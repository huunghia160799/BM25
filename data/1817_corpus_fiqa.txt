the company that 's apparently going to pay this rent wants to treat it as a business expense   they are asking for your ssn because they expect to issue a 1099-misc they probably gave you a form w-9 it 's not mandatory but it 's common to request a taxpayer id on this form there are a couple of issues at play here
# 482483
i disagree with the other respondents if your tenant is an individual renting in their individual capacity there is no reason they need your ssn they will not be sending a 1099 to you if your tenant is a business then your property is not a residential property it is at least a corporate housing and you would have noticed that the contract was signed by a company representative in the capacity of being a company representative not an individual person in that case that representative would also ask   you to fill a form w9 on which your tax id should be reported i would suggest let the tenant figure out their tax avoidance issues without you being involved
# 577284
maybe you should consider setting up a taxpayer identification number tin for your business dealings as a landlord and consider providing that instead of your ssn for this type of thing i am assuming if this is legitimate they want it so they can send you a 1099 as they might be obligated to do if they are claiming the rent as a business expense also i 'd suggest having the tenant tell their employer to contact you directly there is no need for the tenant in this situation to also get your ssn tin

taking as given that your definition of va involves selling at intermediate times your question can be made more general   after all value averaging is just one special case of a portfolio that rebalances to target weights periodically do back end fees and front end fees harm the value of portfolios that require rebalancing   the answer is yes they do   those fees are put in place in order to prevent investors from redeeming shares over any but the longest horizons   any portfolio that rebalances periodically will involve some periodic selling   if you invest in a fund with front end or back end fees it is optimal to leave your money in it for as long as possible and not do any rebalancing if you want to run a portfolio that is at all active involves rebalancing then it is probably wise to use no load funds these are often some of the best and cheapest funds anyway but even if front or back end load funds have a lower expense ratio you will likely lose money on those loads as you rebalance

this is either laundering money or laundering non money   all the other answers point out how a cheque or bank transfer will take days to actually clear   that is a red herring there are lots of ways to illegally transfer real money out of existing accounts   stolen cheque books stolen banking details partly in connection with stolen smartphones and credit cards and cards money transfers from other people duped in a similar manner as you are it is much easier to steal money than invent it and it takes quite longer until stolen rather than invented money will blow up at the banks all of those payments will likely properly clear but not leave you in actual legal possession of money   people will notice the missing money and notify police and banks and you will be on the hook for paying back all of it cheques and transfers from non existing accounts in contrast tend to blow up very fast and thus are less viable for this kind of scam as the time window for operating the scam is rather small whether or not the cheque actually clears is about as relevant of whether or not the rolls royce you are buying for $ 500 because the owner has an toe nail and can not press down the accelerator any more has four wheels better hope for the rolls to be imaginary because then you 'll only be out of $ 500 and that 's the end of it   if it is real your trouble is only starting

facebook is an online social networking service which i 'd categorize as an ad supported social media platform for a type of company facebook makes money from advertisers and applications on the site so there are a couple of different income streams though in recent years facebook has done a number of acquisitions that should be noted as the company is much more than just the fb site in terms of b2c or b2b i see facebook as being a b2c where businesses are paying for access to consumers rather than businesses looking for other businesses some of the posts on facebook can be sponsored posts that are where things can be a bit for what is an advertisement at the same time various games run through facebook may also make facebook some money since some games may use in game purchases that are worth noting b2b requires one to have 3 companies in the overall system one that is the middle one that is providing a service and one that is consuming a service while facebook is selling advertising on this site i do n't see this as that different from tv networks and other distribution channels that ads are bought for consumers to use there is something to be said for what audience is one aiming b2b implies corporate customers which i doubt is what facebook 's customers want rather they are personal consumers that are n't companies on their own to my mind if you want something closer to b2b consider amazon.com 's cloud services where companies may buy resources from amazon as part of the systems they may use to interface with others i can remember in a previous job that we used clay tablet for doing translation services that took content from my employer 's servers to amazon 's cloud that would then be taken by the translation company for more than a few different pieces to the puzzle while part of facebook could be seen as b2b i doubt i 'd see them as a large part of it but i could be wrong as b2b b2c distinctions are n't my specialty are they yours consider paypal in contrast where a business may use paypal for payment processing paypal has agreements that enable them to process payments either through individual bank accounts or merchant accounts as well as for the company that wants to use paypal for their e commerce site thus there can be businesses on each side which is where i see this being a b2b company that is also b2c as some people may just be consumers consider google as another contrast where companies may pay to use google for e mail and the office like products like google docs and google drive that i 'm not sure is b2b as this is just a business buying services from google that does n't involve another company while there is b2c b2b and b2 g not every business has to tie into a specific category here for something else to consider

hce is defined as being above or in the top 20 of the company the exact cutoff point might be different for each company typically only the base salary is considered for that but it 's the company 's and 's decision the irs does not require hce treatment the irs requires that 401(k plans have a fair distribution of usage between all employees very often employees with lower income save over proportionally less in their 401(k and there is a line where the 401(k plan is no longer acceptable to the irs hce is a way for companies to ensure this forced balance by limiting the amount of 401(k savings for hce the companies ensure that the share of all contributions by below hce is appropriate they will calculate define the hce cutoff point so that the required distribution is surely achieved one of the consequences is that when you move over the hce cutoff point you can suddenly save a lot less in your 401(k nothing can be done about that see this irs page highly compensated employee an individual who owned more than 5 of    the interest in the business at any time during the year or the    preceding year regardless of how much compensation that person earned    or received or for the preceding year received compensation from the    business of more than $ 115,000 if the preceding year is 2014    $ 120,000 if the preceding year is 2015 or 2016 and if the employer    so chooses was in the top 20 of employees when ranked by    compensation

that is absolute rubbish   warren buffet follows simple value and tenants that literally anyone could follow if they had the discipline to do so   i have never once heard of an investment made by warren buffet that was n't rooted in fundamentals and easy to understand   the concept is fairly simple as is the math buying great companies trading at discounts to what they are worth due to market fluctuations or to key sectors etc   if i buy abc corp at $ 10 knowing it is worth $ 20 it could go down or trade sideways for five years doing seemingly nothing and then one day catch up with its worth due to any number of factors   in that case my 100 return which took five years to accounts for an average 20 return per year   also and this should be obvious but diversification is a double edged sword   every year hundreds of stocks individually beat the market return   owning any one of these stocks as your only holding would mean that you beat the market   as you buy more stocks and diversify your return will get closer and closer to that of an index or mutual fund   my advice is to stick to fundamentals like value and investing learn to separate when the market is being silly from when it is responding to a genuine concern do your own homework and analysis on the stocks you buy be patient after buying stock that your analysis gives you confidence in and do n't over diversify   if you do these things congrats   you are warren buffet

this is kind of a silly article and it mostly misses the point   first google and others essentially have in house investment banking departments that are vetting valuing negotiating and sealing these deals these m&amp;a guys are mostly former bankers    so while they may not be using investment banks they are certainly using bankers google has $ in cash and does dozens and dozens of acquisitions each year it 's not surprising they find it appealing to move the banking function in house    second certain tech companies like google and facebook and zynga have unique corporate structures where the ceo founders retain majority voting control of their companies    this means guys like zuckerberg page brin et al control over 50 of all voting shares and they can not be ousted by the board of directors nor can they be on any matter via a proxy battle this gives these founders far reaching control over m&amp;a and thus you see deals like the $ cash + stock whatsapp acquisition and instagram both of these deals were reportedly driven by zuckerberg himself who not only initiated and vetted the deals but determined the price    most ceos do not have this kind of latitude    third within silicon valley the network is very small and tight and everybody knows each other the ceos founders vcs etc they all know each other and they know who to call when they are looking to acquire   it 's not like zuck needs a banker to tell him to check out snapchat

so you might be looking at the world of investing after tax deductions are gone buy index funds or a few stable stocks of your choice index funds have minimal turnover so you wo n't realize as many tax events throughout the year the top long term capital gains rate is presently 15 will it go up to 20 soon who knows it might that 's up to congress and obama really if you can control when you realize it say in a year when you do n't have a lot of other income the tax consequences are n't horrible it also helps if you live in a state that does n't tax the gains themselves e.g. not california or buy real estate if you do n't own the house where you live already and your lifestyle permits you should n't expect impressive capital appreciation but you do n't have to pay tax on the imputed rent the rent money you avoid paying by owning the place yourself

i remember reading in an earlier version of pub 590 or possibly the instructions for form 8606 that timely contributions for year x to an ira are deemed to have been made on january 1 of year x regardless of when they were actually made but i do n't seem to be able to find it now in current versions of pubs or 590b and so can not include a citation of chapter and verse be that as it may the calculations on on form 8606 part i effectively track basis on an annual basis rather than on a daily basis and so the fact that the traditional ira has a zero balance and basis 0 too at some time during the year does n't matter in the least   in detail though you did n't ask for it note that the whole $ 6500 that you put in remains non deductible in its entirety but you owe taxes on only $ of that $ 100 k that you rolled over into a roth ira and not on the whole $ 100 k as you were assuming would have been the case so in effect of that $ 6500 nondeductible contribution to your traditional ira you did really get to deduct $ from your taxable income for 2016 and make only a $ 400 nondeductible contribution exactly equal to your basis in your traditional ira as per the form 8606 calculations   i can only assume that the software package that you are using the above calculations exactly and does what the irs says you must do on form 8606 rather than what you get by tracking the basis on a daily basis irs regulations and instructions are not necessarily the same as what the tax law says they are interpretations of the tax law based on what the irs understands the tax law to say people have challenged various specific irs regulations and interpretations as being different from what the law says in tax court and been successful in some cases and failed in others if you believe that tracking basis on a daily basis is what the law says instead of just being reasonable and rational and rationality are not required either of congress in the laws that they write or the irs regulations that interpret the laws you should take up the matter with the irs or the tax court

this is way too long for a comment so i am posting this as an answer my bet is that you 're buying a new piano it is the only instrument that makes sense the rest of this answer are going to assume this but this should apply well if you 're going after a or for example for those readers that do not know a piano is a very delicate and expensive music instrument my piano is literally more expensive than my car there are a lot of similarities in sales negotiation between buying a piano and buying a car you may be surprised to know that the cost for the dealer to acquire a piano is only around half the listed price therefore the salesperson has a lot of room to negotiate a sale price to you this explains why he was able to make a good offer for the model you are not intending to buy you are best by comparing the final sale price with other similar models in your region or the exact model around your region which you have already did those indicate the standard price in your negotiation you described the dealer had the exact model you desire only in different appearance i assume you want a black color while they have a white or wood pattern one in their showroom note every piano is different even with the exact same model there will be very slight differences in the tune and touch since some processes are hand finished if you 're buying a treat each of them as an individual hand crafted art play the exact instrument you will be buying before closing the deal if they do not have your desired model in the showroom ask for a visit to their inventory facility again play the exact instrument not a showroom model some dishonest dealers will have their showroom regulated and tuned differently than the standard from shipping if you get an extremely good offer proceed with caution there may be defects in that particular instrument look for rust or layers on the strings look for in the hammers listen to clicking when playing the keys these are signs that the instrument has been around for quite a while and they can not sell it you can also copy down the serial number and look up the manufacturing date online before you close the deal ask for after sale services how many free will they provide will they polish your piano after delivery these are bargain chips you can use for final adjustment of the price

pete and noah addressed the math showing how this is in effect converting a 30yr to a mortgage at a cost plus payment about 8 higher 1 extra payment per year no magic there the real issue as i see it is whether this is the best use of the money keep in mind once you pay extra principal which in effect is exactly what this is it 's not easy to get it back as long as you have any mortgage at all you have the need for liquidity enough to pay your mortgage tax utilities etc if you find yourself between jobs or to get through any short term crisis   i 've seen people choose the sure thing prepayment vs the risky 401(k deposit ignoring a match is passing up a 50 or 100 return in most cases too good to pass up   2 points to add i avoided the further tangent of the tax benefit of deposits it 's too long a discussion today 's rate for the money saved vs the rate on withdrawal worth considering but not part of my answer the other discussion i avoid is nicholas thoughts on the long term market return of 10 vs today 's ~4 mortgage rate this has been debated elsewhere and into a pre pay vs invest question

i would definitely recommend putting some of this in an ira you ca n't put all $ 30 k in an ira immediately though as the contribution limit is $ for 2014 but until april 15 you can still contribute $ 5500 for 2013 as well at your income level i would absolutely recommend a roth ira as your income will very likely be higher in retirement given that your income will almost certainly rise after you get your ph.d. your suggested asset allocation 70 stocks 30 bonds sounds appropriate if anything you might want to go even higher on stocks assuming you wo n't mind seeing the value drop significantly if you do n't want to put a lot of energy into investment choices i suggest a target retirement date fund as far as i am aware vanguard offers the lowest expenses for these types of funds e.g. this 2050 fund

first i would point you to this question   oversimplify it for me the correct order of investing with the $ 50k that you have inherited you have enough money to pay off all your debt $ 40k purchase a functional used car $ 5k and get a great start on an emergency fund with the rest   there are many who would tell you to wait as long as possible to pay off your student loans and invest the money instead however i would pay off the loans right away if i were you even if it is low interest right now it is still a debt that needs to be paid back pay it off and you wo n't have this debt hanging over your head anymore   your grandmother has given you an incredible gift this money can make you completely debt free and put you on a path for success however if you are n't careful you could end up back in debt quickly learn how to make a budget and commit to never spending money that you do n't have again

republican voters need to stop thinking that the gop supports small business in fact they do nt they work to small business because small businesses do nt have the political clout that large multinationals do what happens in this scenario you the small owner end up the cost of big business in the form of higher taxes while big corporations get away free stop believing that the gop wants to help small business when the gop has supported every pro and pro consolidation law for the past 90 years i sympathize with workers who do personal care other kinds of jobs where they really are at the mercy of the market where making smart decisions that negatively impact employees is often a choice between staying in business or not

my $ .02 is that the problem boils down to the disparity in the tax rates   money is taxed at a lower rate than people in other words money made by money capital gains is taxed at 15 and money made by people income is taxed at 35   over time money will naturally flow to wherever the tax is lowest because tax rates factor heavily into roi   we should equal the playing field or even tax people at a lower rate than money   then there will be job creation and more money will flow to employee 's pockets as income since it 's no longer hugely advantageous to hold the money and invest it   consider employees to be another investment class and lower the barriers to investing in that class   anyone care to on this

does your employer offer a 401(k match if so contribute enough to maximize that it 's free money after that contribute to an ira where you can invest in funds with low expenses after you max that out if you still have money left over max out your 401(k despite the high expenses for the tax advantages remember when you leave the company you can roll over the balance into an ira and switch to lower cost investments of course this is general advice without knowing your situation if you 're looking to buy a home soon for example you might want to keep extra money in a taxable account for a downpayment rather than maxing out your 401(k

there is considerable truth to what your realtor said about the jersey city nj housing market these days it is a hot area with lots of expensive condos being bought up by people working on wall street in nyc very easy commute by train etc and in many cases the offers to purchase can exceed the asking price significantly be that as is may the issue with accepting a higher offer but smaller downpayment is that when the buyer 's lender appraises the property the valuation might come in lower and the buyer may have to come up with the difference or be required to accept a higher interest rate or be refused the loan altogether if the lender estimates that the buyer is likely to default on the loan because his credit worthiness is inadequate to support the monthly payments so the sale might fall through suppose that the property is offered for sale at $ 500 k and consider two bids one for $ 480 k with 30 downpayment $ 144 k and another for $ 500 k with 20 downpayment $ 100 k   if the property appraises for $ 450 k say and the lender is not willing to lend more than 80 of that $ 360 k then buyer 1 is ok it is only necessary to borrow   $ 480 k $ 144 k = $ 336 k while buyer 2 needs to come up with another $ 40 k of downpayment to be able to get the loan or might be asked to pay a higher interest rate since the lender will be lending more than 80 of the appraised value etc of course buyer 2 's lender might be using a different appraiser whose valuation might be higher etc but appraisals usually are within the same ballpark   furthermore good seller 's agents can make good estimates of what the appraisal is likely to be and if the asking price is larger than the agent 's estimate of appraised value then it might be to the advantage of the selling agent to recommend accepting the lower offer with higher downpayment over the   higher offer with smaller downpayment the sale is more likely to go through and an almost sure 6 of $ 480 k 3 if there is a buyer 's agent involved in hand in 30 days time is worth more than a good chance of nothing at the end of 15 days when the mortgage is declined during which the house has been off the market on the grounds that the sale is pending if you really like a house you need to decide what you are willing to pay for it and tailor your offer accordingly keeping in mind what your buyer 's agent is recommending as the offer amount the higher the price the more the agent 's commission how much money you can afford to put down as a downpayment do n't forget closing costs including points that might be need to be paid and what your pre approval letter says about how much mortgage you can afford   if you are buyer 1 have a pre approval letter for $ 360 k   and have enough savings for a downpayment of up to $ 150 k and if you or your spouse   really really like the place and can not imagine living in any other place then you could offer $ 500 k with 30 down and blow the other offer out of the water you could even offer more than $ 500 k if you want but this is a personal decision   what your realtor said is perfectly true in the sense that for y > z an offer at $ x with $ y down is better than an offer at $ x with $ z down it is to a certain extent true that for w > x a seller would find an offer at $ x with $ y down to be more attractive that an offer at $ w with $ down but that depends on what the appraisal is likely to be and the seller 's agent 's recommendations

i realize that a million dollars is    a completely arbitrary figure but    it 's one people on perhaps    folks just meant it 's getting easier    because inflation has made it a far    less lofty sum than when the word    millionaire was coined your point is correct it relatively easier as the 1 million dollar nowadays is no where as valuable as compared in the old days after the inflation adjustment however the way to achieve that is easier said than done the most possible way is to run your own business assuming you will make profit for most of the people running a job to earn a living the job income is the biggest factor being extremely frugal would n't help much if you do n't maximize your income potential earning a million dollar through investment how much capitals are you able to invest in 5k 50k 500k i see no way to earn 1 million with 5k from investment i would n't call it easy this again depends on your income with better income of course you could dedicate a larger portion to investment without exposing too much risk and having to affect your way of life 3 invest some part of your income    over a long period of time and let the    stock market do the work i 'd say this is more geared towards beating the inflation and earn a few extra bucks instead of getting very rich this is being very relative   just a word of the mindset of investment being the shortcut to wealth is very dangerous and often leads to speculative behavior

safe deposit boxes are rented out to customers and their content is not bank 's property money deposits are not being taken by the creditors if a bank goes bankrupt for the same reason its not bank 's money it belongs to the depositors however frequently banks go bankrupt because they do not have enough cash at hand to pay back the depositors in this case unless insured up to $ 250 k in the us k in eu some or all of the deposits may not be immediately or even at all available depositors become creditors of the bank in the bankruptcy proceedings safe deposit box however is rented to the customer and the content is not removed by the bank to be used elsewhere as happens with monetary deposits so even if the bank is bankrupt and does n't have enough money to cover the monetary deposits the content of the safe deposit boxes does n't magically disappear and the owner can get it back the access to the deposit box itself may be limited due to the bankruptcy but the content will remain there waiting for its owners in the united states when a bank goes bankrupt fdic takes over it and its assets safe deposit box rental contract is an asset it is taken over by the fdic and will be sold to a buyer usually as a part of the whole branch where the box is located who will continue operating servicing it

credit unions are mutually owned i.e. customer owned financial institutions that provide banking services   they take deposits from their members customers and loan them to other members   members vote on a board of directors who manage operations    they are considered not for profit but they pay interest on deposits   they get some preferential tax treatment and regulation and their deposits are insured by a separate organization if federally accredited   state chartered credit unions do n't have to maintain deposit insurance at all    their charters specify who can join   they can be based employer based or based on some other group with common interests   regulators restrict them so that they do n't interfere too much with banks   otherwise their preferential tax and regulatory treatment would leave banks uncompetitive    other organizations with similar limits have gone on to be competitive when the limits were released   for example there used to be an insurance company just for government employees the government employees insurance company   you may know it better as geico yes the one with the advertisements   now they offer life and auto insurance all over    credit unions would like looser limitations or no limitations at all but not enough to give up their preferential tax treatment   banks oppose looser limitations and have as much political clout as credit unions

you can definitely affect the price putting in a buy increases the demand for the stock causing a permanent price move   also if you hammer the market trying to execute too quickly you can hit offers that are out of the money and move the price temporarily before it to its new equilibrium    true as an individual investor your trades will be negligible in size and the effect will be nonexistent but if you are a hedge fund putting in a buy for 5 of   you can have a price impact not 50 but at least a handful of bps

4 finally do all companies reduce their stock price when they pay a dividend are they required to there seems to be confusion behind this question   a company does not set the price for their stock so they ca n't reduce it either   in fact nobody sets the price for a stock the price you see reported is simply the last price that the stock was traded at   that trade was just one particular trade in a whole sequence of trades   the price used for the trade is simply the price which the particular buyer and particular seller agreed to for that particular trade   no agreement well then no trade   there 's no authority for the price other than the collection of all buyers and sellers so what happens when nokia declares a 55 cent dividend   when they declare there is to be a dividend they state the record date which is the date which determines who will get the dividend the owners of the shares on that date are the people who get the dividend payment   the stock exchanges need to account for the payment so that investors know who gets it and who does n't so they set the ex dividend date which is the date on which trades of the stock will first trade without the right to receive the dividend payment   ex dividend is usually about 2 days before record date   these dates are established well before they occur so all market participants can know exactly when this change in value will occur when trading on ex dividend day begins there is no authority to set a different price than the previous day 's closing price   what happens is that all knowledgeable market participants know that today nokia is trading without the payment 55 cents that buyers the previous day get   so what do they do   they take that into consideration when they make an offer to buy stock and probably end up offering a price that is about 55 cents less than they would have otherwise   similarly sellers know they will be getting that 55 cents so when they choose a price to offer their stock at it will likely be about that much less than they would have asked for otherwise

i know your pain oh so much   i literally have a 14 gallon container full of i have received   even worse for profit fundraising companies send most of those mailings they take the money and deduct their expenses rigged to consume all your gift   some companies have been caught passing as little as 9 to the charity   first let 's talk about a few issues   authentication   is that outfit really a tax deductible charity    address    is this their genuine address or is it the dropbox of a scammer or one of those evil for profit fundraising companies   acknowledgement    for gifts over a certain size you need a thank you letter from them to show the irs that you really donated   will you get it   the limit is $ 250 no letter deduction rejected but as a practical thing it helps in an audit to show as many donation letters as possible   charities can not issue them retroactively but can issue you second copies of ones they sent previously if the charity drops the ball you lose   obviously enough you go to the post office and spend $ 1 on a money order      this does not authenticate them as a charity it does not assure it goes to their real address   you can do both these things yourself by checking their data on the irs website or on you do n't get an acknowledgement   i mention these because donation websites work much the same way require a higher one time commitment but are much simpler and more efficient after that if you are planning to give $ 5000 in a single year save it up and open a donor advised fund account   a daf is itself a charity    you donate to the daf and take the tax deduction for charitable   then you tell the daf to donate it to other charities on your behalf or anonymously    their concept is you use the daf as a buffer so you can easily make the tax deductible donation when you need to for tax purposes then at your leisure research charities and support them   however i asked my daf most people donate and then immediately re donate the money leaving the fund at zero balance   my daf does n't mind that at all and they charge zero fees for this    its expenses are paid by those of us who leave money sitting around in the daf   mine charges 0.6 a year   this money can be invested sort of like in a 401 k and each investment also has an expense ratio such as 0.18 a year in my chosen index fund   websites like will take any amount of your money and re donate it to the charity you select    they deduct 3 5 for their expenses notably paper stamps and the 2 3 it costs them to process your credit card

the principal and interest are fixed no matter how much money you throw at them this is not correct if i pay an extra $ 1000 in principal this month then my mortgage balance is decreased so slightly less interest accrues before my next payment that means my next payment will be slightly more toward principal and slightly less toward interest than it would have been if i had n't made an extra principal payment this means that my principal will eventually drop to zero earlier than it would have if i had not made the extra payment and i will end up making fewer total payments than i would have without the extra principal payments of course the effect is even stronger if i make regular extra payments rather than a single one like paying off any debt you can consider this payment essentially a risk free investment paying whatever is the interest rate on that debt you know that by making this payment you reduce your interest payments over the coming years by the interest rate on that amount   edit in comments you said you will pay your mortgage off earlier but you wo n't drop the amount required to pay each month look at a mortgage amortization table to see this this is n't because of the amortization table it 's because of the contract terms between you and the lender after you make an extra principal payment a new amortization schedule has to be calculated one way or another it would be possible to re calculate a new reduced monthly payment keeping the number of payments remaining fixed or you can calculate a new repayment schedule keeping the total monthly payment fixed and reducing the number of payments   it happens the banks prefer to do the 2nd of these rather than the first so that 's the terms they offer when lending perhaps someone more knowledgeable can comment on why they prefer that   in any case by reducing your principal you improve your personal balance sheet and build equity in the mortgaged property so that for example if you sell you 'll keep more of the proceeds and use less to pay off your loan

as a buyer you must realize they are doing everything they can to get the best deal for their client the seller they have made the first offer the listing price you made a counter offer now they are trying to get you to see that your offer is too low   how can they do this show you comps that they have found to show that either their listing price was where it should be or even that it could have been higher if there are fresh comps that are showing an upward trend they will be sure to show you those another approach is to show you what is happening in the neighborhood today   if those sales have settled then they are public record if they have n't settled they are not public record your agent should be reminding you that they are worthless as a comp until they are settled the only ethics issue is did the agent by disclosing the contract commit a violation against the rights of buyer and the seller of the other house you have not been harmed and the seller of the house you are interested in most likely approved the maneuver   i would look at the documents you signed to see who owns the info on the form because that will tell you if your offer on the house is being used by another agent or even your agent as leverage in another deal

it depends on your investment profile but basically dividends increase your taxable income anyone making an income will effectively get lower returns on their investments due to this effect if you had the choice between identical shares that either give a dividend or do n't you 'll find that stock that pays a dividend has a lower price and increases in value more slowly than stock that does n't all other things being equal   there 's a whole bunch of economic theory behind this but in short the current stock price is a measure of how much the company is worth combined with an estimation of how much it will be worth in the future npv of all future dividends is the basic model when the company makes profit it can keep those profits and invest in new projects or distribute a portion of those profits to shareholders aka dividends distributing the value to shareholders reduces the value of the company somewhat but the shareholders get the money now if the company does n't give dividends it has a higher value which will be reflected in a higher stock price   so basically all other things being equal which they rarely are but i digress the price and growth difference reflects the fact that dividends are paying out now in other words if you wanted non dividend shares you could get them by buying dividend shares and re investing the dividend as new shares every time there was a payout and you could get dividend share like properties by selling a percentage of non dividend shares periodically dividend income is taxable as part of your income right away however taxes on capital gains only happen when you sell the asset in question and also has a lower tax rate if you buy and hold berkshire you will not have to pay taxes on the gains you get until you decide to sell the shares and even then the tax rate will be lower if you are investing for retirement this is great since your income from other sources will be lower so you can afford to be taxed then in many jurisdictions income from capital gains is subject to a different tax rate than the rest of your income for example in the us for most people with money to invest it 's either 15 or 20 which will be lower than normal income tax would be since most people with money to invest would be making enough to be in a higher bracket say for example your income now is within the 25 bracket any dividend you get will be taxed at that rate so let 's say that the dividend is about 2 and the growth of the stock is about 4 so your effective growth rate after taxation is 5.5 you lose 0.5 from the 25 tax on the dividend if instead you had stock with the same growth but no dividend it would grow at a rate of 6 if you never withdrew the money after 20 years $ 1 in the dividend stock would be worth ^ 20 whereas $ 1 in the non dividend stock would be worth 1.06 ^ 20 you 're talking about a difference of 30 cents per dollar invested which does n't seem huge but multiply it by 100,000 and you 've got yourself enough money to renovate your house purely out of money that would have gone to the government instead the advantage here is if you are saving up for retirement when you retire you wo n't have much income so the tax on the gains even ignoring the capital gains effect above will definitely be less then when you were working however if you had a dividend stock you would have been paying taxes on the dividend at a higher rate throughout the lifetime of the investment   so there you go that 's what is talking about there are some caveats to this if the amount you are investing is n't large and you are in a lower tax bracket and the stock pays out relatively low dividends you wo n't really feel the difference much even though it 's there also dividend vs. no dividend is hardly the highest priority when deciding what company to invest in and you 'll practically never be able to find identical companies that differ only on dividend no dividend so if you find a great buy you may not have a choice in the matter   also there has been a trend in recent years to also make capital gains tax progressive so people who have a higher income will also pay more in capital gains which negates part of the benefit of non dividend stocks but does n't change the growth rate effects before the sale   there are also some theoretical arguments that dividend paying companies should have stronger shareholders since the company has less capital it has to play nice to get money either from new shares or from banks which leads to less risky behavior but it 's not so cut and dried in real life

these have the potential to become end of the world scenarios so i 'll keep this very clear if you start to feel that any particular investment may suddenly become worthless then it is wise to liquidate that asset and transfer your wealth somewhere else if your wealth happens to be invested in cash then transferring that wealth into something else is still valid   digging a hole in the ground is n't useful and running for the border probably wo n't be necessary consider countries that have suffered actual currency collapse and debt default   take zimbabwe for example   even as inflation went into the millions of percent the zimbabwe stock exchange soared as investors were prepared to spend ever more of their devaluing currency to buy stable stocks in a small number of locally listed companies even if the euro were to suffer a critical fall european companies would probably be ok if you did n't panic and dig in the back garden over the fall of dotcom there is no need to panic over the decline of certain currencies   just diversify your risk and buy non cash or euro assets update a few ideas re diversification the problem for greece is n't really a euro problem it is local local property local companies these can be affected by default because no one believes in the entirety of the greek economy not just the currency it happens to be using so diversification really means buying things that are outside greece

first there will always be people who think the market is about to crash it does n't really crash very often when it does crash they always say they predicted it well even a blind squirrel finds a nut once in a while you could go short short selling stocks which requires a margin account that you have to qualify for typically you can only short up to half the value of your account in the us and if you 've maxed out your margin limits and your account continues to drop in value you risk a margin call which would force you to cover your shorts which you may not be able to afford you could invest in a fund that does the shorting for you you could also consider actually buying good investments while their prices are low since you can not predict the start or end of a crash you should consider dollar cost averaging until your stocks hit a price you 've pre determined is your trigger then purchase larger quantities at the bargain prices the equity markets have never failed to recover from crashes ever

you are suggesting something called dollar cost averaging or its cousin dollar value averaging   this is certainly a valid investment strategy although personally i feel that for long term investment it is not necessary unless you plan on being an active trader i still strongly encourage you to research these two methods and see if they would work well for your personal investment strategy and goals as far as what sorts of investments for a taxable account i have three general recommendations as far as which company to use for your brokerage i personally have accounts at price and fidelity i would strongly recommend fidelity out of those three mostly due to customer service and quality and ease of use of their website vanguard is a great brokerage but you do n't have to choose them just because you plan to mostly invest in vanguard funds i also recommend you research how capital gains and dividend taxing works and things like lost harvesting so that you can structure your investments with taxes in mind do this ahead of time do n't wait until april of 2016 because it will be too late to save on taxes by then

your plan will probably work i speak from past experience approx 5 10 years ago when lloyds used to offer tiered interest of up to 4 on £ 5000 in their vantage accounts it was allowed for an individual person to have up to three vantage accounts the criteria for obtaining the headline interest rates were simply what i and many others did was to set up three vantage accounts call them a b and c and a standing order on each to transfer minimum amount + £ 1 on the same day each month in this manner this satisfied the letter of conditions though perhaps not the spirit most importantly it satisfied the bank and all three accounts received that headline interest rate these days banks have got a little wiser to this and have started including the set up n direct debits condition which makes this a more time consuming system to arrange you must assign your various bills across your accounts but i believe that the overall plan still works they do n't care where the money comes from or whether it stays just that it comes in enough people get it wrong that they do n't have to worry about the few who get it perfectly right see also how 0 balance transfer offers can be profitable

the response to this question will be different depending which of the investment you are using   value investors look at the situation the company is in and try to determine what the company is worth and what it will be worth in the future then they look at the current stock price and decide whether or not the stock is priced at a good deal or not if the stock price is priced lower than they believe the company is worth they would want to buy stock and if the price rises above what they believe to be the true value they would sell these types of investors are not looking at the history or trend of what the price has done in the past only what the current price is and where they believe the price should be in the future   technical analysis investors do something different it is their belief that as stock prices go up and down they generally follow patterns by looking at a chart of what a stock price has been in the past they try to predict where it is headed and buy or sell based on that prediction   in general value investors are longer term investors and technical analysis investors are short term investors   the advice you are considering makes a lot of sense if you are using technical analysis if you have a stock that is trending down your strategy probably tells you to sell buying more in the hopes of turning things around would be seen as a mistake it is like the gambler in vegas who keeps playing a game he is losing hoping that his luck changes   however for the value investor the historical price of a stock and even the amount you currently have gained or lost in the stock are essentially ignored all that matters is whether or not the stock price is above or below the true value determined by the investor for him if the stock price falls and he believes the company still has a high value it could be a signal to buy more the above advice does n't really apply for them   many investors do n't follow either of these strategies they believe that it is too difficult and risky to try to predict the future price of an individual stock instead they invest in many companies all at once using index mutual funds believing that the stock market as a whole always heads up over a long time frame those investors do n't care at all if the prices of stock are going up or down they simply keep investing each month and hold until they have another use for the money the above advice is n't useful for them at all   no matter which kind of investing you are doing the most important thing is to pick a strategy you believe in and follow the plan without emotion emotions can cause investors to make mistakes and start buying when their strategy tells them to sell   instead of trying to follow fortune cookie advice like do n't throw good money after bad choose an investment strategy make a plan test it and follow it cautiously after all it may be a bad plan for what it is worth i am the third type of investor listed above i do n't buy individual stocks and i do n't look at the stock prices when investing more each month your description of your own strategy as buy and hold suggests you might prefer the same approach

you do n't want to set up your investment account as a savings or spending budget account   there are a couple of reasons   first investment account balances change daily based on the market   if you set it up as a budget account then your budget category balances would need to have money added or removed from them daily as the market value changes   second because you are investing for retirement this money will be untouchable for many years there is no need to include that in your spending budget instead enter your monthly investment amount as an expense transaction not a transfer to another budget account   if for example you are sending $ 400 per month to your retirement account just enter that as a monthly $ 400 expense out of your checking account assigning it to a retirement category   that money then leaves your budget if you want to see the value of your investment account in ynab so that your net worth is accurate add the account as an investment account   the value will not affect your budget categories but it will affect the net worth on the all accounts page   either set it up as an online account so that the balance will update automatically or add it as a manual account and simply update the balance manually when you get your monthly statement

just read the book flash boys by michael lewis   it describes this process in detail albeit a bit more dramatically than it has to   basically what hfts high frequency traders do is they set up their line to the exchange so its microseconds faster than everyone else   then they test out the market with tiny orders seeing how fast it 's getting filled if these are getting filled immediately it probably means there 's a big order coming in from an investor   so the algorithm and it 's all algo based obviously because no human can remotely hope to catch this will detect that as soon as there 's a spike in volume it will buy all of the volume at the current price and sell it back for higher forcing the big investor to take on higher prices     another case is that some hfts can basically buy the entire trade book from an exchange like nasdaq   so every time someone places a market order for 200 shares of a 6.5 stock the hft will see it buy up all the current stock from say 6.5 6.6 and sell it back at 6.7   not rocket science if you already get info about the trade coming in in fact this is basically market making but performed by an evil hft instead of a trustworthy bank     but honestly there are a lot more ways to make money from hft than front running which is n't even possible anymore because exchanges no longer sell their books to hfts

revenue canada allows for some amount of tax deferral via several methods the point is that none of them allow you to avoid tax but by deferring from years when you have high income to years when you have lower income allows you to realize less total tax paid due to the marginal rate for personal income tax the corporate dividend approach as explained in another answer is one way tfsas are another way but as you point out they have limits   since you brought tfsas into your question about the best and easiest tax deferral option available in canada is the rrsp if you do n't have a company pension you can contribute something like 18 of your income if you have a pension plan you may still be able to contribute to an rrsp as well but the maximum contribution amount will be lower the contribution lowers your taxable income which can save you tax interest earned on the equity in your rrsp is n't taxed tax is only paid on money drawn from the plan because it is deemed income in that year they are intended for retirement but you 're allowed to withdraw at any time so if you have little or no income in a year you can draw money from your rrsp tax is withheld which you may or may not get back depending on your taxable income for that year you can think of it as a way to level your income and lower your legitimate tax burden

the argument you are making here is similar to the problem i have with the stronger forms of the efficient market hypothesis   that is if the market already has incorporated all of the information about the correct prices then there 's no reason to question any prices and then the prices never change   however the mechanism through which the market incorporates this information is via the actors buying an selling based on what they see as the market being incorrect the most basic concept of this problem i think starts with the idea that every investor is passive and they simply buy the market as one basket   so every paycheck the index fund buys some more stock in the market in a completely static way   this means the demand for each stock is the same   no one is paying attention to the actual companies performance so a poor performer 's stock price never moves   the same for the high performer   the only thing moving prices is demand but that 's always up at a more or less constant rate this is a topic that has a lot of discussion lately in financial circles   here are two articles about this topic but i 'm not convinced the author is completely serious hence the worst case scenario title these are interesting reads but again take this with a grain of salt   you should follow the links in the articles because they give a more nuanced understanding of each potential issue   one thing that 's important is that the reality is nothing like what i outline above one of the links in these articles that is interesting is the one that talks about how we now have more indexes than stocks on the us markets   the writer points to this as a problem in the first article but think for a moment why that is   there are many different types of strategies that active managers follow in how they determine what goes in a fund based on different stock metrics   if a stocks p e ratio drops below a critical level for example a number of indexes are going to sell it   some might buy it   it 's up to the investors you and me to pick which of these strategies we believe in another thing to consider is that active managers are losing their clients to the passive funds   they have a vested interest in attacking passive management

basically you either borrow money or get other people to invest in your business by buying stock or something analogous   sometimes you can get people to park money with you for example many people deposit money in a bank checking account they do n't get any interest or other profit from this they just do it because the bank is a convenient place to store their money the bank then loans some percentage of this money out and keeps the interest i do n't doubt that people have come up with more clever ways to use other people 's money borrowing money for an investment or business venture is risky because if you lose money you may be unable to pay it back on the other hand investors expect a share of the profit not just a fixed interest rate

i agree this is an great discussion   i think i understand your position now black scholes is an equilibrium model because its a model that in effect says here 's the price of an option if the underlying follows this stochastic process i guess my question is then what would a strictly no arbitrage equity option model look like then e.g. one analogous to hull white does such a concept even make sense

you linked to an article about 1 quarter in 2010   gt;if companies pay their employees more for the same amount of output it will just drive up the cost of goods leaving us with the same shitty demand   gt;also how do you figure this   i figure this because it is the simplest economics the cost of goods sold is based on 3 things   1 raw materials 2 labor including associated costs such as payroll taxes and benefits and 3 overhead   if 2 is increased with no increase in output the cost of those goods is going up

this chart concerns an option contract not a stock the method of analysis is to assume that the price of an option contract is normally distributed around some mean which is presumably the current price of the underlying asset as the date of expiration of the contract gets closer the variation around the mean in the possible end price for the contract will decrease undoubtedly the publisher has measured typical deviations from the mean as a function of time until expiration from historical data based on this data the program that computes the probability has the following inputs 1 the mean current asset price 2 the time until expiration 3 the expected standard deviation based on 2 with this information the probability distribution that you see is generated the green this is a normal or gaussian distribution for a normal distribution the probability of a particular event is equal to the area under the curve to the right of the value line in the example above the value chosen is this area can be computed with the formula   this formula is called the probability density for x where x is the value in the example above t is the reciprocal of the variance which can be computed from the standard deviation mu is the mean the main assumption such a calculation makes is that the price of the asset will not change between now and the time of expiration obviously that is not true in most cases because the prices of stocks and bonds constantly fluctuate a secondary assumption is that the distribution of the option price around the mean will a normal or gaussian distribution this is obviously a crude assumption and common sense would suggest it is not the most accurate distribution in fact various studies have shown that the distribution is actually a more accurate model for the distribution of option contract prices

b. 's answer is good but there 's an important note to consider for tax purposes   it 's too large for a comment so i 'm adding it as an answer and that is you can not claim the property as a rental property under certain conditions   this affects things like claiming mortgage interest which you do n't have and depreciation in value which a rental is allowed see irs topic for details but i 've included an important excerpt below with emphasis added if you rent a dwelling unit to others that you also use as a residence limitations may apply to the rental expenses you can deduct you 're considered to use a dwelling unit as a residence if you use it for personal purposes during the tax year for more than the greater of      a day of personal use of a dwelling unit is any day that it 's used by talk to a tax accountant to better understand the ramifications of this but it 's worth noting that you ca n't just rent it to her for a paltry sum and be able to take tax advantages from this arrangement

the vanilla advice is investing your age in bonds and the rest in stocks index funds of course so if you 're 25 have 75 in stock index fund and 25 in bond index of course your 401k is tax sheltered so you want keep bonds there assuming you have taxable investments when comparing specific funds you need to pay attention to expense ratios for example vanguard 's sp 500 index has an expense ratio of .17 many mutual funds charge around 1.5 that means every year 1.5 of the fund total goes to the fund and that is regardless of up or down market since you 're young i would start studying up on personal finance as much as possible everyone has their favorite books and websites for sane no nonsense investment advise i would start at bogleheads.org i also recommend two books   this is assuming you want to set up a strategy and not fuss with it daily weekly monthly the problem with so many financial strategies is they 1 do n't work i.e. try to time the market or 2 are so overly complex the gains are not worth the effort i 've gotten a lot of help at the boglehead forums in terms of asset allocation and investment strategy good luck

how realistic is it that i will be able to get a home within the 250,000 range in the next year or so   very unlikely in the next year   the debt income ratio is n't good enough and your credit score needs to show at least a year of regular payments without late or default issues before you can start asking for mortgages in this range you do n't mention how long you 've been employed at these incomes this can also count against you if you have n't both been employed for a full year at these incomes they will look even more on the employment situation if they are n't both full time jobs although if you have a full year 's worth of paychecks showing the income is regular then that might mitigate the full time part time issue next year or so if you pay down your high interest debt car credit cards and maintain employment keep your check stubs and tax returns the loan officer will want copies then there 's a slight chance and from this quick snap shot of our finances does it look like we would be able to qualify for a usda loan probably not   mostly for the same reasons the only time a usda loan helps is when you would be able to get a regular loan if you had the down payment even with an available down payment of 50k you would n't be able to get a regular loan therefore it 's unlikely that you 'd qualify for a usda loan if you are anxious to get into a house choose something much smaller in the range it would improve your debt loan ratio enough that you might then qualify for a usda loan   however i think you 'd still have issues if you have n't both been employed at this rate of income for at least a year and have made regular payments on all your debts for at least a year i 'll echo what others have suggested though strengthen your credit eliminate as much of your high interest debt as you can car credit cards and keep your jobs for a year or two   start a savings plan so you can contribute a small down payment at least 3 5 of the desired home price when you are in a better position to buy during this time keep track of your paycheck stubs you may need them to prove income over the time period your loan officer will request note that even with a usda loan you still have to pay closing costs and those can run several thousand dollars so do n't expect to be able to come to the table with no cash lastly there 's good reason to be very conservative regarding house cost and size   if you can consider buying the house as if you only had the per year   move the debt to the person making the lower income and if you buy the house in the name of the person only making per year then the debt loan ratio looks very positive   further it may be that the credit history of that person is better and the employment history is better   if one of you has better history in these ways then you might have a better chance if only one of you buys the house   banks ca n't tell you about this but it does work   keep in mind though that if you two part ways it could be very unhappy since one would be left with all the debt and the house would be in the other 's name   not a great situation to be in so make sure that you both carefully consider the risks associated with the decisions made

the limit order are matched based on amount and time the orders are listed highest to lowest on the buy side the orders are listed lowest to highest on the sell side if there are 2 sell orders for same amount the order which is first in time fractions of milliseconds is first   the about is the example as to how the orders would look like on any exchange   now the highest price the buyer is ready to pay is 20.21 and the lowest price a seller is ready to sell for is 20.25 hence there is no trade now if a new buy order comes in at 20.25 it matches with the sell and the deal is made if a new buy order comes in at it still matches at 20.25 similarly if a sell order come in at 20.21 it matches and a deal is made if a sell order come in at it still matches 20.21    incase of market order with the above example if there is a buy order it would match with the lowest sell order at 20.25 if there is not enough quantity it would match the remaining quantity to the next highest at and continue down similarly if there is a sell market order the it would match to the maximum a seller is ready to buy ie 20.21 if there is not sufficient buy quantity at 20.21 it will match with next for    if say there are new buy order at and sell orders at these will sit first the the above queue to be matched in your above example the lowest sell order was at at time t1 and hence any buy order after time t1 for amount or greater would match to this and the price would be however if the buy order was first ie at t1 there was a buy order for 20.21 and then at time later than t1 there is a sell order for say amount less than or equal to 20.21 it would match for 20.21 essentially the market looks at who was the first to sell at lower price or who was the first to buy at higher price and then decide the trade   edit to clarify xyz say if there is an sell order at $ 10 qty 100 there is a buyer who is willing to pay max $ 20 and is looking for qty 500 your key assumption that the buyer does not know the current sell price of $ 10 is incorrect now there are multiple things the buyer knows the lowest sell order is at $ 10 he can put a matching buy order at $ 10 qty 100 and say $ 11 qty 100 etc this is painful second lets say he puts a buy order at $ 10 qty 100 by the time the order hits the system someone else has put the trade at $ 10 and his order is fulfilled so this buyer has to keep looking at booking and keep making adjustments if its a large order it would be extremely difficult and frustrating for this buyer hence the logic of giving preference the later buy order says the max i can pay is $ 20 match at the current price and get the required shares

you 're assuming that landlords base rental rates on what tenants or potential tenants can afford to pay and that is not the way it works they base their rental rates on what they think they can get on the market not what they think the potential tenant can pay    complicating things now concerning rental rates at least in the u.s. is the influx of foreign capital looking for a safe haven for storing wealth and it 's really messing up our housing markets   complicating this complication is that housing is really an infrastructure issue and should not be left willy nilly to capitalists to provide since they have proven a thousand million times over they are completely incompetent when it comes to adequately dealing with anything more complicated than a quarterly return projected over five quarters seriously capitalism is at its end times and it will either evolve into something that works or it will be swept away and replaced with something that does work

no one knows if the market is high right now   to know that you would need to compare it to the future not the past if you put all your money in right now you run the risk of putting it in at what turns out to be a bad time   if you spread it out you will for sure put some of it in at a bad time either the stuff you put in now or the stuff you put in later   the strategy that on average will make you the most money is to put everything in now   if your risk tolerance allows that it sounds like it does then i think going all in makes sense there really are n't significant downsides to buying a ton at once   you are n't going to move the needle on a big vanguard fund with that amount and there is n't a tax consequence or anything to buying   of course when you sell you will need to pay capital gains tax on any gains but that 's a later chapter the bigger consideration is to be smart right now about avoiding taxes   if your income is low max out your roth iras   if you need to you can later use that money for a house or you can pull the contribution part out at any time if you want without a penalty is a $ 50 k buffer too much   normally i would say yes it 's excessive   i have 5 rather expensive kids and i keep $ 20 k in cash which seems high if anything   however if you are unemployed or your income is n't covering your expenses then keeping a larger pot in cash makes good sense until your cash flow firms up   setting $ 50 k or something close to that aside sounds a lot like something i would do in your shoes btw where are you finding a savings account that pays 2

the new payment on $ 3.5 15yr would be $ compared to $ now 26 bi weekly payments but 12 months assuming the difference is nearly all interest the savings is closer to $ than   note actual savings are different the actual savings is based on the difference in interest over the year since the term will be changing i 'm looking at cash flow which is the larger concern in my opinion     $ is 60 months this is your break even time to payoff the $ higher actually since the $ 17 k will be accruing interest   i did n't see any mention of closing costs or other expenses obviously that has to be factored in as well   i think the trade off is n't worth it as the other answers suggest the rental is too close to break even now the cost of repairs on two houses is an issue in my opinion it 's less about the expenses being huge than being random you do n't get billed $ to paint the house you wake up see too many spots showing wear and get a $ 3000 bill same for all high cost items roof hvac etc   you are permitted to borrow 50 of your 401(k balance so you have $ 64 k in the account i do n't know your age this might be great or a bit low i 'd keep saving not putting any extra toward either mortgage until i had an emergency fund that was more than sufficient the fund needs to handle the unexpected expenses as well as the months of unemployment in general 6 9 months of these expenses is recommended   to be clear there are times a 401(k loan can make sense i just do n't see that it does now   disclaimer when analyzing there are two approaches the first is to look at interest saved after all interest is the expense principal payments go right to your balance sheet the second is purely cash flow in which case one might justify a higher rate and going from 15 to 30 years but freeing up cash that can be better deployed even though the rate goes up say 1/2 the payment drops due to the term take that savings and deposit to a matched 401(k and the numbers may work out very well   i offer this to explain why the math above may not be consistent with other answers of mine

a change in implied volatility tells us something about what investors are thinking or fearing about the volatility going forward for the life of the associated option contracts which may be short or long lived   iv does a good job of summarizing the information available to investors which includes information about the past and the present however whether these investor views actually translate into what happens in the future is a topic of debate in the finance literature investors do not generally know the future there are conflicting results available   there have been papers that show that implied volatility has predictive power in some situations time periods and horizons though it is also biased and other papers that show that it does not have statistically significant predictive power at all the consensus last time i checked was that implied volatility is no worse than historical volatility including methods that use trends in historical volatility to forecast where it is going at predicting future volatility   whether it is significantly better and whether either reliably predicts the future is something that is not agreed on   i take this lack of consensus as evidence that if it does predict future volatility it does so poorly somewhat dated survey on the subject

i understand where you are coming from but you vote with your dollars as long as you are willing to fork over for shitty service and shitty products they will keep lowering the bar and keep treating the employees worse when people stop buying they either change their tune or go out of business the financial reality is if you actually want improved working conditions for their employees you need to have the fortitude to refuse to subsidise substandard behaviors

probably the most significant difference is the sword hanging over your head the margin call in a nutshell the lender your broker is going to require you to have a certain amount of assets in your account relative to your outstanding loan balance the minimum ratio of liquid funds in the account to the loan is regulated in the us at 50 for the initial margin and 25 for maintenance margins so here 's where it gets sticky if this ratio gets on the wrong side of the limits the broker will force you to either add more assets cash to your account t or immediately liquidate some of your holdings to remedy the situation assuming you do n't have any enough cash to fix the problem it can effectively force you to sell while your investments are in the tank and lock in a big loss in fact most margin agreements give the brokerage the right to sell your investments without your express consent in these situations in this situation you might not even have the chance to pick which stock they sell source investopedia article the dreaded margin call here 's an example from the article let 's say you    purchase $ 20,000 worth of securities    by borrowing $ 10,000 from your    brokerage and paying $ 10,000 yourself    if the market value of the securities    drops to $ 15,000 the equity in your    account falls to $ 5,000 $ 15,000    $ 10,000 = $ 5,000 assuming a    maintenance requirement of 25 you    must have $ 3,750 in equity in your    account 25 of $ 15,000 = $ 3,750    thus you 're fine in this situation as    the $ 5,000 worth of equity in your    account is greater than the    maintenance margin of $ 3,750 but    let 's assume the maintenance    requirement of your brokerage is 40    instead of 25 in this case your    equity of $ 5,000 is less than the    maintenance margin of $ 6,000 40 of    $ 15,000 = $ 6,000 as a result the    brokerage may issue you a margin call read more

you 're an idiot there is no such thing as statistical heresy picking any given stretch of time will create an assumption the last year has had historically crazy low volatility but if they were using a one year sample in it would be the most incredibly conservative var in history on the other hand using historical volatility from the past 50 years would make no sense either does the stock market in 1985 look anything like today 's what about the liquidity of pretty much any derivatives market there is no right way to measure var any way you do it involves assumptions and tweaks that are entirely subjective   also var can be over a variety of confidence intervals 99 or 95 are standard with 95 being more common because that 's two standard deviations in a normal distribution and hey that 's what they used

most likely scenario a you spend tons of time and effort talking to them with the end result that they take away the extra points   you feel screwed having to do their job for them they 've given you no benefit for looking out for them and you 're left with the points you 've earned but maybe less desire to go back and use them most likely scenario b you just use the points they eventually figure out the problem and fix it   they send you a nasty letter demanding some sort of compensation that they have no legal obligation to because points are not money you will have rendered existing points for service and they have per your existing phone call which can be substantiated in existence though not content through phone records confirmed that they are yours they may go so far as to bar you from their premises   if you do n't use enough points to go negative before they fix it you may avoid this if they can deal with this competently from a customer service pr standpoint then in scenario a they may understand you quickly and they may leave you with some extra points for your trouble   in scenario b pretty much the same thing they 'll let you have the points you used and even leave you a little extra i suggest in either case you only engage in written communication with them or if your jurisdiction allows it record voice conversations   you need a record of what you 've been told

some sample prices for straightforward pay for hours or planners i think i 've seen some similar rates elsewhere too i 'd feel like you might get something and boilerplate for too much less than $ 1000 how could the person afford to spend much time and i 'd feel like lots more than $ 1000 for just a standard straightforward plan might be a ripoff basically you 're paying $ 1000 for a day or two of work you do n't want just a couple hours of work but you do n't need a week of work either anyway extracting the general guideline since prices may vary or over time you could figure it takes a day or two to do a decent job on a basic complete financial plan without a lot of complexities in it from there you can decide what 's fair adding or subtracting time if you need less than a complete plan or have complex issues this is assuming you 're paying for time and which is not a given the biggest factor in how much you pay is probably how they charge a couple of the most common models there are other models but these are the ones i 've seen most the difference between these two models is a lot of money over time hourly is going to be much cheaper because it 's a one time cost instead of ongoing and unrelated to what you have in assets however you wo n't get investment management which can be valuable if you are n't the kind to stick to an investment plan or you want someone else to completely take care of it for you the investment management planners have the potential to make a lot more money and are more likely to be in it for the money hourly planners do n't really have as good a business from a business owner 's perspective but they are cheaper from a customer perspective as long as you 're happy to diy a bit one thing i like about hourly planners is that i do n't really feel investments are the main place planners can add value so it makes me nervous to have the compensation based on that insurance estate planning taxes etc are where it 's harder for a to know all the ins and outs and diy from what i 've seen the cheapest planners are the ones that you can get free or discounted from companies like usaa or vanguard if you have an account with them however they will only recommend products from the company in question so that 's a downside and you probably wo n't get to meet them in person this question may be useful too what exactly can a financial advisor do for me and is it worth the money

you can negotiate a no penalty for early payment loan with dealerships sometimes dealerships will often give you a better price on the car when you finance through them vs paying cash so you negotiate in a 48 month finance after you 've settled on the price then you negotiate the no penalty for early payment point they 'll be less likely to try to raise the price after you 've already come to an agreement   my dad has said he does this when buying cars but that could just be hearsay and has said he will negotiate on the basis of a long term lease nail down a price then throw that clause in then pay the car off in the first payment   disclaimer um not a great way to do business though if you plan to purchase a new car every 2 3 years from the same dealer do it once and you 'll have a note in their crm not to either a offer price reductions for financing or b offer no penalty early payment financing

to be fair this is n't just marijuana heroin and meth are big problems some places for example oil workers in remote areas have a tendency to have meth issues that 's a big problem   the other issue is that with drugs like marijuana it can be difficult to tell if someone is high yes marijuana is basically on the same level as alcohol but it 's easier to tell when someone is drunk vs when they are high if they 're covering up in factory or field jobs being able to tell someone is drunk or high is important if you can tell someone is drunk you send them home if you ca n't tell that mike went and got stoned because he does n't smell like it does n't have red eyes etc he can still kill someone because his performance is affected it 's not as simple as marijuana is on the same level as alcohol because yeah that 's true but there are differences and those differences can lead to expensive and problematic workplace injuries    those antiquated ceos are probably right on this one it 's not as simple as you make it out

bond etfs are traded like normal stock   it just so happens to be that the underlying fund for which you own shares is invested in bonds   such funds will typically own many bonds and have them laddered so that they are constantly maturing   such funds may also trade bonds on the otc market note that with bond etfs you 're able to lose money as well as gain depending on the situation with the bond market   the issuer of the bond does not need to default in order for this to happen   the value of a bond and thus the value of the bond fund which holds the bonds is much like a stock determined based on factors like supply demand interest rates credit ratings news etc

obviously the best thing financially would be to continue using your present car unless it impacts you financially on a regular basis for example maintenance or breakdowns impacting your ability to work an unreliable car also impacts your freedom for example preventing you from taking road trips you might want to take or taking up free time with maintenance give thought to what it is about your present car that you dislike both to determine the value you gain from a new car and what 's most important to you anytime you buy a car you generally lose thousands of dollars simply driving it off the lot this is the profit which goes to dealers salespeople etc and not part of the actual value of the car cars also depreciate over time with most of the depreciation happening in the first few years of operation many of the newer model cars have additional expenses for example replacement $ 200 keys or electronic systems that can only be repaired at special facilities in addition if you have insurance other than the minimum third party required by law consider the rate increases and add up the long term impact of that imagine you had invested that money instead at 8 interest over the lifetime of the car if you do n't have insurance consider what you would do in the unfortunate situation where you were at fault in a collision could you afford to lose your investment even with safe responsible driving there is always the potential for road weather conditions or mechanical failures if you determine there is sufficient value to be gained from changing vehicles i would recommend that you buy a vehicle with history from someone privately doing appropriate background checks and consulting friends or family who know about vehicles and can provide feedback do research into the models which interest you ahead of time read online reviews every vehicle generally has known advantages and disadvantages which can take years to discover so buying an older vehicle gives you the advantage of knowing what to expect i would say there is probably a reasonable middle ground between using a 1991 vehicle you do n't like that 's as old as you are and getting a relatively new model look at what you value in the vehicle consider all the costs and find the balance that works best for you vehicles from 2000 2005 years are quite affordable and still 10 15 years newer than your car

nobody has consistently doubled their investment year after year not even the like george soros and warren buffett mr. buffett 's average annual returns have been over 20 for over 50 years that 's about twice the american average of a year so mr. buffett has been twice as good as average for his adult life that 's like having a 200 iq and in a poll taken in 2000 he was rated the greatest portfolio manager of all time no lesser person could hope to do better what has happened is that people may double their investment in one year then give some back the following year or else go through several years of average returns the reason is that they will have an investment style that works for one particular market but not for all markets so they will have to wait for their best market to have their best year

there are no guarantees in the stock market the index fund can send you a prospectus which shows what their results have been over the past decade or so or you can find that info on line but past results are not a guarantee of future performance returns and risk generally trade off against each other trying for higher than average results requires accepting higher than usual risk and you need to decide which types of investments in what mix balance those in a way you are comfortable with reinvested dividends are exactly the same concept as compounded interest in a bank account that is you get the chance to earn interest on the interest and then interest on the interest on the interest it 's a slow exponential growth curve not just linear note that this applies to any reinvestment of gains not just automatic reinvestment back into the same fund but automatic reinvestment is very convenient as a default this is separate from increase in value due to growth in value of the companies yes you will get a yearly report with the results including the numbers needed for your tax return you will owe income tax on any dividends or sales of shares unless the fund is inside a 401k or ira it 's just normal property and you can sell or buy shares at any time and in any amount of course the advantage of investing through those special retirement accounts is advantageous tax treatment which is why they have penalties if you use the money before retirement re predicting results guesswork and rule of thumb and hope that past trends continue a bit longer really the right answer is not to try to predict precise numbers but to make a moderately conservative guess hope you do at least that well and be delighted if you do better and to understand that you can lose value and that losses often correct themselves if you can avoid having to sell until prices have recovered you can of course compute historical results exactly since you know how much you put in when how much you took out when and how much is in the account now you can either look at how rate of return varied over time or just compute an average rate of return both approaches can be useful when trying to compare one fund against another i get an approximate version of this reported by my financial management software but mostly ignore it except for amusement and to myself that things are behaving approximately as expected as long as i 'm outperforming what i need to hit my retirement goals i 'm happy enough and unwilling to spend much more time on it and my plans were based on fairly conservative assumptions if you invest $ 3k it grows at whatever rate it grows and ten years later you have $ if you then invest another $ 10k you now have $ all of which grows at whatever rate the fund now grows when you go to sell shares or fractional shares your profit has to be calculated based on when those specific shares were purchased and how much you paid for them versus when they were sold and how much you sold them for this is a more annoying bit of record keeping and accounting than just reporting bank account interest but many most brokerages and investment banks will now do that work for you and report it at the end of the year for your taxes as i mentioned

sure it 's irresponsible for an executor to take actions which endanger the estate   but what about or inaction   put it another way   is it the obligation of the executor to avoid making revenue for the estate   think about it what a silly idea    consider a apartment building full of rent paying tenants   a tenant gives notice and leaves   so do 4 more   with only tenants the building stops being a revenue center and becomes a massive money pit   is that acceptable   heck no   realistically this will be managed by a property management company and of course they 'll seek new tenants not stopping merely because the owner died   this situation is not different the same fiscal logic applies   the counter argument is usually along the lines of stuff might happen if you rent it out true but the stuff that happens to abandoned houses is much worse and much more likely teen urban explorers pot growers copper thieves winter pipe freeze flooding and wrecking interiors etc   do n't take my word on it ask your insurer for the cost of insuring an abandoned house vs. a rented one   renting brings a chunk of cash that comes in from tenants $ on a $ 1000/mo rental and that will barely pay the bills if you have a young mortgage on a freshly purchased house at recent market rates   but on an old mortgage renting is like printing money   that money first to the estate presumably it is holding back a fix the roof emergency fund and then to the beneficiaries   it means getting annual checks from the estate instead of constantly being for another repair   but i do n't care about making revenue outside of putting back a kitty to replace the roof   even if it was net zero it means the maintenance is being done   this being the point   it is keeping the house in good repair occupied insured and professionally managed fit and ready for the bequest 's purpose occupancy of an aunt   what 's the alternative   move an aunt into a house that 's been 10 years abandoned   realistically the heirs are going to get tired bored of maintaining the place at a total cash loss maintenance will slip and you 'll be moving them into a neglected house with some serious issues   that the bequest and it 's not fair to the rental is a very responsible thing to do   the executor should n't fail to do it merely out of   if you decide not to do it there needs to be a viable alternative to funding the home 's decent upkeep   i do n't think there is one   excluding a revenue producing asset from the economy is an expensive thing to do

i 've often encountered the practices you describe in the netherlands too this is how i deal with it avoid gyms with aggressive sales tactics my solution is to only sign up for a gym that does not seem to have one on one sales personnel and aggressive sales tactics and even then to read the terms and conditions thoroughly i prefer to pay them in monthly terms that i myself initiate instead of allowing them to charge my account when they please 1   avoid gyms that lack respect for their members maybe you 've struggled with the choice for a gym because one of those evil gyms is very close to home and has really excellent facilities you may be tempted to ask for a one off contract without the shady wording but i advise against this   think about it this way even though regular t&c would not apply the spirit with which they were drawn up lives on among gym personnel management they 're simply not inclined to act in your best interest so it 's still possible to run into problems when ending your membership in my opinion it 's better to completely avoid such places because they are not worthy of your trust of course this advice goes beyond gym memberships and is applicable to life in general hope this helps 1 credit cards are n't very popular in the netherlands but we have a charging mechanism called automatic collection which allows for arbitrary merchant initiated charges

if you 're asking this question you probably are n't ready to be buying individual stock shares and may not be ready to be investing in the market at all   short term in the stock market is gambling pure and simple and gambling against professionals at that you can reduce your risk if you spend the amount of time and effort the pros do on it but if you are n't ready to accept losses you should n't be playing and if you are n't willing to bet it all on a single throw of the dice you should diversify and accept lower potential gain in exchange for lower risk standard advice index funds   the way an investor as opposed to a gambler deals with a stock price dropping or surging upward or not doing anything is to say that 's interesting given where it is now do i expect it to go up or down from here and do i think i have someplace to put the money that will do better if you believe the stock will gain value from here holding it may make more sense than taking your losses   specific example the mortgage crisis market crash of a few years ago people who sold because stock prices were dropping and they were scared or whose finances forced them to sell during the down period were hurt badly those of us who were invested for the long term and could afford to leave the money in the market or who were brave contrarian enough to see it as an opportunity to buy at a better price came out relatively unscathed all i have lost was two years of growth so you made your bet now you have to decide do you really want to buy high sell low and take the loss as a learning experience or do you want to wait and see whether you can sell not so low if you do n't know enough about the company to make a fairly rational decision on that front you probably should n't have bought its stock

though mentioned it in a comment i would like to emphasize the point that the financial planner cfp you talked to said that he was a fiduciary   a fiduciary has an obligation to act in your best interests   according to when one person does agree to act for another in a fiduciary relationship the law forbids the fiduciary from acting in any manner adverse or contrary to the interests of the client or from acting for his own benefit in relation to the subject matter   so any of these stack exchange community members may or may not have your best interest at heart but the financial advisor you talked to is obligated to you have to decide for yourself is it worth 1 of your investment to have someone legally obligated to have your best financial interest in mind versus for example someone who might steer you to an overpriced insurance product in the guise of an investment just so they can make a buck off of you   or versus wandering the internet trying to make sense of conflicting advice   in my opinion a fiduciary registered cfp is probably the best person to answer your questions

no but the damage to the quality reputation of the brand can be very real amazon absolutely has an inventory problem where they   are turning a blind eye to counterfeit goods this problem is exacerbated by their commingling of inventory where they can get the same item from multiple suppliers where some of the goods are genuine and some are counterfeits and they are mixed together if the good being bought is listed on amazon as genuine but the consumer is shipped a low quality fake then it is reasonable for the customer to assume the quality of the good is low as they assume amazon would not ship a counterfeit   in 's case they are alleging that very thing happened amazon was allegedly selling counterfeits that they got from other sources than directly from via the authorized seller option and then were shipping those to customers causing damage to the brand though if that were true i would expect to sue amazon and not simply them

in the short term this question is pretty simple are occasional use grid scale natural gas plants economically viable compared to distributed gas generators   home solar is an amazingly good deal now economically the question is n't whether it 'll take over most home power generation it 's how fast that will happen   currently at least where i live the grid is still a good deal for backup power if that changes then people will stop using it   you can get a gas generator to cover a normal sized home installed for in places with gas the price for running the generator looks comparable to grid power per kwh   so no i would n't pay triple the price for grid power or buy a ton of extra storage i 'd get a natural gas generator and handle solar downtime locally

it looks like the rate on that first loan is 6 2/3   when i look at $ principal and a $ 500 payment i 'm seeing a long term 24 years not 60 but not good either   yes as you pay a bit of principal the next payment has less interest and even more principal   i hope your degree is in a field that 's lucrative or that you 're able to get a job that qualifies you for loan forgiveness over time i 'm sorry that advice might seem weak but aside from that the best i can offer is to live well beneath your means i.e. continue to live like a student and make additional payments   as far as bi weekly goes the lender may not accept partial payments set aside the money every two weeks and when you have extra money just make an extra payment amount toward principal   to pay this off as fast as possible i 'd make as high an extra payment as i could each month to the loan with the higher rate if the rates are the same pay it off to the one with the lower balance   with respect to the debt followers of the david say the rates are simply close say .25 apart with the lower balance having the lower rate if you were to pay this one first it would occur sooner of course and free up that monthly payment helping your cash flow but it comes at a cost   note if as noah suggests the rates are the same i 'd advise to make all extra payments toward the lower balance that will get you to the point where you 've freed up that cash flow for other purposes whether it 's to focus on the higher loan or anything else you need this for

the price of real estate reacts to both demand for property and the rate of inflation and rate of income growth mortgage rates generally move as treasury rates move see this paragraph as we mentioned intermediate term bonds and long term mortgages more properly mortgage backed securities or mbs compete for the same fixed income investor dollar treasury issues are 100 guaranteed to be repaid but mortgages are not therefore mortgages carry more risk of default or early repayment which could potentially the return on the investment therefore mortgage rates must be priced higher to compensate for that risk but how much higher are mortgages priced in a normal market the average spread or markup above the 100 secured treasury is about 170 basis points or 1.7 that markup the spread relationship widens and contracts with a range of market conditions investor appetites and supply of available product as well as the presence of competing investment opportunities like corporate bonds or domestic or foreign equity markets source what moves mortgage rates and when the stock market crashes investors tend to run to bonds and treasuries which causes prices to go up and treasury yields to drop theoretically this would also cause mortgage rates to drop although most mortgage rates have a base price below which they can not fall how easy is it to profit from recent stock market drops and at what frequency incredibly difficult the issue with your strategy is that you can not predict the bottom of the market at least us mortals ca n't just take the month of august for example stocks fell something like 15 after the first 5 10 drop people felt that the bottom was there so they rushed in only to have the market fall even more   how will you know when to invest even if the market falls by 50 and there 's a huge buying opportunity and you increase the mortgage on your house odds are your rates will increase because of the equity you take out what if the market stays low for a very long time will you be able to maintain mortgage payments japan 's stock bubble popped in the early 90 's and they 've had two lost decade 's now furthermore there are issues of liquidity what if you need more capital can you just sell a property or can you buy now property to draw equity against what if the market is moving too fast for you to take advantage of do n't ignore transaction costs and taxes either   overall there are a lot of ways that your idea can go wrong and not many ways it can go right

i would strongly consider renting as homes are often viewed by people as investments but in reality they are costs just like renting the time frame for return is so long the interest rate structure in terms of your mortgage payments if you buy you must be prepared to and willing to stay at minimum 7 10 years because anything can happen hot markets turn cold or stale and just the closing costs will cause it be less advantageous to renting   before buying a property ask yourself does it meet these 5 criteria   ideal i income the property will provide positive cash flow through renters   d depreciation tax savings   e equity building equity in the the best way is through interest only loans there is no reason to pay any principle on any property purchase you do 5 year interest only loans keep your payments low and build equity over time as the property price rises look how much principle you actually pay down over the first 7 years on a 30 year mortgage virtually nil   a appreciation the property will over time go up in value period there is no need to pay any principle your equity will come from this time   l leverage as the property becomes more valuable you will have equity stake enabling you to get higher credit lines lines of equity credit to purchase more properties that are idea   when you are rich married and getting ready for a family then buy your home and build it   until then rent it will keep your options open it will keep your costs low it will protect you from market downturns as leases are typically only 1 year at most you will have freedom you will not have to deal with repairs a new water heater ac unit the list goes on and on focus on making money and when you want to buy your first house buy a duplex rent it out to two tenants and make sure it 's ideal

ai and robotics are going to destroy millions of jobs   that 's not necessary a bad thing the human species should not want to spend eternity in menial labor over something as make believe as money   if the cards are played right eliminating menial jobs will be a good thing it would mean easier and more luxurious lives for most people folks who are currently doing jobs which will be replaced such as commercial truck drivers can learn new trades and/or be transitioned to different roles in their industry preferably without starting over from nothing   but it 's going to happen and it would be irresponsible to give menial laborers the impression that their jobs will still exist somehow

depending on how much freelance work we 're talking about you could set up a limited company with you and your wife as directors by invoicing all your work through the limited company which could have many other benefits for you an accountant advisor would well advise it 's the company earning the money not you or her personally you can then pay your wife up to £ 10,000 per year as of writing this without income tax kicking in you would probably have to pay yourself a small amount to minimise exposure to hmrc 's but possibly not as far as i 'm aware the rules do not state anything about working for free for yourself and i would n't worry about the ethics you 're already paying plenty into hmrc 's bank account through your day job some good information here if you 're interested

yes i agree with you saying that the value of the stock will grow as the company grows and acquires more assets i do n't see why okay i 'm a nice guy and i want to see other people do well but what do i care how much money they 're making if they 're not giving any of it to me   frankly i think it 's like people who buy plates or babies or other collectibles as an investment as long as others are also buying them as an investment and buying and reselling at a profit the value will continue to go up but one day people say wait is this little stuffed toy really worth $ 10,000 and the balloon bursts confer dutch tulips as i see it what gives a non dividend paying stock value is mostly the expectation that at some time in the future it will pay dividends this is especially true of new start up companies as you mentioned there 's also the possibility of a takeover it would n't have to be a hostile takeover any takeover would do at that point the buying company either buys the stock or exchanges it for shares of their own in the first case you now have cash for your investment and in the second case you now have stock in a dividend paying company or in another non dividend paying company and you start the cycle over

is it really so important to have good credit with so much collateral yes it is important to have good credit the bank may not lend or may charge higher for bad credit if you were to default the bank will get all that equity so you are missing the fundamental bank can not take more than what they are owed when they take possession of house they auction it take what was due from the sale and return any surplus to the owner this entire process takes time and hence bank wants to avoid giving loan to someone who they feel is risky edit there are different aspects of risk that the bank factors

that 's a really good idea though in most cases like this the template letter is sufficient someone with legal expertise drafts a template letter with the that this letter will probably have the desired effect under a specific set of circumstances if this set of circumstances apply to you then you can print this letter out and send it   legally a properly worded denial by an individual is no different than the same denial written by a lawyer so unless someone has actually began litigation there 's rarely a necessity to seek legal advice and in most cases firing off a denial or a fuck off letter is more legally advantageous than silence so it might not even be worth it

a few years ago i had a 5 year car loan i wanted to prepay it after 2 years and i asked this question to the lender i expected a reduction in the interest attached to the car loan since it did n't go the full 5 years they basically told me i was crazy and the balance owed was the full amount of the 5 year car loan this sounds like you either got a bad car loan i.e. pay all the interest first before paying any principal a crooked lender or you were misunderstood   most consumer loans both car loans and mortgages reduce the amount of interest you pay not the percentage as you pay down principal the amount of interest of each payment is computed by multiplying the balance owed by the periodic interest rate e.g. if your loan is at 12 annual interest you 'll pay 1 of the remaining principal each month although that 's the most common loan structure there are others that are more complex and less friendly to the consumer typically those are used when credit is an issue and the lender wants to make sure they get as much interest up front as they can and can recover the principal through a repossession or foreclosure it sounds like you got a interest loan   with these loans the amount of interest you 'd pay if you paid through the life of the loan is computed and added to the principal to get a total loan balance you are required to pay back that entire amount regardless of whether you pay early or not you could still pay it early just to get that monkey off your back but you may not save any interest    you are not crazy to think that you should be able to save on interest though as that 's how normal loans work    next time you need to borrow money make sure you understand the terms of the loan and if you do n't ask someone else to help you or just save up cash and do n't borrow money

i do n't know why there is so much confusion on such a simple concept the answer is very simple a stock must eventually pay dividends or the whole stock market is just a cheap ponzi scheme a company may temporarily decided to reinvest profits into r&d company expansion etc but obviously if they promised to never pay dividends then you can never participate in the profits of the company and there is simply no intrinsic value to the stock for all of you saying yeah but the stock price will go up please people get a life the only reason the price goes up is in anticipation of dividend yield otherwise why would the price go up   but the company is worth more and the stock is worth more a stocks value is not set by the company but by people who buy and sell in the open market   to think a stock 's price can go up even if the company refuses to pay dividends is analogous to person a says hey buy these paper clips for $ 10 but those paper clips are n't worth that it does n't matter because some fool down the line will pay $ 15 but why would they pay that because some fool after him will pay $ 20 ha ha

the 60 day pay back rule of a distribution your are referring to is a reportable irs rule so you wo n't be able to circumvent that by opening your own company with its own 401 k and borrowing the funds from there failure to accurately report to the irs leads to fines and possible jail time     it 's not advisable to withdraw from a retirement account but if you really need the money then you can move the funds to a rollover ira at the new broker dealer or custodian etc once you withdraw funds the plan sponsor has to abide by a mandatory 20 tax withholding on the distribution you 'll be hit with a 10 tax penalty for early withdraw and you 'll have to report the distribution as income when you file your personal income taxes the move from a 401 k to a rollover however is legal and has no tax implications or penalties besides possible closing fees at the old account that is until you decide to withdraw from it assuming you are under age 59 1/2    regarding your last point 401ks are administered by 3rd parties you would n't be opening up any accounts directly with them necessarily best advice get a financial advisor in your area i recommend going with an advisor who is backed by independent broker dealer independent broker dealers do n't offer their own investment products therefore do n't push their advisors to sell you their in house products like big banks    here 's a good article on using rollover funds to start a venture   here is a resource guide direct from the irs you can for any specific topics

i do n't really like to refer to being an expert cause it is all relative really   i know excel better than anyone in my office but i do n't consider myself an expert because my skills do n't touch many of the people on excel related forums   anyway the initiative you are showing wanting to learn this on your own is great    so if you told me that you were in expert in excel but it is clear you know less than me i 'd peg you as someone with bias   what i would want to see is that you are familiar with functions common with finance related excel work that you understand under which situations certain functions are more efficient for completing a task   like math there are many ways to solve a problem but some are more efficient than others in excel the most efficient is not always the most elegant we are talking about using the least amount of processing power and memory   that if you do n't know how to do something in excel you 'll be able to figure it out without help   there are so many resources on the web and you should know how to be able to look at other examples and apply it to your situation   you should be familiar with vba not just using the macro recorder   know what situations when it is better to use vba than excel functions in most situations you want to avoid vba because 1 it makes it difficult for other users to follow your spreadsheet and 2 excel functions are much more optimized and generally perform tasks much faster   know how to build spreadsheets that are easy for others to follow you work write comments etc   nothing is worse than trying to figure out a cluster fuck of a spreadsheet   i would not expect you to be an expert in vba and to be able to write something in depth from scratch but rather be able to figure it out using outside resources   since i am not writing in vba on daily basis i forget shit all the time but if there is something that needs to be done i can guarantee you i will figure out how   knowledge of how to integrate excel with a database via vba is good for both pulling in data and updating a database   tl;dr   1 do n't your excel knowledge but do n't make yourself out to be an excel god you never know how much knowledge the other person has 2 demonstrate that you have experience with commonly used excel related functions efficient construction of 3 demonstrate that if you do n't know how to do something in excel you will be able to figure it out provide an example 4 knowledge of vba is good especially integrating with outside databases   provide example of a time you used vba and why you did   best way to learn this stuff is through experience if you want me to critique your excel work i would happy to   the following project would give you good experience   download data for 20 countries just choose at random make sure you include u.s. though on gdp in us dollar current prices and ppp basis for all years   from imf   1 build a dash board that calculates the year over year growth of both gdp $ and gdp ppp 2 set it so you can dynamically select which country to display 3 set it up so you dynamically change start and end date 3 the chart should automatically adjust its range based on the date selected 4 create three aggregates developing countries developed countries and world ex us 5 with these aggregates have an option to show the y y growth using either the average mean or on a gdp weighted basis    this is just an idea that would give you some good experience   it is not anything i need so only do it if you want to build your skills

sovereign immunity is the state 's ultimate get out of bankruptcy free card   after all the state has a hand in defining what bankruptcy even is in their state   federal law is a framework states customize it from there    the state 's simplest tactic is to simply not pay you   and leave you scrambling to the courthouse for is that an automatic win   not really the state can plead sovereign immunity e.g. hans v. louisiana v. maine      you could try to pierce that sovereign immunity essentially you 'd be in federal court trying to force the state into bankruptcy   this would pit state authority against federal authority   the feds are just as likely to come in on the state 's side and you lose   best scenario it 's a knock down drag out all the way to the supreme court   you would have to be one heck of a creditor for the legal fees to be worth your trouble   states do n't make a habit of this because if they did no one would lend money to them and this would be rather bad for the economy all around   so business and government work really hard to avert it   but it always stands as their nuclear option   and you got ta know that when loaning money to states

the book value is total assets minus total liabilities and so if you increase the total assets without changing the total liabilities the difference gets bigger and thus higher consider if a company had total assets of $ 4 and total liabilities of $ 3 so the book value is $ 1 now if the company adds $ 2 to the assets then the difference would be 4 + 2 and last time i checked 3 is greater than 1 on definitions here are a couple of links to clarify that side of things from investopedia equity = assets liabilities from ready ratios shareholders equity = total assets total liabilities or shareholders equity = share capital + retained earnings treasury    shares depending on what the reinvestment bought there could be several possible outcomes if the company bought assets that appreciated in value then that would increase the equity if the company used that money to increase sales by expanding the marketing department then the future calculations could be a bit trickier and depend on what assumptions one wants to make really if you need an example of the latter imagine playing a game where i get to make up the rules and change them at will do you think you 'd win at some point it would depend on how i want the game to go and thus is n't something that you could definitively say one way or the other

in simple terms it is a business operation when it becomes a    profit making enterprise it is a grey area but there is a difference between selling    occasional personal items on ebay and selling for profit i would imagine the sort of considerations hm revenue customs would    take into account are the size of your turnover the extent to which    you are both buying and selling and whether you are clearly    specialising in one particular commodity as opposed of disposing of    unwanted presents or clearing the loft i do n't believe that you selling your personal camera gear will be taxable but as the link says it is a grey area   they also recommend to do this it 's far better than having to deal with an investigation a few years    down the line when it comes to completing your tax return there is a section which    is headed other income and it is here where you will enter the net    earnings from the web business net here means your additional income less all expenses associated    with it if you are still worried i would always encourage people to take a cautious approach and discuss their position with hmrc via its helpline on

adding a couple more assumptions i 'd compute about $ would be that pay out in 2018   this is computed by taking the current portfolio 's holdings par values and dividing by the outstanding for those wanting specific figures used now for those assumptions something to keep in mind is that bonds can valued higher than their face value if the coupon is higher than other issues given the same risk   if you have 2 bonds maturing in 3 years of the same face value and same risk categories though one is paying 5 and the other is paying 10 then it may be that the 5 sells at a discount to bring the yield up some while the other sells at a premium to bring the yield down   thus you could have bonds worth more before they mature that will eventually lose this capital appreciation

these are services that facilitate using credit cards so whatever vulnerabilities there may be your risk is limited to your liability to the credit card issuer usually this means no liability whatsoever and the most significant risk is the inconvenience of re issuing the compromised card some card issuers separate the pay service account from your main account so that even that risk is mitigated the number exposed is only used for that specific service and does n't compromise your actual physical card

the risk is that greece defaults on it 's debts and the rest of the eurozone chose to punish it by kicking it out of the eurozone and cutting off it 's banks from ecb funds since the greek government and banks are already in pretty dire straits this would leave greece with little choice but to convert deposits in those banks to a new drachma the exchange rate used for the forced conversions would almost certainly be unfavorable compared to market rates soon after the conversion there would likely be capital controls to prevent people pulling their money out in the to the forced conversion while i guess they could theoretically perform the forced conversion only on euro deposits this seems politically unlikely to me

so my question is is my credit score going to be hit   yes it will affect your credit   not as much as missing payments on the debt which remains even if the credit line is closed and not as much as missing payments on other bills    if so what can i do about it   not very much   nothing worth the time it would take   like you mentioned the account or opening another would likely require a credit check and the inquiry will add another negative factor    in this situation consider the impact on your credit as fact and the best way to correct it is to move forward and pay all your bills on time   this is the number one key to improving credit score    so right now the key task is finding a new job this will enable you to make all payments on time   if you pay on time and do not overspend your credit score will be fine can i contact the creditors to appeal the decision and get them to not affect my score at the very least i know they wo n't restore the account without another credit check is there anything that can be done directly with the credit score companies depending on how they characterize the closing of the account it may be mostly a neutral event that has a negative impact than a negative event   by negative events i 'm referring to bankruptcy charge offs and collections   so the best way to recover is to keep credit utilization below 30 and pay all your bills and debt payments on time you seem to be asking how to replace this line of credit to help you through your unemployment as for the missing credit line and your current finances you have to find a way forward   opening new credit account while you 're not employed is going to be very difficult if not impossible   you might find yourself in a situation where you need to take whatever part time gig you can find in order to make ends meet until your job search is complete   grocery store fast food wait staff delivery driver etc and once you get past this period of unemployment you 'll need to catch up on all bills then you 'll want to build your emergency fund   you do n't mention one but eating paying rent mortgage keeping current on bills and paying debt payments are the reasons behind the emergency fund and the reason you need it in a liquid account    source   i 'm a veteran of decades of bad choices when it comes to money of being unemployed for periods of time of credit cards and generally being irresponsible with my income and savings   i 've done all those things and am now paying the price   in order to rebuild my credit and provide for my retirement i 'm having to work very hard to save   my focus being financial health not credit score i 've brought my bottom line from approximately 25k in the red up to about 5k in the red   the first step was getting my payments under control    i have also been watching my credit score   two years of on time mortgage payments gradual growth of score   paid off student loans uptick in score   opened new credit card with 0 intro rate to consolidate a couple of store line of credit accounts   transferred those balances   big uptick   next month when utilization on that card hits 90 that took back a year 's worth of gains   however financially i 'm not losing 50 100 a month to interest tldr at certain times you have to ignore the credit score and focus on the important things   this is one of those times for you   find a job   get back on your feet   then look into living debt free or working to achieve financial independence

in all likelihood the best thing you can do if these really are your only two options ie no other debt at all paying down your mortgage will shorten the term of the mortgage and mean you spend less on your house in the long run investing is should be a long term activity so yes the likelihood is that given a modest investment it will gain at historical averages over the life of the investment vehicle however that is not a guarantee and is an inherent risk whereas paying down a mortgage lowers your financial obligations and risk investing increases your risk i want to know how you got a 2.1 interest rate on a mortgage though the lowest i 've seen anywhere is 3.25

nothing is guaranteed candlesticks are not crystal balls nor is any part of technical analysis candlestick patterns used correctly and in combination with other western technical indicators can increase the probability of a trade going into the derived direction but they are not a guarantee which is why you should always use stop losses with your candlestick or any trading in saying that another candlestick pattern that can provide high probability trades is the doji or a combination of in a row at a market extreme note that both patterns and work best at price extremes highs and lows and in combination with other technical indicators such as an overbought momentum indicator at a market high or an oversold momentum indicator at a market low edit an example here is a sample trade i placed on the 17th october and am currently in profit on see the chart below as it shows taking the trade on the open of the following day after a bullish pattern appeared at the bottom of a downtrend on the 16th in combination with the slow stochastic crossing over in the oversold region below 20 i would consider this a high probability trade and have placed an initial stop loss at 10 below my open price in case the trade went against me as the price moved up i moved the 10 stop loss up as a trailing stop loss my profit target is set at 25 or $ 4.00

consider searching locally for a rewards checking account   there are some that must be opened nationally but you can likely find a local bank or perhaps even two that offer these high yield checking accounts   they will generally pay more than the interest you have on those cards try this site to see if one is offered locally to you these accounts typically require the following   in return you get higher interest rates and most credit you atm fees   the amount is generally capped between 10 k to 25 k on the high interest rate and you 'll generally receive a small rate for anything above that i 'm in a smaller city and i have one local and one within a 45 minute drive   if you have a job that allows for split direct deposits this is even easier   we never have any trouble knocking out the required debit transactions but you must look at the balance as being an emergency fund rather than a checking fund with an available balance   if you find two near you you can probably earn a month in interest   that 's way more than you pay monthly   i vote to put it to work for you before paying it off

at a minimum i would save 20 30k because you need to have both a safety net and some money for home repairs   very few people move into a house and then do zero repairs painting usually at a minimum and there 's almost always something that comes up pretty soon after   even if you 're buying a condo you 'll want to be sure you can fix anything that needs fixing within that first year or two beyond that you have to decide based on your risk tolerance and your other details like your income   taking a smaller mortgage means a guaranteed 3 to 4 return right now   that 's not quite what you 'll probably get on the market over the long term but how did your investments do last year   my 401(k was down slightly   in order to do better than that 3 4 you 're going to have to invest in stocks or etfs or similar meaning you could have swings potentially year over year which if that 's your only extra 50k might be more than you can tolerate if you 're very risk tolerant and mostly looking to make money over the long term then it may be worth it to you   but if a larger mortgage makes it harder to pay the monthly payments a meaningfully smaller buffer or if your job is such that you might end up having to sell those investments at a loss to cover your mortgage for a few months because you did n't make laid then you may want the smaller mortgage to make that less of a risk though still setting aside the safety net in something minimally risky

there 's another line of business based on the theory of perpetual incremental growth it 's called a pyramid scheme   in the there were two general types of stock growth stocks and income stocks    growth stocks were generally smaller businesses that were still well growing you did n't expect much of a dividend from them because they were reinvesting profits into growing into new markets the focus was on capital growth    once a company got fairly large and mature then the expectation of capital growth off because back then reasonable investors recognized it 's insane to expect that a company can grow forever then while there may be some ongoing capital growth the major focus was on dividend income getting a piece of the profits a large established company could pull in    the dotcom among other things broke that people got obsessed with capital growth and instant returns the idea of a decent yield over time became laughable instead a company had to show a percentage year over year growth or they got by wall street    if you put one penny on the first square of a then two pennies on the next then four pennies on the square after that once you fill the entire how much money do you have

it makes no sense to spend money unnecessarily just for the purpose of improving your credit score   you have to stop and ask yourself the question why do i need a good credit score   most of the time the answer will be so i can get a lower interest rate on abc loan in the future   however if you spend hundreds or even thousands of dollars in the present just so that you can save a few points on a loan you 're not going to come out ahead the car question should be considered strictly in the context of transportation expenses   it cost me $ x to get around last year using lyft if instead i owned a car it would have cost me $ y for gas insurance depreciation parking etc   if you come out ahead and y < x then buy the car   do n't jump into an expensive vehicle which is never a good investment or get trapped into an expensive lease which will costs you many times more than the depreciation value of a decent used car just so that you can save a few points on a mortgage your best option moving forward would be to pay off your student loans first getting rid of that interest expense   place the remainder in savings then start to look at a budget   setting aside a 20 down payment on a home is considered the minimum to many people and if that is out of reach you might need to consider other neighborhoods less than 400 k   if you 're still concerned about your credit score a good way to build that up once you have a budget and spending under control is to get a credit card with no annual fees   start putting all of your expenses on the credit card groceries etc and paying off the balance in full every month   by spending only what you need to within a reasonable budget and making payments on time and in full your credit rating will begin to gradually improve   if you have a difficult time tracking your expenses or sticking to a budget then there is potential for danger here as credit cards are notorious for high interest and penalties   but by keeping it under control and putting the rest toward savings you can begin to build wealth and put yourself in a much better financial position moving into the future

they do but you 're missing some calculations needed to gain an understanding intro to stock index weighting methods notes in part market cap is the most common weighting method used by an index    market cap or market capitalization is the standard way to measure the    size of the company you might have heard of large mid or small cap    stocks large cap stocks carry a higher weighting in this index and    most of the major indices like the s&p 500 use the market cap    weighting method stocks are weighted by the proportion of their market cap to the total    market cap of all the stocks in the index as a stock ’s price and    market cap rises it gains a bigger weighting in the index in turn    the opposite lower stock price and market cap pushes its weighting    down in the index   pros proponents argue that large companies have a bigger effect on the    economy and are more widely owned so they should have a bigger    representation when measuring the performance of the market which is    true cons it does n’t make sense as an investment strategy according to a market    cap weighted index investors would buy more of a stock as its price    rises and sell the stock as the price falls this is the exact    opposite of the buy low sell high mentality investors should use eventually you would have more money in overpriced stocks and less in    underpriced stocks yet most index funds follow this weighting method thus there was likely a point in time where the s p 500 's initial sum was equated to a specific value though this is the part you may be missing here also how do you handle when constituents change over time for example suppose in the s p 500 that a $ 100,000,000 company is taken out and replaced with a $ company that should n't suddenly make the index jump by a bunch of points because the underlying security was swapped or would you be cool with there being jumps when companies change or shares outstanding are rebalanced consider carefully how you answer that question in terms of histories dow jones industrial average and s p 500 index would be covered on wikipedia where from the latter link the composite as the s&p 500 was first called when it    introduced its first stock index in began tracking a small    number of stocks three years later in 1926 the composite index    expanded to 90 stocks and then in 1957 it expanded to its current    standard poor 's a company that out financial information and analysis was founded in 1860 by henry poor in    poor 's publishing henry poor 's original company merged    with standard statistics founded in as the standard statistics    bureau and therein assumed the name standard and poor 's corporation    the s&p 500 index in its present form began on march 4 1957    technology has allowed the index to be calculated and in    real time the s&p 500 is widely used as a measure of the general    level of stock prices as it includes both growth stocks and value    stocks in september 1962 systems corp. entered into an agreement    with standard and poor 's under the terms of this agreement    computed the s&p 500 stock composite index the stock industrial    index the 50 stock utility index and the 25 stock rail index    throughout the market day these statistics were furnished to standard    poor 's in addition also computed and reported the 94 s&p    sub there are also articles like business insider that have this graphic that may be interesting s p changes over the years the makeup of the s&p 500 is constantly changing notes in part in most years 25 to 30 stocks in the s&p 500 are replaced said    david s&p 's chairman of the index committee and while there    are strict guidelines for what companies are added the final decision    and timing of that decision depends on what 's going through the heads    of a handful of people employed by dow jones

summary the corporation pays tax on dividends it receives and gets a tax refund at the same rate when it pays dividends out according to the corporate tax rates for 2015 are according to page 3 the federal and provincial tax rates shown in the tables apply to investment income    earned by a other than capital gains and dividends received from canadian    corporations the rates that apply to capital gains are one half of the rates shown in    the tables dividends received from canadian corporations are deductible in computing    regular part i tax but may be subject to part iv tax calculated at a rate of 33 1/3 if i understand that correctly this means that a corporation in quebec pays on investment income other than capital gains and dividends on capital gains and on dividends i 'm marking this answer as community wiki so anyone can correct these numbers if they are incorrect update according to page 22 the tax rate on taxable dividends received from certain canadian corporations is 33 1/3 further this is refunded to the corporation through the refundable dividend tax on hand mechanism at a rate of $ 1 for every $ 3 of taxable dividends paid my interpretation is as follows if the corporation receives $ 100 of dividends from another company it pays $ tax if that corporation then pays out $ 100 of dividends at a later time it receives a tax refund of $ meaning the original tax gets refunded note the first line is for the 2015 tax year while the second link is for the 2014 tax year the numbers might be a little different but the tax refund process remains the same

in general the goal of an s&p 500 index fund is to replicate the performance of the s&p 500 index   to do this the fund will buy the same stocks in the same proportions as the weighting of the index the s&p 500 index is free float capitalization weighted   this means that the higher capitalization stocks based on publicly traded shares only are more heavily weighted and factor into the index value more heavily than the smaller capitalization stocks or the stocks that have a smaller publicly traded value   for example companies like apple and microsoft have a much larger weight in the index value than smaller companies alternatively there are some s&p index funds that are equal weighted   in these funds the managers have chosen to purchase all 500 of the stocks in the index but in equal proportions instead of the weighted proportions of the index   these equal weighted funds will not as closely match the index price as the traditionally weighted index funds   instead they might do better or worse than the index depending on how the individual stocks do you 'll need to look at the prospectus of the index funds you are interested in to see which approach the fund is taking

i would be realistic and recognize that however you invest this money it is unlikely to be a life changing sum it is not going to provide an income which significantly affects your monthly budget nor is it going to grow to some large amount which will allow you to live rent free or similar therefore my advice is quite different to every other answer so far if i was you i would i reckon this might get you through half the money take the other $ 25,000 and go travelling plan a trip to europe south america asia or australia ask your job for 3 or 6 months off and quit it they wo n't give it you find a few places which you would really like to visit and schedule around them a lot of time to go where you want book your flights in advance or book one way and put aside enough money for the return when you know where you 'll be coming back from stay in a tent or cheap airbnb. make sure you have a chance to meet other people especially other people who are travelling around figure out in advance how much it will cost you a day to live basically and budget for a few beers restaurants cinema concert tickets drugs whatever you do to have fun   it 's really easy nowadays to go all sorts of places and be very about what you want to do next you will find that everywhere in the world is different all people have something unusual about them and everywhere is interesting you will meet some great people and probably become both more independent and better at making friends with strangers your friends in other countries could stay friends for life the first time you see rome the great barrier the panama canal or the tokyo fish market will be with you forever you have plenty of years to fill up your 401k. you wo n't have the energy and of a 23 year old forever go for it

number 2 can not occur you can buy the call back and sell the stock but the broker wo n't force that 2 choice to trade options you must have a margin account no matter how high the stock goes once in the money the option is n't going to rise faster so your margin is not an issue   and your example is a bit troublesome to me why would a $ 120 strike call spike to $ 22 with only a month left you 've made the full $ 20 on the stock rise and given up any gain after that that 's all the call owner may exercise at any time edit is right there are circumstances where an option price can increase faster than the stock price options pricing generally follows the black scholes model since the op gave us the current stock price option strike price and time to expiration and we know the risk free rate is < 1 you can use the calculator to change volatility the number two scenario wo n't occur however because a covered call has no risk to the broker they wo n't force you to buy the option back and the option buyer has no motive to exercise it as the entire option value is time premium

let 's divide all bank accounts into savings and checking the main difference is that checking is easy to get money from savings is hard to get money from because of this the federal reserve requires that banks keep more money on hand to cover transactions in checking accounts here is a related question from a banking customer regarding a recent notice on their bank statement deposit it seems that the bank was moving the customer 's money between hidden sub accounts to make it look like the checking account was really a savings account and thus reduce the amount of funds we are required to keep on deposit at the federal reserve bank if they did n't have to transfer the money many times the bank could keep less cash on hand but once they did 5 hidden transactions the rest of the money in the hidden savings account would be moved by the bank the 6 transaction limit is done to not allow you to treat savings like checking here is a relevant quote from the federal reserve savings deposits   savings deposits generally have no specified maturity    period they may be interest bearing with interest computed or paid    daily weekly quarterly or on any other basis the two most    significant features of savings deposits are the reservation of    right requirement and the restrictions on the number of    convenient transfers or withdrawals that may be made per month or    per statement cycle of at least four weeks from the account in order    to classify an account as a savings deposit the institution must    in its account agreement with the customer reserve the right at any    time to require seven advance written notice of an intended    withdrawal in practice this right is never exercised but the    institution must nevertheless reserve that right in the account    agreement in addition for an account to be classified as a savings    deposit the depositor may make no more than six convenient    transfers or withdrawals per month from the account convenient    transfers and withdrawals for purposes of this limit include    automatic transfers including but not limited to    transfers from the savings deposit for overdraft protection or for    direct bill payments and transfers and withdrawals initiated by    telephone or computer and transfers made by check debit     card or other similar order made by the depositor and payable to    third parties other less convenient types of transfers such as    withdrawals or transfers made in person at the bank by mail or by    using an atm do not count toward the six per month limit and do not    affect the account ’s status as a savings account also a withdrawal    request initiated by telephone does not count toward the transfer    limit when the withdrawal is disbursed via check mailed to the    depositor   should be particularly wary of a bank ’s practices    for handling telephone transfers as noted an unlimited number of    telephone initiated withdrawals are allowed so long as a check for    the withdrawn funds is mailed to the depositor otherwise the limit    is six telephone transfers per month the limit applies to    transfers to move savings deposit funds to another type of deposit    account and to make payments to third parties

when portfolio positions are reported in percentages those percentages are relative to the portfolio 's base equity   when you start out that is equal to the cash you have in a portfolio   later it 's the net equity of the portfolio i.e. how much money you could withdraw if you were to exit all your positions if you put $ 5,000 into your account and are long and short 50 then you are long $ 2,500 and short $ 2,500   if it 's 100 and -100 then long and short $ 5,000 leverage is often computed gross as if all positions were long   so if you have 100 and -100 then your broker may say you are levered 2 to 1   that is your gross exposure is twice as large as your underlying base equity

there seems to be a contradiction here home warranties not worth paper they 're written on and what struck us is that the immediately had the unit replaced there is a huge difference when you buy the insurance yourself and when a bank forces you to buy one because in the latter case the insurance is not for you it 's for the bank to protect their collateral which is your asset as well it becomes obvious when a claim comes up because the insurer is not negotiating with you it 's negotiating with another large financial institution and as far as the stereotype of banks being ruthless behemoths goes in this case you happen to benefit from being on the behemoth 's side and the insurer simply ca n't brush off a bank as much as it can brush off a person like you as you 've put it a house in phoenix without ac is not worth much so the bank could not let that happen because in case of another foreclosure they would have to fix the ac anyway

in summary in long form spreads and shorts are not allowed in cash accounts except for covered options brokers will allow clients to roll option positions in a single transaction which look like spreads but these are not actually sell to open transactions sell to open is forbidden in cash accounts short positions from closing the long half of a covered trade are day trading is allowed in both margin and cash accounts however pattern day trading only applies to margin accounts and requires a minimum account balance of $ 25,000 cash accounts are free to buy and sell the same security on the same day over and over provided that there is sufficient buying power to pay for opening a new position since proceeds are held for both stock and option sales in a cash account that means buying power available at the start of the day will drop with each purchase and not rise again until settlement unsettled funds are available immediately within margin accounts without restriction in cash accounts using unsettled funds to purchase securities will require you to hold the new position until funds settle otherwise your account will be blocked for free riding legally you can buy securities in a cash account without available cash on deposit with the broker but most brokers do n't allow this and some will aggressively liquidate any position that you are somehow able to enter for which you did n't have available cash already on deposit in a margin account margin can help gloss over the few days between purchase and deposit allowing you to be somewhat more aggressive in investing funds a margin account will allow you to make an investment if you feel the opportunity is right before requiring you to deposit the funds see a great opportunity with sufficient margin you can open the trade immediately and then run to the bank to deposit funds rather than being stuck waiting for funds to be credited to your account margin accounts might show up on your credit report the possibility of losing more than you invested having positions liquidated when you least expect it your broker doing possibly stupid things in order to close out an over account and other consequences are all very serious risks of margin accounts although you mentioned awareness of this issue any answer is not complete with mentioning those risks

hey currently in treasury it 's good in some ways and bad in others every role has it 's pluses and minuses   some basic thoughts are that you get to see a lot of the company you get a cursory view of what everyone is doing all the time but you do n't really ever get in depth views of any one area it 's a role that makes it easy to jump around industries because every large company has a treasury department but it limits the size of the company you can join because a lot of small companies wo n't have one or will just have a cash person and not an actual department you get to look at bond and commercial paper markets if that 's interesting to you you get a lot of interaction with higher ups because cash is hugely important you 're the first to know if the company is gon na go bankrupt it 's a good place to learn the business if you end up wanting to move but it 's a pretty specific skill set and carries a decent amount of responsibility it 's one of the only corporate finance roles that 's closer to front office than mid or back office   if you are just joining corporate treasury you 'll probably start out doing cash management and forecasting maybe doing short term liquidity and investment activity after that you would move into bond stuff management corporate finance stuff as opposed to the cash desk after that you 'd probably get to be involved in stuff like long term planning and m&amp;a activity which is the real cool shit    that 's what came off the top of my head do you have any specific questions

as in most anti living wage   editorials there is a lot of here   first the workers are not minimum wage in the sense that increasing the minimum wage will not increase their wages   second the article cites that one worker claimed to be making $ 2 and hour less in tips before the law was enacted with wages unchanged that seems like pretty strong evidence that tipping behavior is ultimately independent of the minimum wage   finally the article cites studies that show that workers that rely on tips have higher poverty levels than those that do n't   so while the article appears to be an editorial opposed to increasing minimum wage a more objective look at the evidence presented suggests that the minimum wage should be increased and that is either a bit of an idiot or he recognizes that as a non minimum wage earner he benefits from the inequality of a lower minimum wage

rather than take anyone 's word for it including and especially mine you need to do think very carefully about your company you know it far better than almost anyone else do you feel that the company values its employees if it values you and your immediate colleagues then its likely that it not only values its other employees but also its customers which is a sign that it will do well does the company have a good relationship with its customers since you are a software engineer using a web stack i assume that it is either a web consultancy or has an e commerce side to it so you will have some exposure to what the customers complain about either in terms of bugs or ux difficulties you probably even get bug reports that tell you what customer pain points are are customers concerns valid serious and damaging if they are then you should think twice about taking up the offer if not then you may well be fine also bear in mind how much profit is made on each item of product and how many you can possibly sell you need to be able to sell items that have been produced those factors indicate how the future of the company looks currently next you need to think about why the ipo is needed ipos and other share offerings are generally done to raise capital for the firm so is your company raising money to invest for the future or to cover losses and cashflow shortfalls are you being paid on time and without issues do you get all of the equipment and hiring positions that you want or is money always a limiting factor as an insider you have a better chance to analyse these things than outsiders as they effect your day to day work remember that anything in the prospectus is just marketing expecting a 4.5 5.3 div yield is not the same as actually paying it or guaranteeing it do you think that they could afford to pay it the company is trying to sell these shares for the maximum price they can get do n't fall for the hyped up sales pitch if you feel that all of these factors are positive then you should buy as much as you can hopefully far more than the minimum as it seems like the company is a strong growing concern if you have any concerns from thinking about these factors then you probably should n't buy any unless you are getting a discount but that 's a different set of considerations as your money would be better utilized elsewhere

putting a dollar amount on the valuation of a start up business is an art form that often has very little at all to do with any real numbers and more to do with your salesman abilities when talking with the vc that said there are a few starting points first is past sales the cost of those sales and a hopefully realistic growth curve   however you do n't have that so this gets harder do you have any actual assets   machinery computers desks patents etc   things that you actually own   if so then add those in   if this is a software start up code is an asset but without sales it 's incredibly hard to put a value on it   the best i 've come up with is how much would it cost for someone else to build it after they 've seen yours   yes you may have spent 5,000 hours building something but could someone else duplicate it or at least the major parts in 200 hours after seeing a demo   use the lower number if i was you i 'd look hard at my business plan   hopefully you were as honest as you can be when writing it and that it is as researched as possible   what is it going to take to get that first sale   what do you actually need to get there hint your logo on the side of a building is not a necessary expense   nor is really nice office space   once you have that first sale what is the second going to take   can you extrapolate out to 3 years   how many key members are there   how much is their contribution worth   at what point will you be profitable    next is to look at risks   you have n't done this before that 's huge i 'm assuming simply because you asked this question   another is competitors hopefully they already exist because opening a new market is incredibly hard and expensive on the flip side hopefully there are n't that many because entering a crowded market is equally hard and expensive   note each are possible but take radically different approaches and sums of money and $ 200k is n't going to cut it no matter what it is you are selling that said competition should be able to at least point you in the direction of a price point and estimate for how long sales take   if any are publicly traded then you have additional info to help you set a valuation   are there any potential regulatory or legal issues what happens if a key member leaves dies or is otherwise no longer available   insurance only helps so much if the one guy that knows everything literally gets run over   god help you if this person likes to go i bring risks up because you will have to them during this negotiation   for example asking for $ 200k with zero hard assets while trying to sell software to government agencies assuming a 3 week sales cycle will have you laughed at for naivety   whereas asking for $ 10 m in the same situation with a team that has governmental sales experience would likely work another big question is exit strategy do you intend to ipo or sell to a competitor or a business in a related category   if selling do you have evidence that the target company actually buys others and if so how did those deals work out   what did they look for in order to buy   exit strategy is huge to a vc and they will want to make several multiples of their money back in a relatively short amount of time   can you realistically support that for how much you are asking for   if not then going through an angel group would be better   they have similar questions but very different expectations the main thing is that no one knows what your business is worth because it is 100 unproven after 2 years and is therefore a huge financial risk   if the money you are asking for is to complete product development then that risk factor just went up radically as you are n't even talking about sales   if the money is purely for the sales channel then it 's likely not enough however if you know what it 's going to take to get that first sale and have at least an educated idea on how much it 's going to cost to repeat that then you should have an idea for how much money you want   from there you need to decide how much of the business it is worth to you to give up in order to get that money and voila you have a pre money valuation the real trick will be to convince the vc that you are right which takes research and a rock solid presentation and negotiating from there   no matter what offer a small percentage of the business for the money you want and realize you 'll likely give up much more than that a few things you should know usually by year 3 it 's apparent if a start up is going to work out or not   you 're in year 2 with no sales that does n't look good unless you are building a physical product have a competent team with hard experience doing this have patents at least filed a proven test product and hopefully have a few pre orders and just need cash to deliver   although in that situation i 'd probably tell you to ask your friends and family before talking to a vc   even would be better    $ 200k just is n't a lot of money and should be very easy to raise from friends or angels   if you ca n't then that speaks volumes to an institutional vc   a plus is having two or three people financially invested in the company more than that is sometimes a problem while having only 1 is a red flag if it 's a web thing and you 've been doing this for 2 years with zero sales and still need another $ 200k to complete it then i 'd say you need to take a hard look at what you 've built and take it to market right now   if you ca n't do that then i 'd say it might be time to abandon this idea and move on as you 'll likely have to give up 80%+ to get that $ 200k and most vcs i 've run into would n't bother at that level   which begs the question how did the conversation with the vc start   did you approach them or did they approach you   if the latter how did they even find out about you   do they actually know anything about you or is this a fishing expedition   if the latter then this is probably a complete waste of your time the above is only a rough guide because at the end of the day something is only worth what someone else is willing to pay   $ 200k in cash is a tiny sum for most vcs so without more information i have no clue why one would be interested in you i put a number of hard questions and statements in here   i do n't actually want you to answer me those are for you to think about   also none of this should n't be taken as a rather it should shock you into a realistic viewpoint and hopefully help you understand how others are going to see your baby    if the vc has done a bit of research and is actually interested in investing then they will bring up all the same things and likely more in order to convince you to give up a very large part of it   the question you have to ask yourself is is it worth it   sometimes it is often it 's not

if you are in an economy which has a decent liquid debt market corporate bonds etc then you may look into investing in aa or rated bonds they can provide higher returns than bank deposits and are virtually risk free though in severe economic downturns you can see defaults in even very high rated bonds leading to partial or complete loss of value however this is statistically quite rare you can make this investment through a debt mutual fund but please make sure that you read through the offer document carefully to understand the investment style of the mutual fund and their expense ratio which directly affect your returns in any case it is always recommended to reach out to an investment adviser who is good with local tax laws to minimize taxes and maximize returns

question 2 some financial institutions can provide a way to invest small amounts with low or no cost fees over a period of time like monthly weekly etc   for instance a few brokerages have a way to buy specific etfs for no cost outside of the total expense ratio question 3 when someone says that investing is like buying a lottery ticket they are comparing an event that almost always has at least a 99.9 of no return large winnings to an event that has much better odds   even if i randomly pick a stock in the s&p 500 and solely invest in it over the course of a given year i do not face a 99.9 chance of losing everything so comparing the stock market to a lottery unless a specific lottery has much better odds keep in mind that some of these jackpots have a of no return is not the same   unfortunately nothing truly safe exists risk may but it 's always present instead the probability of something being safe and or generating a return may be true for a given period of time while in another given period of time may become untrue one may argue that holding cash is safer than buying an index fund or stock etf mutual fund etc and financially that may be true over a given period of time for instance the usd beat the spy for the year of 2008   benjamin franklin per a biography i 'm reading argued that the stock market was superior to gold from the context it sounds like the cash of his day because of what the stock market represents essentially you 're betting on the economic output of workers   it 's like saying in an example using oil that i believe that even though oil becomes a rare resource in the long run human workers will find an alternative to oil and will lead to better living standards for all of us do like the roman and empires collapse   yes and would holding the market in those days fail   yes   but cash and gold might be useless too because we would still need someone to exchange goods with and we would need to have the correct resources to do so if everyone in a city owns gold gold has little value   the only safe bet in those days would be farming skill land crops and or livestock because even without trading one could still provide some basic necessities

you were n't eligible for a 401 k in 2010 but you were eligible for an individual ira   if you had known by april 18th that you had this extra money you could have deposited not rolled over the money up to the maximum $ 5,000 or so i think into an ira account   you could do that because you did n't participate legally in an employer retirement program but you did n't learn until early may so you missed that deadline   i doubt that the irs has any provisions for waiving that april 18th deadline but i could be wrong see the irs publications in any case to answer the question directly no you ca n't roll over the money you 're getting back because it was mistakenly in the 401 k plan   it will now become part of your 2011 income and so you 'll owe taxes on it when you file your tax return for the tax year 2011 in early 2012

well that 's the clever part of it   if you only dole out effective surpluses to those who have squandered a bunch of energy then you 've incentivized a certain lifestyle and robbed people who do n't live that lifestyle to finance it   it 's what we 've been doing for 40 years give or take with consumer goods   they keep getting cheaper and higher quality so if you 're not budgeting a healthy portion of your annual income on consumer goods then you 're missing out on the effective surplus   that incentivizes participation in the mass production consumer culture   which in turn keeps the wheels of the economy turning and keeps all the little worker bees in line   if you just handed people more money they might get crazy ideas like starting their own businesses organizing labor unions running for political office taking a day off work to go vote or attend council meetings and generally being a nuisance to the people that run everything   you would n't want that would you

take the case where a stock has just two owners a and b both at $ 10 one of them sells his shares to c at $ 11   now b has made $ 1 in profit but is no longer an owner of the stock a has n't sold anything but his shares are worth 10 more due to the last traded price printed c has bought shares at $ 11 and the price is $ 11 so technically he has n't lost any money in a larger market there are winners and losers every day on a single stock but they may not remain owners of a stock there could be days in which those that remain owners are all winners say when a stock goes up to an all time high and all those that are currently owners have an average buy price lower than the last traded price and the reverse applies too   it is of course more complicated say you own a stock and let someone else borrow it for a short selling opportunity he sells it in the market for each uptick in price you win the short seller loses and the guy he sold it to also wins a person that has a covered call on a stock is not a winner beyond a point and so on

though i did answer the linked question i thought to quote parts of this article source the rrsp advantage by david february 6th 2015 john the old calgary project manager is aware of the two main advantages of rrsps the tax refund when you make a contribution and the tax deferred growth until you make withdrawals in retirement these make rrsps ideal for those who expect to be in a lower tax bracket when they stop working which will be the case for most canadians for those in the highest tax bracket today the rrsp is a no brainer that ’s why ’s always surprised when he meets people pulling in good incomes who think tfsas stack up better than rrsps people just do n’t understand how these accounts work this is the most common objection to rrsps people simply hate the idea of paying taxes on the withdrawals money taken out of a tfsa by contrast is tax free which sounds far more appealing but that logic ignores the fact that you receive a tax refund when you put money in an rrsp while tfsa contributions are made with after tax dollars so for the and other canadians weighing this decision it comes down to whether it ’s better to pay tax now or later and that ’s not an easy question to answer both hamilton and say that anyone earning more than $ 50,000 is usually better off prioritizing rrsps over tfsas while both accounts allow your investments to grow tax free the tax refund makes the rrsp more attractive for high income earners that in a nutshell is what makes rrsps better than tfsas for higher earners not only are you taxed on your money years later but because you ’re in a lower bracket when you retire you ’ll pay less tax too   when your income is between $ 35,000 and $ 50,000 the long term tax differences between rrsps and tfsas become negligible says malcolm hamilton in that salary range just being able to put money aside in either an rrsp or a tfsa is great but rrsps can still be a better choice for reasons that do n’t involve tax deferral or refunds in his new book like rabbits author robert brown makes the case for rrsps over tfsas most of the time because the former usually means less temptation to access your retirement savings early footnote this 2012 article explains rrsps free of jargon

i think the correct statement is that wants to buy orbitz for $ the market price is $ 11 which means there is somebody willing to sell for that price but you ca n't say that a stock price of $ 11 means that everybody is willing to sell for that price and is unlikely to bid $ for just 40 of orbitz shares they 'll want at least a controlling majority

gt why not lower the minimum wage        because businesses and landlords wo n't suddenly lower their prices    they will just take the profits       as a white collar worker earning far above minimum wage who owns middle class investment property   i will probably win if minimum wages rise    my rents will rise more than my maintenance costs + property tax rise    as my interest rate is fixed the inflationary pressures will effectively lower my debt        i know who wo n't win and that 's the minimum wage workers who receive the pay rise    most of their consumption is provided by minimum wage worker intensive areas    fast food supermarkets gas utilities    all areas that will rise and what 's left will be eaten up by rent rises        minimum wage should be fixed to inflation rising annually by cpi    then we should stop talking about minimum wages at all and focus on how we can assist in upward mobility

my experience two purchases ontario canada is that the property taxes are paid    by whomever is the owner on the date the tax bill comes due   the bill might be due before the owners even decide to sell    however a part of the closing process is a statement of adjustments in which various costs that span the tenure of two owners are split on a per diem basis   in your case there would have been a charge against you of of the tax bill on this statement at the time of closing if you had n't paid any 2014 taxes the statement also includes things like flat rate water bills monthly cable bills security system monitoring   all paid by one owner or the other but split fairly on a per diem basis at the time of closing

some highly pessimistic things worth noting to go alongside all the stability and tax break upside that homes generally provide negative equity is no joke and basically the only thing that the middle classes consistently en masse the uk is at the end of a huge housing bull run where rents are extremely cheap relative to buying often in the 1 range within the brexit is looming and interest rates could well sky rocket with inflation borrowing to buy a highly illiquid asset you might have to fire sale in case of emergency job loss etc for 300k in a few years when lots of relatively cheap rental housing is available to rent risk free could be argued to be a highly lopsided and dangerous bet vs the alternatives locking in preferential mortgage rates can be a huge trap low interest rates generally increase asset values if when they rise assets fall in value as the demand shrinks making you highly exposed to huge losses if you need to sell before it is paid off in the case of housing this can be exceptionally vicious as the liquidity dramatically dries up during falls meaning fire sales become much more severe than they are for more liquid assets like stock   and unlike most products people tend to buy the very best house they can get leverage for rather than work out what they need want and finding the best value equivalent if a bank will lend you £ 20 a day to buy lunch and you can just afford to pay it do you hunt out the very best £ 20 lunch you can every day or do you make some solid compromises so you can save money for other things etc you seem to be hunting very close to the absolute peak amount you can spend on these numbers related to above at that level of mortgage salary you have very little margin for error if either of you lose jobs etc   houses are much more expensive to maintain trade than most people think you spend ~2 5 every time you buy and sell and you can easily spend 2 a year depending what happens just keeping the thing paid for liveable and staying up you need to factor this in and be pessimistic when you do   most people do n't factor in these costs to the apparent index rise in house values and what they expect to sell for in x years in reality no buy and hold investor can ever realise even close to the quoted house price returns as they are basically stocks you have to pay 5 each time you buy or sell and then 1 20 percent a year to own they have to rise dramatically over time for you to even break even after all the costs   in general you should buy homes to make memories not money and to buy them at prices that do n't cause you sleepless nights in case of disasters

it is called the monday effect or the weekend effect there are a number of similar theories including the october effect and january effect it 's all pretty much bunk if there were any truth to traders would be all over it and the resulting market forces would wipe it out personally i think all technical analysis has very little value other than to fuel conversations at dinner parties about investments you might also consider reading about market efficiency to see further discussion about why technical approaches like this might but probably do n't work
