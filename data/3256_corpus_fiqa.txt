it sounds to me like you may not be defining fundamental investing very well which is why it may seem like it does n't matter   fundamental investing means valuing a stock based on your estimate of its future profitability and thus cash flows and dividends   one way to do this is to look at the multiples you have described   but multiples are inherently backward looking so for firms with good growth prospects they can be very poor estimates of future profitability when you see a firm with ratios way out of whack with other firms you can conclude that the market thinks that firm has a lot of future growth possibilities   that 's all it could be that the market is overestimating that growth but you would need more information in order to conclude that   we call warren buffet a fundamental investor because he tends to think the market has made a mistake and overvalued many firms with crazy ratios   that may be in many cases but it does n't necessarily mean those investors are not using fundamental analysis to come up with their valuations fundamental investing is still very much relevant and is probably the primary determinant of stock prices   it 's just that fundamental investing encompasses estimating things like future growth and innovation which is a lot more than just looking at the ratios you have described

all you have to do is ask warren buffet that question and you 'll have your answer grin   he is the very definition of someone who relies on the fundamentals as a major part of his investment decisions investors who rely on analysis of fundamentals tend to be more long term strategic planners than most other investors who seem more focused on momentum based thinking there are some industries which have historically low p e ratios such as utilities but i do n't think that implies poor growth prospects   how often does a utility go out of business    i think oftentimes if you really look into the numbers there are companies reporting higher earnings and earnings growth but is that top line growth or is it the result of cost cutting and other measures which artificially imply a healthy and growing company   a healthy company is one which shows year over year organic growth in revenues and earnings from sales not one which has to continually make new acquisitions or use accounting tricks to dress up the bottom line is it possible to do well by investing in companies with solid fundamentals   absolutely   you may not realize the same rate of short term returns as others who use momentum based trading strategies but over the long haul i 'm willing to bet you 'll see a better overall average return than they do

are you implying that amazon is a better investment than ge because amazon 's p e is 175 while ge 's is only 27   or that ge is a better investment than apple because apple 's p e is just 13   there are a lot of other ratios to consider than p e.   i personally view high p e numbers as a red flag   one way to think of a p e ratio is the number of years it 's expected for the company to earn its market cap   share price divided by annual earnings per share   it will take amazon 175 years to earn $ billion if i was going to buy a dry cleaners i would not pay the owner 175 years of earnings to take control of it i 'd never see my investment back to your point   there is so much future growth seemingly built in to today 's stock market that even when a company posts higher than expected earnings the company 's stock may take a hit because maybe future prospects are a little less bright than everyone thought yesterday the point of fundamental analysis is that you want to look at a company 's management style and financial strategies   how is it paying its debt   how is it accumulating the debt   how is it 's return on assets   how is the return on assets trending   this way when you look at a few companies in the same market segment you may have a better shot at picking the winner over time   the company that piles on new debt for every new project is likely to continue that path in to oblivion regardless of the p e ratio or some other equally less forward thinking management practice that you uncover in your fundamental analysis efforts and i 'll add no amount of historical good decision making from a company 's management can prepare for a total market downturn or lack of investor confidence in general   the market is the market sometimes it 's up irrationally sometimes it 's down irrationally

i understand that itm have little time value so they will have small time but why otm has a lesser theta than atm the time value represents uncertainty   that uncertainty decreases the farther away from atm you get in either direction   at the money there is roughly a 50 chance that the option expires worthless as you get deeper in the money the change that is expires worthless decreases so there is less uncertainty there is more certainty that the option will pay off   as you go deeper otm the probability that the option expires worthless increases so there is also less uncertainty at the ttm decreases the uncertainty theta decreases as well since there is less time for the option to cross the strike from either direction   similarly as volatility decreases theta decreases since low volatility stocks have a less change of crossing the strike

yes an investment can be made in a company before ipo the valuation process is similar as that done for arriving at ipo or for a normal listed company the difference may be the premium perceived for the idea in question this would differ from one investor to other for example whether facebook will be able to grow at the rate and generate enough revenues and win against competition is all a mathematical model based on projections there are quite a few times the projection would go wrong and quite a few times it would go correct an individual investor can not generally borrow from banks to invest into a company listed or otherwise or for any other purpose if he does not have any collateral that can be kept as security by the bank an individual can get a loan only if he has sufficient collateral the exceptions being small personal loans depending on one 's credit history the private equity placement arm of banks or firms in the business of private equity invest in start up and most of the time make an educated guess based on their experience more than half of their investments into start ups end up as wiped out an occasional one or two companies are ones that they make a windfall gain on

the mechanism of supply and demand is imperfect   producers do n't know exactly how many purchasers consumers for a good there are   some goods by their nature are in short supply and some are plentiful the process of price discovery is one where in a nominally free market producers and purchasers make offers and counter offers to assess what the price should be   as they do this the historical price changes usually floating around some long term average   as it goes up we experience inflation   as it goes down deflation however there is n't a fixed supply of producers and purchasers so as new ones arrive and old ones leave this too has an impact on supply and prices money either in electronic or physical form needs to be available to reflect the transactions and the economy most central banks at least in more established economies aim for inflation of 2 4 by controlling the availability of money and the cost of borrowing new money   there are numerous ways they can do this printing issuing bonds etc the reason one wants some degree of inflation is because employees will never accept a pay cut even when one would significantly improve the overall economy   companies often decrease their prices in order to match lower demand but employees do n't usually accept decreased wages for decreased labour demand a nominal degree of overall money inflation therefore solves this problem   employees who get a below inflation wage increase are actually getting a wage cut supply and demand must be matched and some inflation is the inevitable consequence of this

a company start with say $ 100 lets say the max it can borrow from bank is $ 100 $ 10 a year as interest after a years say on the $ 200 the company made a profit of $ 110 so it now has total $ 310 option 1 company pays back the bank $ 100 + $ 10 it further gave away the $ 100 back to shareholders as dividends the balance with company $ 100 it can again start the second year borrow from bank $ 100 10 interest and restart    option 2 company pays back the bank $ 100 + $ 10 it now has $ 200 it can now borrow $ 200 from bank $ 20 after a year it makes a profit of $ 250 economics of scale result $ 30 more quite a few companies in growth phase use option 2 as they can grow faster achieve economies of scale keep competition at bay etc now if i had a share of this company say 1 $ 1 by end of first year its value would be $ 2 at the end of year 2 it would be $ 3.3 now there is someone else who wants to buy this share at end of year 1 i would say this share gives me 100 returns every year so i will not sell at $ 2 give me $ 3 at the end of first year the buyer would think well if i buy this at $ 3 first year i would notionally get $ .3 and from then on $ 1 every year not bad this is still better than other stocks and better than bank cd etc so as long as the company is doing well and expected to do well in future its price keeps on increasing as there is someone who want to buy why would someone want to sell and not hold one 1 needs cash for buying house or other purposes close to retirement etc 2 is balancing the portfolio to make is less risk based 3 quite a few similar reasons    why would someone feel its right to buy 1 has cash and is young is open to small risk 2 believes the value will still go up further 3 quite a few similar reasons

in general yes if interest rates go higher then any existing fixed rate bonds and hence etfs holding those bonds become less valuable the further each bond is from maturity the larger the impact as you suggest once the bonds do mature the fund can replace them at a market price so the effect tails off the bond market has a concept known as duration that helps reason about this effect roughly it measures the average time from now to each payout of the bond weighted by the payout the longer the duration the more the price will change for a given change in interest rates the concept is just an approximation and there are various slightly different ways of calculating it but very roughly the price of a bond will reduce by a percentage equal to the duration times the increase in interest rates so a bond with a duration of 5 years will lose 5 of its value for a 1 rise in interest rates and of course vice versa for your second question it really depends on what you 're trying to achieve by diversifying this might be best as a different question that gives more detail as it 's not very related to your first question short term bonds are less risky but both will lose value if the underlying company is in trouble gilts government bonds are less risky than corporate bonds

the statistic you cited comes from the federal reserve board 's survey of consumer finances a survey that they do every three years most recently in 2013   this was reported in the september 2014 issue of the federal reserve bulletin   they list the percentage of americans with any type of debt as in 2013 down slightly from in 2010 the bulletin also has a table with a breakdown of the types of debt that people have and primary residence mortgages are at the top of the list   so the answer is yes the 75 statistic includes americans with home mortgages the bigger question is are you really in debt if you have a home mortgage   the answer to that is also yes   when you take out a mortgage you really do own the house   you decide who lives there you decide what changes you are going to make to it and you are responsible for the upkeep   but the mortgage debt you have is secured by the house   this means that if you refuse to pay the bank is allowed to take possession of the house   they do n't even get the whole house though they will sell it to recoup their losses and give you back whatever equity you had in the house after the loan is satisfied is it good debt   many people think that if you are borrowing money to purchase an appreciating asset the debt is acceptable   with this definition a car loan is bad credit card debt is very bad and a home mortgage might be okay   even dave ramsey radio host and champion of the debt free lifestyle is not opposed to home mortgages   home mortgages allow people to purchase a home that they would otherwise be unable to afford interestingly according to the bulletin credit card balances were only included as debt for the survey purposes if there was a balance after the most recent bill was paid not including purchases made after the bill   so people that do not carry a balance on their credit card were not considered in debt in this statistic

probably a bad assumption but i 'm assuming your in the united states keep in mind that the check number is printed in 2 places on the front of each check first in the upper right corner and also along the bottom edge on of the check since the check number is scanned by the bank from the bottom edge of the check covering or otherwise modifying the check number on the upper left corner will have no effect on the check number that is recorded when the check is processed and you ca n't modify or cover the numbers or place any marks in the area of the numbers along the bottom of the check as this will likely interfere with processing of checks so modifying the check numbers will not work your choices are basically to    the check numbers are not used in any way in clearing the check the numbers are only for your convenience so processing checks with duplicate numbers wo n't matter   the check numbers are recorded when processed at your bank so they can be shown on your printed and online statements the only time the check number might be important is if you had to stop payment on a particular check or otherwise inquire about a particular check but this should not really be an issue because by the time you have used up the first batch of checks and start using the checks with duplicate numbers the first use of the early duplicate numbered checks will be sufficiently long ago that there should not be any chance of processing checks with duplicate numbers at the same time you did n't mention how many checks you have with duplicate numbers or how frequently you actually write checks so that may play a part in your decision in my case 100 checks will last me literally years so it would n't be a problem for me

as a venezuelan who used to buy usd i believe there is not better explanation than the one given to someone who actually lives and works here in venezuela back in 1998 when took the presidency we had a good economy fast forward 10 years and you could see how poor management corruption and   communist measurements had havoc in our economy it was because most of the money usd coming in venezuela were not invested here but instead given away to countries like cuba remember communism lasts while you have money back then we had an oil barrel going over 100 $ and crazy amounts of money were coming in the country however little to no money was invested in the country itself that is why some of the richest people with bank account in swiss are who stole huge amounts of oil money   i know this is a lot to take in but all of this led to venezuelan economy being the worst in the american continent and because there is not enough money inside the country to satisfy the inner market people would pay to have anything that is bought abroad you have to consider that only a very small amount of people can actually buy usd here in venezuela back in 2013 i was doing it i could buy about 80 usd month with my monthly income however that 's nearly impossible for about 99 of   to illustrate minimum wage = 10.000 month black market exchange rate as of january 2016 = per = usd    < < < that is what about 50 of earn every month that 's why this happens   the guy is holding a huge stack of money of the highest venezuelan note which he got from exchanging only 100 usd i am a computer science engineer the monthly income for someone like me is about so that is about 34 $ a month oh dear so finally answering your question q why do people buy usd even at this unfavorable rate a there are many reasons but being the main 2 the following inflation in venezuela is crazy high the inflation from 2014 2015 was which means that having the venezuelan currency in your bank account makes no sense in two weeks you wo n't be able to buy half of the things you used to with the same amount of money a huge amount of dream with living abroad me included why you ask well sir it is certain that life in this country is not the best i hope you can understand better why people in 3rd world countries and crappy economies buy usd even at an unfavorable rate the last question was q why would venezuela want to block the sale of dollars a centralized currency management is an economic measure that should last 6 months tops this was argentina 's case in 2013 but at this point reverting that would take quite a few years   however 's wikipedia link explains that very well regards

with most of the schools following the phonics method academy in is no different we to use the phonics approach and we are considered as the best phonics classes in one of the main benefits of using phonics is that it teaches children to decipher words on their own which means they ultimately need less help to read making them independent and efficient readers another advantage of learning phonics is that it gives children a foundation for learning new words thereby building vocabulary and communication skills empowered with the knack of phonics application children turn out to be fast and fluent readers

why would people sell below the current price and not within the range of the bid ask there are many scenarios where this is deliberate but all of them boil down to the fact that the top level 's bid does n't support the quantity you 're trying to sell or is otherwise one scenario as an example you 're day trading both sides but at the end of the day you accumulated a rather substantial long position in a stock   you do n't want to or are n't allowed be exposed overnight however   what do you do you place an order that is highly likely to go through altogether   there 's several ways to achieve that but a very simple one is to look at the minimum bid level for which the bid side is willing to take all of your shares then place a limit order for the total quantity at that price   if your position does n't fit into the top level bid that price will well be lower than the current bid footnotes 1 keyword quote stuffing 2 keyword overnight margin aka margin as opposed to intraday margin this is highly broker dependent exchanges do n't usually distinguish between intraday and overnight margins instead they use the collective term maintenance margin

if you are nt sure what field you want to be in then accounting is your best bet by far imo   it 's applicable to investment banking investment management and corporate finance and just in general it 's incredibly useful to understand accounting rules even if you end up in sales one day it 's useful to know exactly how to read a p&amp;l properly or how revenue recognition and return accruals work for example   my would be for financial accounting if you have nt done those courses yet cost accounting can also be very useful especially for corporate finance jobs   if you do more accounting courses basically what will happen is you will become a more well polished finance candidate   now if you are trying to keep more options open and think you might want to have options in more general business fields i.e. consulting brand management etc then branch out and take marketing stats etc   what i would again not recommend though is taking a programming class there just are nt many jobs where knowing a little bit of java or python helps that much most companies prefer to have business specialists e.g. people with finance accounting marketing knowledge and it software specialists if you want to be some kind of product manager for a tech company or a quant i suppose you could try to go all in on the take 4 5 6 courses to really develop a noticeable background taking 1 java class just has a low marginal return because you wo nt know anything meaningful to participate seriously in engineering tech discussions and you will have missed an opportunity to become even more useful as a business specialist with deeper finance accounting marketing knowledge

choosing between an emergency fund and investing aside there is no reason to use a systematic investment plan when you have a lump sum ready to invest here are the three possible futures and the effects on each strategy obviously if you are investing in the market you expect it to go up over time so using an sip will work against you in that case   if the market does go down you 'd be better off but historically the market has gone up more than it 's gone down so there 's no practical reason to keep money in your pockets   you can always rebalance change investments do whatever after you 've invested so at worst you may have some transaction fees but that should n't be a huge issue

this means that if your capital under my management ends up turning a profit i will keep half of those profits but if i lose you money i will cover half those losses the bold part is where you lose me this absolutely exists with the exception of the loss insurance   it just requires a lot more than the general retail consumer investor has to contribute   nobody wants to take on the responsibility of your money then split 50 of the gross proceeds of your $ 10,000 or whatever nominal amount of money you 're dealing with investment and return it all to you after a year   and no money manager will insure that the market wo n't decline hedge funds pe firms vc firms investment partnerships etc all basically run the way you 're describing again without your loss insurance   everyone 's money is pooled and investments are made   everyone shares the and everyone shares the losses   and to top it off the people making investment decisions have their money invested in the fund   all of them have to pay rent and accountants and other costs associated with running the fund and that will eat in to the proceeds to some degree because returns are calculated on net proceeds with enough money you can buy yourself in to a hedge fund for the rest of us there are etfs and other extremely fee reasonable investment options   and if you do n't think the performance and preservation of assets under management is not an incentive to treat the money with care you 're kidding yourself your first bullet point i 'll add that aside from skewing the manager 's risk tolerance toward guaranteed returns i doubt you would fair favorably over the long term compared to simply paying even an egregious 1 expense ratio on an etf   if you look at the s&p performance for 10 or 20 or however many years i 'd venture that a couple good years of giving up half of your gains would have you screaming for your money back   the bad years would put the money manager out of business and the good years would squander your gains

the ownership of the house depends on what the original deed transferring title at the time of purchase says and how this ownership is listed in government records where the title transfer deed is registered hopefully the   two records are consistent   in legal systems that from british common law including the us the two most common forms of ownership are tenancy in common meaning that unless otherwise specified in the title deed each of the owners has an equal share in the entire property and can sell or his her share without requiring the approval   of the others and joint tenancy with right of survivorship meaning   that all owners have equal share and if one owner   dies the survivors form a new spouses generally own property   especially the home in a special kind of called tenancy by the entirety on the other hand the rule is that unless explicitly specified otherwise tenancy in common with equal shares is how the owners hold the property other countries may have different default assumptions and/or have multiple other forms of ownership see e.g. here for the intricate rules applicable in india mortgages are a different issue most mortgages state that the are jointly and liable for the mortgage   payments meaning that the mortgage holder does not care who makes the payment but only that the mortgage payment is made in full if one owner refuses to pay his share the others can not send in their shares of the mortgage payment due and tell the bank to sue the co owner for his share of the payment everybody is liable and can be sued for the unpaid amount and if the bank forecloses everybody 's share in the property is seized not just the share owned by the person   it is of course possible to for different co owners to have separate mortgages for their individual shares but the legalities including questions such as whose lien is primary and whose secondary are complicated with regard to who paid what over the years of ownership it does not matter as far as the ownership is concerned if it is a tenancy in common with equal shares the fact that the various owners paid the bills mortgage payments property taxes repairs and maintenance in unequal amounts does not   change the ownership of the property unless a new deed is recorded with the new percentages   now the co owners may decide among themselves as a matter of fairness that any money realized from a sale of the property should be divided up in accordance with the proportion that each contributed during the ownership but that is a different issue if i were a buyer of property titled as tenancy in common i or the bank who is lending me money to make the purchase would issue separate checks to each co seller in proportion to the percentages listed on the deed of ownership and let them worry about whether they should transfer money among themselves to make it equitable careful here gift taxes might   well be due if large sums of money change hands

in older days the merchants and their merchant service providers would take funds in their currency say in this case usd when the charge hits the issuer bank the merchant and merchant bank gets there usd and were happy the user would get charged in local currency in this case the rate applied by his bank and card provider visa master also take a cut is the standard shelf rate to individuals    when business growing and banking becoming more sophisticated lots of merchant banks and merchants have created a new business if you offer to all users then you have lots of that you can convert into usd so in this model the merchant makes some more profit from fx spread the merchant bank makes good money in fx your bank and card network loose out you stand to gain because you potentially get a better rate all this theory is good but the rates are moving and its quite difficult to find out if the rates offered directly by ei ai would be better than those offered by your bank i have no experience in this example but i have tried this with large shops buy 2 items one charge in gbp and other in local currency around 2 3 times spread over a year the difference in rate was close to identical at times better or worse in range of .02

i do n't think there 's a rule i ca n't comment but brick cited irs rules but imo brick missed one thing is not looking for a distribution but is looking for a rollover my best guess   that this part of the is not well defined and your and my employer have chosen to interpret any withdrawl as a distribution even if better characterized a rollover a few months ago i went so far as to explore if i could use a loophole my company had just gone through a merger i was hoping i could rollover some or maybe all of my 401k to my ira i remember now it would have been everything before starting roth 401k contributions   my company asserted this was not permitted and further asserted that the rumors i had heard were mistaken that when we went through a company spin off a few years before that nobody under 59 1/2 was permitted to roll over i did a quick search and found irs topic   as far as i can tell this topic is silent on the matter at hand topic referred me to irs publication 575 where i started looking at the section on rollovers   i read some of it then got bored note that we 're one step removed we are reading irs publications and interpretations of irs rules   i do n't know that anybody here has read the actual tax law   there may be something in there that prevents companies from rolling over before 59 1/2 that is not well codified in irs publications

in usa if you take a personal loan you will probably get rates between 8 19 it is better that you take a loan in india as home loan rates are about is the lowest offered by sbi   this might not be part of the answer but it is safer to hold usd than indian rupees as india is inflating so much that the value of the rupee is always going 1970 when you could buy 1 dollar for 7 rupees there might be price fluctuations where the rupee gains against the dollar but in the long run i think the dollar has much more a personal opinion and since you are taking a home loan i am assuming it will be somewhere between 10 20 years so you would actually save a lot more on the depreciating rupee than you would pay interest yes if you can get a home loan in usa at around 4 it would definitely be worth considering but i doubt they will do that since they would not know the actual value of the property coming to answer your question getting a personal loan for 75k without keeping any security is highly unlikely what you can do since you have a good credit score is get a line of credit for 20 25k as a backup and use that money to pay your emi only when absolutely required that way you build your credit in the united states and have a backup for around 2 years in india in case you fail to pay up moreover line of credits charge you interest only on the amount you use cheers

# 118449
as for income tax purposes 's answer is correct the entire amount that is converted is post tax you had to pay tax on any pre tax amounts upon conversion so you do not pay tax on it when you withdraw it in a non qualified distribution similar to with contributions however there 's another perhaps more important consideration here the early withdrawal penalty for non qualified distributions from roth ira for non qualified distributions of contributions there is never an early withdrawal penalty for non qualified distributions of rollovers and conversions there is an early withdrawal penalty if withdrawn within 5 years of the rollover or conversion but only on the part of the rollover or conversion that was taxable during the conversion so if you want to withdraw within 5 years of the conversion then it works differently from direct contributions because contributions and conversions have different treatment for the penalty the ordering between them matters too contributions are always withdrawn before rollovers and conversions a later contribution still comes before an earlier rollover or conversion but within rollovers and conversions they are ordered by year an earlier rollover or conversion comes before a later one and within a year the taxable part is ordered before the non taxable part

collateralized secured are interchangeable terms note the following two quotes from wikipedia links below a secured loan is a loan in which the borrower pledges some asset e.g. a car or property as collateral for the loan which then becomes a secured debt owed to the creditor who gives the loan in lending agreements collateral is a borrower 's pledge of specific property to a lender to secure repayment of a loan this website also uses the terms interchangeably loan line of credit are not interchangeable terms   in a loan you receive a one time disbursement repay it over a fixed amortization schedule think home mortgage in a line of credit you can pay back re borrow from your credit line as often as you need think credit card or home equity line of credit

first of all one thing that is very important match is always better than no match   so you should definitely use that match on your hsa if you 've already maxed out the company match on your 401(k   in fact for most people there wo n't be much reason to invest in your 401(k above the company match at all if for example your company matches only up to 5 and you want to invest 15 of income into retirement you ought to open an ira instead roth or standard depending on your situation and put the extra 10 in there beyond that you 're right hsa 's the accounts themselves have all the benefits of a 401(k   i would n't invest there for retirement instead an ira though   there is just no reason the only built in downside of an hsa is the hdhp attachment which may be undesirable to some employees or in certain situations if you want to get down to raw dollar figures and your company is offering both a standard health plan and a the calculation will be dependent on the premiums and benefits of each and your projected costs of your health care which is always a crystal ball estimation anyway   those costs and benefits can vary wildly from a completely obvious choice on either the hdhp or standard plan or pretty much a wash where you decide based on your comfort level with a high deductible to illustrate standard plan your company might offer a standard plan that costs you $ 100 out of pocket for an individual   that means you pay a minimum of $ 1200 a year for health care   most plans will have copays a flat amount like $ 15 you pay for standard doctor consultations a deductible you pay 100 of fees up to this co pays do n't count a percentage you pay beyond the deductible 20 is typical and a maximum like $ 1000 per individual per year beyond this up to a lifetime maximum benefit of like $ 2 million you wo n't be charged anything in a standard plan where you have no expenses you might pay $ 1200 a year plus a couple co pays for a total of $   in a bad year with surgery you might max out so $ 1200 + $ 30 + $ 1000 = $ hdhp hsa these plans are very different   you might still pay a premium i.e. $ 30 a month   they will still have a deductible and maximum but they might be the same amount   you will probably not have copays i did n't when i had one but i could be wrong which means a standard doctor visit will cost more like $ 80 100 in a good year this will mean that you pocket $ 500 from your company but pay back $ 360 in premiums   a couple doctor visits would mean there 's only $ 300 left in your account at the end of the year   but that 's still a net cost of only $ 60 compared to $   big win in a bad year you would end up out of pocket the max say $ 2000 plus premiums minus the $ 500 for a total of $ 1860   in this case still better than the standard plan the important difference will come in an in between year   you will reach the max quicker on an hdhp than you will on a standard plan   with a family where all of these numbers are higher and you have more people to be getting sick injured this might make the standard plan a better benefit however since whatever you build up in an hsa account stays with you forever while you 're single and have only your own health to be concerned about that is probably a good choice   when you have a family things might change and you switch to a standard plan but you still have that war chest to offset copays and hospital visits in future years i was forced onto an hsa for 2 years with a smaller company   they had a really good contribution $ 2500 if i remember right and we saved up big time later when my wife was pregnant we were on a low deductible standard plan and paid all our fees out of the hsa   it worked out great i say as long as the averaged yearly expected costs make sense after doing calculations illustrated above go for it

being self employed your profit is calculated as all the bills you send out minus all business related cost that you have you will need a receipt for everything and there are different rules for things that last for long time long tools machinery   you can file your taxes yourself the hrs website will tell you how to and you can do it online it 's close to the same as your normal online tax return only thing is that you must keep receipts for all the cost that you claim   your tax assuming your gross salary is £ 25,000 and your profits are about £ 10,000 you will be paying 8 for national insurance and 20 income tax if you go above £ or thereabouts you pay 40 income tax on any income above that threshold instead of 20 but your national insurance payments stop

what it is trying to describe is the psychology around the current price of the stock   in candlestick charts for example if you get what is called a bearish candle where the open is higher than the previous day 's close and the close is lower than the previous day 's open at the top of an uptrend this could mean that the top may have been reached and the bears are taking over the bulls a bearish candle is seen as a bearish reversal pattern as the bulls start the day by opening the stock at a higher price than yesterday 's close but by the end of the day the bears have taken over as the price drops below yesterday 's open this reversal pattern can be even more pronounced and effective if it coincides with other chart indicators such as an overbought momentum indicator if you want to learn more look up about the psychology of the market and candlestick charting

will the proportion of my payments towards interest eventually go down   yes today would be a good day to do a web search for amortization schedule you will quickly learn how to compute precisely how much of each payment goes to interest and how much goes to principal given different payment choices would it be wiser to spend more each month on loan payments that depends on your goals and resources which we know nothing about if you have extra money you could spend it on debt reduction or you could spend it on an investment that pays more money in growth or dividends than the interest you 'd save or you could decide that the longer you have that loan sure the more interest you 'll pay but inflation will make future money less valuable basically by taking out a loan you have chosen to gamble that the thing you bought with the loaned money will be worth the cost of the interest payments in the future adjusted for inflation the bank on the other hand is gambling that you 're good for the debt and that they can make a reasonable profit off it if you have more money to gamble with which bet is the wisest one is really up to you would it be smarter to try to pay off one loan before the other if you want to pay off a loan early then always choose the loan with the higher interest rate should i start making bi weekly payments instead of monthly that 's roughly equivalent to paying off the principal by one additional payment a year there are two reasons to do so   the first is that the total interest will be lower and the loan will be paid off faster you can work out exactly how much with your new found skill at amortization computation    the second is the simple convenience of knowing that your budget for each pay period is the same   that convenience is worth something is it worth the amount extra you 'll be paying every year again this is for you to decide work out how much extra you 're paying per year and how much you 're saving in the long run and compare that against the benefit

when you give a gift to another person or receive a gift from another person there is no impact on your taxes you do not have to report certain amounts in your income including the following    gifts and inheritances if you give a gift to a charity or similar organization you can reduce your taxes it is my recollection that when a family member gives a large amount of money to a child tax on the income that money earns typically interest should be paid by the giver not the child but i ca n't find any publications to that effect on the cra site there is a bit of language about gifts from an employer that are really employment income gifts and other voluntary payments 1.3 the term gift is not defined in the act in common law jurisdictions the courts have said that a bona fide gift exists when    is a voluntary transfer of property    donor freely of his or her property to a donee and    donee no right privilege material benefit or advantage on the donor or on a person designated by the donor 1.4 whether a transfer of property has been made voluntarily is a question of fact in order for a transfer to be considered voluntary there must be no obligation to make such a transfer amounts received as gifts that is voluntary transfers without consideration and which can not be attributed to an income earning source are not subject to tax in the hands of the recipient 1.5 however sometimes individuals receive a voluntary payment or other valuable transfer or benefit by virtue of an office or employment from an employer or from some other person in such cases the amount of the payment or the value of the transfer or benefit is generally included in employment income pursuant to subsection or paragraph see also guide guide taxable benefits and allowances similarly voluntary payments or other transfers or benefits received by virtue of a profession or in the course of carrying on a business are taxable receipts if the people in question are adults who are not related to each other and do n't have a business or employment relationship then you should find that regardless of the amount of the gift neither giver nor recipient will have a tax consequence

you 're a partnership you should ask the money to be paid to the partnership you 'll have to fill partnership income tax return form 1065 and each of you will get a k-1 schedule with your own personal portion of the income for example you 're adam ben and you work together on a project and are being paid you get a check for $ 300 issued to adam ben and dba abc partnership you do n't have to have a dba it just makes it easier to show you as a single entity you then deposit the check to an account you set up for your partnership and from that account you transfer $ 100 to each of you year end you file form 1065 showing $ 300 income and attach k-1 for each of the partners showing $ 100 income that $ 100 income will flow to your individual tax returns the overhead here is setting up a partnership account potentially making a dba and filing the extra tax return that 's the proper way to do it especially if it is something you 're going to do regularly for a one time thing one of you can get paid report it as income on his her schedule c and issue 1099 to the rest of you for your parts and deduct the amount as his her expense here the overhead is schedule c for each of you instead of schedule e if handling it as a partnership extra 1099 forms instead of 1065 and and a risk of one partner defrauding the others depends on how much you trust each other with proper documentation each of these is equally legal and tax wise the costs are the same i.e. either way you pay the same taxes with partnership the overhead is a bit more expensive extra cost but in the long term it will make your life easier if you do this kind of thing regularly you may want to consider setting up your partnership as a llc llp depending on what your state allows but that would require state paperwork and potentially more fees

do n't underestimate the degree to which it seemed like microsoft essentially was the entire computer industry in 2000 apple 's comeback was only understood by a few of us the smart phone market did n't exist and microsoft office and networking solutions were dominating almost everything they competed in hell internet explorer was even considered the final word in browsers at the time firefox was two years off betting on microsoft in 2000 was like betting on computers assuming computers were a growth market and even after the .com bubble no one really expected computers in general to do anything but grow then microsoft was going to grow    point is microsoft in 2000 was the king of the technology world to a degree that is hard to appreciate in 2014 they were beyond dominant they were god

firstly decide how long you may be in the country you will nearly surely have nowhere near sufficient time to suit everything in your listing inside the time body you 've got in your excursion so determine what is most important to you cuba is n't a reasonably priced destination take an affordable sum of money credit playing cards are restrained in use to huge be certain you take a look at your card might be time honored of the accommodations in cuba they no longer take much credit playing cards the price of every transaction is also very high priced so playing cards are first rate used simplest in big quantities cuba can be an exceedingly small country however their form of geographic areas gives you many picks in activities

having just gone through this process as a buyer via broker in israel here are my thoughts tl;dr an incentive such as you are suggesting would not be particularly helpful in this case your best option is to spend your efforts shopping for a broker that you can trust the rest your main concern is that the broker will find you a place at the top of your budget and will not negotiate aggressively the main person responsible for negotiation is you you are paying for the property and you are putting in bids not your agent the agent should advise you but in the end should pass along your bids directly the real problem is that you as the buyer generally do not have as close a feel for the pulse of the market as the broker who should be quite aware of recent closings in the neighborhood therefore there are a few things that you can do to help arm yourself at the end of the day if you have decided to use a broker you are making a large financial commitment to hire someone to find you the best place and therefore it may be more important at this point to spend your efforts shopping around for the best broker rather than trying to figure out how to outsmart her you are correct buyers agents do have incentives to sell you on places that may not be right or good for you for example although your scheme may help a bit with the first concern it will not help at all with the other two which i assume to be much more likely problems in any event instead find recommendations for brokers from others have the broker show you a few properties and put in some low bids to get a feel for how she handles them discuss the properties together and try to assess if they really have your interests in mind you are paying a lot for their service and you should make sure as much as possible that they really are working honestly and in your best interest a good broker who knows his market and is trying to help you can be a great asset in the opaque cutthroat real estate market good luck

create a meaningful goal for yourself which would distract you from spending all your money and help you to direct it towards something more meaningful maybe you 're curious about just how little money you can live off of in one year and you 're up for a challenge maybe you want to take a whole year off from work a trip around the world or create a financial independence account the money that is put into this account should never be touched the idea is to live off of the interest that it throws off   i strongly suggest that you listen to the audio book prosperity consciousness by you can probably find a copy at your local library or buy if off of amazon

the fsa can only pay for expenses incurred after it was open   this also applies in case of a mid year change in election such as due to marriage divorce child birth etc for example according to this page you can only be reimbursed for qualifying expenses from the election that was in place at the time the expense was incurred so say you had $ 500 available from january to june then on july 1 had a qualifying event you then elected $ 2000   you can be reimbursed for up to $ 500 in expenses incurred prior to july 1 and then an additional $ 1500 in expenses incurred after up to $ 2000 if you did n't use your full $ 500 more specifically from the irs publication generally distributions from a health fsa must be paid     only to reimburse you for qualified medical expenses you     incurred during the period of coverage the hsa question is more complicated i would talk to a tax accountant or at minimum your benefits coordinator   also read the publication i linked above the first part is about hsas   the short answer to your specific question stop contributing to the hsa unless you were contributing well under the limit of the hsa   if you know your limit and you know you 're under it you can continue contributing until april 15 of next year if you fail to be an eligible individual during     2013 you can still make contributions up until april 15     2014 for the months you were an eligible individual the general rule is you can contribute up to of months you were eligible   so if you changed jobs oct 1 and you 're single then you could contribute or just over $ 2400 in total for the year   if you 've contributed less than that to date you may continue contributing up to that amount but again contact your benefits coordinator or preferably a tax accountant as the rules can be complicated you definitely can not deduct any expenses from the account that you incur after you are no longer eligible and the rules on distributions are pretty complicated and if you get it wrong you may owe a 10 penalty on top of the tax you would normally owe so there is significant incentive not to get it wrong

there is one massive catch in this which i found out when i went to nationwide to ask for a loan i 've got a credit card which they kept increasing my credit limit it 's now at something ridiculous nearly £ 10,000 but they keep increasing it i never use that card when i went to nationwide though they said they could n't give me a loan because i had £ 10,000 credit already and if i reduced this credit this would affect my credit rating and they could potentially give me a loan i then realised what had done   i have two cards with this bank one with really low interest and the other with really high interest and a high credit limit even though the other card has a zero balance loan companies still see it as money i could potentially go and spend it does n't matter to them that i 've not spent any money on that card in about 12 months to them it 's the fact that they could give me a loan and then i could go and spend another £ 10,000 on that card as you can see extremely risky    of course this means that what are doing is giving me such a high credit knowing full well that i 'm not going to use it but it also prevents their competitors from offering me a loan even at a lower rate because i 've already got too much credit available so yes there is a catch to giving you a high credit limit on your cards and it 's to prevent you from either leaving that bank or getting a lower interest rate loan out to clear the debt

you can print them on any irs approved paper you do n't have to use pre printed forms the irs publishes specifications for paper that is approved for use for these kinds of forms 109 w etc   here 's the reason why it is important even the slightest deviation can result in incorrect scanning and may affect money amounts reported for employees note that some portions of these forms are in different color 1099-misc copy a this is important and using incorrect color will affect the irs ocr mechanisms forms for individuals are less complicated with regards to technical specifications because individuals must file them and as such any complication will unnecessarily burden the all the 109 w etc forms are not legally required to be filed by all citizens you 're only required to file them if you chose to do business or chose to employ others as such using professional software and special forms is a cost of doing your business and not a tax as it would be had it been mandatory to everyone mistakes in individual forms due to ocr failure or something else will be noticed by the taxpayers less more refund etc or through the internal matching and cross check however forms 109 and w feed that matching and cross check system and are considered source of truth by it and as such their processing must be much more reliable and precise

there are tax free bonds in the united states   they are for things like public housing and other urban projects   they are tax free for everyone but only rich people buy them   why    the issue is that the tax free nature of the bond is included in its yield   so rather than yielding say a 5 return they figure that the owner is getting 20 off due to not paying taxes   as a result they only give a 4 return but are as risky as a 5 return investment   net result only rich people invest in tax free bonds   rich is defined here to mean people paying a 20 tax on long term investment returns    or take the state and local tax salt deduction which has been in the news recently   again it is technically open to everyone   but there is also a standard deduction that is open to everyone   for the typical family state and local taxes might be 5 of income   so for a family making $ 100k a year that 's $ 5k   the same family can take a $ 13k or so standard deduction instead of itemizing   so why would they take the smaller deduction    as a practical matter two groups take the salt deduction   people rich enough to pay more than $ 13k in state and local taxes and people who also take the mortgage interest deduction   so it helps a lot of people who are rich quite a bit   and it helps a few middle class people some    but if you are lower middle class with a $ 30k mortgage on a tiny house and paying 4 interest then that 's only $ 1200 a year   add in property taxes of $ 3000 and salt of $ and that 's only $ 7k   even if the person gives $ 3k to charity the $ 13k deduction is a lot better and requires less paperwork    contrast that with someone who has $ 500k mortgage at 3.6 interest   that 's $ 18k in interest alone   add in a salt of $ 7k and property taxes of $ 50k and there 's $ 75k of itemized deductions much better than $ 13k   now a $ 7k donation to charity is entirely deductible   and even after the mortgage interest deduction goes away the other $ remains

especially for people just starting out without much reserve the biggest concern is the of their expenses and income if you 're paid every two weeks but your rent car loan and other big rocks are due once a month then there are two a year that no one has a claim on depending on your spending style these can go into savings yay or be spent on the spot and wasted boo   of course you can get your mortgage set to every two weeks and typically the bank will do that at the half your monthly payment level if you 're paid every two weeks you wo n't feel any pain from this but are making extra payments every year and getting out of the mortgage faster the time value of money part has a small impact the emotional part and fooling yourself into saving or paying things off faster has a bigger one

the folks who hold stock are the legal owners of the company if a majority of stock holders become unhappy with the management of a company they can fire the executives and put in new management or they can direct the company to close its doors and sell off its assets as a crude approximation the stock holders are happier when the stock price goes up and when it goes down therefore executives are highly motivated to drive the stock price up   a frequent criticism of corporate is that management can be so motivated to drive the stock price up that they will take actions that drive the stock price up in the current year even if undercuts the company in the long term

question 1 yes question 2 there is no simple formula car insurance is mostly statistics because you have so many millions of cases that the variance is really low this also means that because the cost can be estimated so precisely it is difficult to make an offer better than the competitors for that reason every insurance company makes there own arbitrary segmentation of the data which leads them identify low risk groups they can offer a bonus to common ones are type of car or and driving experience but it could be anything that is not forbidden by anti discrimination laws also additional perks like towing insurance etc may give them an opportunity do differentiate themselves or to make easy profit   in fact it is a common tactic to offer prices that make close to no profit to fill up your book then raise tariffs in then following years an make you profit with those who are to lazy to switch

your question is one of semantics   etfs and mutual funds have many things in common and provide essentially the same service to investors with minimal differences   it 's reasonably correct to say an etf is a mutual fund that and then follow up with some stuff that is not true of a typical mutual fund   you could do the same with for example a hedge fund   a hedge fund is a mutual fund that does n't comply with most sec regulations and thus is limited to accredited investors as a matter of practice when people say mutual fund they are talking about traditional mutual funds and pretty much never including etfs   so is an etf a mutual fund as the word is commonly used   no

disclaimer i am not a tax specialist you probably need a sales tax permit if you 're going to sell goods since just about every state taxes goods though some states have exemptions for various types of goods   for services it gets there is a database here that lists what services are taxed in what states in wyoming for example cellphone services and diaper services are taxed while insurance services and barber services are not   for selling over the internet it gets even there 's a guide on that claims to be comprehensive it states that the default rule of thumb is that if you have a physical presence in a state such as a warehouse or a retail shop or an office you must collect tax on sales in that state given your situation you probably only need to collect sales tax on customers in wyoming probably   in any event i 'd advice having a chat with an accountant in wyoming who can help walk you through what permits may or may not be needed

as someone who 's currently shopping for some winter wheels and has the raised blood pressure to go with that i 've got a few suggestions as to what would make me pick up the phone and call your or email you if you 're advertising a vehicle keep in mind that if you 're willing to deal with the additional hassle you 'll normally get the most money for a used car if you sell it privately if it is worth the additional effort though is both a matter of judgement and if you 're willing to put up with strange people like me depending on the value of the vehicle and its rarity desirability you 're looking at newspaper ads probably wo n't get you much of a response these days craigslist and similar and last but not least ebay if you 're trying to sell something that 's easy to find because there are five at every street corner think minivan skip ebay if it 's worth below i would n't bother with places where you have to pay to advertise which leaves cl for the cheap stuff that said i 'd still stick it on cl if it 's advertised in other places heck it 's free after all the figure out what sort of money you 're asking for check the resources like and have a look at your local cl for similar vehicles out here certain types of vehicles for example sell quickly and often above even a little market research will help you come up with a good price just do n't do things like asking a massively inflated price for a vehicle because you paid $ x five years ago all this shows that you have no idea what your vehicle is worth oh and i 'd always work out what the minimum i 'd take is leave yourself some haggle room but do n't the vehicle once you know where you advertise and for how much pull together the basic facts for your vehicles and the points that would make it stand out basic facts about the car should include engine size type of transmission if it 's awd where applicable mileage color i can see on the pictures but it 's nice to include that too if you have service records recently replaced a big ticket item think transmission or similar or had a very recent service especially a big one where you had a timing belt and changed mention it do n't say the vehicle has a new engine if that was put in 100k miles ago that 's nice to mention but it 's not new if nobody 's ever smoked in it mention it if it 's got other outstanding features super low mileage summer only use etc make sure to mention it that too next if it 's got any faults that you know of especially obvious ones disclose them people like me will most likely find the leaking shock and the rust holes in the floor anyway and it makes a much better impression if you do tell us about them beforehand trying to tell someone that your banana shaped car that looks like the blue man group used it for practise is actually pristine and accident free is n't going to go down very well next pull together the paperwork make sure you 've got the title if there is a lien on the title check with the lienholder before advertising the car so you know their procedure for releasing the title any maintenance records you have manuals receipts etc if the vehicle has a salvage title try to find out why and mention it in the ad i 've just had a comedian phone me while i was driving to see his vehicle and leave a message that he did n't have a title and did n't seem to be willing to bother to get one either obviously that put me in the right frame of mind given that it was a 200 mile round trip so do n't do it if you ca n't get a title the schmuck you sold it to will have even less of a chance of getting one and given that you are in california a lot of people including myself react really badly to three years worth of back registration missing expired registrations on something i 'd expect to test drive etc essentially anything that would stop a potential cash buyer to drive it away on the spot next clean the car you know the five years of accumulated mcd and inch thick layer of dirt i 'm only partially kidding i 've seem some pretty horrible stuff recently spend the two hours it takes to clean it or pay to have it or detailed clean shiny cars sell a lot better than a rolling recycling container oh and last make the effort take some decent photos the more the shot in daylight no a black car after sunset and if there is any damage an additional photo or two showing the damage would be nice stick the on or similar and put the links in your craigslist ad so you do n't restrict yourself to the photos that you normally get on there as to payment i 'd either take cash meet the buyer at his bank where he draws out a cashiers check in front of your eyes or well cash no deeds on bridges in brooklyn or anything else be prepared to take a deposit a lot of buyers are n't willing to wander around with ten large ones in the back pocket to go look at a car and spell out exactly how long the deposit is good for i also tend to make them non refundable buyer does n't pick up the car within the negotiated timeframe you keep the deposit as damages for not being able to sell it to another cash buyer check your dmv 's website as to what exactly you need to do once you sold the car here in nevada it 's the buyer 's problem on how to move it as you keep the plates but i know in california the regular plates not personal ones iirc stay with the vehicle and i think you need to inform the dmv that you sold the vehicle i 'd also keep a record of who i sold a vehicle to name address from his drivers license license number etc just in case they run a few red lights and accumulate a few worth of parking tickets

construction loans are typically short term that then get rolled into conventional mortgages at the end of the construction period since the actual construction loan is short term you can not combine it with a long term land loan as well you could do the two separate loans up front to buy the land and finance the construction then at the end roll both into a conventional mortgage to close out the land and construction loans this option will only work if you do all three through the same lender trying to engage various lenders will require a whole new refinance process which i very much doubt you would want to go through these are sometimes called combo loans since they aggregate several different loan products in one transaction not a lot of places do land loans so i would suggest first find a lender that will give you a land loan and set an appoint with a loan representative explain what you are trying to do and see what they can offer you you might have better luck with credit unions as well instead of traditional banks

if your gut told you to buy during the depths of 09 your gut might be well calibrated the problem is stock market declines during recessions are frequently not that large relative to the average long run return of 9   a better strategy might be hold a percentage in equities based upon a probability distribution of historical returns   this becomes problematic because of changes in the definition of earnings and the recent inflation stability which has encouraged high valuations   cash flow has not been as corrupted as earnings now and might be a better indicator   this obviously is n't perfect either but returns can be improved since there is no way yet available the optimal primary strategy is still buy hold which has made the most successful investor frequently one of the richest people on the planet for decades but this could still be used as an auxiliary for cash management reserves during recessions once retired

i guess i do n't understand how you figure that taking out a car loan for $ 20k will result in adding $ 20k in equity   a car loan is a liability not an asset like your $ 100k in cash   besides you do n't get a dollar for dollar consideration when figuring a car 's value against the loan it is by   in other words the car is only worth what someone 's willing to pay for it not what your loan amount on it is remember that taking on a loan will increase your debt to income ratio which is always a factor when trying to obtain a mortgage   at the same time taking on new debt just prior to shopping for a mortgage could make it more difficult to find a lender   every time a credit report hard inquiry is run on you it temporarily impacts your credit score   the only exception to this rule is when it comes to mortgages   in the u.s. the way it works is that once you start shopping for a mortgage with lenders for the next 30 days additional inquiries into your credit report for purposes of mortgage funding do not count against your credit score so it 's a in a way   you ca n't use this to shop for any other kind of credit but the purpose is to allow you a chance to shop for the best mortgage rate you can get without adversely impacting your credit in the end my advice is to stop looking at how much house you can buy and instead focus on a house with payments you can live with and afford   trying to buy the most house based on what someone 's willing to lend you leaves no room in the near term for being able to borrow if the property has some repair needs you want to furnish upgrade it or for any other unanticipated need which may arise that requires credit   do n't paint yourself into a corner   just because you can borrow big does n't mean you should borrow big i hope this helps good luck

you should check the details of those balance transfers they typically have a 3 to 5 one time fee which means you pay nearly a year 's interest right away and then every time you transfer the total on again also this fee gets added to the credit card total and it is possibly considered paid last after you paid off the completed transferred balance so it cost interest for the whole time and that interest is different maybe 19.99 or worse it is probably a better idea to refinance for 5 years at < 3 and they pay off as fast as possible

in general you are allowed to deduct up to $ 50/month per student see page 4 but only if you are n't reimbursed in your case since you are receiving a stipend the full $ 2000 will be treated as taxable income but the question of is it worth it really depends on how much you will actually spend and also what you 'll get from the experience suppose you actually spend $ 1000/month to host them and if your combined tax rate is 35 you 'll pay $ 700 in additional taxes each month but you 'll still profit $ 300 each month if your primary motivation for hosting students is to make a profit you could consider creating a business out of it if you do that you will be able to deduct all of your legitimate business expenses which in the above example would be $ 1000/month keeping with that example you would now pay taxes on $ 1000 instead of $ 2000 which would be $ 350 meaning your profit would now be $ increasing your profit by $ 350/month you will only need to keep spending records if you plan to go the business route my advice assume you wo n't be going the business route and then figure out what your break even point is based on your tax rate the formula is max you can spend per month without losing money = 2000 2000 t e.g. if t = 35 the break even point is $ 1300 side note my family hosted 5 students in 5 years and it was always a fantastic experience but it is also a very big commitment teenagers eat a lot and they drive cars and go on dates and play sports and need help with their homework especially english papers and they do n't seem to like bed times or imho it 's totally worth it even without the stipend

you apparently assume that pouring money into a landlord 's pocket is a bad thing not necessarily whether it makes sense to purchase your own home or to live in a rental property varies based on the market prices and rents of properties in the long term real estate prices closely follow inflation however in some areas it may be possible that real estate prices have increased by more than inflation in the past say 10 years this may mean that some stupid people assume that real estate prices continue to appreciate at this rate in the future the price of real estates when compared to rents may become unrealistically high so that the rental yield becomes low and the only reasonable way of obtaining money from real estate investments is price appreciation continuing no it will not continue forever furthermore an individual real estate is a very poorly diversified investment and a very risky investment too a mold problem can destroy the entire value of your investment if you invest in only one property real estates are commonly said to be less risky than stocks but this applies only to large real estate portfolios when compared with large stock portfolios it is easier to build a large stock portfolio with a small amount of money to invest when compared to building a large real estate portfolio thus i would consider this how much return are you going to get by not needing to pay rent but needing to pay some minor maintenance costs when purchasing your own home how much does the home cost what is the annual return on the investment is it larger than smaller when compared to investing the same amount of money in the stock market as i said an individual house is a more risky investment than a well diversified stock portfolio thus if a well diversified stock portfolio yields 8 annually i would demand 10 return from an individual house before considering to move my money from stocks to a house

yes that is not an unusual number in some states the state tax rate is fairly flat and unless you are highly paid the social security and medicare taxes are also flat the big issue is the federal number several things can make make the federal taxes for the early paychecks larger than normal later checks will include these pretax amounts which will reduce the taxable income and the taxes though the net check will get smaller keep in mind that the size of the checks your first year are impacted by the fact that most recent graduates start in the summer the tax tables assume that each of the paychecks you receive will be essentially the same for those recent graduates the 1st real paycheck the average paycheck for the first part of the year this can put you in a higher bracket than you should be and result in a large refund when you file in the spring   you can adjust your withholding numbers after a few checks to counterbalance this of course the numbers will need to be changed back in year two to to avoid under withholding

assuming you 're talking about a property in the united states the answer generally would be no   you are n't actually paying any of the expenses for the property and yet you want to take the deductions for doing so   that 's a rather move i 'd say grin    it probably would lead to some real strife with your brother since he would have proper claim to those credit on the basis he 's the one footing the bills for the property   before you do anything like what you 're talking about it might be best to speak with him because both of you are running the very real risk of an audit and if that happens then i can guarantee the irs will slap the out of you for it   your brother i 'm sure is already claiming all of the deductions he can for what he 's putting into the property and on top of that you want to file for your half   what half are you referring to when your out of pocket is zero   so what you 're saying is you think that between you and your brother you should be able to take a credit of 150 of the actual deductions sounds like a recipe for disaster to me i strongly encourage you to talk to a tax professional but if you get a different answer to this than what i 've already given then i 'd be stunned    i hope this helps good luck

gift taxes kick in at around $ 13 k per giver per recipient per year that means that a straight up gift of $ 200 k as cash or a house will incur a tax it is possible however that if the father has a spouse he and the spouse could each give the mother and each child the full gift limit for a total of about $ 78 k per year and that money could be used by all 3 of them to buy the house jointly over a couple of years i think the children would have to be on the title since part of the gift money would be theirs and one is an adult as far as lending the money my in laws are our mortgage lenders and when we structured the loan it had to be at a market rate which could be the lowest advertised rate we found for a fixed rate mortgage independent of what we might actually qualify for or we could not deduct interest payments forgiving the loan could also be considered a gift so they would need to keep an audit trail showing that payments were made and her father would need to declare the interest income on his taxes if he bought the house as a second home and let her and her children live there rent free it might work but i 'm not sure it would in that case be an asset of his estate when he dies i do n't know anything about structuring it as a trust free rent could conceivably also be construed as a gift subject to the limits stated above disclaimer not a tax professional

there 's a lot of personal preference and personal circumstance that goes into these decisions   i think that for a person starting out what 's below is a good system   people with greater needs probably are n't reading this question looking for an answer how many bank accounts should i have and what kinds and how much percentage wise of my income should i put into each one   you should probably have one checking account and one savings money market account   if you 're total savings are too low to avoid fees on two accounts then just the checking account at the beginning   keep the checking account balance high enough to cover your actual debits plus a little buffer   put the rest in savings multiple bank accounts beyond the basics or using multiple banks can be appropriate for some people in some circumstances   those people for the most part will have a specific reason for needing them and maybe enough experience at that point to know how many and where to get them else they ask specific questions in the context of their situation i did see a comment about partners if you 're married in long term relationship you might replicate the above for each side of the marriage partnership   that 's a personal decision between you and your partner that 's more about your philosophy in the relationship then about finance specifically then from there how do i portion them out into budgets and savings   i personally do n't believe that there is any generic answer for this question   others may post answers with their own rules of thumb   you need to budget based on a realistic assessment of your own income and necessary costs   then if you have money some savings   include a minimal level of entertainment in necessary costs because most people can not work constantly   beyond that minimal level additional entertainment comes after necessary costs and basic savings   savings should be tied to your long term goals in addition to you current constraints should i use credit cards for spending to reap benefits no use credit cards for the convenience of them if you want but pay the full balance each month and do n't overdo it   if you lack discipline on your spending then you might consider avoiding credit cards completely

for us stocks it 's a bit of a gamble many actively managed funds underperform the market indexes but some of them outperform in many years with an index you will get average results with an active manager you might do better than average so you can view active management as a higher risk potentially higher reward investment approach on the other hand if you want to diversify some of your investments into international stocks bonds junk bonds and real estate reits active management is highly likely to be better than indexing for these specialized areas specialized knowledge and research is needed

first of all look for a savings account with a decent interest rate online banks are good at offering those and you can transfer your money back and forth from the checking account with a couple of business days delay ing direct offers 1.1 apy right now lame but much better than nearly nothing if you 'd like a little nicer rate of return you should also consider putting some of the money the part you need least in a short- or intermediate term bond etf or mutual fund you can sell them quite readily they pay more interest than a savings account and because of the shorter maturities involved the interest rate risk is limited that 's the one that makes your bonds less valuable now because the rates went up after you bought them i have some nyse that 's yielding 3.8 or so

it is great that you came up with a plan to own a rental home free and clear and also move up in home   it is also really good of you to recognize that spending has a profound effect on your net worth many people fail to acknowledge that and prefer to instead blame things outside their control   good work there   here are some items of your plan that i have comments on by aggressively elective spending how does your spouse feel about this   they have to be on board but it is such a short time frame this is very doable cashing out all corporate stock this will probably trigger capital gains   you have to be prepared to pay the tax man but this is a good source of cash for your plan   you also have to have an additional amount that will likely be due next april 15th all contributions to my current non matched this is fine as well because of the short time frame withdrawing the principal from a roth ira this i kind of hate   we are so limited in money that we can put into tax favored plans that taking money out bothers me   also it is that much more difficult to save in a roth because of the sting of taxes   i would not do this but would favor instead to take a few extra months to make your plan happen buy home 2 how are you going to have a down payment for home 2   is your intention to pay off home and save a while then purchase home 2   i would do anything to avoid pmi    besides i would take some time to live in a paid for house overall i would grade your plan a b.   if take a bit longer and remove the withdrawing from the roth it then becomes an a-   with a good explanation of how you come up with the down payment for house 2 you could easily move to an a+

i reread your question you are not asking about the validity of selling a particular stock after a bit of an increase but a group of stocks we do n't know how many   this is the s&p for the past 12 months trading at 1200 or so means that 80 100 points is an 8 move i count 4 such moves during this time   the philosophy of you ca n't go wrong taking a gain is tough for me to grasp as it offers no advice on when to get back in studies by firms such as dalbar you can google for some of their public material show data that supports the fact that average investors lag the market by a huge amount 20 years ending the s&p returned investor equity returns showed i can only conclude that this is a result of buying high and selling low not staying the course   the data also leads me to believe the best advice one can give to people we meet in these circumstances is to invest in index funds keeping your expenses low as you can i 've said this since read jack bogle decades ago and this advice would have yielded about over the 20 years beating the average investor by far by guaranteeing lagging the average by 10 basis points or so   a summary of the more extensive report citing the numbers i referenced is available for down load 2015 quantitative analysis of investor behavior it 's quite an eye opener and a worthy read the original report was dated 2009 but the link broke so i 've updated to the latest report 2015

simplest way to answer this is that on margin one is using borrowed assets and thus there are strings that come with doing that thus if the amount of equity left gets too low the broker has a legal obligation to close the position which can be selling purchased shares or buying back borrowed shares depending on if this is a long or short position respectively investopedia has an example that they walk through as the call is where you are asked to either put in more money to the account or the position may be closed because the broker wants their money back what is maintenance margin a maintenance margin is the required    amount of securities an investor must hold in his account if he either    purchases shares on margin or if he sells shares short if an    investor 's margin balance falls below the set maintenance margin the    investor would then need to contribute additional funds to the account    or liquidate stocks in the account to bring the account back to the    initial margin requirement this request is known as a margin call as discussed previously the federal reserve board sets the initial    margin requirement currently at 50 the federal reserve board also    sets the maintenance margin the maintenance margin the amount of    equity an investor needs to hold in his account if he buys stock on    margin or sells shares short is 25 keep in mind however that this    25 level is the minimum level set brokerage firms can increase but    not decrease this level as they desire example determining when a margin call would occur assume that an    investor had purchased 500 shares of 's stock the shares were    trading at $ 50 when the transaction was executed the initial margin    requirement on the account was 70 and the maintenance margin is 30    assume no transaction costs determine the price at which the investor    will receive a margin call answer calculate the price as follows $ 50 1- = $ 1 0.30 a margin call would be received when the price of 's stock fell    below $ per share at that time the investor would either need    to deposit additional funds or liquidate shares to satisfy the initial    margin requirement most people do n't want margin calls but stocks may move in unexpected ways and this is where there are mechanisms to limit losses especially for the brokerage firm that wants to make as much money as possible cancel what trade no the broker will close the position if the requirement is n't kept basically think of this as a way for the broker to get their money back if necessary while following federal rules this would be selling in a long position or buying in a short sale situation the margin investor walks through an example where an e mail would be sent and if the requirement is n't met then the position gets exited as per the law

term insurance is definitely expensive at 60 but so is permanent insurance   let 's think about why people buy each one term makes sense if you are worried about death during a certain period of time but not afterward   often this is young people trying to get out of debt have young dependents etc who expect to have more money later in life and less need for insurance permanent makes sense if you want to ensure that your dependents get paid tax free at your death even if you die at an age when you are basically uninsurable   these plans make sense if you hold them forever but if you get out of them early there are often large fees that will make it a pretty bad deal the fact that your uncle is already in a permanent plan makes me think it might make sense to continue   check the details to see how large the fees on getting your money out early would be    given that he has a disabled wife having a permanent plan may make sense especially if her disability is not one associated with dying younger having said that i can see an argument for term insurance if your uncle is primarily concerned with providing for his daughter and wo n't be concerned about it after she 's out of school    the answer really depends on

if you are interested in a career in algorithmic trading i strongly encourage you to formally study math and computer science   algorithmic trading firms have no need for employees with financial knowledge if they did they 'd just be called trading firms   rather they need experts in machine learning statistical modeling and computer science in general of course there are other avenues of employment at an algorithmic trading firm such as accounting clearing exchange relations etc   if that 's the sort of thing you 're interested in again you 'll probably want a formal education in those areas as opposed to just reading about finance in the news if you edit your question or add a comment below with information about your particular background i could perhaps advise you in a bit more detail edit given your comment i would say you have a fine academic background for the industry   when hiring mathematicians firms care most about the ease with which you can explore and extract features from massive datasets especially time series regardless of what the dataset might represent   an intelligent firm will not care whether you arrive at their doorstep with zero finance knowledge they will want to teach you everything from scratch anyway nonetheless some domain knowledge could be helpful but you 're not going to get more of it from reading any mass market news source whether you have to pay for it or not   that 's because   some non mass market news sources in the industry are   these are subscription only and actually discuss real information that real professional investors care about   they are loaded with industry jargon they 're extremely opinionated and in my opinion they 're useless   i ca n't imagine trying to learn about the industry from them but if you want to spend money for news in order to be exposed to the of the industry then either of these is far better than the financial times   despite requiring a subscription the financial times still does not cover the technical details of professional trading instead of trying to learn from news then i would suggest some old favorites and above all else read everything in the navigation box on the right side under financial markets and financial instruments

i would imagine that it goes beyond purpose and also addresses the demographic as a poor credit risk those seeking a post secondary education are a poor credit risk   they are at the beginning of their careers so tend to have low income a short credit history and a very short time of managing money on their own   also many do n't know how to work   this later fact to me is a great predictor of financial success reading into the financial data surrounding student loans it pretty easy to see that this demographic makes poor money decisions   i live near a state university   a large percentage of students drive late model luxury cars frequent expensive bars and restaurants and wear pretty nice clothes   they also graduate with on average 60 k in student loans   keep in mind a 4 year degree could be had for about 30 k and could be paid for working a part time job   and that to me is the wisdom in bank 's decision   sure they will loan you all the money you want with a government guarantee   however once that disappears they will not you money for unnecessary purposes

the problem is that short term trends are really unpredictable   there is nobody who can accurately predict where a fund or even moreso a single stock or bond is going to move in a few hours or days or even months the long term trends of the entire market however are more or less predictable   there is a definite upward bias when you look at time scales of 5 10 20 years and more   individual stocks and bonds may crash and different sectors perform differently from year to year but the market as a whole has historically always risen over long time scales of course past performance never guarantees future performance   it is possible that everything could crash and never come back but history shows that this would be incredibly unlikely   which is the entire basis for strategies based on buying and holding and periodically rebalancing a portfolio containing funds that cover all market sectors now regarding your 401(k you know your time horizon   the laws wo n't let you withdraw money without penalty until you reach retirement age this might be 40 years depending on your current age   so we 're definitely talking long term   you should n't care about where the market goes over a few months if you wo n't be using the money until 20 years from now the most important thing for a 401(k is to choose funds from those available to you that will be as diverse as possible   the actual allocation strategy is something you will need to work out with a financial advisor since it will be different for every person   once you come up with an appropriate allocation strategy you will want to buy according to those ratios with every paycheck and rebalance your funds to those ratios whenever they start to drift away   and review the ratios with your advisor every few years to keep them aligned with large scale trends and changes in your life

your bank will gladly help you convert your indian savings accounts into nro savings accounts you can not change these accounts into nre accounts directly nre accounts are supposed to be funded via deposits made from foreign currency accounts under the liberalized schemes available now you can transfer the money in your regular savings account into your account abroad converting it into foreign currency if you and your ca provide proof to your bank and the reserve bank of india that you have paid all applicable taxes on the money in your savings account and then you can transfer it all back into your nre account perhaps you can combine these two steps into a single one thereby putting the money in your regular savings account into an nre account in one step but i am sure that there will be lots of fees involved e.g. you might get by commissions as well as the exchange rate differential as if you converted indian rupees to us dollars say and then converted the dollars back to rupees just as if you did the two step conversion there are no taxes involved in moving your own money into different accounts but there can be lots of fees and service charges

gt;well first off the roads are more than just hobbies they really do go places a lot of the roads in my area would be unprofitable and people live down those roads what happens when a company decides that road is too expensive to maintain but decides to keep ownership the people have to move   yes if people want to live out somewhere that is inefficient other people who do not choose to live there should n't have to subsidize them i say this having grown up 17 miles from the nearest town in a completely rural environment   gt;it does n't have to but it 's unrealistic to expect that they wo n't take a profit from it but do you really think that if a company has a monopoly they 're going to charge you the bare minimum they can if you have no choice but to pay tolls or for driving passes for certain cities and you can only get them from a single company what motivation does that company have to keep them affordable and readily available they 're going to do like any company would and find that point of maximum profitability between cost of permit and number of permits   is this not a similar situation we currently have with electricity trash and various other pieces of our infrastructure people are not being because there is some level of regulation which is necessary for a functional society i 'm not necessarily advocating a completely free market as monopolies are dangerous i just think the government 's role is to big   gt;then there 's the whole reality that you will still pay for roads you do n't use if one company owns multiple roads they 're going to charge you enough money to expand roads to fix up other dilapidated roads etc more profitable roads will be used to offset less profitable roads etc basically if there 's a new neighborhood and they build a road to it if you 've been paying that company they 're using your money to build that road   not really i 'm paying to use a certain stretch of road right now what the company chooses to do with that money is their issue

there are a few reason why share prices increase or decrease the foremost is expectation of the investors that the company economy will do well not well that is expectation of profit intrinsic value growth over some time frame 1 4 is also demand supply mismatch over usually short time if you really see the actual value of a company is it 's net worth in of shares outstanding which in a way is the book value then all shares should trade at their book value the actual number but it does not the expectation of investors that a share would be purchased by another investor at a higher price because the outlook of the company over a long time is good

if i buy property when the market is in a downtrend the property loses    value but i would lose money on rent anyway so as long i 'm viewing    the property as housing expense i would be ok this is a bit too rough an analysis   it all depends on the numbers you plug in   let 's say you live in the boston area and you buy a house during a downtrend at $   two years later you need to sell it and the best you can get is $   you are down $ 70k and you are also out two years of property taxes maintenance insurance mortgage interest maybe etc   say that 's another $ 10k a year so you are down $ 70k + $ 20k = $ 90k   it 's probably more than that but let 's go with it in those same two years you could have been living in a fairly nice apartment for $   in that scenario you are out $ 2k 24 months = $ 48k and that 's it   it 's a difference of $ 90k $ 48k = $ 42k in two years   that 's sizable if i wanted to sell and upgrade to a larger property the larger    property would also be cheaper in the downtrend yes the general rule is   if you have to spend your money on a purchase it 's best to buy when things are low so you maximize your value    however if the market is in an uptrend selling the property would    gain me more than what i paid but larger houses would also have    increased in price but it may not scale   when you jump to a much larger more expensive house you can think of it as buying 1.5 houses   that extra 0.5 of a house is a new purchase and if you buy when prices are high relative to other economic indicators like salaries and rents you are not doing as well as when you buy when they are low    do both of these scenarios negate the pro cons of buying in either    market i do n't think so   i think in general buying more house either going from an apartment to a house or from a small house to a bigger house when housing is cheaper is favorable   houses are goods like anything else and when supply is high after overproduction of them and demand is low during bad economic times deals can be found relative to other times when the opposite applies or during housing bubbles    the other point is as with any trend you only know the future of the trend after it passes   you do n't know if you are buying at anything close to the bottom of a trend though you can certainly see it is lower than it once was    in terms of practical matters if you are going to buy when it 's up you hope you sell when it 's up too this graph of historical inflation adjusted housing prices is helpful to that point   let me just say that if i bought in the latest boom i sure hope i sold during that boom too

fixed   you are confirming the amount you are going t pay over the term of the loan variable over the total difference over the life of the loan comes to around $ 1200 that is the wrong way to calculate the variable portion the variable is primarily set with a margin over a certain benchmark i.e. fed rate assuming the fed rate does n't change over or only goes lower the variable rate is the one to go if it rises then your payment will increase and the margin they take over the benchmark rate may increase so the total amount you pay might increase too   i would assume a read through the t&cs should clarify that for you is it ever a good idea to choose a variable rate loan only if you think we are in a low interest rate environment i.e. the economy is in and the feds are trying to simulate the economy by decreasing the benchmark rates and you are sure that the lender is n't going to increase his margins if the rate remains low for quite a substantial amount of time and i might assume there will be penalties for paying off a loan quicker

if you 're refinancing a conforming fannie mae or freddie mac mortgage do n't go with an fha try a harp refinance which wo n't increase your mortgage insurance even if your home has lost value harp also limits the risk based pricing adjustments that can be charged so your rate should be very competitive with an fha mortgage even once you get the loan to value ratio down to 80 percent you still have mortgage insurance for several years plus the upfront costs in your case i think it 's a bad deal

the irs has a faq page about hardship distributions from a 401(k the irs defines a hardship in this case as an immediate and heavy financial need of the employee and the amount must be necessary to satisfy the financial need   included in the list of examples is certain expenses for the repair of damage to the employee 's principal residence   however whether your former employer allows this particular reason is up to their plan documents   it sounds like from what you described on the website that your plan does include this reason as a possibility for you next you need to decide if the projects you have in mind qualify as repair of damage   this uses the same rules as the deductible casualty rules found in irs publication which defines a casualty this way a casualty is the damage destruction or loss of property resulting from an identifiable event that is sudden unexpected or unusual a sudden event is one that is swift not gradual or progressive an unexpected event is one that is ordinarily unanticipated and unintended an unusual event is one that is not a day to day occurrence and that is not typical of the activity in which you were engaged examples are given in pub   if the projects you have in mind are necessary due to an event like a flood or a fire it might be allowed   but most home improvement projects would not qualify for this if you 'd like a way to simplify your financial profile an option for you since you no longer work at this employer is to roll over this 401(k into a rollover traditional ira   this way you wo n't have to deal with your former employer anymore   you could pick an ira custodian that you already have another account with if you like and reduce the number of statements that you get   but the ira will not let you take money out without penalty for home improvement projects either

the prices seem very low even considering the risk the prices are low because of the risk nothing happens to the banks if the sovereign defaults however the sovereign debt holders lose some or all the money they lent to that sovereign incidentally many banks invest in the treasury bonds of various countries especially those they 're located in they also invest in other companies that rely on the government or the currency if that dependency is too high the bank may fail if the dependency is not high or non existent the bank will survive if the bank fails yes your shares will be wiped out that 's what happens with bankrupt companies if you considering investing in banks in a country that you think may default research them and see how much investments they have that will be affected by that default

from what i 've read paying down your mortgage above and beyond what you 'd normally pay is indeed an investment but a very poor form of investment in other words you could take that extra money you 'd apply towards your mortgage and put it in something that has a much higher rate of return than a house as an extreme example consider if i took $ 6k extra i would have paid toward my mortgage in a single year and bought a nice performing stock i could see returns of 2x or 3x now that implies i know which stock to pick etcetera i found a mortgage or investment calculator which could be of use as well scroll to bottom to see the summary and whether or not prepay or invest wins for the numbers you plugged in

look at how much tax you paid last year including withholding and any additional amount that might have been due with the tax return look at the instructions for the w-4 form which sets how much tax you want your employer to withhold adjust the numbers on that form until the total withheld during the year is close to what you expect this year 's total to be remember though that there 's no penalty for over withholding but could be for under withholding submit the w-4 form to your employer   remember that we 're a few weeks into the year so even if you adjust withholding now there will have been several paychecks at the prior setting you can try to build that into your of how to reset the withholding or just not worry about it do the same with your state 's withholding adjustments form repeat on a yearly basis to account for raises changes in other income changes in filing status etc until it 's close enough that you 're satisfied with it then reconsider if when your financial situation changes personally i find that exercise more effort than it 's worth and have simply set my withholding at close enough i usually get some money back from the feds and owe some to the state but either is handled happily by my normal bank account balance

you should contact the company and the broker about the ownership do you remember ever selling your position when you look back at your tax forms can you identify the sale it should have been reported to you and you should have reported it to the irs if not then you 're probably still the owner as to k-1 the income reported does n't have to be distributed to you partnership is a pass through entity and can not accumulate earnings for tax purposes everything is deemed distributed if however it is not actually distributed you 're still taxed on the income but it is added to your basis in the partnership and you get the tax back when you sell your position however you pay income tax on the income based on the kind of the income and on the sale at capital gains rates so the amounts added to your position will reduce your capital gains tax but may be taxed at ordinary rates get a professional advice on the issue and what to do next talk to a ea cpa licensed in new york

i am assuming you mean derivatives such as turbo 's or factors when you say derivatives these derivatives are rather popular in european markets in such derivatives a bank borrows the leverage to you and depending on the leverage factor you may own between 50 to + -3 of the underlying value the main catch with such derivatives from stocks as opposed to owning the stock itself are counterpart risk the bank could go bankrupt in which case the derivatives will lose all their value even if the underlying stock is sound or the bank could decide to phase out the certificate forcing you to sell in an undesirable situation spread costs the bank will sell and buy the certificate at a spread price to ensure it always makes a profit the spread can be 1 5 or even 10 pips which can translate to a the bank taking up to 10 of your profits on the spread   price complexity the bank buys and sells the long certificate at a price that is proportional to the price of the underlying value but it usually does so in a rather complex way if the share rises by € 1 the long certificate will also rise but not by € 1 often not even by leverage € 1   the factors that go into determining the price are   are normally documented in the prospectus of the certificate but that may be hard to find on the internet furthermore the bank often makes the calculation complex on purpose to commissions or other kickbacks to itself in it 's certificate prices   double commissions you will have to pay your broker the commission costs for buying the certificate however the bank that issues the derivative certificate normally makes you pay the commission costs they incur by hiding them in the price of the certificate by reducing your effective leverage in effect you pay commissions twice once directly for buying the derivative and once to the bank to allow it to buy the stock   so as havoc p says there is no free lunch the bank makes you pay for the convenience of providing you the leverage in several ways as an alternative futures can also give you leverage but they have different downsides such as margin requirements however even with all the all the drawbacks of such derivative certificates i think that they have enough benefits to be useful for short term investments or speculation

wire transfers are not the same as ach transfers   i regular transfer money between chase ally capital one 360 and fidelity and have never been charged a fee because i never do wire transfers   the default for all these banks is ach you must explicitly choose wire transfers edit to answer the modified question one of the fastest ways to send money is via wire transfer although a wire transfer can take days in most cases a wire transfer takes place within minutes it is a direct bank to bank transaction that allows you to move money from your account directly into the account of someone else while it may seem similar to a wire transfer a transaction accomplished with the help of an automated clearing house ach is not the same thing when you arrange for the electronic transfer of funds all of the information is included in a batch which is then sent to the clearing house all of the transactions in the batch are then handled by the clearing house rather than as a direct bank to bank transaction as a result your money is not available as quickly as it often is with a wire transfer the ach process can be more convenient and is less expensive but it also takes a little bit longer

the choices given are either leave after some reasonable hours or put in endless crunch time until you drop dead   the reality as usual is between those extremes   most people are hired to get a job done   that is likely to require some extra work and if you really care about the job then that is n't really so bad and is not going to scale up to suicidal levels     crunch time as such is increasingly rare because the downsides are so obvious   it generates inferior work and burns out critical assets   at the same time there is no reason to believe that significant professional challenges will necessarily fit neatly into standardized work time arrangements   sometimes difficult problems come up and need to be handled or innovative products wo n't be released in time to make a difference in the marketplace

are auto income generators scams or alternative investment channels i would n't go so far as to say that these are scams so much as grossly exaggerated marketing claims if it sounds too good to be true then it usually is auto auto income generator for example hosts a site that you can use to produce revenue from ads in order to get enough traffic to generate the amount of income they promise you have to put in a lot of work hardly making it automatic i ca n't find anything on auto bit coin builder however they promise to pay out an outrageously high fixed return with vague descriptions about investments this is purely speculation since there is not very much information about this small site but it may be a pyramid or ponzi scheme they promise a return higher than traditional investments offer extra incentives for referrals and offer a list of excuses for why funds may be pending even though the transfer happens instantly on their end the fact that they only deal in may also be an attempt to remain anonymous

as others have said this opinion is predicated on an assumption that early in your life you have no need to actually use the money so you are able to take advantage of compounding interest because the money is going to be there for many many years and you are far more tolerant of loss because you can simply wait for the markets to recover this is absolutely true of a pension pot which is locked away for a great many years but it is absolutely not true of general investments someone in the to is very likely to want to spend that money on say buying a house in which case losing 10 of your deposit 3 months before you start looking for a house could potentially be a disaster in your if your child 's school college fund goes up in smoke that 's a big deal it is a very commonly espoused theory but i think it is also fundamentally flawed in many scenarios

stated plainly it 's a benefit companies are not required to offer you any compensation above paying you minimum wage but benefits attract higher quality employees   i think a big part of it is that it is the norm employees want it because of the tax benefits employees expect it because almost all reputable companies of any significant size offer it you could run a great company but if you do n't offer a 401k plan you can scare away good potential employees it would give a bad impression the same way that not offering health insurance would

i wrote about this in another answer you can sell the scrip dividend in the market the capital gain from this sale may fall below the annual tax free allowance for capital gains in which case you do n't pay any capital gains tax on that amount for a cash dividend however there is n't a minimum taxable amount so you would owe dividend tax on the entire dividend and may therefore pay more taxes on a cash dividend since you have n't sold the shares in the market yet you have n't earned any income on the shares you do n't owe taxes on the scrip until you sell the shares and earn capital gains on them hmrc is very explicit about this in it is quite common for a company particularly a quoted company to offer its shareholders the option of receiving additional shares instead of a cash dividend the expression ` stock or scrip dividend is used to describe shares issued in such circumstances the basic position under tax law is that when a company makes a bonus issue of shares no distribution arises and the bonus issue of shares is not income for tax purposes in the hands of the recipient obviously if this is an issue for you talk to a tax professional to make sure you get it right

reading irs regulations section more closely i see that this was a contingent payment sale with a stated maximum selling price therefore at the time of filing prior years there was no way of knowing the final contingent payment would not be reached and thus the prior years were filed correctly and should not be amended those regulations go on to give an example of a sale with a stated maximum selling price where the maximum was not reached due to contingency and states that in such cases when the maximum payment amount is subsequently reduced the gross profit ratio will be with respect to payments received in or after the taxable year in which an event requiring reduction occurs however in this case that would result in a negative gross profit ratio on line 19 of form which turbo tax reports should be a non negative number   looking further in the regulations i found an example which relates to bankruptcy and a resulting loss in a subsequent year for 1992 a will report a loss of $ 5 million attributable to the sale taken at the time determined to be appropriate under the rules generally applicable to worthless debts therefore i used a gross profit ratio of zero on line 19 and entered a separate stock sale not reported on a 1099-b as a worthless stock on form 8949 as a capital loss based upon the remaining basis in the stock sold in an installment sale   i also included an explanatory statement with my return to the irs stating in 2008 i entered into an installment sale of stock the sale was a contingent payment sale with a stated maximum selling price the sales price did not reach the agreed upon maximum sales price due to some contingencies not being met according to the irs    regulations section my basis in the stock remains at $ 500 in 2012 after the final payment rather than using a negative gross profit ratio on line 19 of form i 'm using a zero ratio and treating the remaining basis as a schedule d loss similar to worthless stock since the sale is now complete and my remaining basis is no longer recoverable

at any given time there are buy orders and there are sell orders   typically there is a little bit of space between the lowest sell order and the highest buy order this is known as the bid ask spread   as an example say person a will sell for $ 10.10 but person b will only buy at $ 10.00   if you have a billion shares outstanding just the space between the bid and ask prices represents $ 100,000,000 of market cap now imagine that the ceo is in the news related to some embezzlement investigation   a number of buyers cancel their orders   now the highest buy order is $ 7   there is n't money involved that 's just the highest offer to buy at the time but that 's a drop from $ 10 to $ 7   that 's a change in market cap of $   some seller thinks the stock will continue to fall and some buyer thinks the stock has reached a fair enterprise value at $ 7 billion $ 7 per share   whether or not the seller lost money depends on where the seller bought the stock   maybe they bought when it was an ipo for $ 1   even at $ 7 they made $ 6 per share value is changing not money   though it would be fun there 's no money at the nyse

first you need to ensure that you are not violating any federal child labor laws i would look at this u.s. dept of labor wage hour div standards for and 15-year olds in employment these were the items that to federal law for 14 year olds 14 is the minimum age for employment in specified occupations outside    of school hours for limited periods of time each day and each week    and 15-year olds may not be employed there is a section on minimum allowed wage payment to young workers and also a list of allowed types of work for 14 and 15 year old 's the type of household helper tasks described definitely fell within what was allowed for child labor the same page details what sort of forms need to be filled out i think this is something that is done quite commonly here are specifics in new york state for minimum wage for minors and for employing 14 year olds

for a non etf mutual fund you can only buy shares of the mutual fund from the mutual fund itself at a price that the mutual fund will reveal only at the end of the day and can only shares back to the mutual fund again at a price that the mutual fund will reveal only at the end of the day there is no open market in the sense that you can not put in a bid to buy say 100 shares of vfinx at $ per share through a brokerage and if there is a seller willing to sell 100 shares of vfinx to you at $ then the sale is and you are now the proud owner of 100 shares of vfinx the only buyer or seller of vfinx is the mutual find itself and you tell it that you want to buy 100 shares of vfinx and please take the money out of my checking account if this order is entered before the markets close at 4 pm the mutual fund determines its share price as of the end of the day opens a new account for you and puts 100 shares of vfinx in it or adds 100 shares of vfinx to your already existing pile of shares and takes the purchase price out of your checking account via an ach transfer similarly for redeeming selling shares of vfinx that you own and these are held in an account at the mutual fund itself not by your brokerage you tell the mutual fund to that you wish to redeem 100 shares and please send the proceeds to my bank account and the mutual fund does this at the end of the day and the money appears in your bank account via ach transfer two or three days later   generally these transactions do not need to be for round lots of multiples of 100 shares for efficiency most mutual fund will gladly sell you fractional shares down to a of a share in contrast shares of an exchange traded fund etf are just like stock shares in that they can be bought and sold on the open market and your broker will charge you fees for buying and selling them selling fractional shares on the open market is generally not possible and trading in round lots is less expensive also trades occur at all times of the stock exchange day not just at the end of the day as with non etf funds and the price can fluctuate during the day too many non etf mutual funds have an etf equivalent voo is the symbol for vanguard 's s&p 500 index etf while vfinx is the non etf version of the same index fund   read more about the differences between etfs and mutual funds for example here

first of all there are some differences between the retirement accounts that you mentioned regarding taxes   traditional ira and 401(k accounts allow you to make pre tax contributions giving you an immediate tax deduction when you contribute   roth ira roth 401(k are funded with after tax money and a non retirement account is of course also funded with after tax money   so if you are looking for the immediate tax deduction this is a point in favor of the retirement accounts roth ira roth 401(k accounts allow the investment to grow tax free which means that the growth is not taxed even when taking the investment out at retirement   with traditional ira and 401(k accounts you need to pay tax on the gains realized in the account when you withdraw the money just as you do with a non retirement account   this is a point in favor of the roth retirement accounts to answer your question about capital gains yes it is true that you do not have a capital gain until an investment is sold   so discounting the contribution tax deductions of the retirement accounts if you only bought individual stocks that never paid a dividend and never sold them until retirement you are correct that it really would n't matter if you had it in a regular brokerage account or in a traditional ira   however even people dedicated to buy and hold rarely actually buy only individual stocks and hold them for 30 years there are several different circumstances that will generally happen in the time between now and when you want to withdraw the money in retirement that would be taxable events if you are not in a retirement account if you sell an investment and buy a different one the gains would be taxable if you want to rebalance your holdings this also involves selling a portion of your investments   for example if you want to maintain an 80 bond ratio and your stock values have gone up to 90 you might want to sell some stock and buy bonds   or if you are getting closer to retirement you might decide to go with a higher percentage of bonds   this would trigger capital gains inside a mutual fund anytime the management sells investments inside the fund and realizes capital gains these gains are passed on to the investors and are taxable   this happens more often with managed funds than index funds but still happens occasionally with index funds dividends earned by the investments are taxable   any of these events in a non retirement account would trigger taxes that need to be paid immediately even if you do n't withdraw a cent from your account

there are only two things you can directly do with the money in an amazon gift card you can keep the gift card or you can put the money into your amazon account   there are n't any other options   you ca n't deposit the value into a bank account or anything like that   so as far as safety those are the only options you need to consider because there 's nothing else you can do okay there is one other thing you can do you could sell the card to someone else or barter it for something you want   but you can do that with anything the gift card is just a string of numbers and letters that you put into your amazon account and it credits you with the appropriate amount of money   so yes it can be stolen   if you have n't redeemed it yet someone could find the code by hacking your email or looking over your shoulder or whatever   if they redeem it you wo n't be able to do so as for your edit if i do n't transfer the balance of the amazon card to my amazon account can i transfer the balance to other accounts or use the card to buy other gift cards if you do n't transfer it to your account you can transfer the balance to another account by giving the code to someone else and letting them deposit it in their account   you still wo n't be able to buy other gift cards with it because you ca n't buy anything with it until it 's deposited in an amazon account and once it 's deposited in an amazon account you ca n't buy gift cards with it because of their policy if you do n't want the restrictions imposed by amazon do n't buy amazon gift cards instead just use your actual money to buy things   if you 're worried about the cards being stolen just deposit them into your account right away and you eliminate the risk of them being stolen   if as you say you bought the cards for yourself there 's no reason not to do this presumably you bought them so you could buy things on amazon and you 'll have to deposit them into your account eventually anyway to do that so just put them in right away i do n't know specifically how walmart cards work but i assume they 're the same   in general anything called a gift card offered by a particular retailer works the same way you ca n't do anything with it except buy products at that retailer the only thing that really makes amazon different is that the only way to use your card is to add the money to your amazon account because the only way to pay for things on amazon is with an amazon account   there 's no way to spend just some of the value you have to deposit it all into your account   with gift cards for retailers with physical locations you can usually use the value up piecemeal by actually going to a store and spending just enough to buy something   i assume walmart works this way although i do n't know if you can use an e gift card this way there

the simple answer is there are many ways for trades to take place   some systems use order matching software that employs proprietary algorithms for deciding the order of processing others use fifo structures and so on   some brokerages may fill customer orders out of their own accounts which happens more frequently than you might imagine and others put their orders into the system for the market makers to handle   there 's no easy all encompassing answer to your question but it 's still a good one to ask by the way asking if the market is fair is a bit naive because fairness depends on what side of the trade you came out on grin   if your limit order did n't get filled and you missed out on an opportunity that 's always going to seem unfair right

read again what i said in my original post   enterprise value is the sort of bare bones total firm value it does n't include any cash because you 'd basically be paying cash for cash also this makes analysis of transaction multiples more streamlined as some firms may have a ton of excess cash on their balance sheet skewing multiples   i said that that is why we use enterprise value because if you did n't it would skew multiples

if you withdraw 401 k then 10 penalty is applied also the amount you withdraw is considered as income for that year whether you go back to india or not the amount is considered income depending on the reason you state during withdraw the income tax default 10 might be withheld note sometime they may not withhold tax if you are relocating to india as per international tax rule between india us when filing tax in india then you are supposed to show this as income the 401 k amount and pay tax according to the total income including amount earned in india could be upto 30 if there was tax withheld in us you can show it as international tax paid and pay the difference between 10 and your tax rate upto 30 if you are relocating to india but still filing in us it 's possible then 401 k amount will be taxed at us tax rate could be upto 35   in either case filing in india or us the amount withheld can be shown as tax paid but yet you will pay the tax difference could be 20 or 25 more as per the income for that year you are not supposed to pay tax in two countries for the same year as per regulations might end up with audit in both country hope it helps

if you ended at your second paragraph no it 's simply a refund of your own money same as any time i get any cash back whether due to a credit card reward program or price match   but your 4th paragraph changes this yes you owe tax as it 's clearly not your own money coming back even barter income is taxable   per the new comments appearing this is not a case of bartering i cited bartering as an understandable example of when there 's no cash and yet tax is owed in this situation value is received and it counts as income similar to the barter situations   just because the value is n't in cash does n't negate the tax due i 'd ask how op pays his rent mortgage utilities cell phone bill etc the answer is simple non traditional income as op puts it has a tax due

you 'll own whatever fraction you bought to own the company as in yes or no you need to buy 100 of the outstanding stock re controlling the company in general the answer is yes although the mechanism for this might not be so straight forward ie you may have to appoint board members and may only be able to do so at pre set intervals and there may be conditions in the company charter designed to stop this happening depending on your jurisdiction certain ownership percentages can also trigger the need to do certain things so you may not be able to just buy 50 in australia when you reach 20 ownership you have to launch a formal takeover bid

futures are immediate settlement and your money is available as soon as you close out your position
# 357324
cart 's answer is basically correct but i 'd like to elaborate a futures contract both the buyer of a contract and the seller of a contract to conduct the underlying transaction settle at the agreed upon future date and price written into the contract aside from settlement the only other way either party can get out of the transaction is to initiate a closing transaction which means   the party that sold the contract buys back another similar contract to close his position   the party that bought the contract can sell the contract on to somebody else whereas an option contract provides the buyer of the option with the choice of completing the transaction   because it 's a choice the buyer can choose to walk away from the transaction if the option exercise price is not attractive relative to the underlying stock price at the date written into the contract   when an option buyer walks away the option is said to have expired however and this is the part i think needs the original seller writer of the option contract does n't have a choice   if a buyer chooses to exercise the option contract the seller wrote the seller is obligated to conduct the transaction   in such a case the seller 's option contract is said to have been assigned   only if the buyer chooses not to exercise does the seller 's obligation go away   before the option expires the option seller can close their position by initiating a closing transaction   but the seller ca n't simply walk away like the option buyer can

in other amazing news people do n't pay attention to things they do n't care about   want to make sure people pay attention during meetings ensure the people in attendance actually have a good reason to care about the subject matter have a say in it and then keep it focused and short most meetings do n't follow these guidelines and far too many of them are largely just chances for a few people to herd a lot of people into a room so they can feel self important while talking   when planning a meeting first ask yourself if you could n't simply write an email or publish a document that covers the same material if the answer is no then ask yourself who really needs to be in the meeting to give input and who can be given a summary amp chance to ask a few questions after the fact and do just as well as if they 'd attended   i ca n't count the number of important mandatory meetings i 've taken part in where my biggest contribution was simply checking in in the first place without fail every one of them could 've been handled without me there summarized in a brief email and would have left dozens of man hours of labor

first it 's not always the case that etfs have lower expenses than the equivalent mutual funds   for example in the vanguard family of funds the expense ratio for the etf version is the same as it is for the admiral share class in the mutual fund version   with that in mind the main advantages of a mutual fund over an equivalent etf are from a long term investor 's point of view the main disadvantage of mutual funds relative to etfs is the minimum account sizes   especially if the fund has multiple share classes i.e. where better classes get lower expense ratios you might have to have quite a lot of money invested in the fund in order to get the same expense ratio as the etf    there are some other differences that matter to more active investors e.g. intraday trading options etc but for a passive investor the ones above are the major ones   apart from those mutual funds and etfs are pretty similar   personally i prefer mutual funds because i 'm at a point where the fund minimums are n't really an issue and i do n't want to deal with the more aspects of etfs for investors just starting out the lower minimum investment for an etf is a big win as long as you can get commission free trades which is what i 've assumed above

keeping your big emergency fund in stocks if you have 12 months income saved is ok    however you should keep your small emergency fund in cash    however i find that even my stock broker accounts have some cash in them as i like to let the dividends build up enough to make the dealing charges worthwhile   you do n’t wish to be forced to sell at a bad time due to your boiler needing replacing or your car breaking down      however if you lost your job in the same week that your boiler broke down and your car needed replacing then being forced to sell stocks at a bad time is not much of an issue also if you are saving say 1/3 of your income each month and you have a credit card with large unused credit limit that is paid of each month then most small emergency that are under 2/3 of your monthly income can be covered on the credit card with little or no interest charges one option is to check you bank balance on the day after you are paid and if it is more than 2x your monthly income then move some of it to long term savings but only if you tend to spend a lot less then you earn most months

while i can appreciate you 're coming from a strongly held philosophy i disagree strongly with it   i do not have any 401k or ira i do n't like that you need to rely on government and keep the money there forever a 401k and an ira allows you to work within the irs rules to allow your gains to grow tax free additionally traditional 401ks and iras allow you to deduct income from your taxes meaning you pay less taxes missing out on these benefits because the rules that established them were created by the irs is very very misguided do you refuse to drive a car because you philosophically disagree with speed limits   i am planning on spending 20k on a new car paying cash paying cash for a new car when you can very likely finance it for under 2 means you are loosing the opportunity to invest that money which can conservatively expect 4 returns annually if invested additionally using dealership financing can often be additional leverage to negotiate a lower purchase price   if for some reason you have bad credit or are unable to secure a loan for under 4 paying cash might be reasonable   the best thing you have going for you is your low monthly expenses that is   if early retirement is your goal you should consider housing expenses as a part of your overall plan but i would strongly suggest you start investing that money in stocks instead of a single house especially when you can rent for such a low rate a 3 fund portfolio is a classic and simple way to get a diverse portfolio that should see returns in good years and stability in bad years you can read more about them here you should never invest in individual stocks people make lots of money to professionally guess what stocks will do better than others and they are still very often wrong you should purchase what are sometimes called stocks but are really very large funds that contain an assortment of stocks blended together you should also purchase bonds which again are not individual bonds but a blend of the entire bond market   if you want to be very aggressive in your portfolio go with 100 80 stocks the remainder in bonds if you are nearing retirement you should be the inverse 100 80 bonds the remainder stocks   the rule of thumb is that you need 25 times your yearly expenses including taxes but minus pension or social security income invested before you can retire since you 'll be retiring before age 65 you wo nt be getting social security and will need to provide your own health insurance

i 've given up on trying to understand how the allowances correspond to my number of dependents    what i do instead to achieve the same end goal of having the right amount of money withheld is using a paycheck calculator if i get paid 24 times a year twice a month and i figure i 'm going to owe about $ 6,000 of taxes then every paycheck needs to have $ 250 of federal tax withheld from it to make sure i am covered go to the paycheck calculator and play with the allowance numbers until you get $ 250 as the federal tax withheld and then submit a new w4 to your employer this is the only reliable way i 've found to figure this out on my own   because my calculations are done in dollars instead of exemptions etc and my taxes do not wildly fluctuate year to year this works well for me

to issue corporate grade bonds the approval process very nearly matches that for issuing corporate equity you must register with the sec and then generally there is a initial debt offering similar to an ipo i say similar in terms of the process itself but the actual sale of bonds is nothing like that for equities it would be rare for a partnership to be that large as to issue debt in the form of bonds although there are some that are pretty big but i suppose it is possible as long as they want to file with the sec    beyond that a business could privately place bonds with a large investor but there is still registration requirements with the sec   all that being said it is also pretty rare for public bonds to be issued by a company that does n't already have public equity and the amounts we are talking about here are huge the most common trade in corporate debt is a round lot of 100,000 so this is n't something a small corporation would have access to or have a need for generally financing for a smaller business comes from a bank

this is a simple solution because you do n't have to monitor a person 's trades over time or even their frequency implementing this in the modern computer exchanges seems trivial to me asking an exchange to monitor each trader 's trades to ensure no hfts seems full of loopholes ask a computer to execute hfts across multiple trader ids for example and i think is a distraction suggestion   the reason that i think these taxes do n't get is as correctly states these taxes empower the government which is something that a lot of political players republicans libertarians and anarchists do n't want i have always wondered what would happen if these fees were imposed by the government implemented by the exchanges but all money went to say the american red cross i think that that would be a pretty good idea   finally i also want to mention that the government plays a large role in markets already for example enforcing contracts managing and preventing fraud are all things that the government does to ensure that markets work well this is another simple thing the the government can do to reduce market uncertainty and make our financial markets work better

yes it is a very good idea to start your credit history early   it sounds like you have a good understanding of the appropriate use of credit as a substitute for cash rather than a supplement to income   as long as you keep your expenses under control and pay off your card each month i see no problems with the idea try to find a card with no annual fees a low interest rate if possible which will be difficult at your age and with some form of rewards such as cash back   look for a reputable issuing bank and keep the account open even after you get a new card down the road   your credit score is positively correlated with having an account open for a long time having a good credit usage to credit limit ratio and having accounts in good standing and paid on time

strategy would be my top factor   while this may be implied i do think it helps to have an idea of what is causing the buy and sell signals in speculating as i 'd rather follow a strategy than try to figure things out completely from scratch that does n't quite make sense to me there are generally a couple of different schools of analysis that may be worth passing along fundamental analysis fundamental analysis of a business involves analyzing its financial statements and health its management and competitive advantages and its competitors and markets when applied to futures and forex it focuses on the overall state of the economy interest rates production earnings and management when analyzing a stock futures contract or currency using fundamental analysis there are two basic approaches one can use bottom up analysis and top down analysis the term is used to distinguish such analysis from other types of investment analysis such as quantitative analysis and technical analysis technical analysis in finance technical analysis is a security analysis methodology for forecasting the direction of prices through the study of past market data primarily price and volume behavioral economics and quantitative analysis use many of the same tools of technical analysis which being an aspect of active management stands in contradiction to much of modern portfolio theory the efficacy of both technical and fundamental analysis is disputed by the efficient market hypothesis which states that stock market prices are essentially unpredictable there are tools like stock screeners that will let you filter based on various criteria to use each analysis in a mix   there are various strategies one could use   wikipedia under stock speculator lists several different types of stock trading strategies or approaches exist including day trading trend following market making scalping trading momentum trading trading the news and arbitrage   thus i 'd advise research what approach are you wanting to use as the make it up as we go along losing real money all the way would n't be my suggested approach there is something to be said for there being numerous and newsletter if you want other ideas but i would suggest having a strategy before putting one 's toe in the water

if you 've already used turbotax on your 2015 taxes you can use the numbers turbotax gave you as your reasonable estimate   line 4 is your estimate of total tax liability for 2015 this would be line 63 of form 1040 this is federal income tax only not social security tax   line 5 is the total of tax payments you made last year you should be able to read this off your w-2 forms box 2 it corresponds to line 74 on the 1040   line 6 is the difference between lines 4 and 5 you ca n't claim a refund on the extension so if line 5 is more than line 4 enter 0 otherwise subtract line 5 from line 4 and enter it in line 6 this is the amount you should send in with the form to minimize any penalty due with your taxes later   the turbotax software can generate this extension form automatically i believe   also do n't forget to give a copy of this extension form to your tax preparer he will need to know the amount you sent in

no danger you can get in a car accident break your leg or otherwise wind up in the hospital like anyone else   you can also get the money back with a tax penalty but you probably will never need to if you are responsible and live within your means do you need a wake up call about what things can cost   i knew a college student who broke his leg and did n't buy the health insurance    he had to have a rod put in his leg and it was   obviously he did n't have the money and the hospital agreed to put him on some kind of payment plan   i suppose bankruptcy was an alternative but either way not a great way to start out in life    any time you can defer payment of tax for decades or buy something with pre income tax money it is like instantly earning 20 or more on your money   i believe you can pay for and dental out of an hsa as well   so i would n't go overboard on an hsa or ira if you have big credit card debts if you do have room for savings it is dumb not to be putting money in the hsa and ira/401k take a look at hsa bank for a low fee home for your money they pay interest on over $ 3,000 but like most banks not much   the fees for being under $ 3k are currently around $ 2 a month   do n't worry about investing the hsa money until you have like $ 10,000 in there which will be a while

the reason diversification in general is a benefit is easily seen in your first graph   while the purple line betterment 100 stock is always below the blue line s&p and the blue line is the superior return over the entire period it 's a bit different if you retired in 2009 is n't it   in that case the orange line is superior because its risk is much lower so it did n't drop much during the major crash   lowering risk and lowering return is a benefit the closer you get to retirement as you wo n't see as big a cumulative return from the large percentage but you could see a big temporary drop and need your income to be relatively stable if you 're living off it or soon going to    now you can certainly invest on your own in a diverse way and if you 're reasonably smart about it and have enough funds to avoid any fees you can almost certainly do better than a managed solution even a relatively lightly managed solution like betterment   they take .15 off the top so if you just did exactly the same as them you would end up .15 per year better off however not everyone is reasonably smart and not everyone has much in the way of funds betterment 's target audience are people who are n't terribly smart about investing and/or have very small amounts of funds to invest   plenty of people are n't able to work out how to do diversification on their own while they probably mostly are n't asking questions on this site they 're a large percentage of the population   it 's also work to diversify your portfolio you have to make minor changes every year at a minimum to ensure you have a nicely balanced portfolio   this is why target retirement date portfolios are very popular a bit higher cost similar to betterment roughly but no work required to diversify correctly and maintain that diversification

i agree that high volatility just means the underlying stock price fluctuates more and it does not imply if the stock is going up or down but a high volatility in the price of an underlying also means that there is a higher chance that the underlying price could reach extreme prices albeit in either direction however if you purchased a call option then if the underlying price reached an extremely high value then you will be rewarded but if the underlying price reached an extremely low value you wo n't lose any more than the initial premium that you paid there is no additional risk on your side it 's capped to the premium that you paid for the call option it 's this asymmetric outcome heads i win tails i do n't lose combined with high volatility that means that call options will increase in value when the underlying price becomes more volatile if the optionality was n't there then the price would n't be related to the volatility of the underlying but that would be called a future or a forward

prop proprietary traders trade using huge amounts of a bank 's money i.e. other people 's money so the reason why they have such low commissions and they certainly do is that the firms for which they work negotiate low commissions as the quantities and volumes as they also trade very frequently will be high and so the total commission will be very high there is no such thing as a prop trading account unless you are a big bank with a very large bank roll tens of millions of usd so you can not open one to enjoy those benefits unless you have enough money that you can negotiate your commission with brokers 25k cad is definitely not enough money to even start a conversation about those sorts of commissions note prop traders are generally banned from trading intraday with their own money by their employers and the law as it is a massive conflict of interests those who do and get caught face lengthy prison sentences

as i understand it a company raises money by sharing parts of it ownership to people who buy stocks from it   it 's not ownership in quotes it 's ownership in a non ironic way   you own part of the company   if the company has 100 million shares outstanding you own of it per share it 's small but you 're an owner   in most cases you also get to vote on company issues as a shareholder though non voting shares are becoming a thing   after the initial share offer you 're not buying your shares from the company you 're buying your shares from an owner of the company   the company does n't control the price of the shares or the shares themselves i get that some stocks pay dividends and that as these change the price of the stock may change accordingly the company pays a dividend not the stock   the company is distributing earnings to it 's owners your proportion of the earnings are equal to your proportion of ownership   if you own a single share in the company referenced above you would get $ 1 in the case of a $ 100,000,000 dividend of the dividend for your ownership stake i do n't get why the price otherwise goes up or down why demand changes with earnings and speculation on earnings   companies are generally valued based on what they will be worth in the future    what do the prospects look like for this industry   a company that only makes typewriters probably became less valuable as computers became more   was a new law just passed that would hurt our ability to operate   did a new competitor enter the industry to force us to change prices in order to stay competitive   if we have to charge less for our product it stands to reason our earnings in the future will be similarly reduced    so what if the company 's making more money now than it did when i bought the share presumably the company would then be more valuable none of that is filtered my way as a part owner   yes it is as a dividend or in the case of a company not paying a dividend you 're rewarded by an appreciating value why should the value of the shares change a multitude of reasons generally revolving around the company 's ability to profit in the future

# 598646
from intuit yes but there are limits losses on your investments are first used to offset capital gains of the same type so short term losses are first deducted against short term gains and long term losses are deducted against long term gains net losses of either type can then be deducted against the other kind of gain if you have an overall net capital loss for the year you can deduct up to $ 3,000 of that loss against other kinds of income including your salary for example and interest income any excess net capital loss can be carried over to subsequent years to be deducted against capital gains and against up to $ 3,000 of other kinds of income so in your case take the loss now if you have short term gains   also take it if you want to take a deduction on your salary but this maxes at 3k but you can keep using an additional 3k each year into the future until its all used up there is n't really an advantage to a long term loss right now since long term rates are lower than short term rates

wyoming is a good state for this it is inexpensive and annual compliance is minimal although delaware has the best advertising campaign so people know about it the reality is   that there are over 50 states jurisdictions in the united states with their own competitive incorporation laws to attract investment as well as their own legislative bodies that change those laws so you just have to read the laws to find a state that is favorable for you what i mean is that whatever delaware does to get in the news about its easy business laws has been and done even better by other states by this point in time and regarding delaware 's court all other states in the union can also lean on delaware case law so this perk is not unique to delaware wyoming is cheaper than delaware for nominal presence in the united states requires less information then delaware and is also tax free a registered agent can get you set up and you can find one to help you with the address dilemma this should only cost $ 99 $ 200 over the state fees an llc does not need to have an address in the united states but many registered agents will let you use their address just ask many kinds of businesses still require a bank account for domestic and global trade many do n't require any financial intermediary any more to receive payments but if you do need this then opening a bank account in the united states will be more difficult again the registered agent or lawyer can get a tax identification number for you from the irs and this will be necessary to open a us bank account   but it is more likely that you will need an employee or nominee director in the united states to go in person to a bank and open an account this person needs to be mentioned in the operating agreement or other official form on the incorporation documents they will simply walk into a bank with your articles of incorporation and operating agreement showing that they are authorized to act on behalf of the entity and open a bank account they then resign and this is a private document between the llc and the employee but you will be able to receive and accept payments and access the global financial system now a lot of multinational entities set up subsidiaries in a number of countries this way

yes it 's unreasonable to think the prices will drop 10 20 in that time frame   housing prices are not an equation that can can be solved to home prices are x% overvalued you have 3 answers so far 's prices are inversely proportional to rates rob 's there 's no strong correlation between interest rates and house prices and mb 's rising interest rates create downward pressure on housing prices any research into price history had better take every other variable into account articles that look at rates vs price do n't always address a key item income say we agree that the data show your city to be 10 too high but if sellers like their high price and have some dig my heels in power prices wo n't drop the seller simply stays put and the supply demand curves result not in a lower price but in less supply and the effect is to change the demographic of that area i.e. attracting higher income earners   rob linked to an article with a nice set of charts one chart showing the yr fixed rate and real house prices what results is a chart that can refute the relationship between rates and prices but that would ignore an historical point that 's too important to forget the tumble that started in jan 06 had nothing to do with the 30 year rate it was the result of a series of insane financial products including interest only option arms which permitted buyers to get approved for a purchase based on a payment that was n't fixed and would change to a fully amortizing mortgage at a higher rate that was unaffordable a product that was a financial time bomb canada banks offered no such product and when the us market got canada experienced a mild cold with respect to any answers that offer us centric data to prove any hypothesis i do n't feel such comparisons are appropriate   correlations and the data used to prove them are an interesting thing i can suggest that you take the us 30 year rate along with our median income or rather 25 of monthly median income calculate the mortgage that results this translates nicely to the home a median family can afford and i claim that long term this is the equilibrium price of that median home but supply demand has another factor or the more technical term of demand this means that for example a 10 increase in the price of cigarettes does not cause a 10 drop in consumption each and every good has its own elasticity and in the case of housing a rise in cost would certainly impact the marginal buyers but others will simply adjust their budgets not all buyers were planning to hit the bank 's limit on what they could afford so the rise does n't change their mind just their budget   last i know that canada does not have a 30 year mortgage most common is a 5 year rate with 30 year amortization correction clarification anyone the effect of this is less volatility in the market since i believe your rates are not poised for the 2.5 to 4 jump implied by another response small increases can be absorbed   in a beautiful coincidence the federal reserve board sent me a link to the interest rate elasticity of mortgage demand evidence from at the conforming loan limit it 's a bit long but a worthwhile look at how the correlation is n't as instant as some might think

typically your statement will break down each of the balances that carry a different rate so you 'll see them lumped into the 0 line or two separates lines with different rates for each if you do n't see it on the statement a quick call to your bank should clarify it for you if i had to guess i would lean towards the fee likely being at 0 also but if it is n't typically you would pay the minimum + $ 350 on your next statement because only amounts over the minimum go towards principal of the highest rates first at least this is true in the us for personal accounts of course this is something your bank should be able to clarify as well balance transfer tip i always recommend setting up automatic payments when you take advantage of a balance transfer offer the reason is oftentimes buried deeply in the terms and conditions is an evil phrase which says that if you miss a payment they have the right to revoke the promotional rate and start charging you a higher rate that would be bad enough if it happened but to make things worse i believe the fee you paid for the transfer is not returned to you so set up an auto payment each month for at least the minimum payment and if you can afford it divide the total transferred by the number of months and pay that amount each month assuming you do n't pay interest on the fee $ 17,500 1.02 18 = $ month that way you 'll have it paid off just in time to not have any higher interest when the promotional rate expires if you do n't know if you can afford the higher amount each month set it to the max you know for sure you can afford and make additional payments whenever you can

i do n't know how fast are wire transfers between bank accounts in the us but here in europe we can have them in under an hour usually for an extra fee during bank working hours so you could take a laptop with internet connection to the transaction make a wire transfer and wait that hour drinking coffee for the transfer to arrive before handing the keys and papers and the buyer driving away

the thing to look at is paypal 's service which is a pretty neat little item   when you sign up for a account totally free you create a unique username   so for example my account name is   i can give someone the following web link to send me $ 500 if you click the link above you 'll see what the user sees my company name is salt river networks inc.   i gave a live link so you can see the working example of it no need for anyone to send money chuckle i can change the amount by simply changing the value at the end of the url when they go to that link they see a landing page with your name on it and the amount to send to you then they go through the normal process of paying via paypal it 's a pretty neat service and i 've used to it bill a few clients for work i 've done by emailing that link to them rather than going through the whole paypal procedure

genetics and the environment you were raised in are entirely determined by luck developed from both of these are all of your traits preferences psychology and personal philosophy through nurturing acceptance enlightened exposure or rebellion taking responsibility for your actions and in actions is what you did    you have preferences to be convincing hard working and good at whatever it is you do broker all of these things are marketable and in line with a good strategy for our western capitalist culture and the modern state of human nature all of these things build up your sense of self and have you feel empowered and guess what having confidence is also a desirable trait    so lets say we take one of these traits away through the result of your upbringing and your genetics you are no longer examples genetics child abuse constant verbally abusive parents etc luck of the draw i would n't say that is the child 's fault for being in that situation would you so now you are not and you can not network effectively there goes your career how unlucky

most of them use ta or hopeful to bet on if you wanted to get into crypto from a solid fundamental base it 's probably too late most of the returns if any do n't match up to their valuation and pretty much all of them are in some form of beta people are smelling the possible revolution that the underlying blockchain technology may bring to our current systems but are blockchain tech with the themselves   for correlation it 's not very sophisticated but think of each as a company and you can draw lots of parallels you can evaluate their returns from their whitepaper underlying technology potential market share their team market sentiment comparison with other similar also look at bubble markets in other technological revolutions industry threats potential   it 's not impossible to make money if the dotcom bubble is anything to go by there is clear precedent for survivors to thrive it 's more of a question of do you understand how everything works well enough to predict the survivors if there even are going to be any

401(k withdrawals early or otherwise are not subject to fica or medicare taxes   that 's because they already were taxed when they were contributed   and of course the earnings from the 401(k contributions are not earned income and thus are not subject to payroll taxes for that reason while 401(k contributions are exempt from federal and generally state income taxes they are n't exempt from payroll taxes and as such you 'll see two separate amounts on your w2 and paystub if you contributed the amount that is subject to those taxes and the amount that is subject to income tax so no you do n't have to pay payroll fica social security taxes on your early withdrawal   as for the penalty that is basically an extra tax so if you withdraw $ 1000 you pay income tax at your marginal rate plus 10 penalty if your marginal rate is 25 and you 're not moving across a rate step boundary you will pay +

what no not at all not even a little bit the argument made in his book is that political elites were looking for easy fixes to stagnant wages at the bottom which were caused by large scale forces like globalization and information tech but those problems are hard to deal with so they let them eat credit they lowered home loan standards and gave them govt guarantees in order to give them higher standards of living and of course it collapsed i think his views are different than krugman who i would guess would actually be supportive of such an absurd idea least do a cursory search before making a cynical self comment
