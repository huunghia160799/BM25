in the us this was the case during the 19th century there was a system of subscriptions between banks where larger banks backed the smaller banks to some extent in trade notes from distant banks were not accepted or discounted relative to known local banks or silver gold coinage there were a number of problems with this system which came to a head during the panic of 1907 during this crisis a series of banking failures was only stopped by the personal intervention of jp morgan even when morgan it was very difficult to make capital available in a way that avoided the panic the subsequent creation of the federal reserve was a response to that crisis

there is absolutely no logical reason why each nation does not own and control banking and thus the supply of money   any system including the financial system works exactly the same way regardless of ownership   banking depends solely on the confidence of the customers investors therefore when a sovereign nation state has ownership of the banks the profits are kept in house within the nation which is actually a bonus and taxes can be off set by profits which is another benefit   any improvement or benefit by the private ownership of banking is a total myth

who says they do n't in the united kingdom the bank of england and the bank of scotland print the money in some other countries like hong kong israel and the us commercial banks were issuing the currency at some point of time but now the governments do that the problem with commercial banks issuing currency is the control if a bank is allowed to print money how can the amount of currency be controlled if it is controlled by the government then the bank will be just a printing press so what 's the point and since governments now want to control the monetary policy banks have no reason to just be printing presses for the government the governments have their own edit apparently in hong kong it is still the case as i 'm sure it is in some other places in the world as well

are you talking about printing up more of the same kind of bill or printing up a different kind of bill   you 'll have different answers based on which one you mean if it 's a different kind of bill governments do n't like competition in this matter in us history there are examples of the government shutting alternative currencies down   a recent run at an alternative currency is the liberty dollar   the similarity is not lost on bitcoin or even chuck e. cheese last one is a but i did worry for a second as i still have a bunch of those tokens if it 's the same kind of bill the currency is a tool of the government in the us and it does the sourcing for its production   there is n't a whole lot of reason for others to get involved really   it 's special paper special plates special presses special everything and doing it in one place ensures some consistency of product   there are n't any compelling reason to open up another manufacturing channel to produce exactly the same product there 's no real economic benefit for banks to print their own money   the larger ones play a key role in shaping how much is printed but actually printing the bills is an of this

any person at any time may produce their own currency one can even do so on the back of a paper napkin ripped beer coaster or whatever   this is not a banking privilege it is within the lawful ability of anyone capable of engaging in commerce it is called a negotiable instrument it gives the holder rights to a sum of money   notice that i say holder this is what distinguishes it from a non negotiable instrument the fact that you do n't need to redeem it from source you can pass it to another who then becomes the holder in due course and thus obtains the rights the rights over a sum of money or indeed other asset are themselves value do banks do this   yes all the time one of the simplest examples are cheques drawn against the bank which are considered as good as cash   usually they will be drawn out to the order of the person you wish to pay but can equally be drawn out to bearer   the only reasons they resist making out to bearer is but you can write your own at any time on any thing see the yet entertaining tale of the negotiable cow

as well as credit risk there 's also interest risk if a bond has a face value of $ 100 pays 1 and matures in 20 years time then you expect to receive a total of $ 120 from buying it now $ 1 per year for 20 years and $ 100 at the end but if you can get a 3 return elsewhere then if you invest your $ 80 there instead you will get $ per year for 20 years and then $ 80 at the end making a total of $ 128 and you also get more of the money sooner so even $ 80 for the $ 100 bond is a bad buy and you should invest elsewhere

like kind of exchanges have a list of requirements the irs has not issued formal guidance in the matter i recommend to be aggressive and claim the exchange while justifying it with a good analogy to prove good faith and persuade the irs official reading it the risk of losing in tax court would be to high worst case the irs will attempt to reject the exchange at which point you could still pony up to get rid of the problem interest being the only real risk for example past tax court rulings have stated that collectable gold coins are not like kind to gold bars and unlike silver coins but investment grade gold coins are like kind to gold bars so you could use a justification like this i hold bitcoin to be like kind to litecoin because they use the same fundamental technology with just a tweak in the math as if exchanging different grades of gold bars which has been approved by tax court ruling note that it does n't matter whether any of this actually makes sense it just has be reasonable enough for you to believe and look like it is not worth pursuing to an overworked irs official at it i have n't tried this yet so up to now this is a guess but it 's a good enough guess in my estimation that i will be using it on some rather significant amounts next year

in the end you your dad and your brother should come to an agreement so there 's no surprises or expectations but here 's my opinion if you can afford to make the additions now i would offer to pay fully for the addition with the understanding that the additional value that it generates is yours   that keeps everything in your name and should be fair since you pay for the expense and someday reap the benefit if you ca n't afford to make the additions now i see two options have your brother buy your father 's house giving you half of the proceeds and use those proceeds to make the addition as above or split the cost of the addition and have some sort of contract drawn up promising to reimburse him with the amount of the reimbursement very clear like xxx dollars plus accrued interest at y% annually as a condition to selling the house    one other part you did n't mention is any compensation you get for keeping your father at your house   what compensation if any you get is not as important as making sure that the three of you all agree on what is fair    in any case clear honest communication and full agreement is key there is a very real risk that when your father 's estate is settled that there will be disputes over what the agreement was and who it entitled to what   having everything in writing may sound cold but it keeps everyone on the same page

the idea with passive investing in etfs is to eliminate the all important firm specific risk i agree with him that it surely creates a herd mentality and might over understate the fundamental prices for individual stocks if fund managers could consistently maintain alpha lower their and not shutdown when they ca n't reach their high water mark then maybe investors might come back to them as it stands now the money goes where it can get the best return with only market risk to worry about

etfs are both liquid benefits active traders and a simple way for people to invest in funds even if they do n't have the minimum balance needed to invest in a mutual fund edit in which purchases are resolved at the end of the trading day one big difference between etfs and mutual funds is that you must buy etfs in whole units whereas you can add $ 100 to a mutual fund and the fund will determine usually to 4 decimal places how many shares you 've purchased

you should distinguish between the price and the value of a company   price is what you pay value is what you get price is the share price you pay for one share of the company value is what a company is worth based on fundamental analysis one of the principles of value investing   i would recommend selling the stock only if the company 's value has due to fundamental changes e.g. better products from competitors declining market and its value is lower than the current share price

tl;dr roth earnings are not necessarily tax deferred but they might be this is a great question because imho the use of the wording tax deferred is slightly misleading when talking about a roth ira and roth 401k too the phrase tax deferred actually means you save tax now and you pay tax later i.e. you defer the tax as you pointed out this is the normal terminology used for describing a traditional ira/401k earnings on a roth ira are tax free not deferred but only if your distributions are qualified for the most part distributions are considered qualified if you wait until you are 59.5 years old before taking the money out but there are some exceptions if you choose to distribute more than your contributions meaning you are now taking out earnings the earnings are tax free only if your distribution is qualified for example if you take out the earnings before you are 59.5 and no other exceptions apply then you would pay tax on the earnings and also a 10 penalty so perhaps a better way to say it is that earnings in a roth ira are tax deferred

first of all congratulations on your home purchase   the more equity you build in your house the more of the sale price you get out of it when you move to your next house   this will enable you to consume more house in the future   think of it as making early payments towards your next down payment another option is to save up a chunk of money and your mortgage paying down the principal and having the resulting amount re amortized to provide you with a lower monthly payment   you may be able to do this at least once during your time in the house and if you do it early enough it can potentially help your savings in other areas on the other hand it is possible given today 's low interest rates for mortgages that in other forms of investments such as index funds you could make more on the money you 'd be putting towards your extra payments   then you would have more money in savings when you go to sell this house and buy the next one that you would in equity if you did n't go that route   this is riskier than building equity in your home but potentially has a bigger pay off you do the trade offs

all right i will try to take this nice and slow this is going to be a little long try to bear with me suppose you contribute $ 100 to your newly opened 401(k you now have $ 100 in cash and $ 0 in mutual funds in your 401(k and $ 100 less than you used to somewhere else at some later date you use that money within the 401(k to buy a single share of the acme world all market index fund which happens to trade at exactly $ 100 per share on the day your purchase goes through as a result you have $ 0 in cash and exactly one share of that fund corresponding to $ 100 within your 401(k some time later the price of the fund is up 10 so your share is now worth $ 110 since you have n't contributed anything more to your 401(k for whatever reason your cash holding is still $ 0 because your holding is really denominated in shares of this mutual fund of which you still have exactly one the cash equivalent of your holding is now $ 110 now you can basically do one of two things by selling the share you protect against it falling in price thus in a sense locking in your gain but where do you put the money instead you obviously ca n't put the money in anything else that might fall in price doing so would mean that you could lose a portion of your gains the only way to truly lock in a gain is to remove the money from your investment portfolio altogether roughly speaking that means withdrawing the money and spending it and then you have to consider if the value of what you spent the money on can fluctuate and as a consequence fall what 's the value of that three weeks old of milk in the back of your refrigerator the beauty of compounding is that it does n't care when you bought an investment let 's say that you kept the original fund which was at $ 110 now since that day it is up another 5 since we are looking at the change of price of the fund over some period of time that 's 5 of $ 110 not 5 of the $ 100 you bought at which was an arbitrary point anyway 5 of $ 110 is $ 5.50 which means that the value of your holding is now at $ from a gain first of 10 followed by another 5 if at the same day when the original fund was at $ 110 you buy another $ 100 worth of it the additional 5 gain is realized on the sum of the two at the time of the purchase or $ 210 thus after the additional 5 gain you would have not $ 210 $ 100 + $ 100 + 5 nor $ $ 100 + 5 + $ 100 but $ $ 110 + $ 100 + 5 see how you do n't need to do anything in particular to realize the beauty of compounding growth there is one exception to the above some investments pay out dividends interest or equivalent in cash equivalents basically deposit money into an account of yours somewhere in the case of retirement plans usually within the same container where you are holding the investment these dividends are generally not counted against your contribution limits but check the relevant legal texts if you want to be absolutely certain this is somewhat uncommon in mutual funds but very common in other investments such as stocks or bonds that you purchase directly which you really should not do if you are just starting out and/or feel the need to ask this type of question in that case you need to place a purchase order yourself for whatever you want to invest the dividend in if you do n't then the extra money of the dividend will not be growing along with your original investment

if you 're doing a little paid work on the side i would think twice about setting up a limited company due to the expense and administrative overhead a limited company has a couple of benefits assets and liabilities of the company are separate from your personal assets and liabilities which i see as a big bonus but it 's not worth it for a few hundred or even a couple of thousand a year you can get a lot of the tax benefits simply by working as a sole trader and you 'd have to do a tax return every year as you 're still able to deduct any expenditure incurred in the process of your side business from the income and thus lower your taxes on it you 'd also want to make sure that you have a separate bank account for the side business so you do n't mix it with your personal accounts makes it easier to admin just keep in mind that this is for expenses wholly incurred in the process of doing business try to claim on a pc that also doubles as a gaming rig might be an issue you 're best off discussing this with an accountant who can talk you through the various alternatives and advise if it 's worth the headache

goodness i wish i could put away half my paycheck not to rain on your parade but a 6-month emergency fund is not quite very good   it is the typical starting time frame   personally i would feel more comfortable with a 2 + year fund   that is a bit extreme but only because many of us can barely seem to make it around to a 6-month fund   so we focus on the more attainable goal i say you do all three   make saving money your priority but do enjoy some of it in moderation   do not plan on making any big purchases with it but know that you will eventually be able able to do so   money not spent is worthless idle money is worthless   make some hopefully prudent investments with some of your money    a small portion of that investment portfolio can should be in speculative investments   maybe even as much as 20 of your investment portfolio since you are young   consider that money gone and you will hopefully be surprised by one of those speculative investments   that is the crucial point earmark a small portion of your investment portfolio which you are willing to lose   however do not gamble with it   research the hot emerging technologies for example and find a way to make an investment so in summary you may have more money that you know what do with right now   however that does not mean you need to go out and spend it all   trust me as you get older you will think of plenty of good uses for that money

my biggest concern with this plan is that there 's no going back should you decide that it is not going to work either due to the strain on the relationship or for some other reason    if you were borrowing from a relative in place of a mortgage or a car loan you can always refinance and might just pay a little more interest or closing costs from a bank   student loans are effectively unsecured so your only option for a refinance would be to get a personal unsecured loan or borrow against existing collateral if you have it you are going to have a tough time getting another 50k unsecured personal loan at anywhere near student loan rates    the other negative aspects overall risk of borrowing from family loss of possible tax deduction make this plan a no go for me i 'm not saying that it 's always a good idea to borrow from family for homes or cars only that there 's at least an exit plan should you both decide it was a bad idea

already hit on some of this   it 's hard to explain this to a five year old because there are some fairly abstract concepts involved but here goes    all actual money is debt all of it including monetary gold etc do n't argue with me yet i 'll get to that   imagine a pretend world with no money some kind of primitive or something now let 's invent paper money you ca n't just print a bunch of paper that says people have to give you stuff because nobody would honor it but you could print ious let 's walk through this   let 's say you 're an apple farmer and i 'm a hunter you want some meat but have n't harvested your crops yet you say to me hey go hunt me some meat and i 'll give you 1/10th of my apple harvest in the fall fair enough i give you meat you owe me apples there 's probably a lot of this kind of stuff going on in addition to normal barter in time standard prices start to emerge a deer is worth a bushel of apples or whatever    now let 's say a week later i realize that my kid needs a new pair of shoes more than i need a bushel of apples i come back to you and say   hey remember that bushel of apples you owe me could you write a marker redeemable for one bushel of apples that i can give to the shoemaker in trade for a pair of shoes you say okay and we have invented a transferable note something a lot like money    in time our little starts to figure out that a note redeemable for a bushel of apples can be swapped for all kinds of things the fisherman who does n't even like apples will accept apple certificates in trade for fish because he knows he can trade them to boat builder who loves apples in time you can even start to hire farm workers without giving them anything except a note promising a cut of the future harvest    now you are issuing debt a promise to provide apples the money is a transferable your workers get a promise to provide value equal to a day of farm work or whatever and it 's transferrable so they can use it to buy whatever they want the worker gets fish from the fisherman not in exchange for doing any work or giving him anything he can use but in exchange for an iou that the fisherman can redeem anywhere    so far so good but there are a couple of in the road here on the way to a realistic monetary system that we 'll address separately   what happens if your apple orchard is destroyed in a wildfire suddenly all the notes that everyone has been trading are basically wiped out it did n't go anywhere it 's just gone it does n't exist real value was genuinely destroyed there is no law of the conservation of monetary just as you and i created it by creating transferable debt it can also be genuinely destroyed we 'll get back to this in a minute it gets interesting    the second issue is that in all probability the whole town is not just trading apple certificates i could also issue promises to catch deer the fisherman could issue promises of fish and so on this could get pretty messy especially if you got the notion to issue more apple certificates than you can grow you could buy all kinds of stuff with self issued debt that you could never repay and the town would n't find out until harvest time comes once again value has been destroyed people worked and made stuff and gave you stuff in exchange for something that does n't exist and will never exist all that stuff they made is gone you consumed it and there is nothing to show for it   the above two concerns are likely to become manifest in our village sooner or later and probably sooner   this leads to the question of credit which is at its most basic a measure of every time you issue an apple certificate you are borrowing with a promise to repay from future apple    after the first couple of town scandals people will start taking a closer look at the credibility of the issuer let 's say the town potato farmer comes up with a scheme where his potato certificates are actually issued by some credible third party say the town priest or whatever who starts every growing season with a book of numbered certificates equal to the typical crop yield and no more and keeps half of the certificate on file issuing the other half now there is an audit trail and a very credible system that is likely to earn the potato grower a lot of credit compared to other farmers in town that means that the potato grower can probably issue more notes at a better exchange rate than some system similarly the town drunk probably wo n't get much value for his certificates promising a ship of gold    now we have something like a credit market emerging and the potato farmer is issuing something closer to what we might call a modern bond   continued in a reply to this post

this chart concerns an option contract not a stock the method of analysis is to assume that the price of an option contract is normally distributed around some mean which is presumably the current price of the underlying asset as the date of expiration of the contract gets closer the variation around the mean in the possible end price for the contract will decrease undoubtedly the publisher has measured typical deviations from the mean as a function of time until expiration from historical data based on this data the program that computes the probability has the following inputs 1 the mean current asset price 2 the time until expiration 3 the expected standard deviation based on 2 with this information the probability distribution that you see is generated the green this is a normal or gaussian distribution for a normal distribution the probability of a particular event is equal to the area under the curve to the right of the value line in the example above the value chosen is this area can be computed with the formula   this formula is called the probability density for x where x is the value in the example above t is the reciprocal of the variance which can be computed from the standard deviation mu is the mean the main assumption such a calculation makes is that the price of the asset will not change between now and the time of expiration obviously that is not true in most cases because the prices of stocks and bonds constantly fluctuate a secondary assumption is that the distribution of the option price around the mean will a normal or gaussian distribution this is obviously a crude assumption and common sense would suggest it is not the most accurate distribution in fact various studies have shown that the distribution is actually a more accurate model for the distribution of option contract prices

mrchrister makes some good points but i saw his invitation to offer a counter opinion first there is a normal annual deposit limit of $ 13,000 per parent or donee this is the gift limit due to rise to $ 14,000 in 2013   if your goal is strictly to fund college and this limit is n't an issue for you the one account may be fine unless both kids are in school at the same time in that case you 're going to need to change beneficiaries every year to assign withdrawals properly   but as you mention there 's gift money that your considering depositing to the account in this case there 's really a legal issue the normal 529 allows changes in beneficiary and gifts to your child need to be held for that child in an irrevocable arrangement such as a utma account there is a 529 flavor that provides for no change of beneficiary a utma 529 clearly in that case you need separate accounts   in conclusion i think the single account creates more issues than it potentially solves if the true gift money from others is minimal maybe you should just keep it in a regular account edit on further reflection i strongly suggest you keep the relatives gifts in a separate account and when the kids are old enough to have legitimate earned income use this money to open and deposit to roth iras they can deposit the lesser of their earned income or $ 5000 in 2012 $ 5500 in 2013   this serves two goals avoiding the risk of gift money being stolen from one child for benefit of the other and putting it into an account that can help your children long term but not impact college aid as would a simple savings or brokerage account

as others have pointed out your bond funds should have short durations preferably not more than about 2 years if you are in a bond fund for the long haul meaning you do not have to draw on your bond fund a short time after interest rates have gone up it is not a big issue the fund 's holdings will eventually turn over into higher interest bearing paper if bonds do go down you might want to add more to the fund(s see my comment on age specific asset allocation below keep in mind that some stocks are interest sensitive for example utility stocks which are used as an income source and their dividends compete with rates on cds which are much safer right now cd rates are very low this could change it 's possible that we may be in an unusually sensitive interest rate period that might have large effects on the stock market yet to be determined the reason is that rates have been so low for such a long time that folks that normally would have obtained income streams from bonds have turned to dividend bearing stocks some believe that recent market rises are due to such people seeking dividends to enhance cash inflows if and emphasis on if this is true we could see a sharp drop in the market as sell offs occur as those who want cash streams move from stocks to ultra safe government insured cds only time will tell if this is going to play out if retirement for you is 15 + years in the future and the market goes down bonds or equities good stuff it 's a buying opportunity in whatever category has dropped most important is to keep an eye on your asset allocation and make sure it is appropriate to your age you did not state the percentages in each category so further discussion is impossible on that topic with more than 15 years to go i personally would be heavily weighted on the equity side mostly mid cap and some small equity funds or etfs in both domestic and international markets as you age shuffle some equities into fixed income bonds cds and the like work up an asset allocation plan start thinking about it now do n't wait

by definition actively managed funds will underperform passive index funds as a whole or more specifically the aggregate performance of all actively managed portfolio of publicly tradable assets will have equal performance to those of passively managed portfolios which taken with premise two actively managed funds will charge higher fees than passively managed funds results in in general lower fee investment vehicles e.g. passive index investments with broad enough diversification to the desired risk exposure will outperform higher fee options but do n't take my approach from a more practical perspective consider

both explanations are partly true there are many investors who do not want to sell an asset at a loss   this causes resistance at prices where large amounts of the asset were previously traded by such investors   it also explains why a break through of such a resistance is often associated with a substantial move in price there are also many investors who have stop loss or trailing stop loss limit orders in effect   these investors will automatically sell out of a long position or buy out of a short position if the price drops or rises by a certain percentage typically 8 10 there are periods of time when money is flowing into an asset or asset class   this could be due to a large investor trying to quietly purchase the asset in a way that avoids raising the price earlier than necessary   or perhaps a large investor is dollar cost averaging   or perhaps a legal mandate for a category of investors has changed and they need to rebalance their portfolios   this rebalancing is likely to take place over time   or perhaps there is a fad where many small investors at various times decide to increase or decrease their stake in an asset class   or perhaps for demographic reasons the number of investors in a particular situation is increasing so there are more investors who want to make particular investments   all of these phenomena can be summarized by the word momentum traders who use technical analysis including most day traders and algorithmic speculators are aware of these phenomena   they are therefore more likely to purchase or sell or short an asset shortly after one of their buy signals or sell signals is triggered   this reinforces the phenomena there are also poorly understood long term cycles that affect business fundamentals and/or the politics that constrain business activity   for example note that even if the markets really were a random walk it would still be profitable and risk reducing to perform dollar cost averaging when buying into a position and also perform averaging when selling out of a position   but this means that recent investor behavior can be used to predict the near future behavior of investors which justifies technical analysis

are there any advantages to layaway there are two main advantages first when you pay the initial deposit the seller reserves the item for you at a given price this is helpful with unique products like a high end custom made watch if there is only one of those watches in the entire world then it 's nice to know that the seller wo n't sell it to anyone else while you 're getting together the remaining funds and the price you 're paying is locked in second layaway agreements often allow for a payment plan this is helpful for people who have a hard time saving up money for many it 's easier to make smaller monthly payments than a large one time payment of course the cost of layaway is that you 're $ 30,000 short for up to 6 months this money could be generating a significant amount of interest during a half year period you 'll need to make sure that reserving the item and locking in the price are worth this cost

if you are interested in a career in algorithmic trading i strongly encourage you to formally study math and computer science   algorithmic trading firms have no need for employees with financial knowledge if they did they 'd just be called trading firms   rather they need experts in machine learning statistical modeling and computer science in general of course there are other avenues of employment at an algorithmic trading firm such as accounting clearing exchange relations etc   if that 's the sort of thing you 're interested in again you 'll probably want a formal education in those areas as opposed to just reading about finance in the news if you edit your question or add a comment below with information about your particular background i could perhaps advise you in a bit more detail edit given your comment i would say you have a fine academic background for the industry   when hiring mathematicians firms care most about the ease with which you can explore and extract features from massive datasets especially time series regardless of what the dataset might represent   an intelligent firm will not care whether you arrive at their doorstep with zero finance knowledge they will want to teach you everything from scratch anyway nonetheless some domain knowledge could be helpful but you 're not going to get more of it from reading any mass market news source whether you have to pay for it or not   that 's because   some non mass market news sources in the industry are   these are subscription only and actually discuss real information that real professional investors care about   they are loaded with industry jargon they 're extremely opinionated and in my opinion they 're useless   i ca n't imagine trying to learn about the industry from them but if you want to spend money for news in order to be exposed to the of the industry then either of these is far better than the financial times   despite requiring a subscription the financial times still does not cover the technical details of professional trading instead of trying to learn from news then i would suggest some old favorites and above all else read everything in the navigation box on the right side under financial markets and financial instruments

your question is listed as how to invest 100k not how would i find someone without a hidden agenda so i 'll answer that it depends i believe the best choices available are essentially as follows if you are looking to pay for your childrens college it might be nice just to put the money in a roth ira and have that done right off the bat if you disciplined enough to keep the money invested in some type of stock indexed fund that might be good the stock market has often outperformed almost every other form of investment over the very long haul but if you could see yourself tapping it for things then you might not want this another option is to put the money against your house if that does n't pay it off refinance the remaining portion into a lower rate for less years obviously this knocks down a huge portion of the interest duh and gives you a nice cash flow you can use for investing also the money you 've put into a primary residence is pretty safe i believe in some cases safe even from bankruptcy but as you 've noted being underwater on the home you are essentially throwing that money away in some way or fashion and really all in all houses are terrible investments you never really get your money out of your primary home unless you downsize the money is essentially saved without an equity line this is a good choice if you 're not disciplined your choice depends on of course you can do any combination of these things and as dave ramsey is apt to remind his and you ought to have your emergency fund set before you do any of these things

some lenders will work with you if you contact them early and openly discuss your situation   they are not required to do so   the larger and more corporate the lender the less likely you 'll find one that will work with you my experience is that your success in working out repayment plan for missed payments depends on the duration of your reduced income   if this is a period of unemployment and you will be able to pay again in a number of months you may be able to work out a plan on some debts if you 're permanently unable to pay in full or the duration is too long you may have to file bankruptcy to save your domicile and transportation   the ethics of this go beyond this forum as do the specifics of when it is advisable to file bankruptcy research your area find debt counselling   they can really help with specifics   speak with your lenders they may be able to refer you to local non profit services   be sure that you find one of those not one of the predatory lenders posing as credit counselling services   there 's even some that take the money you can afford to pay divide it up over your creditors allowing you to keep accruing late partial payment fees and charge you a fee on top of it   to me this is fraudulent and should be cause for criminal charges the key is open communication with your lenders with disclosure to the level that they need to know   if you 're disabled long term they need to know that   they do not need to know the specific symptoms or causes or   they need to know whether the social security administration has declared you disabled and are paying you a disability check   if this is the case you probably have a case worker who can find you resources to help negotiate with your creditors

i have n't read the book and have no intention of reading it this definitely looks like a forced savings plan with whole life insurance as the theme which is pretty bad for someone who is able to take care of his finances it would be good for someone who is not very good with his finances and wants to be forced into savings but then even for those people it would only help a little there are enough clauses that would make things more bad for him i.e. one can choose to take a loan pay only interest etc no book is going to help you build a savings habit one has to realize and spend what is essential it means not buying or doing tons of things and putting quite a bit away for a rainy day after this comes investing wisely

td will only sell the stock for you if there 's a buyer there was a buyer for at least one transaction of at least one stock at but who said there were more obviously the stocks later fell i.e. there were not that many buyers as there were sellers what i 'm saying is that once the stock passed reached the limit the order becomes an active order but it does n't become the only active order it is added to the list and to the bottom of that list obviously in this case there were not enough buyers to go through the whole list and get to your order and since it was a limit order it would only execute with the limit price you put once the price went down you got out of luck   that said there could of course be a possibility of a system failure but given the story of the market behavior it just looks like you and lost on a bet

the first thing i would try is to take out a loan from a local credit union if you do n't know of any that you 're eligible for start looking at the national credit union administration 's credit union locator you should be able to get a good rate since your credit is so good if for whatever reason you ca n't get the credit union loan i would open another credit card try hard to get the loan though because using a credit card will most likely be significantly more expensive if you ca n't cover your cash only expenses with cash you already have make sure that you can get cash from the card for example one of my cards regularly sends me checks that i could write to myself to get cash but be careful with this strategy usually the interest is much higher than normal purchases either way until you 've paid off this emergency debt and built up an emergency fund of 3 6 months of expenses cut your expenses as much as possible this experian article has some good tips

the first thing you have to do is to decided what area in finance you want to get into for example investment banking and quant are very different jobs learning all the cfa material is useful so you might as well take the exams too while you are at it you may be able to get into financial it or some type of financial programming job that is one step closer to your goal because at least you will be at a finance company and you can network with people that are in the field   also if you want to go into the buy side like i did i recommend you invest your own money and manage your own portfolio that way you would have some intimate familiarity with some companies strategies you ca n't get this from a textbook there is something a little wrong with someone who wants to manage other people 's money when he does n't manage his own that is a tough sell   you ca n't be too picky about where you get in getting in the door is the most important i got a lot of quant interviews because i was an engineer those interviews consist of a lot of math and brain teaser type questions for fundamental analyst positions they will typically want to figure out how you think about businesses companies   you can typically steer the interview any way you want which is why i think it is important that you invest your own money if you say the largest position i hold is in xyz company you can be 99 certain that they will be asking about that investment for the next 15 minutes at least that is your opportunity to show how you can add value   most companies prefer students for entry level because why hire a guy who is already working in another field when you can get someone fresh i stood out in the interviews because i could say i put $ 50k into this position because it 's not the only way to do it but i can only provide you with my experience

first off if you provide good service than you should n't worry since you are providing a service and your customers send payment to your paypal if there is no dispute made within 90 days the customer can not dispute further   however if it is disputed within 90 days than you may run into some trouble but it may be in your favor if paypal finds no signs of fraud and since it 's a service payment paypal can not really track it compared to if your customers paid you for a product which can be disputed up to 180 days i may be wrong on that one   however if it does get disputed and paypal favors your clients than you have to pay it back one way or another you may want to ask your customers or put yourself a description of the service and terms in the invoice it may help resolve future disputes i know this because i have called paypal customer service and ask which i suggest you do too

luke i 'd like to point out some additional benefits of the roth ira accounts 1 going roth you can effectively increase the amount of your contribution to your ira account in your example you are assuming that your contribution to roth ira is in fact $ 85 $ 100 less $ 15 tax paid in reality albeit more costly roth ira allows you to contribute full $ 100 $ less $ tax incurred using this method you can in fact grow your tax free funds to $ over 30 years the larger you effective tax rate is the larger will be the difference between your maximum effective traditional vs roth ira contribution will be 2 should you need to access your ira funds in case of emergency unqualified event of not buying your first home nor paying for your college education roth ira account contributions can be withdrawn without incurring the 10 penalty charge that would be imposed on your unqualified traditional ira distribution 3 as other contributors noted it 's hard to believe that lower us tax rates would prevail chances are you will be contributing to traditional 401k later throughout your work life having a roth ira account would afford you a tax diversification needed to hedge against possible tax rate hikes coming in the future considering the future of the social security funding and ever growing us national debt can we really expect for there to not be any tax rate increases in the next 20 40 years by the way as others pointed out your effective tax rate will always be lower than your marginal tax bracket

in my opinion separating your money into separate accounts is a matter of personal preference i can only think of two main reasons why people might suggest separating your bank accounts in this way security and accounting the security reasoning might go something like this my employer has access to my bank account because he direct deposits my salary into my account   i do n't want my employer to have access to all my money so i 'll have a separate account that my employer has access to and once the salary is deposited i can move that money into my real account the fault in this reasoning is that a direct deposit setup does n't really give your employer withdrawal access to your account and your employer does n't have any reason to pull money out of your account after he has paid you   if fraud is going to happen it much more likely to happen in the account that you are doing your spending out of the other reason might be accounting   perhaps you have several bank accounts and you use the different accounts to separate your money for different purposes   for example you might have a checking account that you do most of your monthly spending out of you might have a savings account that you use to store your emergency fund and you have more savings accounts to keep track of how much you have saved toward your next car or your vacation or your christmas fund or whatever   after you get your salary deposited you can move some into your spending account and some into your various savings accounts for different purposes instead of having many bank accounts i find it easier to do my budgeting accounting on my own not relying on the bank accounts to tell me how much money i have allocated to each purpose   i only have one checking account where my income goes my own records keep track of how much money in that account is set aside for each purpose   when the checking account balance gets too large i move a chunk of it over to my one savings account which earns a little more interest than the checking account does   i can always move money back into my checking account if i need to spend it for some reason and the amount of money in each of the two accounts is not directly related to the purpose of the money in summary i do n't see a good reason for this type of general recommendation

fica taxes are separate from federal and state income taxes as a sole proprietor you owe all of those   additionally there is a difference with fica when you are employed vs. self employed   typically fica taxes are actually split between the employer and the employee so you pay half they pay half but when you 're self employed you pay both halves this is what is commonly referred to as the self employment tax if you are both employed and self employed as i am your employer pays their portion of fica on the income you earn there and you pay both halves on the income you earn in your business edit as @joetaxpayer added in his comment you can specify an extra amount to be withheld from your pay when you fill out your w-4 form this is separate from the calculation of how much to withhold based on dependents and such see line 6 on the linked form this could allow you to avoid making quarterly estimated payments for your self employment income i think this is much easier when your side income is predictable personally i find it easier to come up with a percentage i must keep aside from my side income for me this is about 35 and then i immediately set that aside when i get paid i make my quarterly estimated payments out of that money set aside   my side income can vary quite a bit though if i could predict it better i would probably do the extra withholding yes you need to pay taxes for fica and federal income tax   i ca n't say exactly how much you should withhold though if you have predictable deductions and such it could be lower than you expect i 'm not a tax professional and when it comes doing business taxes i go to someone who is you do n't have to do that but i 'm not comfortable offering any detailed advice on how you should proceed there i mentioned what i do personally as an illustration of how i handle withholding but i ca n't say that that 's what someone else should do

my answer is with respect to the united states i have no idea about india 's regulatory environment you are opening yourself up to massive liabilities and problems if you deposit their money in your account i managed investment accounts as a private investment advisor for years those with less than 15 clients were not required to register until dodd frank changed the rules thus you would have to register as an advisor probably needing to take the series 65 exam or qualifying some other way e.g. getting your cfp cfa etc i used a discount broker dealer scottrade as the custodian here 's how it works each client 's account was their own account and i had a master account that allowed me to bill their accounts and manage them   they signed paperwork making me the advisor on their account   i had very little accounting to handle aside from tracking basis for taxed accounts if you take custody of the money you 'll have regulatory obligations there are always lots of stories in the financial advisor trade publications about advisors who go to jail for screwing their clients the most common factor they took custody of the assets i understand why you want a single account you want to ensure that each client gets the same results right does each client want the same results   certainly the tax situation for each is different yes   perhaps one has gains and wants to take losses in one year and the other does n't if their accounts are managed separately one can take losses while the other realizes gains to offset other losses financial advisors offer these kinds of accounts as separately managed accounts the advisors on these kinds of accounts are mutual funds managers and they try to match a target portfolio but they can do things like realize gains or losses for clients if their tax situation would prefer it you certainly ca n't let them put retirement accounts into your single account unless the irs has you on their list of acceptable custodians i suggest that you familiarize yourself thoroughly with the regulatory environment that you want to operate under then after examining the pros and cons you should decide which route you want to take   i think the most direct and feasible route is to pass the series 65 register as an investment advisor and find a custodian who will let you manage the assets as the advisor on the account real estate is another matter you should talk to an attorney not some random guy on the internet even if he has an mba and a bs in real estate which i do this is very much a state law thing

in this case trust the real estate agent negotiating experience is one of the things you selected them for especially if they 're suggesting a lower number than you expected since they get paid on commission and so may be biased the other way   part of their job is to look for hints about how motivated this seller is and what price they might accept as opposed to what price they hope to get   and remember that the default assumption is that the two parties will meet in the middle somewhere which means it 's customary to offer 10 less to signal that you could probably be talked into it if they drop the price about 5 this is like bridge hand bidding it 's a semi formalized system of hints about levels of interest except with fewer conventions and less rationality as far as the seller paying the closing costs that 's really part of the same negotiation and doing it that way makes the discussion more complicated for the seller since they need to figure out how much more to charge you to cover this cost if they offer great factor that into what you are willing to pay but i would n't assume it or ask for it edit yes unless you have engaged a buyer 's agent which i recommend for first time buyers and maybe all their fiduciary duty is to the seller but part of that duty is to make the sale happen if the price goes too high and you walk away neither the agent nor the seller make money a bad agent can be as bad as a bad car salesman sure but if you do n't like and mostly trust your agent you are working with the wrong agent that does n't mean you give them every bit of information the seller might want but it does mean you probably want to listen to their input and understand their before deciding what your own strategy will be

the preapproval is the bank stating that they will loan you up to a with a down payment of b for y years at r rate if you do n't ned all the money that is great they will still give you the loan you can keep the down payment some amount of money or the same percentage of the purchase price whichever you want for example preapproval of $ 200,000 and a down payment of $ 50,000 20   allows you to buy a house for $ 250,000 but you find one for $ 240,000 you can either neither of these needs a new pre approval in both cases your monthly payment will be lower than the original loan was expected to be if you want to change to $ 200 k for the loan and $ 40 k for the down payment or in other words decrease the percentage of down payment you might run into an issue that the bank does n't think you have enough of your own money in the deal or you may now require pmi where you did n't previously in this case they will need to re approve you now if the price goes up the bank could require more money down or may need to re evaluate the loan

the fsa can only pay for expenses incurred after it was open   this also applies in case of a mid year change in election such as due to marriage divorce child birth etc for example according to this page you can only be reimbursed for qualifying expenses from the election that was in place at the time the expense was incurred so say you had $ 500 available from january to june then on july 1 had a qualifying event you then elected $ 2000   you can be reimbursed for up to $ 500 in expenses incurred prior to july 1 and then an additional $ 1500 in expenses incurred after up to $ 2000 if you did n't use your full $ 500 more specifically from the irs publication generally distributions from a health fsa must be paid     only to reimburse you for qualified medical expenses you     incurred during the period of coverage the hsa question is more complicated i would talk to a tax accountant or at minimum your benefits coordinator   also read the publication i linked above the first part is about hsas   the short answer to your specific question stop contributing to the hsa unless you were contributing well under the limit of the hsa   if you know your limit and you know you 're under it you can continue contributing until april 15 of next year if you fail to be an eligible individual during     2013 you can still make contributions up until april 15     2014 for the months you were an eligible individual the general rule is you can contribute up to of months you were eligible   so if you changed jobs oct 1 and you 're single then you could contribute or just over $ 2400 in total for the year   if you 've contributed less than that to date you may continue contributing up to that amount but again contact your benefits coordinator or preferably a tax accountant as the rules can be complicated you definitely can not deduct any expenses from the account that you incur after you are no longer eligible and the rules on distributions are pretty complicated and if you get it wrong you may owe a 10 penalty on top of the tax you would normally owe so there is significant incentive not to get it wrong

others have covered the usual vehicles for getting money out of a property there 's another category of home loan called a hard money loan it would take a lot of inquiries to find a hard money loan given your needs but chances are its doable the terms can be onerous and hard money lenders do n't mess around when it comes to foreclosing after a few missed payments it 's an off the radar industry and the private lenders and specialized trustees operate together with strike force precision trustees normally should be trust able by borrower and lender but in the case i describe below one man owned the small company that lent and the small company that acted as trustee borrower beware yet if your credit score and income are dismal but your home equity is great hard money is the only way to borrow against your home in making hard money loans lenders do n't consider your credit score or income just how much equity is in the property i they hope you 'll default they do n't always hang onto the loans if you look like a payer instead of someone they can foreclose on they might sell the loan to someone who wants a stable monthly income you do n't know a thing about that person   a cautionary tale check out for a currently unfolding in which an elderly couple 's grandson convinced them to let him take title to their house borrow against it invest the proceeds and share the profits it did n't work that way he went through hard money lenders he borrowed $ and then $ 65,000 those were mysteriously paid off total mystery at this point and he borrowed $   about a year later he lost the house by defaulting the $ loan he was only about $ 2000 behind in payments when the trustee issued a notice of default followed by a notice of sale the trustee put the place up for auction which did n't require a court order that 's the way it is in california and many western states and a few others the hard money lender bought the loan at auction for $ and a home worth about $ 800,000 no longer belonged to the grandson   a fundraiser brought in about $ 120,000 and the couple bought a mobile home in a mobile home park the acre of land and swimming pool they used to own will be for sale soon or possibly for a mansion to be built house in the area go for about $ 2.5 m when improved with very large new houses i poke around when i see a house bought cheaply at a foreclosure auction quite often the former borrower had inherited the house treated it like a piggy bank defaulted and boom no more house it never makes sense to put a house at risk for a small amount like $ 5000 if you ca n't pay those credit card bills the lenders can you and maybe get a court order to extract something from your checking account every month but they ca n't take your belongings when you sign a deed of trust or mortgage you 're giving a third party the right to kick you out of your home and take possession of it you do n't have any say in the matter you might go to court and say whatever you feel like saying but if you owe many payments and ca n't pay them immediately you 're very likely to be out of luck someone mentioned paying off credit card balances with the highest interest rates first that 's done by throwing whatever cash you have at them while paying the minimum on the lower rate balances that 's financially sound but there 's a technique that turns out to be more motivating for some which is attacking the lowest balance first it leads to the quickest reduction in the number payments you 're required to make every month and quickly lets you add the money you were applying to the smallest balance to the payment you make on the next smallest balance close each card as you pay it off if you do n't want to accumulate debt again p.s. i do n't know what your home 's feed is so i did n't address that if it 's some kind of rental income every lender i have encountered credits 75 of the current monthly rent toward your gross income they assume there will be vacancies and other costs

the concept of emergency fund is a matter of opinion i can tell you the consensus is that one should have 6 9 months worth of expenses kept as liquid cash this is meant to cover literally all bills that you might encounter during that time   that 's a lot of money there are levels of savings that are shy of this but still responsible not enough to cover too much in case of job loss but enough to cover the busted transmission the broken water heater etc this is still more than many people have saved up but it 's a worthy goal   the doctor visit is probably the lowest level even without insurance the clinic visit should be under $ 200 and this should n't cause you to have to carry that amount beyond the time the bill comes in   the point that should n't be ignored is that if you owe money at 18 on a credit card the emergency fund is costing you money and is a bit misguided i 'd send every cent i could to the highest rate card and not have more than a few hundred $ $ liquid until the cards were at zero   last $ 5 k $ 10 k in the emergency account is great unless you are foregoing matched 401(k dollars to do it all just my opinion others here whom i respect might disagree with parts of my answer and they 'd be right    edit regarding the consensus 6 9 months i suggest   from investopedia using the conservative recommendation to sock away eight    worth of living expenses the article strongly support my range for the fact that it both cites consensus yet disagrees with it   from money under 30 the more difficult you rank your ability to find a new job the more    we suggest you save up to a year ’s worth of expenses if you think    your income would be very difficult to replace from bank of america    i have no issue with those comfortable with less a dual income couple who is saving 30 of their income may very well survive one person losing a job with no need to tap savings and any emergency expense can come from next month 's income that couple may just need this month 's bills in their checking account

to begin with bear in mind that over the time horizon you are talking about the practical impact of inflation will be quite limited inflation for 2017 is forecast at 2.7 and since you are talking about a bit less than all of 2017 and on average you 'll be withdrawing your money halfway through the overall impact will be < 1.3 of your savings you should consider whether the effort and risk involved in an alternative is worth a few hundred pounds if you still want to beat inflation the best suggestion i have is to look at peer to peer lending that comes with some risk but i think over the course of 1 year it 's quite limited for example zopa is currently offering 3.1 on their access product and are offering 2.9 on the everyday product both of these are advertised as instant access albeit with some caveats these are n't fscs guaranteed bank deposits and they do come with some risk firstly although both and zopa have a significant level of provision against bad debt it 's always possible that this wo n't be enough and you 'll lose some of your money i think this is quite unlikely over a one year time horizon as there 's no sign of trouble yet secondly there 's liquidity risk although the products are advertised as instant access they are actually backed by longer duration loans made to people who want to borrow money for you to be able to cash out someone else has to be there ready to take your place again this is very likely to be possible in practice but there 's no absolute guarantee

anyone that currently owns a business of any size is a slave to pretty much anyone else   we are told who to hire how much to pay how much of the profits we must give to pay our fair share who we must serve and by what measure of quality what prices we may charge in many cases and so on   what you and people like you do not get is that those of us that enjoy starting businesses have lost our taste for it   we 're sick of working twice as hard as our employees and then being told we do n't give back enough    i would never not hire or serve someone on the basis of their color religion and so forth   why   because finding great people is hard enough why reduce the potential population further with and silliness   but i would also never hire a person because of those things   i do n't care if you 're black and feel like you 're entitled to special consideration because your great great great great grandfather was enslaved   a i do n't care   b i had nothing to do with it   c you 're not entitled to squat unless you 've earned it   ditto native americans women people that are overweight or any one of a dozen other manufactured excuses for not being willing to be measured by as per the content of your character not the color of your skin or whatever   in the mean time i have been on strike   i am not starting another business or hiring another person until this nonsense gets put under control   i made that the day the worst president in my lifetime mr hoax and shame got elected   guess what   there are lots of people like me and you 're not going to see an improving unemployment picture until you quit squeezing us with this pc feel good stupidity    and you know what   if you do end the eeoc lunacy what will happen   people of all flavors who are persons of character and ability will flourish and the low life white trash black ghetto scum drug addict losers that support the ideological left will starve   and that 's just fine with me so long as they do not block traffic

how to break 90 golf is a lifelong pursuit that will always challenge may entertain and will almost certainly at times   for most players golf scores similar to those consistently seen from our favorite pros may be unattainable   a more reasonable goal for most is to find a way first to routinely break 90 but how do you get there   a few regular adjustments will provide the best opportunities to do so pre shot routine every needs a pre shot routine that happens every time you approach the ball for example during practice always visualize a target plan your shot and try to see the outcome take one or two practice swings to get a feel for the stroke before you step to the ball the key to this is consistency if it happens every time you can begin to take the guesswork out of your game golf    practice more than you play do n’t try to fix your mistakes on the back nine when you are on the course you should n’t be thinking about how to correct your stroke grip stance etc in fact if you ’ve done the work off the course you should n’t have to think about much at all trust your muscle memory to do what you have practiced   practice the minimum to perfect any physical skill it is important to focus on the smallest amount of information possible at one time you can not simultaneously pay attention to the plane of your stroke while thinking about the weight on your left foot and refining your grip try to pick one small thing to focus on at one time and work it into your muscle memory practicing the minimum will allow you to stop thinking about each factor of the game while on the course again the goal of this process is to make your motions automatic and fluid   care less   it may seem counterintuitive but when you step onto the golf course the more invested you are in each shot the less you can rely on the hard work you have put into your game during practice do the work on the driving range so that you do n’t need to worry about it when you need it http://www

i have had my card blocked at home only rarely one occasion comes to mind i had bought something fairly large online late at night no sooner had i clicked purchase than my phone the bank was asking had i actually just spent $ amount at $ online store i said yes and that was that a little later i made another purchase late at night on a different card it went through but when i tried to use the card the next day for something small in a store it was declined embarrassed i used a different card then called the bank they said they had put the card on hold because of the online purchase for a large amount even though they had let the purchase go through they had n't called me because it was late at night and they had n't given themselves any reasonable mechanisms to compensate for that like calling me the next morning emailing me or the like they 'd just blocked the card we had what you might call a frank and open exchange of views on the matter   not all banks use the same strategies or software i suggest far and away the simplest thing is just to have more than one card so that these declines are a momentary hiccup you might forget by the time you and your rolex are out of the store

if it is one of those debit cards you use just like a credit card without a pin i 'd cancel it regardless of whatever you are trying to do with your finances they just seem too dangerous to me   unlike a credit card if someone makes fraudulent purchases on a debit card the money is gone from your bank account until you resolve the issue with the issue with a credit card the bank is out the money until it gets worked out my brother once had his credit card number not the card stolen and the criminals emptied his bank account eventually the bank put the money back after an investigation but it had two really nasty side effects 1 dozens of checks bounced the bank refunded the bounced check fees but not all of the stores would    2 he had no money in his account until it was resolved luckily in his case they resolved it in a few days but he was already making preparations to borrow money to pay his rent bills

what you want is a position transfer likely by    this is a transfer from one ira to another without having to liquidate positions to do so   in effect the brokerage firm is just transferring records from your existing ira to your new ira   you will need to watch out to make sure your new ira account can hold your positions for this to work   for example some brokerages allow you to hold fractional shares but others do n't   the fractional share amounts would be sold automatically prior to transfer   another example might be different fund families could be allowed between different brokerages the general process is open your new ira account initiate the from your new account your old ira account brokerage sends the positions over and after a week or so your new ira brokerage notifies you that everything is transferred i 've switched iras a couple times via this mechanism and never been charged a fee but i 've always stuck with the larger brokerages like fidelity td ameritrade and interactive brokers

the best strategy for rsu 's specifically is to sell them as they vest usually vesting is not all in one day but rather spread over a period of time which assures that you wo n't sell in one extremely unfortunate day when the stock dipped for regular investments there are two strategies i personally would follow sell when you need if you need to cash out cash out rebalance if you need to rebalance your portfolio i.e. not cash out but reallocate investments or move investment from one company to another do it periodically on schedule for example every 13 months in the us where the long term cap gains tax rates kick in after 1 year of holding rebalance you would n't care about specific price drops on that day because they also affect the new investments speculative strategies trying to sell high buy low usually bring to the opposite results you end up selling low and buying high but if you want to try and do that you 'll have to get way more technical than just dollar cost averaging or similar strategies most people do n't have neither time nor the knowledge for that and even those who do rarely can beat the market and never can in the long run

for any sort of investment you need to understand your risks first if you 're going to put money into the stock or bond market i would get a hold of graham 's the intelligent investor first or any other solid value investing book and educate yourself on what the risks are i ca n't speak about real estate investing but i am sure there are plenty of books describing risks and benefits of that as well i could see inflation deflation having an effect there but i think the biggest impact on the landlord front is quality of life in the area you are renting and the quality of the tenant you can get one crazy tenant and you will be driven mad yourself as for starting a business one thing i would like to say is that money does not automatically make money the business should be driven by a product or service that you can provide first and the backing seed capital second in my opinion you will have to put energy and time worth much more than the 100k into a business over time to make it successful so the availability of capital should not be the driving decision here hope this helps more than it confuses

so you are paying taxes on your contributions regardless the timing    is just different i am failing to see why would a person get an ira instead of just    putting the same amount of money into a mutual fund like vanguard or    something like that what am i missing you are failing to consider the time value of money getting $ 1 now is more valuable to you than a promise to get $ 1 in a year even though the nominal amount is the same with a certain amount of principal now you can invest it and it will likely grow into a bigger amount of money principal + earnings at a later time and we can consider the two to have approximately equivalent value the principal now has the same value as the principal + earnings later with pre tax money in traditional ira the principal + earnings are taxed once at the time of withdrawal assuming the same flat rate of tax at contribution and withdrawal this is equivalent to roth ira where the principal is taxed at the time of contribution because the principal now has the same value as the principal + earnings later so the same rate of tax on the two have the same value of tax even though when you look at nominal amounts it might seem you are paying a lot less tax with roth ira since the earnings are never taxed with actual numbers if we take a $ 1000 pre tax contribution to traditional ira it grows at 5 for 10 years and a 25 flat rate tax we are left with $ 1000 1.05 ^ 10 0.75 = $ with the same $ 1000 pre tax contribution so after 25 tax it 's a $ 750 after tax contribution to a roth ira growing at the same 5 for 10 years and no tax at withdrawal we are left with $ 1000 0.75 1.05 ^ 10 = $ you can see they are equivalent even though the nominal amount of tax is different the lower amount of tax paid now is equivalent to the bigger amount of tax later with a taxable investment which you will not buy and sell until you take it out you contribute with after tax money and when you take it out the earnings portion is subject to capital gains tax but remember that the principal + earnings later is equivalent to the principal now which is already all taxed once and if we tax the earnings portion later that is effectively taxing a portion of the money again another way to look at it is the contribution is just like the roth ira but the withdrawal is worse because you have to pay capital gains tax instead of no tax you can take the same numbers as for the roth ira $ 1000 0.75 1.05 ^ 10 = $ but where the $ $ 750 = $ is earnings and is taxed again at say a 15 capital gains rate so you lose another $ in tax and are left with $ you would need a capital gains tax rate of 0 to match the advantage of the pre tax traditional ira or roth ira after tax money in traditional ira has a similar problem the contribution is after tax but after it grows into principal + earnings the earnings part is taxed again except it is worse than the capital gains case because it is taxed as regular income like above you can take the same numbers as for the roth ira $ 1000 0.75 1.05 ^ 10 = $ but where the $ earnings is taxed again at 25 so you lose another $ in tax and are left with $ so although the nominal amount of tax paid is the same as for pre tax money in traditional ira it ends up being a lot worse everything i said above about pre tax money in traditional ira after tax money in traditional ira and roth ira also applies to pre tax money in traditional 401(k after tax money in traditional 401(k and roth 401(k respectively regarding the question you raise in the title of your question why someone would get contribute to a traditional ira if they already have a 401(k the answer is mostly they would n't first note that if you merely have a 401(k account but neither you nor your employer contributes to it during the year then that does n't prevent you from deducting traditional ira contributions for that year so basically you can contribute to one or the other so if you only want to contribute below the ira contribution limit and do n't need the bigger 401(k contribution limit and the ira 's investment options are more attractive to you than your 401(k 's then it might make sense for you to contribute to only traditional ira if you or your employer is already contributing to your 401(k during the year then you can not deduct your traditional ira contributions unless your income is very low and if your income is really that low you are in such a low tax bracket that roth ira may be more advantageous for you if you make a traditional ira contribution but can not deduct it it is a non deductible traditional ira contribution i.e. it becomes after tax money in a traditional ira which as i showed in the section above has much worse tax situation in the long run because its earnings are pre tax and thus taxed again however there is one good use for non deductible traditional ira contributions and that is as one step in a backdoor roth ira contribution basically there is an income limit for being able to make roth ira contributions but there is no income limit for being able to make traditional ira contributions or for being able to convert money from traditional ira to roth ira so what you can do is make a non deductible traditional ira contribution and then immediately convert it to roth ira and if you did not previously have any pre tax money in traditional iras this achieves the same as a regular roth ira contribution with the same tax treatment but you can do it at any income level

yes there are times when co signing is the right choice one is when you know more about the person than the loan issuer does consider a young person who has just started working in a volatile field the kind of job where you can be told on friday that you only get one shift next week but things might pick up the week after and who makes maybe $ 12 an hour in that job you 've done the math and with 40 hour weeks they can easily afford the loan furthermore you know this person well and you know that after a few weeks of not enough shifts they 've got the to go out and find a second job or a different job that will give them 40 hours or more a week and you know that they have some savings they could use to ensure that no payments will be missed even on low wage weeks you can cosign for this person say for a car loan to get them a car they can drive to that job knowing that they are n't going to walk away and just stop making the payments the loan issuer does n't know any of that   or consider a young person with poor credit but good income who has recently decided to get smart about money has written out a budget and a plan to their credit and who you know will work passionately to make every payment and get the credit score up to a place where they can buy a house or whatever their goal is again you can cosign for this person to make that happen because you know something the lender does n't or consider a middle aged person who 's had some very hard knocks laid off in a plant closing perhaps marriage failure lost all their house equity when the market collapsed that sort of thing they have a chance to start over again somewhere else and you have a chance to help again you know this is n't someone who is going to their money and walk away from the payments and leave you holding the bag if you would give the person the money anyway say a car for your newly graduated child then cosigning instead gives them more of a sense of accomplishment since they paid for it and gives them a great credit rating too if you would not give the person the entire loan amount but would make their payments for many months or even a year say your brother 's mortgage for the house where he lives with a sick wife and 3 small children then cosigning is only making official what you would have done anyway   arrange with the borrower that if they ca n't make their payments any more you will backstop them and the item car house whatever is going up for sale to cover your losses if you do n't think you could enforce that just from the strength of the relationship reconsider co signing then sign what you need to sign and step away from it it 's their loan not yours you want them to pay it and to manage it and to leave you out of it until it 's all paid off and they thank you for your help if things go south you will have to pay and it may take a while for you to sell the item or otherwise stop the paying so you do need to be very confident that the borrower is going to make every single payment on time my point is just that you can have that confidence based on personal knowledge of character employment situation savings and other resources in a way that a lender really can not

the advantage of having a mortgage rather than borrowing money in other ways is that it is cheaper because the loan is secured against the value of the property   if you stop paying then the bank take the house and can sell it keeping what they are owed and returning any excess if you have enough money to pay it off then you do not need the mortgage   they normally run for 25 years   it is a lovely day when finally you realise that you own the whole house and no longer owe anything to the bank and the charge against the house is removed and the record of it removed from the land registry    when you sell a house with a mortgage the buyer has to check that the bank has been paid off before they accept the property

also unless i missed it and someone already mentioned it do keep in mind the impact of these credit cards balances on your credit score over roughly 75 usage on a given credit account reflects badly on your score and has a pretty large impact on how your worthiness is calculated it gives the impression that you are a person that lives month to month on cards etc if you could get both cards down to reasonable balances to where you could begin paying on them regularly and work them down over time that will not only look incredible for your credit report but also immediately begin making your credit worthiness begin to raise due to the fact that you will not have accounts that i 'm assuming here are at very high usage over 75 of your total limit if you have to get one card knocked out just to get breathing room and you 're boxed in here or honestly even if the mental stress is causing you incredible hardship day to day then i suppose blow one card out of the water reassess and start getting to work on that second card i hope this helped i 'm no expert but i have had every kind of luck with credit cards and accounts you could think of so i can only give my experience from the rubber meets the road perspective good luck

to answer i 'm going to make a few assumptions first the ideal scenario for a pre tax 401(k is the deposit goes in at a 25 tax rate i.e. the employee is in that bracket but withdrawn at 15 this may be true for many but not all it 's to illustrate a point   the spy s&p 500 index etf has a cost of per year if your 401(k fees are anywhere near 1 per year total over 10 years you 've paid nearly 10 in fees vs less than 1 for the etf above i suggest the ideal is that the 401(k saves you 10 on your taxes but if you pay 10 over the decade the benefit is completely negated   i can add to the above that funds outside the retirement accounts give off dividends which are tax favored and if you were to sell etfs held over a year they receive favorable cap gains rates   the deposit to get the matching funds should always be good advice it would take many years of high fees to destroy that but even that seemingly reasonable 1 fee can make any other deposits a bad approach   keep in mind when retired you will have a zero bracket in 2011 the combined standard deduction and exemption adding to $ as well as a 10 bracket the next $ 8500 so having some pretax money to take advantage of those brackets will help last the average person changes jobs now and then the ability to transfer the funds from the bad 401(k to an ira where you can control the investments is an option i 'd not ignore in the analysis   i arbitrarily picked 1 to illustrate my thoughts the same math will show a long time employee will get hurt by even if enough time passes what are the fees in your 401(k    edit study of 401(k fees put out by the dept of labor unfortunately it 's over 10 years old but it speaks to my point back then even a 2000 participant plan with $ 60 m in assets had 110 basis points this is 1.1 in fees on average whatever the distribution is those above this average should n't even participate in their plans except for matching and those on the other side should look at their expenses as points out below yes for those just shy of retirement the fee has less impact and of course they have a better idea if they will retire in a lower bracket those who have some catching up to do may benefit despite the fees

first i 'd like to congratulate you on your financial discipline in paying off your loans and living well within your means   i have friends who make more than twice your salary with similar debt obligations and they barely scrape by month to month if we combine your student loan debt and unallocated income each month we get about $ 1,350   you say that $ per month is the minimum payment for your loans which have an average interest rate of about 3.5   thus you have about $ 1,350 a month to invest making your loan payments is basically the same as investing with the same return as the loan interest rate when it comes down to it   an interest rate of 3.5 is not great all things considered and barely above inflation     however that 's a guaranteed return of 3.5 more or less like a bond   as noted previously the stock market historically averages 10 before inflation over the long run the us stock market is right around its historic high at this point djia is at today april 6th 2017 historic high hit just over on march 1 2017   obviously no one can predict the future but i get the feeling that a market correction may be in order especially depending on how things go in washington in the next weeks or months   if that 's the case again we have no way of knowing if it is you 'd be foolish to invest heavily in any stocks at this point what i would do given your situation is invest the $ in a portfolio that 's 50/50 stocks and bonds where the bonds here are your student loans   here you have a guaranteed return of on the bond portion and you can still hedge the other 50 on stocks continuing their run and also benefiting from dividends capital gains etc over time   i would apply the extra loan payments to the highest interest loan first paying only the minimum to the others   once the highest interest loan is paid off move onto the next one once you have all your loans paid off your portfolio will be pretty much 100 stocks at which point you may want to add in some actual bonds say a or 80/20 split depending on what you want   i 'm assuming you 're pretty young so you still have plenty of time to let the magic of compounding interest do its work even if you happen to get into the market right before it drops well that and the fact that you wo n't really have much invested anyway again let me stress that neither i nor anyone else has any way of knowing what will happen with the market i 'm just stating my opinion and what my course of action would be if i were in your shoes

money has to come from somewhere   it ca n't just appear   so if there is really an aunt at an agency and she is sending checks then she is writing checks from that company and stealing from that company   if that is the case then the person with whom you are in contact would be using you to launder money hide its illegal origin and when the aunt was caught you would be also if it is really being done between countries then it might be more difficult for them to find you but it is still illegal however it is also likely that your contact may be using a common scam as described by another answerer that of asking for money in return for a cashier 's check   although cashier 's checks were designed to be safer than regular checks in that they wo n't bounce if it is a fake cashier 's check it was never worth anything in the first place   when the bank tries to claim the cash from the other bank and finds it does n't exist or there is no record of that check then the effect is similar to that of a personal check bouncing the bank will want the money back if you have already given a portion of that money to your contact chances are when your find this out he will be long gone   i would not have anything further to do with this person good luck

you 're talking about modern portfolio theory the wiki article goes into the math here 's the gist modern portfolio theory mpt is a theory of finance that attempts to maximize portfolio expected return for a given amount of portfolio risk or equivalently minimize risk for a given level of expected return by carefully choosing the proportions of various assets at the most basic level you either a pick a level of risk standard deviation of your whole portfolio that you 're ok with and find the maximum return you can achieve while not exceeding your risk level or b pick a level of expected return that you want and minimize risk again the standard deviation of your portfolio you do n't maximize both moments at once the techniques behind actually solving them in all but the most trivial cases portfolios of two or three assets are trivial cases are basically programming because to be realistic you might have a portfolio that a does n't allow short sales for all instruments and/or b has some securities that ca n't be held in fractional amounts like etf 's or bonds then there is n't a closed form solution and you need computational techniques like mixed integer programming plenty of firms and people use these techniques even in their most basic form also your terms are a bit strange it has correlation table for i and j running from 1 to n this is usually called the covariance matrix i want to maximize 2 variables namely the expected return and the additive inverse of the standard deviation of the mixed investments like i said above you do n't maximize two moments return and inverse of risk i realize that you 're trying to minimize risk by maximizing negative risk so to speak but since risk and return are inherently a tradeoff you ca n't achieve the best of both worlds maybe i should point out that although the above sounds nice and theoretically it 's sound as one of the comments points out it 's harder to apply in practice for example it 's easy to calculate a covariance matrix between the returns of two or more assets but in the simplest case of modern portfolio theory the assumption is that those do n't change over your time horizon also coming up with a realistic measure of your level of risk can be tricky for example you may be ok with a standard deviation of 20 in the positive direction but only be ok with a standard deviation of 5 in the negative direction basically in your head the distribution of returns you want probably has negative   because on the whole you want more positive returns than negative returns like i said this can get complicated because then you start minimizing other forms of risk like value at risk for example and then modern portfolio theory does n't necessarily give you closed form solutions anymore any actively managed fund that applies this in practice since obviously a completely passive fund will just replicate the index and not try to minimize risk or anything like that will probably be using something like the above or at least something that 's more complicated than the basic undergrad portfolio optimization that i talked about above we 'll quickly get beyond what i know at this rate so maybe i should stop there

when buying investment properties there are different levels of passive investment involved   at one end you have those that will buy an investment property and give it to a real estate agent to manage and do n't want to think of it again apart from watching the rent come in every week at the other end there are those that will do everything themselves including knocking on the door to collect the rent where is the best place to be well somewhere in the middle the most successful property investors treat their investment properties like a business they handle the overall management of the properties and then have a team taking care of the day to day nitty gritty of the properties regarding the brand new or 5 to 10 year old property you are going to pay a premium for the brand new a property that is 5 years old will be like new but without the premium i once bought a unit which was 2 to 3 years old for less than the original buyer bought it at brand new also you will still get the majority of the depreciation benefits on a 5 year old property you also should not expect too much maintenance on a 5 to 10 year old property another option you may want to look at is defence housing they are managed by the department of defence and you can be guaranteed rent for 10 years or more whether they have a tenant in the property or not they also carry out all the maintenance on the property and restore it to original condition once their contract is over the pitfall is that you will pay a lot more for the management of these properties up to 15 or more personally i would not go for a defence housing property as i consider the fees too high and would not agree with some of their terms and conditions however considering your emphasis on a passive investment this may be an option for you

government registering of financial institutions usually is to make the government safe eg is watching for money laundering and financing terrorism rather than to make it 's customers safe   most governments have many levels of registrations and regulatory bodies the most stringent requirements are usually obligatory only for banks and they indeed often include precautions for insuring customer 's deposits even this insurances have limits eg in most eu countries the state guarantees deposits up to if you deposit more and the bank you lose everything over the limit companies like forex or currency exchanges usually make their best effort to avoid as many regulations as possible just because it 's costly if a given company does have guarantee funds and/or customer insurance it should be advertised and explained on their website however the whole issue of trust is you do n't have to trust in your grocery store to shop there there is no government guarantee that the vegetables sold will be tasty if you buy and the product short of your expectations you call it a loss and start shopping elsewhere financial services are no different than any other product i recommend to your aunt to start small and see how it works if a service turns out well she can increase the amount sent through exchange and decrease amount sent through bank but still it 's always prudent to send eg $ 1000 every week instead of $ 4000 once a month it 's more time consuming and cumbersome than having your bank do it but it 's the safety and convenience you 're paying premium for

most people who have over $ 250,000 in liquid cash savings would not want to start putting their money into regular savings accounts in different banks especially with interest rates as ridiculously low as they are now in 2014 15   people with money will want to diversify their investments in ways that will potentially earn them more money and they can also afford to seek the advice of financial planners who can help them do this wisely even if you decide to put $ 250,000 into various accounts at different banks i would n't necessarily trust that the fdic will be able to help you recover your money in the event that your banks go under   the amount of money available to the fdic to cover such losses pales in comparison to the actual amount of money that americans have in their bank accounts

@joetaxpayer 's answer outlines how to value it some other considerations as i understand it some public pensions may be tax free if you still live in the state that is paying the pension e.g. when a massachusetts teacher receives pension it is exempt from state taxes but if that person moves to vermont he will have to pay vermont income tax on those payments so if you plan to stay in the state post retirement this provides additional value pension payments are n't fully guaranteed by the pbgc and not all pension plans are fully funded depending on the political and economic environment when you hit retirement your retirement plan could suffer and if you are n't working you may not have a union vote any more when the other working members are voting on contract amendments that affect pensions i 'm not certain of all of the rules but i hear news reports from time to time that formulas like what you 've posted in the original question are changed through negotiation with the union if you make an employment decision using the formula in year x and then the formula changes in year your expected pension payment will change

stock market indexes are generally based on market capitalization which is not the same as gdp   gdp includes the value of all goods and services produced in a country this includes a large amount of small scale production which may not be reflected in stock market   thus the ratio between countries may not be the same as the ratio of their total market capitalization   for instance us gdp is approximately 3.8 times as much as japan 's see here but us total market cap is about 5.5 as much as japan 's see here the discrepancy can be even more severe when comparing developed economies like the us to developing or less developed economies in which there is less participation in large scale financial systems like stock markets   for instance us gdp is roughly 10 times that of brazil but us total market cap is roughly 36 times that of brazil   switzerland has a total market cap nearly double that of brazil despite its total gdp being less than half of brazil 's   since the all world index includes all investable economies it will include many economies whose share of market cap is disproportionately lower than their share of gdp in addition according to the fact sheet you linked to that index tracks only and mid cap stocks   this will further skew the weighting to developed economies and to the us in particular since the us has a disproportionate share of the largest companies obviously one would need to take a more detailed look at all the weights to determine if these factors account precisely for the level of discrepancy you see in this particular index   but hopefully that explanation gives an idea of why the us might be weighted more heavily in a stock index than it is in raw gdp

from the instructions if you do not need to make any adjustments to the basis or type of    gain or loss short term or long term reported to you on form 1099-b    or substitute statement or to your gain or loss for any transactions    for which basis has been reported to the irs normally reported on    form 8949 with box a checked you do not have to include those    transactions on form 8949 instead you can report summary information    for those transactions directly on schedule d. for more information    see exception 1 later however in case of espp and rsu it is likely that you actually do need to make adjustments since 2014 brokers are no longer required to track basis for these so you better check that the calculations are correct if the numbers are right and you just summarized instead of reporting each on a separate line its probably not an issue as long as the gains reported are correct no one will waste their time on you if you missed several thousand dollars because of incorrect calculations some might think you were intentionally trying to hide something by aggregating and may come after you

there may be a third option the bank gives you the first mortgage of 80 and a second maybe a heloc for that missing 5 this way you get the lower rate and the money they 'd charge you for pmi goes to paying down the second loan   alternately do you have any other sources to tap to bridge this small gap a 401(k loan perhaps the rate low and for home purchase a 10 yr payback if these are n't viable options i agree that taking the pmi route while tracking the balance is the way to go

your house does n't need to multiply in order to earn a return your house can provide shelter that is not money but is an economic good and can also save you money if you would otherwise pay rent this is the primary form of return on the investment for many houses it is similar for other large capital investments like industrial robots washing machines or automobiles the value of money depends on as long as the size and velocity of the money supply changes about as much as the overall economic activity changes everything is pretty much good a little more and you will see the money lose value inflation a little less and the money will gain value deflation   as long as the value of inflation or deflation remains very low the specifics matter relatively little prices including wages the price of work do a good job of adjusting when there is inflation or deflation the main problem is that people tend to use money as a unit of account e.g. you owe $ 100,000 on your mortgage i have $ 500 in the bank changing the value of those numbers makes it really hard to plan for the future imagine if prices and wages fell in half it would be twice as hard to pay off your mortgage or if the bank expected massive inflation in the future they would want to charge you a lot more interest presently inflation is the norm because the government entities who help adjust how much money there will be through monetary policy interest rates and the like ask about it if you 're interested will generally gradually increase the supply of money a little bit more quickly than the economy in general they may also be worried that outright deflation over the long term will lead to people purchases to get more for their money later harming overall economic activity so they tend to err on the slightly positive side the value of money however has not really ordinarily decreased until the modern era the 1930s or so during much of history a relatively low fixed amount of valuable commodities gold served as money when the economy grew and the same amount of money represented more economic activity the money became more valuable and deflation this could have the unfortunate effect of investment because rich jerks with lots of money could see their riches increase just by holding on to those riches instead of doing anything productive with them and changes in the supply of gold havoc with the money supply whenever there was some event like a gold rush because precious metals were at the base of the monetary    system rushes increased the money supply which resulted in inflation    soaring gold output from the california and australia gold rushes is    linked with a thirty percent increase in wholesale prices between 1850    and likewise right at the end of the century a surge    in gold production reversed a decades long deflationary trend and is    often credited with indebted farmers and helping to end the    populist party ’s strength and its call for a gold and    silver money standard the california gold rush today there is way too little gold production to represent all the growth in world economic activity but we do n't have a gold standard anymore so gold is valuable on its own merits because people want to buy it using money and its price is free to fluctuate when it gets more valuable and people pay more for it mines will go through more effort to locate extract and refine it because it will be more profitable that 's how most commodities work for more information on these of history some in depth articles on

although this is n't related to homes directly as an it professional i know that wind power tends to be cost effective to the point that many data centers the massive buildings holding the servers that are the backbone of the internet actually invest in their own wind turbines to slash costs since servers tend to be power as far as going off the grid that ultimately depends on how much wind sun you 're getting at your residence but if you look at places like dallas pa ca and other areas where   the major hosts place centers they 're typically in areas where there 's plenty of sunlight or wind going back to small scale thinking however one of my contacts actually leases a building in pa where he has a few server racks and while he currently has electric there he also owns a couple of turbines which have been < 60 of the demand and he 's actually planning to add solar and also feed that back to the grid at a profit so overall wind solar definitely has the potential for a decent roi at both large and small levels but performance will vary greatly from area to area   i know that lowes actually started advertising about carrying solar panels so going in and asking about the performance and if you can arrange an audit of your home might be a good place to start if you google green audits i 'm sure you can find a trillion companies specializing in green power but as with any sales rep including at lowe 's i 'd do some due diligence so you do n't get taken for a ride and also to check references because i do n't think green audit companies have any official certifications standards

in theory when you obtained ownership of your usd cash as a canadian resident resident for tax purposes which is generally a quicker timeline than being resident for immigration purposes it is considered to have been obtained by you for the cad equivalent on that date   for example if you on dec 31 2016 and carried $ 10k usd with you when the rate was then canada deems you to have arrived with $ cad if you converted that cad to usd when the rate was 1.39 you would have received cad a gain of $ 400 to show as income on your tax return   receiving the foreign inheritances is a little more complex those items when received may or may not have been taxable on that day however whether or not they were taxable you would calculate a further gain as above if the fx rate gave you more cad when you ultimately converted it if the rate went the other way and you lost cad value you may or may not be able to claim a loss if it was a small loss i would n't bother trying to claim it due to hassle if it 's a large loss i would be very sure to research thoroughly before claiming because something like that probably has a high chance of being audited

there 's no need for an index to have a currency as its purpose is not to act as an asset but rather to signal investors about the performance of a collection of stocks an index can be price weighted meaning that its value equals the arithmetic average of the prices of each stock in the index with no stock splits the return on this index is the same as the return on a portfolio composed of one share of each stock if there is a stock split however instead of dividing by the number of stocks as you normally would when taking the arithmetic average you divide it by the number that will make the value of the index pre stock split arithmetic average equal to the value post stock split then use that dividing number for all periods until a new stock split occurs   an index can be value weighted meaning that its changes in value track the percentage changes in total market capitalization of the stocks in the index price weighted indexes ignore for firm size and percentage changes in price weighted indexes are not robust to stock splits value weighted indexes take firm size into account and are robust to stock splits djia is price weighted s&p 500 is value weighted

in your comment you said it just seems a little stupid to me to go and put away money for the explicit purpose of emergencies presumably in a way that 's somehow different from how you would normally save money seems better to go and treat the money as you would normally and then pull whatever you need from the money that you had saved the problem with that logic is that people save money for many different things   you might save for a vacation or a new refrigerator or a new car or a house or your kids college education   if you pull whatever you need for such expenses you may find that when a real emergency occurs you do n't have enough money   the things you used it for may have been legitimate reasonable expenses but nonetheless you may later wish you had deferred those expenses until after you had built up a cushion so the idea of an emergency fund is to designate certain money that is not to be used for whatever you need but specifically for unforeseen circumstances   of course there can be debate about what counts as an emergency but the main point is to distinguish saving for planned future expenses from saving for unplanned future expenses note that this does n't mean the money has to be in a separate account or saved in any special way   it just means the money has to be considered by you as an emergency fund   for some people it may be psychologically useful to put the emergency fund in a separate account that they never withdraw from   but even if you just have all your money in one savings account and you mentally tell yourself i do n't want to ever let the balance drop below $ 10,000 just so i have a safety cushion then you are effectively designating that $ 10,000 as an emergency fund

i deleted my comment that this was a reply to so i 'll repost it   it was    gt;i do n't know the answer but i 'm pretty sure this is incorrect   you have to take into account the correlations of the securities across the three different markets   it 's definitely not as simple as dividing by three   the reason why i do n't think this is correct is because you can imagine an exchange in which there is only one other security and the asset in question is perfectly correlated and therefore has a beta of 1   you could then have a different exchange with thousands of securities where the asset has a beta of 0.3   the   simple average method would produce a beta of when it 's probably true that the correct answer is closer to 0.3   the solution is not so i do n't think it can be right it neglects the relative sizes of the exchanges and the correlation of the underlying assets with each other   which leads me to consider perhaps the right thing to do is to calculate the returns across all three exchanges and the returns of the asset on all three exchanges do a weighted average and use that variance covariance to calculate the beta across all three exchanges   i 'm not sure what purpose practically such a beta would serve   i think the correct answer is to take the beta of the asset with respect to the largest most diversified exchange   ultimately using a basket of securities like the s&amp;p 500 is just a proxy for the market whatever that means   it does n't truly represent the realm of possibilities for the diversified investor but it 's close enough   tl dr i say pick one exchange and go with it

your gut feeling is absolutely spot on you should n't be worrying about pension now not at the age of 25 assuming that you 're not a in the middle of the most productive part of your career and already have a fat wad of crunchy banknotes under your pillow that you 're looking to set aside for a rainy day when you wo n't be able to play at your prime any longer that does n't mean you should n't invest nor that means that you must n't save there are several factors at play here   first of all as a young person you are likely to have a high tolerance for risk there is still plenty of time to recover should expected returns not even a pension fund with the most aggressive risk return strategy might just not quite do it for you you could invest into education instead improve health obtain a profitable skill create social capital by building connections pay for experience buy a house start a family or even a business next as a young professional you 're unlikely to have reached your full earning potential yet and due to the law of diminishing marginal utility a hundred pounds per month now have greater utility i.e. positive impact on your lifestyle than a seven hundred pounds will in 7 10 years time once your earnings that is to say it 's easier to save £ 700 month from £ 3000 and maintain a reasonable level of personal comfort than carve £ 100 from £ 1300 monthly income and last but not the least lets face it from a human point of view forty years is a very long investment horizon and many things might and will change one of the downsides of uk pensions is that you have very little control over the money until you reach a certain age i suggest saving up to build a cushion consisting of cash or near cash assets the size of the stash should be such that it is enough to cover all of your expenses from a minimum of 2 months to a maximum of a year the exact size will depend on your personal comfort level whatever social net you have parents wife partner and how hard it will be to find a new source of income should the current cease to produce cash on a strategic level you can start looking into investing any surplus cash into the foundation of what will bring joy and happiness into the next 40 years of your life your or your partners training and education is one of the most sensible choices whilst you 're young starting a family is another one both might help you reach you full earning potential much quicker finding what you love to do and learning how to do it really well cash can accelerate this process bringing you quicker there you want to be if you were a start up business in front of a huge market would you rather use cash to pay dividends or finance growth

as other answers and comments suggest you are trying to do something odd to say the least no one wants to use a credit card to finance a checking current account because you are creating a debt on that credit card unless you are in the odd situation where the card is in credit that will immediately start accruing interest at a rate probably in excess of 10 per annum that is not a clever thing to do what you really need to do is find an account that one of you owns that has a positive balance and use an internet banking service to transfer part of that positive balance onto the debit card the other solution is not to use the debit card at all but use the credit card to complete the purchases you are trying to manage with the debit card the reason that bofa and amex customer support ca n't help you is that no one would ever do what you want to do they would either move existing money from another account or ask for a bank loan

a mutual fund could make two different kinds of distributions to you capital gains when the fund liquidates positions that it holds it may realize a gain if it sells the assets for a greater price than the fund purchased them for as an example for an index fund assets may get liquidated if the underlying index changes in composition thus requiring the manager to sell some stocks and purchase others mutual funds are required to distribute most of their income that they generate in this way back to its shareholders many often do this near the end of the calendar year   when you receive the distribution the gains will be categorized as either short term the asset was held for less than one year or long term vice versa based upon the holding period the gain is taxed differently currently in the united states long term capital gains are only taxed at 15 regardless of your income tax bracket you only pay the capital gains tax not the income tax short term capital gains are treated as ordinary income so you will pay your probably higher tax rate on any cash that you are given by your mutual fund you may also be subject to capital gains taxes when you decide to sell your holdings in the fund any profit that you made based on the difference between your purchase and sale price is treated as a capital gain based upon the period of time that you held the mutual fund shares it is categorized as a short- or long term gain and is taxed accordingly in the tax year that you sell the shares dividends many companies pay dividends to their stockholders as a way of returning a portion of their profits to their collective owners when you invest in a mutual fund that owns dividend paying stocks the fund is the owner that receives the dividend payments as with capital gains mutual funds will redistribute these dividends to you periodically often quarterly or annually the main difference with dividends is that they are always taxed as ordinary income no matter how long you or the fund have held the asset i 'm not aware of texas state tax laws so i ca n't comment on your other question

i 've addressed some of the problems with the new fiduciary rule in other threads but basically no one is arguing that advisors should n't be fiduciaries of course they should and the vast majority do what this rule effectively does is simply alter the way that advisors are compensated on retirement assets such as 401(k 's by forcing them to hold these assets in ria accounts this is not necessarily in the best interest of the client yes i am aware of the best interest contract exemption or perhaps more importantly these types of regulations should be handled by one of the already existing regulator bodies the sec or finra to bring in the dol as a third regulatory body is a bit redundant to say the least   i think a far easier solution in concept at least is that any finra registered advisor which is basically all advisors aside from pure insurance agents should be held to the fiduciary standard and not simply the suitability standard

you have a sequence of questions here so a sequence of answers if you stopped at the point where you had multiple wins with a net profit of $ 72 then you would pay regular income tax on that $ 72 it 's a short term capital gain which does not get special tax treatment and the fact that you made it on multiple transactions does not matter when you enter your next transaction that takes the hypothetical loss the question gets more complicated in either case you are paying a percentage on net gains   if you took a two year view in the second case and you do n't have anything to offset your loss in the second year then i guess you could say that you paid more tax than you won in the total sequence of trades over the two years although you picked a sequence of trades where it does not appear to play if you 're going to pursue this type of strategy then you are likely at some point to run into a case where the wash sale rules apply so you should be aware of that   you can find information on this elsewhere on this site and also for example here   basically these rules require you to defer recording a loss under some circumstances where you have rapid wins and losses on substantially identical securities edit a slight correction you can take part of your losses in the second year even if you have no off setting gain   from the irs if your capital losses exceed your capital gains the amount of the excess loss that you can claim on line 13 of form 1040 to lower your income is the lesser of $ 3,000 $ 1,500 if you are married filing separately

what asset allocation is right for you at the most basic the percentage if stocks vs bonds at the advanced level percentage of growth vs value international vs domestic etc is a function of your age retirement goals income stability and employment prospects until retirement   roth ira is to this   now once you have your allocation worked out there are tactical tax advantage decisions available interest income reit and mlp dividends are taxed at income and not capital gains rate so the tactical decision is to put these investments in tax advantage accounts like roth and 401ks   conversely should you decide to buy and hold growth stocks there are tactical advantages to keeping them in a taxable account you get tax deferment until the year you choose to sell barring a takeover you get the lower lt cap gains rate and you can employ tax loss harvesting

dividend yield is a tough thing to track because it 's a moving target   dividends are paid periodically the yield is calculated based on the stock price when the dividend is declared usually though some services may update this more frequently    i like to calculate my own dividend by the dividend payment divided by my cost basis per share   as an example say you have shares in x co.   x issues a quarterly dividend of $ 1 per share and the share price is $ 100 coincidentally this is the price at which you purchased your shares but a few years goes by and now x issues it 's quarterly dividend of $ 1.50 per share and the share price is $ 160 however your shares only cost you $ 100 your annual yield on x is 6 not the published 3.75   all of this is to say that looking back on dividend yields is somewhat similar to nailing to the wall   do you look at actual dividends paid through the year divided by share price   do you look at the annualized dividend at the time of issue then average those   the stock price will fluctuate that will change the yield depending on where you bought your stock your actual yield will vary from the published amount as well

it really varies based on the stock volatility is the main determining factor and whether you are talking about temporary or permanent price impact   how long you are trading etc the below paper fits a functional form to a set of citigroup data and estimates for a 10 trade in a large cap like ibm the price would move on the order of presumably would be more expensive their estimate seems a bit low to me but i 'm more familiar with futures so maybe it 's not unreasonable

if you bought 5 shares $ 20 each that would cost you $ 100 plus brokerage even if your brokerage was only $ 10 in and out your shares would have to go up 20 just for you to break even you do n't make a profit until you sell so just for you to break even your shares need to go up to $ 24 per share because your share holding would be so small the brokerage even the cheapest around would end up being a large percentage cost of any overall profits if instead you had bought 500 shares at $ 20 being $ 1000 the $ 20 brokerage in and out only represents 2 instead of 20 this is called economies of scale

if you can get a mortgage with 10 downpayment and the seller will accept some may want at least 20 downpayment for whatever reasons and with pmi it still lower than your rent sounds like it 's a good idea to buy now   of course this assumes that the money you 'd be otherwise saving for 20 downpayment will be used to pay off a mortgage faster

sure user data is valuable but valuable enough to be their business model the math does n't add up   if the data is that valuable then why even charge users in the first place letting people in free would certainly generate even more data definitely more than what they would have gotten at their $ 10 price point if they get twice as many people to jump in at the free price level not a far fetched assumption then they would make enough additional money to justify giving it away   and after a certain point additional data stops being statistically significant while costs continue to mount paying for all those additional tickets   furthermore the ceo has already said that their business model is to share the additional revenue with the theaters   i 'm not saying that they wo n't mine their data they would be fools not to and they will definitely be able to monetize it but it 's not possible for that alone to be their business model how can it every time they send someone to a new movie it costs them the full ticket price

the question is how does $ for 6.5 years fit into your budget or to put it another way what wo n't you be spending that money on housing food vacations retirement fund investments though you can invest your car fund in the meantime building a hefty emergency fund kids college funds saving for a down payment on a home charity etc are all other places that money could go i do n't know what your needs are today let alone 6.5 years into the future but i 'd encourage you to consider all your financial goals and evaluate where this expense would fit   it seems your plan is to save up to the total cost of the car and then buy it in cash that 's a valid strategy but it means you 'll have no car unless you already own one for 6.5 years   do you need a car if so what will you drive in the meantime and even if you already own another car outright you 'll have gas and maintenance expenses if you do n't need a car then $ 100,000 is a rather extravagant purchase for something we just established you do n't need would you be happier having this expensive car in 6.5 years or having a series of less expensive cars starting now or buying a used model of the expensive car sooner or having no car at all also a lot can change in 6.5 years cars will evolve and there 'll be different models and options available maybe your salary will have doubled or maybe you 'll be unemployed you could be living in a different city have a different commute and maybe you 'll need a minivan to haul kids around or live in a place with bad winters and want a drive you 'll also need to be prepared for the additional expenses that generally come with expensive cars such as higher insurance and maintenance rates and parking could be costly if you live in an expensive city   the other option of course if the car is truly something you need want and can afford would be to save up a sizable down payment and finance the rest so you can get the car sooner finally there 's nothing wrong with saving your money for 6.5 years building up that fund and then what makes the most sense for you at that time maybe it will the car maybe something else but the nice thing about having savings is that it gives you more options

you actually do n't need an accountant they 'll be expensive and at this early a stage unnecessary what you need is a good bookkeeper who can keep track of what comes in and what goes out you 'll need that to know if you 're making money or not and to show the government at the end of the year get a copy of quickbooks and pick up bookkeeping for dummies to at least get a sense for what 's going on   have you registered as a sole proprietorship make sure you have a vendor 's permit so you can legally sell your services in ontario you may need to collect hst in which case you 'll need to register for an hst and submit it on a quarterly basis    whatever you do do n't fuck with the government they can freeze your bank accounts to get money they 're owed you need to keep money on hand to pay for any taxes you might owe on the business especially if it 's a sole proprietorship where you 'll be tempted to treat profit as income you do n't want to end up with nothing in the bank at the end of the year and $ 40k owing to the cra   get a separate bank account do n't mix personal and business it 's messy   expense everything you reasonably can

i would suggest you forget everything you learned in economics the only applicable knowledge is accounting 101   step 1 an accrual basis financial statement there is no step 2 if you do n't do this most small business do everything cash basis simpler cheaper but useless for analysis you would get better answers from the local fortune teller than a cash basis statement    make one change from the general rules if you have debt or are paying interest for inventory include that in your cost of sales this is actually proper but the rule is little known and often ignored interest on debt up to the amount of inventory is a cost of inventory   step 2 gross profit if you seem to be working hard and still losing money it may be because you are selling products for less than they cost you in this case the more you sell the more you lose so suggestions like advertising or doing anything to increase sales are actually destructive   step 3 price products at the level necessary to turn a profit at current sales and overhead when we have enough sales we will make a profit is the philosophy of a start up business it is toxic for a going concern   step 4 if sales are unsustainable at the price that produces a profit have the courage to sell or close the business i have seen people waste their lives on futile endeavors just because they ca n't make that tough decision   finally step 0 ignore all other suggestions but this they are well meaning but ill informed to reiterate growing sales while losing money on every transaction is a huge mistake trends books charts and graphs analytics and market research are the tools of con men and fortune tellers business is arithmetic and nothing more or less   fyi if i do n't get at least one upvote this is the last time i am giving my valuable professional advice away for free on reddit folks will have to rely on the suggestions of their fellow college kids

if it were n't for the anti government sentiment preventing it you could get the same effect simply by having the government hire a lot more people at the low end of the socioeconomic scale people like teachers firefighters etc especially if that hiring included proper training for people who did n't already have it   this would create a defacto minimum wage since private industry would have to compete for workers without requiring them by law to adhere to some predefined compensation packages   this would have a been a much better way to use the hundreds of billions that the fed has used to provide stimulus to the economy instead giving it to the big banks amp letting them play securities games with it   of course with the anti government sentiment and the lack of ability to control how the big bucks get handed out to political donor industries fat chance of a straightforward solution like this ever being implemented

they believe that it reduces the risk that revenue canada will deem you to be an employee and make them pay a whole pile of tax ei cpp and so on that should have been paid if you had been hired as an employee it 's my recollection that the employer gets dinged for both the employee and employer share of those withholdings and generally the employer 's share is larger than yours so they really want to prevent it there 's a revenue canada publication about whether you 're an employee or not there 's nothing on it about being incorporated but still employers feel more protected when their contracts are incorporated   we did work as a sole proprietorship at the very beginning so that we could deduct our losses against employment income earned earlier in the year before we started the business you can find clients who will take you on we incorporated once the losses were over with basically we had bought the equipment and office supplies we needed to get started it 's a simple and relatively inexpensive thing to do and gives clients a sense of protection it wo n't protect you from your own poor decisions since you 'll be a director of the firm

the issues of trading with unsettled funds are usually restricted to cash accounts   with margin i 've never personally heard of a rule that will catch you in this scenario   you wo n't be able to withdraw funds that are tied up in unsettled positions until the positions settle   you should be able to trade those funds   i 've never heard of a broker charging margin interest on unsettled funds but that does n't mean there is n't a broker somewhere that does brokers are allowed to impose their own restrictions however since margin is basically offering you a line of credit   you should check to see if your broker has more restrictive rules i 'd guess that you may have heard about restrictions that apply to cash accounts and think they may also apply to margin accounts   if that 's the case and you want to learn more about the rules generally try searching for these terms you should be able to find a lot of clear resources on those terms   here 's one that 's current and provides examples on a margin account you avoid these issue because the margin essentially a loan from your broker provides a cushion additional funds that avoid the issues   it is possible that if you over extend yourself that you 'll get a margin call but that seems to be different than what you 're asking and maybe worth a new question if you want to know about that

as joetaxpayer notes in his comment answers to this are really just opinions so here 's mine for what it 's worth if your risk tolerance is 5 out of 5 you should n't have anything in treasuries   those are basically the most conservative of all investments   this would probably mean no tips as well   if you 're more like 4.5 out of 5 you could have some but just a little a 30 allocation to government securities is quite conservative   if you want to diversify across different asset classes you could consider a bond fund like for instance vbmfx the vanguard total bond market index fund   your portfolio does n't currently contain any non government bonds which is something to consider 20 seems like quite a large allocation to reits   most sample portfolios i 've seen allocate no more than 10 to reits often no more than 5   there are some that have more like the 20 you 're but you might want to ponder that a bit more especially in light of your concerns about reits being at an all time high as for your question about all time highs it 's reasonable to think about but i think waiting for 30 50 off all time highs is unrealistic   looking at a chart of vfinx essentially the s&p 500 i see that at the of the recent downturn in early 2009 the market was at about 50 of its pre crash all time high   at the of the dot com bust the market was about 45 off its pre crash high   if you 're waiting for it to be 50 off it 's all time high you 're not just waiting for a good time to invest you 're waiting for a major crash it could certainly make sense not to immediately put everything into us stocks but that does n't mean you should put nothing in   as commented you could put some of the money in and then gradually add the rest over time reducing the risk of buying at the peak   this can also reduce the psychological of worrying about whether you 're doing the right thing which is worth taking into account   also note that if you get rid of the treasuries you eliminate a good chunk of the stuff that you thought was too close to the peak anyway your two basic points asset allocation and low cost funds have a strong boglehead flavor   you may already have looked at the bogleheads wiki if not you should take a look   if you are comfortable with that philosophy and i think it 's a sound one you should remember that part of that philosophy is not worrying about timing the market   you pursue a buy and hold strategy if you believe the market will go up in the long term and do n't care much about what it does in the short term   that said as mentioned above you might want to ease in your investment over time rather than buying all at once if only to avoid tearing your hair out if the market goes down in the short term incidentally your proposed portfolio is similar to this one that they mention although as i said above i think this is too conservative if you are 30 years old and consider yourself a 5 out of 5 in terms of risk tolerance   i 'm not sure if you already saw that in your research but since that portfolio apparently has a name and is known you might be able to find information about its risks and benefits by searching for discussion of it by name

a credit card is basically a revolving loan in which you 're allowed to borrow up to a certain amount the limit and any time you borrow you pay interest   if you were to borrow $ 100 to pay for something via a credit card you 'd have a $ 100 balance on the card if you then pay $ 70 cash to the card there would be $ 30 remaining   that $ 30 balance could accrue interest the timing of that interest charge could vary the 20 you 've quoted is almost certainly apr of which the a stands for annual so that 20 would be an annual rate   it makes the most sense mind you to keep a minimal balance on a credit card as the interest rate is higher than most other loans

yes this is related to our economy   you see israel is basically a jewish state and has spent the last 50 years killing unarmed women and children in palestine and building illegal settlements they as a part of government policy deny their own arab citizens rights and as such are not a democracy they are an apartheid state   now jews are jews first and then any thing else like for instance american citizens they are jews first and will always put first   well that s all fine but jews also control the us economy and exert a great deal of control on the us politics via their control of the purse strings   but america is supposed to be the of democracy and human rights and is forced to publicly   support israel which is now known to the world as an apartheid state and a of and strife and the root cause of terrorism and therefor by aligning with the israeli 's and giving them weapons and military aid america shows it self as a hypocritical liar and a shallow state and grow in its isolation   all the while israel keeps about war and iran and syria and now russia and forcing america to its own destruction while siphoning off all the fat from the us economy into jewish pockets   that village is the death of the us economy

what kind of deductions are you talking about many deductions like the standard itemized deductions come after the agi and do not affect the agi so i do n't see how this would make any difference maybe you are talking about deductions that come before the agi if you want to increase your agi legitimately here 's a way every year itemize deductions on your federal return and over withhold your state income tax assuming your state has income tax by a lot and/or make voluntary extra payments to your state income tax as a result you will get a huge refund on your state taxes the following year then you will need to include this refund as income on line 10 of the federal return that year which will be included in the agi of course you will also be able to deduct a lot of state income tax paid every year in the federal itemized deductions but those come after the agi

simply put the government has no balls to fight corruption   ideally the government would have enough people to oversee and make sure corruption like this does n't happen but the politicians cut a lot of money out for this type of enforcement primarily because they had money donated to them by these same businesses this looks great for the politician as it looks like they 're cutting government fat let 's say something like a hundred million dollars these fleece these companies and when they go under they plead and beg the government to bail them out or else they 'll have to fire all these people and it 'll kill the economy so the government steps in and bails out these companies for a few billion now they look like they are being proactive and saving the economy   all at the expense of you of course it 's too bad politicians do n't do what they believe is best but do what their donors believe is best for themselves

that depends where you put the top bracket but probably there is little way to jack income tax to anywhere near that without serious detrimental effect to the economy the real issue is not that the wealthiest earn too much but that they have too much there is a huge glut of massive savings at the top that is continually growing and taking money from the economy this savings drives the creation of public debt more than any other factor it is that which needs to be at least in the near term taxed aggressively

in order to short a stock you have to borrow the number of shares that you 're shorting from someone else who holds the shares so that you can deliver the shares you 're shorting if it becomes necessary to do so usually there 's also naked short selling where you do n't have to do this but it 's banned in a number of jurisdictions including the us if a stock has poor liquidity or is in high demand for shorting then it may well be impossible to find anyone from whom it can be borrowed which is what has happened in this instance

gt upfront investment cost to create a contemporary business is challenging today and this is before a firm anticipation of the cost of labour declining in developed nations    yes today   but i think part of this future is where these costs come down due to advanced technology   look at 3d printing as an example   it 's new and expensive now but when these things are $ 99 at staples and capable of printing high quality plastic parts you essentially give every single person the ability to buy a cheap factory for his home   this helps greatly distribute and the means of production and possibly even get around copyright and with open source like   this is how i see the future in the world described in the video   cheap advanced technology that replaces human labor   when the cost of a labor robot is in the price range of 90 of the public you wo n't have to work   every human will have robots working on their behalf   i think the video warns of a future where these robots exist but they 're only owned by the rich   i think that 's the wrong prediction   that is n't how technology works   they even go over that in the video   how computers every year get cheaper and more powerful   same goes with 3d printing they get more powerful and cheaper by the day   same will go for labor robots   so it 's not that every person is going to have to operate their own small business though it will probably increase entrepreneurship which is a great thing it just means that each individual will have the means to produce without actually laboring

just came across this news companies moving abroad no substitute corporate tax reform how stop article they make it sound quite straight forward and i do n't think they can be called totalitarian leftists by any stretch   here is the money quote   gt america ’s corporate tax has two horrible flaws the first is the tax rate which at 35 is the highest among the 34 mostly rich country members of the oecd yet it raises less revenue than the oecd average thanks to myriad loopholes and tax breaks aimed at everything from machinery investment to nascar race tracks last year these breaks cost $ 150 billion in forgone revenue more than half of what america collected in total corporate taxes gt   gt the second flaw is that america levies tax on a company ’s income no matter where in the world it is earned in contrast every other large rich country taxes only income earned within its borders here too america ’s system is absurdly ineffective at collecting money firms do not have to pay tax on foreign profits until they bring them back home not surprisingly many do not american multinationals have some $ 2 trillion sitting on their foreign balance sheets and growing    it seems clear that the 35 rate is not the driving reason for these huge companies doing inversions that 35 rate should almost certainly be cut down but the loopholes and tax breaks need to stop as a condition of a rate cut    clearly this is not a dead simple issue but i just do n't want to hear the silly argument of oh our poor mega corporations are having to pay the highest taxes in the world when the tax environment in the us is clearly rigged in their favor small and mid sized companies that ca n't afford their own congressman sure are getting fucked though and that makes me sad

your hypothetical money market account parallel basically nails it   you understand exactly how the math works   irr computes a rate at which your money market account would have to pay interest in order to match whatever investment you are comparing to that said there are two major complicating factors to consider your hypothetical account would have to not only pay interest but also lend money at exactly the irr rate   in reality of course it never happens this way   you may be able to lend invest at x but to borrow you 're going to have to pay y.   irr simplifies away that issue in order to give us a single number   that number can be very handy for comparison to other competing hypothetical investments but it does not capture that fundamental issue of lending rate vs. borrowing rate an irr calculation assumes implicitly that all cash flows outgoing and incoming are known and fixed that is risk free   it makes no allowance whatever for risk and all investments have some level of risk   two investments that compute to the same irr might have hugely different risk around their cashflows and so not be a close decision at all   to compare those investments you might go to a measure like risk adjusted return on capital   but that 's much harder and more subjective because it requires some numerical measurement of risk

from paul and mike of the 101 years of global investment returns princeton princeton university press 2002 the small firm effect has not proved the road to    great riches since soon after its discovery the us size premium went    into reverse this was repeated in the united kingdom and virtually    all other markets around the world despite their disappointing performance in recent years the very    long run record of small caps remains one of outperformance in both    the united states and the united kingdom furthermore and    small size companies are still an important asset class their    differential performance over long periods of history shows that there    is useful scope for investors to reduce risk by diversifying across    the large and the small capitalization sectors of the market    furthermore given the of the size effect across the    entire size spectrum it is important to all investors since the    size tilt of any portfolio will strongly influence its short- and    long run performance this holds true whether there is a size premium    or a size discount the size effect has certainly proved persistent    and robust what is at issue is whether we should continue to expect a    size premium over the longer haul and accompanying charts     and one chart from blackrock

the house that sells for $ 200,000 might rent for a range of monthly numbers 3 would be $ or $ 500/mo this is absurdly low and favors renting not buying 9 is $ in which case buying the house to live in or rent out as a landlord is the better choice at this level paying rent should be avoided   i 'm simply explaining the author 's view not advocating it   a quote from the article   annual rent purchase price = 3 means do not buy prices are too    high annual rent purchase price = 6 means borderline annual rent purchase price = 9 means ok to buy prices are    reasonable edit to respond to chuck 's comment mortgage rates for qualified applicants are pretty tight from low to high the 30 year is about 4.4 and the 15 of course a number of factors might mean paying more but this is the average rate and it changes over time but the rent and purchase price in a given area will be different very different based on location see what you 'd pay for 2000 sq feet in manhattan vs a nice town in the mid west one can imagine a heat map when an area might show an $ 800 rent on a house selling for $ 40,000 as a the home price divided by annual rent and another area as a 20 where the $ 200 k house might rent for $ it 's not homogeneous through the us as i said i 'm not taking a position just discussing how the author formulated his approach the author makes some assertions that can be debatable e.g. that low rates are a bad time to buy because they already pushed the price too high in my opinion the us has had the crash but the rates are still low buying is a personal decision and the own rent ratios are only one tool to be added to a list of factors in making the decision   of course the article as written does the math based on the rates at time of publication and the ratio of income to mortgage one can afford is tied to the current rate the $ 60 k couple at 4 can afford just over a $ 260 k mortgage but at 6 $ k and 8 $ the struggle is n't with the payment but the downpayment    the analysis is n't too different for a purchase to invest if the rent exceeds 1 of the home price an investor should be able to turn a profit after expenses

the stock price is not only based on the general market trend and the stock 's current profitability and prospects but is also based on prediction of how the stock 's prospects might change in the future in almost every case there are professional investors analysing the stock 's future prospects and considering whether it 's over or under values for its current price however even professionals can be totally wrong   if you feel like you have a good grasp on whether the stock will have improving or declining prospects over time then you might be if you 're right equipped to make a sensible decision on whether to hold the stock or not if you do n't think you have a good understanding about the stock then an understanding of the general market direction might at least make stock in general worth holding otherwise you are simply taking a if you know of another stock that has better prospects then ask yourself why you would hold onto the stock that you think will perform worse   but also bear in mind that in my understanding research has shown that on average people who try to pick stocks rarely do better than a random selection and more stock trades means more brokerage which thanks to brokerage losses would mean you will end up doing worse than average unless you really do know better than the market

you actually have a few options first you can do a share split and then sell an equal number of shares from both you and your wife to maintain parity second you can have the company issue additional shares convert shares and then have the company sell the appropriate percentage to the third party while the rest is distributed to you and your wife third you can have the company issue a separate class of stock for example there are companies that have voting stock and non voting stock depending on your goal you could just issue non voting stock and sell that   best bet is to contact a lawyer who specializes in this type of work and have them recommend a course of action one caveat that has not been mentioned is that what how you do this will also depend on the type of corporation that you have created

every year you save your receipts track your expenses and when april comes around pay your taxes but what if you know of someone who is n't as honest as you are someone who on their income or information in order to be placed in a lower bracket   the internal revenue service irs estimates that americans underpay their articles tax by about $ billion every year according to barron 's the popular financial news website and magazine in fiscal 2009 the irs collected $ billion in enforcement revenue this process required the employment of thousands of revenue officers agents and special agents unfortunately this type of enforcement happens every year and often spans to multiple previous years in the end there is still a large amount of tax money that goes unpaid   there 's definitely a gap between the tax and the irs evaders are usually exposed due to a slip up on their part or a tip from a bystander if you 'd like to help close that gap you can but why should you and how is it done   why help the irs   nobody likes paying more than their fair share of taxes in order to compensate for others who intentionally evade theirs why should n't tax evaders give up a portion of their incomes to provide things that benefit the general good like roads and when you do reporting a tax cheat is like reporting a you 're just asking them to pay for something they 're trying to unfairly get for free   gather the evidence   the irs is not likely to pursue someone without good reason if the time and resources are going to be spent the odds need to be good that the efforts will result in a payoff besides determining who what where when and why the person his or her taxes the irs will need specific information type of violation availability of books or records having a hunch without supporting details just is n't good enough   also ensure that the evasion is financially significant enough for example stating that your neighbor failed to report a $ 50 babysitting earning is not going to interest the irs on the other hand if you work for a large business that you suspect is its income the irs will likely be very interested   blowing the whistle on a tax cheat   the irs may pay awards in exchange for valuable information that leads to the collection of taxes penalties interest or other amounts from the taxpayer according to the agency 's website there are various types of awards granted depending on the 's income level and classification business or individual the irs likely chooses to focus its efforts on these larger cases because they have a higher payoff it has also been suggested that higher income individuals have been found to cheat more frequently and for higher sums of money mostly because they tend to earn more self reported income   cover your assets   a complaint in order to spite an undesirable neighbor who does in fact pay taxes is not a good way to get revenge when you sign off on the irs form providing your report you are stating i declare under penalty of perjury that i have examined this application my accompanying statement and supporting documentation and that such application is true correct and complete to the best of my knowledge you do n't want to be found guilty of perjury   keep it legal   breaking into the cfo 's office at work to get evidence to support your claim is not a good idea the irs does n't want you to break the law to help find a tax cheat however if you are the bookkeeper for a company that is cheating on its taxes and part of your job involves working with documents that prove the company is cheating that paperwork would be acceptable to submit to the irs   while the irs wants to maintain your privacy if the case against the person you report ends up going to trial you could be asked to be a witness if you 're comfortable with that possibility go ahead and put your name on the report   reasons not to report a cheat   if your information is really just speculation it 's probably best to keep it to yourself as explained earlier in this article the irs does not have the resources to pursue your hunch   if you yourself are a tax cheat it might be best to stay in the clear there 's nothing that says that people who submit claims of cheating by others will have their own tax returns examined more carefully still it stands to reason that you would n't want to do anything to call irs attention to yourself if you 're not in compliance with its rules   if you helped plan or initiate the cheating of the person you are reporting it might be smart to think twice if you decide to report a crime in which you took part be prepared for the consequences and definitely do n't expect to receive a reward   as with many government processes there 's a lot of red tape to cut through therefore if you 're looking for fast cash you might want to look elsewhere it can take several years to complete an investigation of tax evasion and if there is no conviction there is no award not only does the irs have to determine guilt it has to actually collect the amount owed before paying you what 's more if the irs determines that your tip did not substantially contributed to the service 's detection and recovery of tax you will not receive an award   it 's also important to note that under some circumstances like attorney client confidentiality you may not be able to report tax cheating   other considerations   if you earn a whistle blower award it will need to be reported when you file your taxes if you 're blowing the whistle on your employer and you 're not planning to change jobs an irs audit could make your work situation extremely unpleasant this is n't to say that you should n't report someone who is cheating but it is something to consider   what 's next   if you decide to report the person or business you suspect of cheating use irs this form asks for basic information on the tax you are reporting the types of violations you believe to be committed the details of the violation and how you learned about it if you do not want to fill out this form you can also simply write the irs a letter if you are providing your name and want the possibility of receiving an award also submit irs form which is an application for the award   the bottom line   underpayment of federal income taxes and subsequently state income taxes is a serious problem the irs encourages people to submit tips by allowing anonymous submissions and offering generous rewards for who are willing to identify themselves if you can substantiate your claims and are willing to accept the potential consequences of reporting a tax cheat can be lucrative not only for the government but also for you   take control of your money    whether you ’re buying a home consolidating debt or planning a

lenders pay attention to where your down payment money comes from if they see a large transfer of money into your bank account within about a year before your purchase this will cause an issue for you down payments are not just there to make the principal smaller they are primarily used as an underwriting data point to assess your quality as a borrower if you take the money as loan it will count against your credit worthiness if you take the money as a gift it will raise some other red flags all of this is done for a reason if you ca n't get a down payment you are a higher credit risk poor discipline lack of consistent income even if you can currently pay the monthly cost of a mortgage   ps the cost of home ownership is much higher than the monthly mortgage payment will all this mean you won't get a loan of course not you can almost always get some loan but it will likely be at a higher rate than you otherwise would qualify for if you just waited a little bit and saved money for a down payment   another option cheaper house edit the below comments provide examples where gifts were are not a problem my experience from buying a house just a few years ago and my several friends who bought house in the same period some with family gifts and some without is that it is an issue your best bet is to talk in person with an actual mortgage broker in your area who can go through the options with you and the downsides to various approaches

typically mutual funds will report an annualized return it 's probably an average of 8 per year from the date of inception of the fund that at least gives some basis of comparison if you 're looking at funds of different ages they will also often report annualized 1- 3- 5- and year returns which are probably better basis of comparison since they will have experience the same market booms and busts   so yes generally that 8 gets compounded yearly on average at that rate you 'd get your investment doubled in roughly 9 years on average of course past performance ca n't guarantee future results and all that and variation is often significant with returns that high might be 15 one year -2 the next etc hence my emphasis on specifying on average edit based on the fund given in the comments so in your fund the times less than a year 1 mo 3 mo 6 mo 1 yr is the actual relative change that of fund in that time period anything greater is averaged using cagr approach for example the most recent 3 year period probably ending end of last month had a averaged return 2014 2015 and 2016 had individual returns of and thus that total return over that three year period was = 21 return over three years this is the same total growth that would be achieved if each year saw consistent 6.5 growth ^ 3 =   not exactly the but remember we 're looking at a slightly different time window but it 's pretty close and hopefully helps clarify how the calculation is done

it really depends on what your goals are   if your intent is to benefit the charity i 'm sure that they would tell you that the sooner you give them the money the better if they think that the money would do them more good invested then spent they will invest it   the money you have sitting in your charitable account does n't benefit anyone until you give it away it really does n't benefit you either you take your tax deduction when you contribute and it is really out of your hands at this point   the only reason i could see for using a charitable account this way is if you do n't know who you want to give money to if this is the case you can contribute money to your charitable account now and take the tax deduction now and wait to identify a worthy charity later   but if i were you i would n't wait too long to find someone to give the money to there are lots of good organizations that would do a lot of good with that money and the sooner they get it the better if you skip the charitable account and donate directly to them on a regular basis you can experience the joy of partnering with a charity to help people if you decide in the future to switch to a different charity then you do so waiting until the right time to donate does n't really do anyone any good

reasons for no in your first sentence you say something interesting rates low   prices high   actually those 2 are correlated imagine if rates would be 5 higher very few people could buy at current prices so prices would drop also you need to keep in mind the rate of inflation that was much higher during some periods in the us example over 10 in the 1980 so you can not make comparisons just based on the nominal interest rate putting all your eggs in one basket if you think real estate is a good investment buy some reits for 10k do not spend 20 of your future income for 20 years maintenance people who rent usually underestimate this or do not even count it when making rent vs mortgage comparisons reasons for yes    lifestyle decision you do n't want to be kicked out of your house you want to remodel      speculation i would recommend against this strongly but housing prices go up and down if they will go up you can make a lot      of money to answer one of questions directly 1 my guess is that fed will try to keep rates well 10 even much lower since government can not service debts if interest rates go much higher but nobody can say if they will succeed

i disagree i believe money should be invested not spent investing is something you should do as early as possible even especially before incurring personal debt such as cars houses student loans etc as warren buffet says delaying investment until you are all paid up is like saving sex for your old age remember that you are considering an investment not another expense the only consideration is whether or not the property will be cashflow positive i.e. does it make more in rent than it costs to maintain if it is buy it you can use the income to pay off those debts faster and at the end you will still have the income stream second it makes no sense to use all your cash when the bank is willing to lend you money there is nothing wrong with debt as long as it is attached to an asset i.e. something that makes more money than it costs if you have that much cash buy several apartment buildings hire a management company and retire

daniel covered the correct way to file on the returns i 'm in specifically to discuss the question of whether it could be a gift the irs will classify it as a tip even if the person giving it says it 's a gift if a service was rendered before the gift was given the only way that you could make a case to the irs that it was a gift is if you have a personal relationship outside of the working environment and the person giving the gift provides an explanation for the motivation behind the gift   such explanations as happy birthday or congratulations on graduating or other special occasions could be gifts but you did a good job and i just want to reward you for your effort is not a reason someone gives a gift and the irs will penalize you if you do not have evidence that it was a gift rather than a tip

are you trying to get someone to do your homework for you   this question has been answered repeatedly in the negative by everyone who actually studies the economy   read model and learn this stuff   you can see why currency regimes like the euro make sense from a theoretical stand point but where flexible exchange rates are a welcome release valve for pressures   you obviously have never studied economics hyper inflation does n't happen becuase of floating rates   hyperinflation happens when people lose faith in the governing body regardless of who that is   you think political regimes wo n't change just because there is one currency   no they will still spent 1.05 for every dollar they bring in taxes   hyperinflation is not a problem of floating exchange rates it does n't follow from any causal relationship

the auction market is where investors such you and me as well as market makers buy and sell securities   the auction markets operate with the familiar bid ask pricing that you see on financial pages such as google and yahoo   the market makers are institutions that are there to provide liquidity so that investors can easily buy and sell shares at a fair price market makers need to have on hand a suitable supply of shares to meet investor demands   when market makers feel the need to either increase or decrease their supply of a particular security quickly they turn to the dealer market in order to participate in a dealer market you must be designated a market maker   as noted already market makers are dedicated to providing liquidity for the auction market in certain securities and therefore require that they have on hand a suitable supply of those securities which they support   for example if a market maker for apple shares is low on their supply of apple shares then will go the dealer market to purchase more apple shares   conversely if they are holding what they feel are too many apple shares they will go to the dealer market to sell apple shares   the dealer market does operate on a bid ask basis contrary to your stated understanding the bid ask prices quoted on the dealer market are more or less identical to those on the auction market except the quote sizes will be generally much larger this is the case because otherwise why would a market maker offer to sell shares to another market maker at a price well below what they could themselves sell them for in the auction market   and similarly with buy orders   if market makers are generally holding low quantities of a particular security this will drive up the price in both the dealer market and the auction market similarly if market makers are generally holding too much of a particular security this may drive down prices on both the auction market and the dealer market

why should i have any bias in favour of my local economy the main reason is because your expenses are in the local currency    if you are planning on spending most of your money on foreign travel that 's one thing   but for most of us the bulk of our expenses are incurred locally   so it makes sense for us to invest in things where the investment return is local    you might argue that you can always exchange foreign results into local currency and that 's true   but then you have two risks   one risk you 'll have anywhere   your investments may go down   the other risk with a foreign investment is that the currency may lose value relative to your currency   if that happens even a good performing investment can go down in terms of what it can return to you   that fund denominated in your currency is really doing these conversions behind the scenes    unless the bulk of your purchases are from imports and have prices that fluctuate with your currency you will probably be better off in local investments   as a rough rule of thumb your country 's import percentage is a good estimate of how much you should invest globally   that looks to be about 20 for australia   so consider something like 50 local stocks 20 local bonds 15 foreign stocks 5 foreign bonds and 10 local cash   that will insulate you a bit from a weak local currency while not leaving you out to dry with a strong local currency    it 's possible that your particular expenses might be more or less vulnerable to foreign price fluctuations than the typical   but hopefully this gives you a starting point until you can come up with a way of estimating your personal vulnerability

before starting with investing you should make sure you are saving enough   living in a welfare country france does not exempt you from potentially needing to save large amounts of money you state that you do not need much of an emergency day fund but this is not true   being dismissed from your job is not the only way to become unemployed and not all roads lead to unemployment pay   being fired for cause or leaving your job voluntarily are two work related causes that will leave you without an income source   unexpected major expenses are another reason you might need to dip into your emergency fund if your emergency fund is in order the next thing to investigate is your pension and saving for retirement   in a country with a strong pension system you need to check how comfortable you are with its sustainability greece anyone and also whether it will adequately meet your needs   if not there are no 401ks or iras in france but there is a relatively new personal supplementary pension plan that you might investigate contributing to if you 're comfortable with your emergency fund and your retirement savings then preparing for buying a house is likely your next savings goal   a quick search shows that to get a mortgage to buy a house in france banks will commonly require a downpayment of 20 plus various closing costs   see for example here   this is 40,000 + euro for a 200k euro house which will take you several years at the rate of 500 euro month   france has special plans plan with tax exempt interest for saving up for a house that you might want to investigate in your other question you also ask about buying a cheap car   as you get older and possibly start a family having a car will likely become more of a necessity   this is another goal you can save for rather than having to take a loan out when you buy one

there 's a couple of considerations here    firstly would this activity count as trading if you 're trading you are legally required to register as self employed   the line between a hobby activity and trading can be blurred but a key feature is whether you 're aiming to make a profit whether you manage it or not secondly are you actually making any money   even if what you 're doing counts as self employment self employed people pay tax on the profits they make from their activities not on the total amount of money they take in   if you spend all the money you take in on keeping the server running then you 're not making any profit so there 's nothing to pay tax on

there 's really not a simple yes no answer   it depends on whether you 're doing short term trading or long term investing   in the short term it 's not much different from sports betting and would be almost an exact match if the also got a percentage of the team 's ticket sales in the long term though your profit mostly comes from the growth of the company   as a company apple say or tesla increases sales of iphones or electric cars it either pays out some of the income as dividends or invests them in growing the company so it becomes more valuable   if you bought shares cheaply way back when you profit from this increase when you sell them   the person buying it does n't lose as s he buys at today 's market value in anticipation of continued growth   of course there 's a risk that the value will go down in the future instead of up of course there are also psychological factors say when people buy apple or tesla because they 're popular instead of at a rational valuation   or when people start panic selling as in the 08 crash   so then their loss is your gain assuming you did n't panic of course

buying stocks is like an auction put in the price you want to pay and see if someone is willing to sell at that price   thing to remember about after hours trading there is a lot less supply so there 's always a larger bid ask price spread that 's the price brokers charge to handle the stocks they broker over and above the fee   that means you will always pay more after the market closes unless it is bad news but i do n't think you want to buy when that happens i think a lot of the after market trading is to manipulate the market traders drive up the price overnight with small purchases then sell their large holdings when the market opens

the exact answers depend on what you 're going to do and what you started with and what your local market is like but a bit of and/or asking a good general contractor will yield a table of typical improvement in sale price from various renovations one thing you 'll discover is that unless you are staring with something almost few if any if return more than you paid for them getting back 85 is exceptionally good a possible exception is energy saving measures basic air and attic insulation improvements pay back their cost relatively quickly and solar can do so if you have a decent site for that and these are often subsidized in one way or another by government or utilities for most things the real answer is to ask yourself what would make the house better for you and your family and what that would be worth to you if you can get it done for less than that go for it it 's a good idea to put together as complete a list possible before starting since some will be considerably less expensive if done in the right order or at the same time redo your roofing before installing rooftop solar panels if possible as one example then prioritize by what will improve your enjoyment of the house most you 'll probably get better specific advice over in the home improvement area of stack exchange

i think you are mixing two different concepts here the average investor in the quoted reference means an average single investor like you or like me the average investor consistently under performs the market however you then ask the question and you seem to refer to all investors as a group individuals institutions investment banks et al since together investors own 100 of the stock in every company every investor could match the performance of the market easily and at low fees by simply buying an s&p index fund and holding it in fact some investors can even beat the market with the addition of some stocks here is the ten year chart of berkshire hathaway b compared to the s&p 500    there are other examples however few of us have the discipline to do so we read questions here every week about the coming in the market about the next big trend about the next bubble etc the average investor thinks he is smarter than the market and buys on a whim or sells likewise and misses out on the long slow overall growth in the markets finally the title of your question is dalbar how can the average investor lose money i doubt that the average investor loses money in the past several years not making as much money as is easily possible is not at all the same as losing money

this is n't exactly the answer you were looking for but it is something else to consider rather than just running money through the card to get the bonus have you considered spending that $ 5,000 in the form of good debt in other words can you purchase some asset that will create more cashflow than you would be paying on the card with the $ 5,000 balance the idea is instead of running up the balance and paying it back off to get the bonus maybe you could buy an asset for $ 5,000 create positive cashflow with the opportunity for long term capital gains and get the credit card bonus you could even turn around and use the bonus to pay back part of the credit card balance thus reducing the payments and widening the profit margin on the asset
