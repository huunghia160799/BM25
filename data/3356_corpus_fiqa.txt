there are non financial costs to having a debt you need to remember to make monthly payments perhaps keep track of changing interest rates be aware of conditions of the debt archive the related paperwork life is simpler with fewer debts and that has value of course if the difference in interest rate is large then that is more important and the higher interest should be paid off first but if the difference is only half a percentage point or so you may decide that having fewer debts is in itself worth the bit of extra interest you pay
# 466707
strictly from a fastest payback standpoint the rule is to make all minimum payments and send any extra funds to the highest interest loan next   this will result in the lowest interest paid each year   the decision to consolidate depends on the impact it will have to both your payment and overall payoff schedule it sounds like your priority might need to be cash flow and not overall savings e.g. taking a 4 loan that has a high payment but stretching it over more time can lower the payment even at a bit higher rate you just need to be aware of the cost and decide based on what you can live with i hope you are in a good field that would see improvements to your income over these next few years

the solicitor involved up front should be able to place as your suggesting   i think you should look carefully at the desired wording you deserve a return on your £ 100k say the day after you buy this is hypothetical please bear with me a developer says he needs the property and will give you £ your wording here says you get £ 100k and then after the mortgage split £ 230k but it seems more reasonable that your deposit doubles to £ 200k the remaining £ pays the mortgage and the £ 130k left is split £ 65k each   my method accounts for the value of your £ 100k some would ask why not apply the mortgage rate to that deposit because the home value may grow at a different rate in my opinion it 's fair to apply the home value growth to the £ 100k deposit   fair means different things to different people this is my opinion and a suggestion consider it and do what you and your partner wish use a solicitor put it in writing

i was wondering why equity is reflecting ownership of the issuing entity   that is the definition of equity in this regard my understanding is that for a stock equity its issuing entity is a company firm that sells the stock equity while its receiving entity is an investor that buys the stock equity correct equity reflects ownership of the receiving entity i.e. investor incorrect equity reflects ownership by the receiving entity of the issuing entity that is when you buy stock in a company taking an equity stake in the company you buy a piece of the company   it would be rather odd for the company to own a piece of you when you buy their stock

as usual it depends but fundamentally an interest rate is just a function of a party 's creditworthiness and the length of time the money is being lent out for   so no if your credit entitles you to a 3 apr on a 60 month term then it should entitle you to a better interest rate over a 30 month term perhaps not double but better

the most important thing in my view is flexibility to avoid running into problems one useful thing in the uk would be an arranged overdraft you go to your bank and they 'll agree that you can overdraw your account by a certain number of pounds depending on your income etc it will cost you a very high interest rate but only for each day where you are overdrawn so paying a bill two days before your salary comes in is n't too bad obviously avoid using the overdraft if you can having an overdraft while not using it is free it 's meant for an emergency being regularly overdrawn is expensive but once it is arranged with your bank an arranged overdraft is much much cheaper than bouncing cheques etc and possibly high fees for overdrawing your account and it takes the pressure of you   now things to need before you get a loan again uk the real interest rate that you are paying is called apr that 's the number that counts and that can not be manipulated no payday loans to avoid getting yourself into deep deep trouble no loan sharks obviously if you buy things with interest free credit that 's a included in the price so you pay more and b if you miss paying by one day they 'll hit you with huge interest payments and some will try this intentionally interest rate depends on loan amount i once had to borrow 20 more than i needed because it reduced the interest rate by half the 20 went straight into a savings account credit cards and overdrafts are much more expensive than loans mortgage is again cheaper than a loan usually make sure that you only use money from sources that charge the least amount make sure you pay back regularly so cheap sources stay available to you   just do yourself a favour and if at all possible spend less instead of getting a loan

as far as i know i am not a tax professional or ifa there would be no tax implications or other burden on the recipient of the loan under uk law even if it ended up being treated as a gift rather than a loan there are no clauses about money being in the account for 90 days in uk housing transactions however under money laundering rules your brother 's solicitor might need sight of loan agreements to verify where the funds came from i think it would depend on whether you paid the money to your brother direct in which case there would be no problem or if you paid it direct to the solicitor for the purchase what canadian law might say about capital gains inheritance tax if the canadian irs did decide the loan counted as a gift i have no idea

this may be more of a comment than an answer but it 's too long for a comment perhaps the stackexchange gods will forgive my that said even with the tax penalties it can be to your advantage to put money into a retirement account and withdraw it before retirement the trick is is the amount of the tax penalty more than the benefit of untaxed compound growth for example just to make up some numbers suppose you have $ 1000 of gross income to invest you are considering whether to invest in an ordinary non tax favored account or a classic ira either way you will get 10 returns your tax rate both when you put the money in and when you take it out is 15 there is a 10 tax penalty for early withdrawal with an ordinary account you will pay 15 tax off the top so you are only investing $ 850 then each year 15 of your returns are paid in taxes so your net return is 8.5 but when you withdraw the money there are no additional taxes with an ira you do not pay any taxes up front so you can invest the entire $ 1000 you collect 10 each year with no taxes when you withdraw you pay 15 plus the 10 penalty equals 25 so after 5 years the ordinary account would yield $ 850 x ^ 5 = $ the ira would yield $ 1000 x 1.1 ^ 5 x 0.75 = $ the tax penalty hurts you are better to use the ordinary account but if you could leave your money in for 25 years then the ordinary account would yield $ 850 x ^ 25 = $ the ira would yield $ 1000 x 1.1 ^ 25 x 0.75 = $ the ira even with the tax penalty is better of course my numbers are just made up what your tax bracket is what returns you get and how long you think you might leave the money in the investment all vary

if wire transfer through your bank does not work then perhaps one of the more popular money transfer services may be what you are looking for such as moneygram or western union now these rely on a trusted registered third party to do the money transfer so you need to make sure that you are working with a legitimate broker each money transfer service has a site that allows you to perform the search on registered parties around your area there are certain fees that are sometimes applied due to the amount being transferred all of these you will want to do some detailed research on before you make the transfer so that you do not get scammed    i would suggest doing a lot of research and asking people that you trust to recommend a trusted broker   i have not personally used the services but doing a quick search brought many options with different competitive conversion rates as well as fees good luck

i agree this article does n't even consider the fact that we may be adding different types of jobs and ones in different industries than those that were lost during the recession    instead it seems to assume that all jobs are uniform and that when the economy adds jobs after a recession that they are replacing the old jobs that we lost that is simply not so nothing is that simple   there are n't just jobs and ceo jobs the economy is more complex than that   we lost a lot of high paying jobs in the recession that just wo n't ever come back especially jobs at financial institutions that were dependent on mortgage backed securities a part of that industry that has since shrunk permanently losing those jobs were necessary and good for the economy the fact that the jobs we are adding now happen to be at a lower wage are basically happenstance as i see it   i 'm just happy that we 're adding jobs the inequality thing will always be an issue and i hope it gets better but this article is pretty elementary when it comes to economic truth

speculation is when someone else makes an investment you do n't like the above is tongue in cheek but is a serious answer there are several attempts at separating the two but they turn into moral judgements on the value of a pure buy and hold versus any other investment strategy which is itself doubtful is shorting an oil stock more speculation than buying and holding an alternative energy stock some economists take the other route and just argue that we should remove the moral judgement and celebrate speculation as we celebrate investment

to follow up on quid 's comment the share classes themselves will define what level of dividends are expected note that the terms common shares and preferred shares are generally understood terms but are not as precise as you might believe   there are dozens hundreds of different characteristics that could be written into share classes in the company 's articles of incorporation as long as those characteristics are legal in corporate law in the company 's jurisdiction so in answering your question there 's a bit of an assumption that things are working as usual note that private companies often have odd quirks to their share classes things like weird small classes of shares that have most of the voting rights or shares with shotgun buyback clauses as long as they are legal clauses they can be used to help control how the business is run between various shareholders with competing interests things like parents anticipating future family infighting and trying to prevent familial struggle you are unlikely to see such weird quirks in public companies where the company will have additional regulatory requirements and where the public wo n't want any shock at unexpected share clauses in your case you suggested having a non cumulative preferred share with no voting rights but that does n't impact dividend payment there are two salient points left related to payout that the articles of incorporation will need to define for the share classes 1 what is the redemption value for the shares this is usually equal to the cost of subscribing for the shares in the first place it represents how much the business will need to pay the shareholder in the event of redemption recall 2 what is the stated dividend amount this is usually defined at a rate that 's at or a little above a reasonable interest rate at the time the shares are created but defined as $ share for example the shares could have $ 1 share dividend payment where the shares originally cost $ 50 each to subscribe this would reflect a rate of payment of about 2 typically by corporate law dividends must be paid to preferred shares to the extent required based on the characteristics of the share class some preferred shares may not have any required dividends at all before any dividends can be paid to common shares so if $ 10k in dividends is to be paid and total preferred shares require $ 15k of non cumulative dividends each year then $ 0 will be paid to the common shares the following year $ 15k of dividends will once again need to be paid to the preferred shares before any can be paid to the common shares

this very much depends how you use that second line of credit and what your current credit is there are of course many more combinations buy you can probably infer the impact based on these cases    your credit score is based on your likely hood of being profitable to a creditor should they issue you credit this is based on your history of your ability to manage your credit   having more credit and managing it well shows that you have a history of being responsible with greater sums of money available   if you use the card responsibly now then you are more likely to continue that trend than someone with a history of irresponsibility   having a line but not using it is not a good thing   it costs the creditor money for you to have an account   if you never use that account then you are not showing that you can use the account responsibly so if you are just going to throw the card in a safe and never access it then you are better off not getting the card in the first place

in the stock market many participants enter orders that are not necessarily set at the current market price of the stock i.e. they are not market orders they are limit orders they can be lower than the market price if they want to buy or they can be higher than the market price if they want to sell the set of orders at each point of time for a security is called the order book the lowest selling price of the order book is the offer or ask the higher buying price is the bid the more liquid is a security the more orders will be in the order book and the narrower will be the bid ask spread the depth of the order book is the number of units that the order book can absorb in any direction buy or sell as an example imagine i want to buy 100 units at the lowest offer but the size of the lowest offer is only 50 units and there is not any further order that means the stock has little depth

i would look at it as more of a balance in general assuming you have the ability to contribute pre or post tax money and you expect your retirement tax rate to be about the same pre tax money gives you flexibility of withdrawal during retirement say one year you have unusually high expenses you can pull money from your taxed accounts until you hit the top of your target tax bracket and then pull the rest out of already taxed accounts note that if you have the same tax rate today as when you retire the traditional account will net you slightly more money but not a huge amount

in to your questions as @joetaxpayer said you really should look into a solo 401(k in 2017 this allows you to contribute up to $ 18k year and your employer the llc to contribute more up to $ year total subject to irs rules 401(k usually have roth and traditional sides just like ira i believe the employer contributed funds also see less tax burden for both you and your llc that if that same money had become salary payroll taxes etc you might start at and go from there roth vs. pre tax you can mix and match within years and between years figure out what income you want to have when you retire any year you expect to pay lower taxes low income kids deductions etc make roth contributions any year you expect high taxes bonus high wage taxable capital gains etc make pre tax payments i have had a uniformly bad experience with target date funds across multiple 401(k plans from multiple plan they just do n't perform well a common problem with almost any actively managed fund you probably do n't want to deal with individual stocks in your retirement accounts so rather pick passively managed index funds that track various markets segments you care about and just sit on them for example your high risk money might be in fast growing but volatile industries e.g. tech aerospace medical your medium risk money might go in total market or s&p 500 index funds and your low risk money might go in treasury notes and bonds the breakdown is up to you but as an 18 year old you have a ~50 year horizon and so can afford to wait out anything short of another great depression and maybe even that so you 'd want generally you want more or your money in the high risk high return   category rebalancing to lower risk investments as you age diversifying into real estate foreign investments etc might also make sense but i 'm no expert on those

it 's slightly more insidious than that these days we 're finding out how to make games in such a way as to maximise profit not by making the games more fun or entertaining but by abusing the flaws in human psychology   they are also designed in such a way as to these extra purchases when it says in the article you can buy quicker progress through the game and a lot of people like it it 's because they 've artificially slowed down the normal progress in the game they 've deliberately broken the product so you 'll pay to fix it   from a business ethics point of view there 's nothing wrong in this but it makes a lot of people in the industry uneasy

i 'm hopeful that opinion based answers are acceptable in this context i 've been using ynab classic for some years i 've tried to keep all possible options open in the manner of individual items for budget allocation there does seem to be a number of emergency situations for which one would prefer to not dig into regular scheduled expenses having a large number of smaller funds give you flexibility in terms of categorizing your past emergencies this gives you a better view of future allocation of your funds perhaps freeing up money you might not have otherwise identified if you are using a program such as ynab classic i 'm not familiar with the current version you can easily transfer funds from one category to another as needed after all it 's merely numbers in a file not real money that would be otherwise inaccessible to summarize i think the smaller fund concept provides a better picture the big picture of the small stuff means greater flexibility and forecasting prior to the world of personal computers i had a piece of paper in my wallet it had every category i could devise representing every penny in my checking account and eventually grew into ynab but the concept remained the same all these decades

if you 've been in your house for a few years and have built some equity up and the market is active in your area online is probably fine the local banks will be better if it 's not obvious to someone in me that your neighborhood in san diego is worth substantially more than the crappy area 2 miles away i 've had 3 mortgages one from a regional bank one from a broker sourced national mortgage company and another from a local bank the bigger banks had better statements and were easier to do stuff with online the smaller bank has been a better overall value because the closing costs were low and they waived some customary fees   in my case the national mortgage company had a better apr but my time horizon for staying in the house made the smaller bank which had a competitive apr about a half point higher than the lowest advertised a better value due to much lower up front costs

i have found a good explanation here financing is calculated by taking the overall position size and multiplying it by libor + say 2 and then dividing by 365 x the amount of days the position is open for instance the interest rate applicable for overnight long positions may be 6 or 0.06 to calculate how much it would cost you to hold a long position for x number of days you would need to make this pro rata meaning that you would need to divide the 0.06 by 365 and multiply it by x days and then multiply this by the trade size so for example for a trade size of $ 20,000 held for 30 days the interest cost would be about $ it is important to note that due to financing long positions held for extended periods can reduce returns

well like a lot of stuff on there is not a simple answer but generally it is not a good thing take a look at the wikipedia entry on net operating loss basically the company is commenting that when they do make money they will receive preferential tax treatment on that income     so whether or not this is a positive or a negative depends on a couple of things nol does n't directly impact book value other than how the actual assets of the company changed over the previous quarter i believe there is a 1:1 correspondence to how the assets change and nol but i am sure someone could clarify that for me in another answer or as a comment

do you have an adviser mentor for your thesis i 'd recommend talking to them about your goals and see if they have any insight they might have a better idea of your credentials capabilities etc they will also likely be one of the ones to write a letter of so it would be good to get them on board early   if you 're still at the same institution or area from your undergrad then you could probably talk to any of the finance profs you liked as well they could be helpful as well and would know more about your background   since you are doing a thesis anyways i 'd recommend trying to get it published this would be something you would want to hopefully get your mentor involved with the association of business schools abs journal rankings can give you an idea of where you might want to try to publish i 'd think anything at an abs 2 3 would be fantastic a 4 as a masters student is really unlikely but would open almost any door would really help your application although the timing is unlikely to work out assuming you are working on the thesis and also applying to phd school this year because the publication process takes a long time being able to mention in your application that you were targeting a journal or being able to provide an update that you received a revise and might really help with your application also if you end up waiting a year for phd school you 'd also have more time to get your thesis published    i 'd think the math stat background should be pretty solid even if you do n't have all the calc    a ton of your placement post phd will be determined by your phd school so if possible shoot high and try attend the best program you are accepted into rankings could give you a good idea of program strength you can also look at the faculty members cv seeing lots of abs 4 or 4 articles in their research is a good sign that it would be a strong program   i hope this helps i 'm not 100 what you mean by flagship state school if you are thinking top 20 maybe ohio state or comparable then my advice may not apply as much but if you are thinking in terms of a solid reputable state school then i think this might apply

i 'm not an expert but here 's my $ 0.02 deductions for business expenses are subject to the 2 rule in other words you can only deduct that which exceeds 2 of your agi adjusted gross income for example say you have an agi of $ 50,000 and you buy a laptop that costs $ 800 you wo n't get a write off from that because 2 of $ 50,000 is $ 1,000 and you can only deduct business related expenses in excess of that $ 1,000 if you have an agi of $ 50,000 and buy a $ 2,000 laptop you can deduct a maximum of $ 1,000 $ 2,000 minus 2 of $ 50,000 is $ 2,000 $ 1,000 = $ 1,000 additionally you can write off the laptop only to the extent that you use it for business so in other words if you have an agi of $ 50,000 and buy that $ 2,000 laptop but only use it 50 for business you can only write off $ 500 theoretically they can ask for verification of the business use of your laptop a log or a diary would be what i would provide but i 'm not an irs agent

when you are a certain age you will be able to tap into your retirement accounts or start receiving pension and social security funds in addition you may be faced with required minimum distributions from these accounts   but even before you get to those points you will generally shift the focus of new funds into the retirement account to be more conservative depending on the balances in the various accounts and the size of the pension and social security accounts you may even move invested funds from aggressive to conservative investments the proper proportion of the many different types of investments and revenue streams is open to much debate during retirement you will be pulling money out of retirement accounts either to support your standard of living or to meet the required minimum distributions what to sell will be based on either the tax implications or the required distributions that will still maintain the asset allocation you desire    if your distributions are driven by the law you will be selling enough to meet a specific required $ figure you will either spend that money or move it into a low interest savings account or a non retirement investment account if trying to meet your standard of living expectations you will be selling funds that allow you to keep your desired asset allocation but still have enough to live on again you will be trying to meet a specific $ figure   of course you may decide at anytime in retirement to rebalance based on changes to your lifestyle family obligations or winning the lottery

to me this question is really about setting and meeting goals the process is the same whether it 's about exercising regularly or saving or whatever you need to have clear personally relevant reasons for doing something   write down exactly why you want to save it may seem trivial but if you ca n't visualize the prize it 's hard to stay motivated how much can you afford to save use something like mint.com to find out your real monthly expenses as opposed to what you think you 're spending also do n't get leave yourself some money for small luxuries and unexpected expenses so you do n't feel like a miser saving should be a joy not torture automate the saving process set up an automatic transfer to move the amount you figured out in step 2 to your savings account on the same date you get paid this is very important by saving early you ensure there will be enough money to save if you wait until the end of the month there will usually not be anything left do n't you dare touch your savings except in a real emergency if you must dip into your savings immediately create a plan to put it back as soon as possible also get into the habit of reading personal finance books blogs sites etc i recommend authors like robert kiyosaki and suze orman good luck

but do you know about a us state risking to go default now or in the past ultimately a us state could go into default   however i doubt that such a scenario would be allowed to this seems to happen to california with some   that is risking default   what would happen is not quite well known there is no provision for a state to go bankrupt said i do n't think anyone really knows what will happen or even if the state will go into if it does default i can tell you this officials are looking at all the current laws source i believe that the answer to your question is that it could happen but likely would not be allowed to occur   the nature of the eu and us are quite different   the individual states forming the us are not separate nations   for better or for worse the us is a stronger federation than the eu something that is at times when the feds mess with the of the locals

my answer has nothing to do with tax brackets or mathematics i 'm taking advantage of the leeway your question allowed but rather it has to do with career goals and promotion   large companies often have large policies procedures to go with them   one policy that sometimes exists which would make it a bad idea to accept a raise is employee can not be given more than one    salary increase in a 12-month period this means that if you accept a standard of living or merit increase of say 2 or 3 in april and then you apply for a job that would otherwise warrant a pay grade increase you may be forced to wait until the following year to get bumped to the proper pay grade of course this totally depends on the company but it would be advisable to check your company 's h.r. policy on that if you 're considering a move even a lateral one in the future

keep in mind that credit takes time to build    your best short term solution is to save enough cash to put enough of a down payment that the lower loan to value ratio outweighs the lack of credit history   if there 's enough equity to ensure that the bank will get their money back if they have to foreclose you will have a better chance of securing financing in addition the stability and consistency of your employment may also be a factor that makes it difficult for you to get a loan without a substantial down payment finally do n't ignore the risk present in resting a property that you have a loan on   make sure you have a plan in place to pay your payments if the other half goes for several months or you risk losing the entire property my advice is to rent somewhere else for enough time that you can save up a lot of cash to purchase a duplex rather than getting in a rush and doing something unwise like apply for a bunch of credit cards you do n't need

i think you have to refer to it i.e. a hedge fund as more of a legal structure rather than from an investment perspective hedge funds are generally private investment vehicles that require large capital contributions whether the hedge fund is set up as a or a structure does n't matter what the relative investment strategy is long only long short levered distressed debt model defined etc   = qualified purchaser status = min worth of $ = accredited investor status = less than qualified purchaser status but still requires certain income limits   just my two cents

gt;my father and my grandfather and my great grandfather could all sustain their families on a single middle class income   well depends on what you define as middle class income   some of it is a rising expected standard of living   what size house did they have   how many automobiles did they have   if you go back to your great grandfather 's time he probably had far fewer sets of clothing   they probably did n't have the television telephone and air conditioning services that i expect most middle class people expect   my dad ate fruits and vegetables only in season you did n't get to have in the middle of winter or shipped in from chile   i expect to be able to travel via air to visit relatives go back to the 1960s or even into the 1970s and it was considered something that only the well to do would expect to be doing   my father did n't have video game consoles available to him   some of these are driven purely by technology of course and someone can manage to pay no larger a chunk of change than they did before   we eat more meat if i remember a lecture on this correctly   my parents had a lot more and inexpensive foods than i do   but some of it is also adjusting norms   reading about the sort of house that a farmer lived in a few hundred years back would make me think of horrible poverty by modern standards   most women seem not to have wanted to remain when women started going out and doing men 's historical work   so if they go out into the workforce then keeping up with the doing what 's considered middle class requires doubling income and downwards pressure on some fixed costs like say utility costs or gas costs is lessened that makes things tough on the few families who want to have a single income standard   sure maybe a small percentage of people out there want less expensive beef but its the bulk of people who get catered to   automation has greatly decreased demand for some types of jobs performing a repetitive pre defined task on an assembly line has fallen dramatically in value as the need for more people to do this sort of work has fallen off   wages for a particular job are a function of how many people are available to do them relative to how many are needed   every atm is one less bank teller every e commerce website fewer retail workers   that increases the productive capacity of society but whereas before there might be tremendous demand for someone to perform a repeated task on an assembly line which it was easy to train people to do many of the types of labor that are currently under supplied are things that take longer to train people to do and require more specialization   debt   any debt that someone has that does n't have a positive return on investment an engineering degree would probably have a positive roi a large television probably a negative winds up making them poorer in the long run   any debt at all barring investors making bad pricing decisions and hitting default or unexpectedly low returns means transfer of wealth from people without money to people with money   the more non defaulted upon debt the more people with more wealth make more wealth from lending   people have vastly more personal debt than they once did    compare the amount of debt that someone has today with the amount of debt that they typically had in your great grandfather 's time in the 1930s   there 's a constant drain of wealth towards the lenders   this is one of elizabeth warren 's favorite points people take out a lot more debt particularly on housing than they ever did in the past and so a lot of their income is eaten year by year on debt service   there are lots of factors that make it easier to take out more debt   the biggest source of personal debt is by far pdfs and this is where the largest increases have taken place policies to try to encourage people to go into debt to take out larger and larger mortgages have been steadily ramped up over this time with the government subsidizing and taking on risk for insurance liability on mortgages to keep encouraging ever larger amounts of debt   lenders have computers and much more information and sophisticated systems for evaluating risk of default which permits lending out more wealth   so there are technological changes driving this   the government has more public debt which means more such payments even if they do n't show up on your personal checkbook and are only seen by an increasing disparity between what you pay in taxes and the services you get back    here 's a chart of inflation adjusted debt per business of the day americans income and the us in the united states   that means that there 's a constant increasing in the siphoning off of taxes as well to pay for the government having purchased a good or service without having actually paid for it at the time it was ordered   that decreasing green line means not that personal debt is falling well most of the time but that the government is taking out debt on your behalf even faster than private debt has been going up   the rest of the world catching up and breaking a temporary limited monopoly on certain   china and india were not industrialized and the former stuck under and not trading much with the rest of the world so there were fewer people available to do this sort of work   europe rebuilt from world war ii so it did n't have to purchase from the overseas us manufacturing industry   what could change   well standard of living is a cultural thing that seems hard to manipulate   i 'm sure that it 's possible to change that but i have a hard time suggesting how   automation would be an across the board good thing if workers could be efficiently shifted into fields which currently have more demand it 's only an issue for workers if they stay in a field that has falling demand   i 'm sure that our mechanisms for re educating workers are not terribly good   today our education system still involves having a person stand up in front of a lot of other people and talk at them then have those other people go and repeat some rote tasks to try and hammer something into their brain it 's the same mechanism that the wealthy used hundreds of years ago to tutor their children but ramped up on a larger scale   if it were cheaper and easier to learn a new trade it 'd be easier to enter lucrative fields   college costs in particular are ridiculous   when you take college classes you 're basically getting a reading list a very few limited slots to ask questions and a set of predefined tasks plus some grading   that can be done far less than it is provided today   i personally have high hopes for online courses as a start here though i 'm sure that there will be blocks   ditto for things like wikipedia using means that i can skip over things i already know and focus on what i do n't understand and electronic automatic distribution means that it can be done far less than having some guy with a phd stand up in front of a room and read some lecture notes   instead of answering questions generation after generation those people should be polishing databases of answers to questions so that every subsequent human being can quickly and easily refer to their answer and so that we can direct people to the best explanation easily   it 's possible to adopt some measures that would reduce debt service by reducing public debt but the public debt has been growing for a long time and it seems very clear that people are much more willing to take out debt than to cut into their favorite concern low taxes or lots of services in the immediate future   as for reducing debt service via reducing private debt most of the policy and technological factors that drive private debt seem unlikely to change to me   maybe if we see some sort of cultural change an aversion to taking out debt with a negative roi but all of the information i 'm giving here has been public for a long time and people have n't changed so i doubt that we 'll see any kind of a reversal or social movement against taking out lots of debt   you 'd have to have the equivalent of a great wiki with respect to debt and given that attempts to excite interest in the matter have generally not gone anywhere thus far i suspect that this is human nature and doubt that things will change   you can always change your personal debt decisions but society as a whole   as for the temporary monopoly well i think that it 's pretty much inevitable that the rest of the world catches up to a great degree   asia will catch up even africa will eventually get there   i think that that would be a pretty difficult thing to stop and i think that most of the world would object to someone attempting to stop it

the are a couple of explanations that i can think of though for determining exactly what is different you will want to print out both returns and compare them line by line to see how they differ if the company up your income to account for the taxes on housing possibly by paying the additional withholding you may be just benefiting from them estimating your tax rate this can especially be the case if your only work was the three month internship they would have to assume your salary was for the entire year there is an earned income tax credit for low wage earners that you may have qualified for it would depend your specific circumstances if you meet the criteria but that credit for a range of income actually pays out more the more you earn to encourage working that extra hour instead of reducing benefit because you had another hour of employment as for the housing subsidy itself while the value is quite high the irs considers that to be a taxable benefit that the employer provided you and so it needs to be added to your w-2 wages $ 8k a month seems quite high but i do n't know the quality of the apartment you were provided and what the going rates are in the area given that you said you worked for a major tech company i can imagine that you might have been working in an area with high rents if the employer did gross up your paycheck so as to cover your taxes that $ 24k would also include that extra tax payment e.g. if the employer paid $ 8k in additional taxes for you then the housing cost that they directly paid were $ 16k

money is a commodity like any other and loans are a way to buy money like any other financial decision you need to weigh the costs against the benefits to me i 'm happy to take advantage of a 0 for six months or a modest 5 6 rate to make capital purchases of stuff especially for major purchases for example i took out a 5.5 loan to put a roof on my home a few years ago although i had the money to make the purchase   why did i borrow selling assets to buy the roof would require me to sell investments pay taxes and spend a bunch of time computing them i do n't believe in borrowing money to invest as i do n't have enough borrowing capacity for it to me worth the risk feels too much like gambling vs. investing from my point of view

the short answer is that the exchange of the stock in exchange for the elimination of a debt is a taxable exchange and gains or losses are possible for the stock investor as well as the bank    the somewhat longer answer is best summarized as noting that banks do n't usually accept stocks as collateral mostly because stock values are volatile and most banks are not equipped to monitor the risk involved but it is very much part of the business of stock brokers    in the usa as a practical matter i only know of stock brokerages offering loans against stock as part of the standard services of a margin account you can get a margin account at any us stock broker the stockholder can deposit their shares in the margin account and then borrow around 50 of the value though that is a bit much to borrow and a lower amount would be safer from sudden demands for repayment in the form of margin calls in a brokerage account i can not imagine a need to repay a margin loan if the stocks dividends plus capital appreciation rises in value faster than the margin loan rate creates interest charges   trouble begins as the stock value goes down   when the value of the loan exceeds a certain percentage of the stock value which can depend on the stock and the broker 's policy but is also subject to federal rules like regulation t the broker can call in the loan and/or take initiative to sell the stock to repay the loan    notice that this may result in a capital gain or loss depending on the investor 's tax basis which is usually the original cost of the stock   of course this sale affects the taxes of the investor of who gets the money

a true 0 loan is a losing proposition for the bank that 's true   however when you look at actual 0 loans they usually have some catches there might also be late payment fees prepayment penalties and other clauses that make it a good deal on average to the bank   individual borrowers might be able to get away with free money but the bank does not look to make money on each loan they look to make money on thousands of loans overall for a retailer including new car sellers the actual financing costs will be baked into the sales price   they will add say 10 to the sales price in exchange for an interest free loan they can also sell these loans to an investment bank or other entity but they would be sold at a deep discount so the difference will be made up in the sales price or other fees it 's possible that they would just chalk it up to promotional discounts or customer acquisition costs but it would not be a good practice on a large scale

mortgage or other interest rates are determined by the banks on cost of funds risk and operating cost    the fed raises money from the markets by issuing bonds at a specified rate this rate at which it raises money varies on the economy thus there are 2 rates the rate at which banks can borrow money from the fed which is higher than the rate that the fed would give banks for excess money deposited with them so if the cost of borrowing is less banks can borrow this money from the fed and loan it to individuals at a slightly higher rate that would cover their costs plus a small profit the risk associated with a mortgage is less and hence these would be cheaper then say a personal loan   if the cost of borrowing goes up the mortgage rate will go up if the cost of borrowing money goes down the cost would come down banks may not always borrow money to lend if they have existing money they can either park it with the fed for a lower interest rate or loan it to individuals for a rate higher than what they would have received from the fed

i just wanted to add one factor to the other answers the cost of maintenance etc is not a fraction of the cost of financing it is more likely a fraction of the value of the house and a function of its age if you say you need to replace a roof every 25 years and that costs $ 10,000 depends on the size of the house obviously then you need to set aside $ 400 a year for roof repair other costs painting flooring kitchen bathrooms water heaters heating ac yard upkeep etc can be roughly estimated in the same way a rule of thumb is 1 of the value of the house per year to cover all big ticket maintenance if you pay 4 mortgage that would increase the reserve by 25 but if interest rates rise the fraction may be smaller i remember paying over 10 mortgage in general whether keeping a property for long term rental income with the potential for appreciation but prices can go up and down is a good idea will largely depend on your ability to predict future costs and value if you have a variable mortgage that will be harder to do

the breakeven amount is n't at 8 years you calculated how many years of paying $ 500 it would take to break even with one year of paying $ 4000 8 x 10 years = 80 years so by paying $ 500/year it will take you 80 years to have spent the same amount $ 40000 total as you did in 10 years at this point it may seem obvious what the better choice is consider where you 'll be after 10 years in scenario 1 you 've spent $ 5000 $ 500 10 and have to continue spending $ 500/year indefinitely in scenario 2 you 've spent $ 40000 $ 4000 10 and do n't have to pay any more but you currently have $ $ 40000 $ 5000 less than you did in scenario 1 if you had stayed with scenario 1 you could invest that $ at a measly 1.43 annual return and cover the $ 500 payments indefinitely without ever dipping into your remaining $ most likely over the long term you 'll do better than 1.43 per year and come out far ahead

yes it is viable but uncommon as with everything to do with investment you have to know what you are doing and must have a plan i have been successful with long term trading of cfds for about 4 years now it is true that the cost of financing to hold positions long term cuts into profits but so do the spreads when you trade frequently what i have found works well for me is maintaining a portfolio that is low volatility e.g. picking a mix of positions that are negatively correlated has a good sharpe ratio sound fundamentals i.e. co integrated assets or at least fairly stable correlations then leveraging a modest amount

the risk other than losing principal especially when rates go up is capital gains as with any mutual fund this one might need to sell assets for cashflow in which case the taxes on the sales are shifted to the investors so you may end up with the fund losing value due to price fluctuations yet you 'll have capital gains probably with a significant short term part since the maturity periods are relatively short to pay taxes on to what extent that may happen depends on the fund 's cashflow influx of money vs. withdrawals capital gains reduce your basis since no money is actually distributed but if you hold the fund for more than a year you lose the difference between the short term and the long term tax for the short term portion of the gains

day trading is an attempt to profit on high frequency signal changes long term investing profits on low frequency changes what is the difference high frequency signal = the news of the day this includes things like an earnings report coming out panic selling jim cramer pushing his buy buy buy button an oil rig blowing up in the ocean a terrorist attack in some remote region of the globe a government mandated recall the fed announcing an interest rate hike a competitor announcing a new product hurricanes cold winters a new health study on child obesity some other company in the same sector missing their earnings etc think daily red and green on cnbc up a buck down a buck low frequency signal = the long term effectiveness of a company to produce and sell a product efficiently plus the sum of the high frequency signal over a long period of time think 200 day moving average chart of a stock no fast changes just long term trends over time the high frequency changes tend to negate each other to me long term investing is wiser because the low frequency signal is dominated by a companies ability to function well over time that in turn is driven by the effectiveness of its leadership coupled with the skill and motivation of its employees you are betting on the company and its people pseudo random forces which you ca n't control play less of a role   the high frequency signal on the other hand is dominated by and unpredictable forces that typically ca n't be controlled by the company it has some of randomness about it trying to invest on that random component is not investing at all it is gambling akin to investing in that next coin flip coming up heads i understand the allure of high frequency trading look at the daily chart of a popular stock and focus on the up and down ticks mathematically you could make a killing if you could just stack all those on top of each other if only it was that easy

the only real competition i see in the us market is in the pre paid service providers   but they are just off the networks of the larger carriers   to have an actual functioning market they would have to be some legal framework that requires all carriers to share their networks at some reasonable fee rate and then put value added on top of that   that is pretty much how the pots worked   we recognized that as a nation it is plainly ridiculous to compete on who can hang the most wires   we lost that lesson and now we 're letting carriers compete almost purely on who can erect the most towers   at&amp;t and verizon are essentially the same company offering the same service   the entire basis of their competition is who can get the most right of way access to install the most towers   it 's crazy

while derivative pricing models are better modeling reality as academia invests more into the subject none sufficiently do if for example one assumes that stock returns are for the purposes of pricing options like black scholes does the only true dependent variable becomes log standard deviation otherwise known as volatility producing the infamous volatility smile which disappears in the cases of models with more factors accounting for other mathematical moments such as mean skew and etc   still these more advanced models are flawed and suffer the same extreme time mispricing as black scholes   in other words one can model anything however one wants but the worse the model the stranger the results since volatility for a given expiration should be constant across all strikes and is with better models in the case of pricing dividends these can be adjusted for the many complexities of taxation but the model becomes ever more complex and extremely expensive for each eventuality   furthermore with more complexity in any model the likelihood of discovering a closed form in the short run is less for equities in a low interest rate not high dividend yield not low volatility low dividend tax environment the standard swap pricing models will not provide results much different from one where a single low tax rate on dividends is assumed if one is pricing a swap on equity outside of the bounds above the dividend tax rate could have more of an effect but for computational efficiency applying a single assumed dividend tax rate would be optimal with instead of d in a formula where d is the dividend paid and x is the tax rate in short a closed form model is only as good as its assumptions so if anomalies appear between the actual prices of swaps in the market and a swap model then that model is less correct than the one with smaller anomalies of the same type   in other words if pricing equity swaps without a dividend tax rate factored more closely matches the actual prices than pricing with dividend taxes factored then it could be assumed that pricing without a dividend tax factored is superior   this all depends upon the data and there does n't seem to be much in academia to assist with a conclusion if equity swaps do truly provide a tax advantage and both parties to a swap transaction are aware of this fact then it seems unlikely swap sellers would n't demand some of the tax advantage back in the form of a higher price   a model is no defense since volatility curves persist despite what black scholes says they should be

as observed above 1.5 for 3 years is not attractive and since due to the risk profile the stock market also needs to be excluded there seems about 2 primary ways fixed income bonds and g gold however since local bonds gilt or corporate are sensitive and follow the central bank interest rates you could look out investing in overseas bonds usually through a overseas gilt based mutual fund i am specifically mentioning gilt here as they are government backed of the overseas location and have very low risk best would be to scout out for strong fund houses that have mutual funds that invest in overseas gilts preferably of the emerging markets as the interest is higher the good fund houses manage the currency volatility and can generate decent returns at fairly low risk

alright i will go through bullet point by bullet point and try to best figure out what you will be doing in layman 's terms please bear in mind that i do not work for a hedge fund but rather a much larger entity so a lot of the work you will be doing is pre populated   = in this role the individual will be the main point of contact for the client on all things related to understanding their trading profit amp loss and how their valuations have been sourced in addition the product controller will work with internal partner areas to ensure all required processes have been performed to verify the valuation accuracy of the client ’s portfolio   from my understanding you will act as the middle man between the client and the analyst as such here is how a real interaction may go client x calls you answer hello 's office how can i assist you client x asks hey i was curious what my capital gains were on my fb purchase ok let me pull up your account just a moment it seems as though your current capital are $ 30,000 lol on your fb purchase   client x hmm well do i have any significant loses that i may be able to sell off to off set the tax on the capital gains why yes you do it seems aapl has taken a mighty tumble would you like to sell a position to assist you in offsetting client x why that would be great thanks for your help the conversation could go on and that is a pretty deep conversation for the level you are going in but i have had conversations like these before the second part of the bullet just means that you will be checking and the grunt work of the analyst and in some places actually performing the grunt work the work will most likely be along the lines of finding returns for different time periods popular desired time periods are inception ytd 1yr etc remember all of these time periods are not good stand alone they must be compared to a relevant benchmark for instance you would not want to compare the barclays intermediate ag to an equity portfolio the most common benchmark for an equity portfolio is going to be the s&amp;p 500 but you have to look at where the portfolio is focused if it is a you may want to look more towards something like the ishares s&amp;p smallcap 600 value index in the end always remember that any number you come up with is always relative to a benchmark a plain return number is useless   skills = knowledge of cash and derivative products across various markets knowledge of pricing and valuation knowledge of profit and loss reporting and related attribution analysis   pretty much they just want to make sure that if a client asks about a forward future contract as well as any swap option that you understand what they are this bullet points i know what i am doing even though nobody knows what is going on in the economy be up on your current events have a personal conjecture about what you feel is going to happen moving forward but do not convey it if you know that the unemployment was the main driver behind today ’s poor market then you will be good for the day because that will suffice for any call in that relates to why is the market down one of my favorite quotes about the current economy is as follows anyone around here who is n't confused about what ’s going on does n't understand as scary as it is that is the honest truth nobody knows what is about to happen and if anyone tells you they do they are lying and you need to run away quickly i am assuming you know how to calculate profit and loss i do n’t really know of a special way to twist the numbers around   duties = managing the daily p&amp;l process for one or more client trading desks o daily review of quality control checks o working with trading on p&amp;l differences inquiries o working with offshore product control team india on qc process o delivering a final daily and month end p&amp;l statement to the client understanding and explaining the key drivers behind the p&amp;l movements preparing managing monthly or more frequently as required price verification process and associated reporting updating and maintaining pricing policy for each financial type that is included in the consultant ’s p&amp;l reporting ad hoc projects to meet and enhance client   all this means is that you will be sending out the due diligence to the client and you will ensure you are using the proper closing price and include any deposits withdrawals during the month into your calculation the main point is knowing the reasons the price moved throughout the day month keep up on current events and make sure that you understand a vast knowledge of economic data   for what your day to day activity may be i can walk you through it let ’s say you get in at 8 am you will get in at 8 read economic data recent news articles until about 10 from there you will update client a f p l worksheet until about noon you will eat a quick lunch until about and continue on the grind of e m until about 4 from 4 5 you will reread what happened at the end of the day and an overall economic activity report for the day you may stay until 8 or 9 if you are in a banking hub nyc but a lot of the older guys will leave at this time this is your time to shine stay as late as you can and pump out as much work as you can   as for your interview they may ask you what will be a good play for the next 6 months to a year you should respond with common themes in the market the most common theme is the dividend growth play a ton of people are not predicting large amount of growth for the next 5 10 years i believe i read something earlier that jpm lowered their growth forecasts by about 30 recently so dividends is the play dividend payers are generally well established companies blue chip that have a strong in their respective industry

here 's how capital gains are totaled long and short term capital gains and losses are either long term or    short term it depends on how long the taxpayer holds the property if    the taxpayer holds it for one year or less the gain or loss is    short term net capital gain   if a taxpayer ’s long term gains are more than their    long term losses the difference between the two is a net long term    capital gain if the net long term capital gain is more than the net    short term capital loss the taxpayer has a net capital gain so your net long term gains from all investments through all brokers are offset by any net short term loss   short term gains are taxed separately at a higher rate i 'm trying to avoid realizing a long term capital gain but at the same time trade the stock if you close in the next year one of two things will happen either the stock will go down and you 'll have short term gains on the short or the stock will go up and you 'll have short term losses on the short that will offset the gains on the stock   so i don;t see how it reduces your tax liability   at best it defers it

these good rates all tend to be on up to $ x where x is some number that could require multiple accounts they often also come with other strings like set up automatic deposits withdrawals and use debit card at least 15 times per month the two you mention have these flaws whether or not it 's worth it depends on if you are happy to meet those requirements and how big your emergency fund is   personally i 'd rather get rewards on a credit card than use a debit card and i do n't want to open a bunch of accounts so i have a boring savings account with a pretty low interest rate for my emergency fund it 's liquid earns some interest and i do n't have to think about it

unfortunately in this market environment your goal is not very realistic at the moment real interest rates are negative and have been for some time   this means if you invest in something that will pay out for sure you can expect to earn less than you lose through inflation   in other words if you save your $ 50 k when you withdraw it in a few years you will be able to buy less with it then than you can now you can invest in risky securities like stocks or mutual funds   these assets can easily generate 10 per year but they can and do also generate negative returns   this means you can and likely will lose money after investing in them   there 's an even better chance that you will make money but that varies year by year   if you invest in something that expects to make 10 per year meaning it makes that much on average it will be extremely risky and many years it will lose money perhaps a lot of it   that 's the way risk is   are you comfortable taking on large amounts of risk good chances of losing a lot of your money you could make some kind of real investment   $ 50 k is a little small to buy real estate but you may be able to find something like real estate that can generate income especially if you use it as a down payment to borrow from the bank   there is risk in being a landlord as well of course and a lot of work   but real investments like that are a reasonable alternative to financial markets for some people another possibility is to just keep it in your bank account or something else with no risk and take $ 5000 out per year   it will only last you 10 years that way but if you are not too young that will be a significant portion of your life   if you are young you can work and add to it unfortunately financial markets do n't magically make people rich   if you make a lot of money in the market it 's because you took a risk and got lucky   if you make a comfortable amount with no risk it means you invested in a market environment very different from what we see today edit to get an idea of what risk free investments after inflation earn per year at various horizons see this table at the treasury   at the time of this writing you would have to invest in a security with maturity almost 10 years in order to break even with inflation   beating it by 10 or even 3 per year with minimal risk is a pipe dream

you can open savings bank account with some banks that offer better interest rate note there would be restriction on number of withdrawals in quarter there are better interest rates if you lock in for 90 + days the other option to explore is to open a demat brokrage account and invest in liquid funds note depending on various factors it may or may not suite your requirements

if you invest in a foreign bank you are subject to their financial rules and regulations if you put your money with their cd it will be converted to and you will be paid back in which introduces the exchange rate risk   fdic is not the only reason why a cd in a us bank pays a lower interest but it could be seen as a contributing factor   it all comes down to risk and what the bank is willing to pay for your money when a bank issues a cd they are entering the debt market and competing against other banks governments or anyone looking for money if the yield from lending to one bank is the same as the yield of another the logical choice would be whichever loan is less risky so in order for the riskier bank to receive loans they must entice investors by offering a greater rate of return in addition if a bank is n't looking for loans they might be less inclined to pay for them see what is the bernanke twist and operation twist what exactly does it do if your looking to invest in the cd 's of foreign banks i would suggest doing research on their regulations especially if and how your money is protected in the event the bank goes bust

i am an instructor who teaches financial modeling courses to investment bankers in nyc looking at the model i do not see anything wrong with it there are just too many assumptions i would rather use the multiple value for the terminal value calculation but it will not make any significant differences some more thoughts   a the author has used text book method for valuation but everyone the text book method hence subjective evaluations    b oil and gas valuation is quite a deep subject and every time we create models industry experts come and big time change the inputs we have no indication that the model is tested by industry experts o&amp;g operations experts   c for matured companies like aramco i would prefer the dcf model as used and then adjust using comparables i do not see that it has been done in the model   d in some cases investment experts would rather use 3 stage dcf model 5 years next 10 years next 20 years or so it makes the model pretty complex but provides more accuracy   e the revenue taken in the calculation is flat instead he should have taken the data from past 10 years and modeled the fluctuations    f one of the biggest challenges we have faced in this sector is the accounting method full cost of successful effort high capex only occurs in one of the methods and depending on the company 's maturity level people may use different methods more on this method in this link articles fundamental   i am at wits to understand how the value will be more than 1 trillion dollars in any case

note the main trade off here is the costs of holding cash rather than being invested for a few months vs trading costs from trading every month   let 's start by understanding investing every month vs every three months   first compare holding cash for two months at for most canadians right now and then investing on the third month vs being invested in a single stock etf ~5 annually   at those rates she is forgoing equity returns of around   these costs and the $ 10 for one big trade give total costs of $ dollars    if you were to trade every month instead there would be no cost for not being invested and the trading costs over three months would just be   so in this case it would be better to trade monthly instead of every three months however i 'm guessing you do n't trade all $ 2000 into a single etf   the more etfs you trade the more trading more infrequently would be an advantage   you can redo the above calculations the amount across more etfs and including the added trading costs to get a feel for what is best   you can also rotate as suggests but that can leave you unbalanced temporarily if not done carefully   a second option would be to find a discount broker that allows you to trade the etfs you are interested in for free   this is not always possible but often will be for those investing in index funds   for instance i trade every month and have no brokerage costs dollar cost averaging and value averaging are for people investing a single large amount instead of regular monthly amounts   unless the initial amount is much much larger than the monthly amounts this is probably not worth considering edit hopefully the above edits will clarify that i was comparing the costs including the forgone returns of trading every 3 months vs trading every month

modern portfolio theory dramatically the risk of the recommended assets   this is because so few underlying assets are in the recommended part of the curve   as investors identify such assets large amounts of money are invested in them   this temporarily reduces measured risk and temporarily increases measured return   sooner or later the trade becomes crowded   eventually large amounts of money try to exit the trade into cash or the next discovered asset   and so the measurable risk suddenly rises and the measured return drops in other words modern portfolio theory causes bubbles and causes those bubbles to pop some other strategies to consider

gt;i'm curious to know if you or any of your relatives have ever been declared as being mentally ill or having a psychological disorder    there are but only a handful some valid mental illnesses but by and large the is filled with little more than social scams   and as far as anecdotes i have known quite a few people who have been diagnosed with a wide variety of so called disorders most of them are quite happy to accept the label as it can then be used as a justification for their behavior and/or for claiming benefits and no one ever said that psychology was n't a useful fraud a lot of people believe and think it to be quite useful just as a lot of other people think is   gt;if most of psychology is all bs then that just makes everyone else stupid for spending all of their money to get treated and really if we are that stupid stupid enough to believe such a huge lie i would then agree with the 25 of americans suffer from mental illness statement because you have to be pretty stupid to be told such a huge lie and not figure it out    and whoever claimed that the majority of the human population were anything but easily duped idiots   i certainly never have   thing if it is so easy to tell that psychology is a scam then why is there in general cross from physics biology history language medicine etc acceptance of psychology as a science    chiefly because the majority of people in those other sciences even the hard sciences are rather dumb and easily duped themselves most are who have only rote knowledge of their own fields and just as with religions psychology offers a mixture of theoretical bases that they accept or reject on an ad hoc anecdotal basis mostly without even any superficial investigation much less anything more thorough and in the cases where someone has investigated the claims theories the are often very easily debunked cf john work   add in that many drugs amp substances which pre existed psychology amp are in fact effective in changing thoughts and behaviors duh that 's like saying water is wet and which have become the main tool and then via a pragmatic used to create a causal theoretical basis the whole brain chemical imbalance even though there is no objective evidence to validate the theory beyond the affect of the drugs which can not be independent evidence since that would be like saying the reason water is wet is because of it 's properties

a reason not to split your stock is that the value of the company might fall back again and if its stock price falls below $ 1 it will be delisted from the nyse so if the value of your company grows so the shares go from $ 5 to $ 50 you do a ten for one split and then its value shrinks back to where it started you 're off the stock exchange

from rich dad poor dad 3 major things with rental real estate in addition to mortgage interest you also deduct property taxes and must claim depreciation cost of house 27.5 years business expenses for example buy a yacht and put it in a charter fleet deduct interest on the loan depreciation of the asset property taxes upkeep of the boat your business earns profit from the boat which if i recall correctly is taxed at a lower rate you get to go sailing for free then there was the concept of the businesses if you own a restaurant create another business to own the property and the equipment used in the company then lease the equipment and rent the land to the restaurant now admittedly i thought this was like the daylight savings plan of tax avoidance i mean now are n't you essentially having two companies paying half the taxes i am sure there are well paid cpas that make the math happen perhaps using insurance plans perhaps each business funds a whole life insurance account and contributes vast amounts into that then you take a loan from your insurance account loans of course are not income so not taxed the third way is to create your own bank banks are required to have reserves of 9 meaning if i have $ 100 dollars the allows me to loan $ i then charge you 20 interest or $ now how much can i loan   well you can see how profitable that is sure you pay taxes but when you print your own money who cares most of this is just from books and government publications but that was my general understanding of it feel free to correct the finer points

i 'm really surprised at the answers here claims year per region is n't a statistic that is meaningful here you need to think about the risk factors and the purpose of the insurance first what does title insurance do it protects you against defects in the deed defects that may crop up and mean that your mortgage is no longer valid this is different from most forms of insurance the events that render your title invalid are events that may have happened years decades or even centuries ago a big part of the insurance policy and its cost is conducting research to assess the validity of a deed the whole point of the insurance is to reduce claims by improving data associated with the chain of custody of the property so how do you evaluate the risk of finding out about something that happened a long time ago that nobody appears to know about imo you have to think about risk factors that increase the probability that things were screwed up in the past you need to have an informed discussion with your attorney and figure out if it makes sense for you do n't dismiss it out of hand

if you are interested in a career in algorithmic trading i strongly encourage you to formally study math and computer science   algorithmic trading firms have no need for employees with financial knowledge if they did they 'd just be called trading firms   rather they need experts in machine learning statistical modeling and computer science in general of course there are other avenues of employment at an algorithmic trading firm such as accounting clearing exchange relations etc   if that 's the sort of thing you 're interested in again you 'll probably want a formal education in those areas as opposed to just reading about finance in the news if you edit your question or add a comment below with information about your particular background i could perhaps advise you in a bit more detail edit given your comment i would say you have a fine academic background for the industry   when hiring mathematicians firms care most about the ease with which you can explore and extract features from massive datasets especially time series regardless of what the dataset might represent   an intelligent firm will not care whether you arrive at their doorstep with zero finance knowledge they will want to teach you everything from scratch anyway nonetheless some domain knowledge could be helpful but you 're not going to get more of it from reading any mass market news source whether you have to pay for it or not   that 's because   some non mass market news sources in the industry are   these are subscription only and actually discuss real information that real professional investors care about   they are loaded with industry jargon they 're extremely opinionated and in my opinion they 're useless   i ca n't imagine trying to learn about the industry from them but if you want to spend money for news in order to be exposed to the of the industry then either of these is far better than the financial times   despite requiring a subscription the financial times still does not cover the technical details of professional trading instead of trying to learn from news then i would suggest some old favorites and above all else read everything in the navigation box on the right side under financial markets and financial instruments

's answer is quite good and for your own specific situation you might begin by being about what you are getting for investing a few thousand dollars   with the exception of paul graham 's y there are very few opportunities to invest at that type of level and y provides a lot of other assistance besides their modest initial investment    i can tell from your post that you think like an investor   it is highly unlikely that the entrepreneurial programmers that you will be backing will be wired that way    from the modest amount that you are investing you are unlikely to be the lead investor in this opportunity   if you are interested in proceeding simply stick along for the ride examining the terms and documents that more significant investors will be demanding   remain positive and supportive but simply wait to sign on the dotted line until others have done the heavy lifting for more insights into startups themselves see paul graham 's essays at   he 's the real deal and his recent essays will provide you with current insights about software startups good luck

gt net neutrality has more to do with the fact that companies could start prioritizing or blocking access to certain websites and services where they have an incentive to   great   so just like walmart prioritizing the display of their in house brands vs. brands of their competition   or a car dealership showing you only and not as well   i mean what 's the difference here   gt;to use you example of roads say for instance that a car manufacturer paid the govt to have the speed limit raised for their vehicles or even reduced the speed limit for other manufacturers this would create an i level playing field   speed is actually a secondary function here because we 're actually talking about bandwidth   light travels at the speed of light electricity travels between 50 99 of that   those are properties of physics not anything comcast can control   we 're talking about bandwidth   so using your roads example imagine now that a car manufacturer wants to use 50 of the road capacity to ship its goods everyday   and in doing so it practically crowds out every other entity that wants to use the road   who is in the right here   how would we regulate who is using the road   what is fair

every economy wants growth and for growth to come you need investments so you must provide some motive for people to risk their money every investment has inherently a degree of risk or if you want uncertainty about the outcome as a result the tax on capital gains is lower than on other types of income because the risk is almost zero the tax is considered in the calculation of the net interest rate and you can see this as the interest which the investors demand in order to invest their money

technically the answer is no you ca n't put more money in to that isa in that tax year once you 've transferred it unless you 've transferred it to a stocks and shares isa faqs 7 and 8 from cover these cases q. i have transferred current year payments to my cash isa to a stocks    and shares isa can i make any further payments to a cash isa in this    tax year a. yes provided you have n't already used up your annual isa    investment allowance £ in the tax year 2013 14 when you transfer current year payments to your cash isa to a stocks    and shares isa it is as if that cash isa had never existed any money    you saved up to the date of transfer will be treated as if you had    invested that money directly in the stocks and shares isa for example if you had put £ 2,000 in a cash isa and then transferred    it to a stocks and shares isa you would be able to make further    payments totalling £ in that tax year you could either put all    of the £ in the stocks and shares isa or you could put up to    £ in a cash isa with the same or a different isa manager and    the remainder of the £ in the stocks and shares isa   q. how many isas can i have a. there are limits on the number of isa accounts you can subscribe to    each tax year you can only put money into one cash isa and one stocks    and shares isa but in different years you could choose to save with different    managers there are no limits on the number of different isas you can    hold over time however in practice if you transfer mid year from provider a to provider b provider b has no way of telling whether you have already put money in to the isa with provider a that year or not so you will be able to put more money in   i believe that isa providers do report their subscriptions back to hmrc so they can check for multiple subscriptions over the limit in one tax year but in the past i have done exactly what you describe and it has never been picked up in any way or caused any problem at all as long as you stick to total subscriptions within the limit i 'd guess you 're unlikely to encounter a problem of course i am not a financial advisor so you should take what i say with the same pinch of salt as you would take any other random advice from the internet

just for shits i 'll give you the excerpts from liar 's poker   i was living in london in the winter of 1984 finishing a master 's degree in economics at the london school of economics when i received an invitation to dine with the queen mother it came through a distant cousin of mine who years before and somewhat had married a german baron   what had been advertised as a close encounter with british royalty proved to be a fundraiser with seven or eight hundred insurance salesmen somewhere in the great hall as luck would have it were two managing directors from salomon brothers i knew this only because as luck would further have it i was seated between their wives   the wife of the more senior salomon brothers managing director an american took our table firmly in hand once we 'd finished our to a glimpse of british royalty when she learned that i was preparing to enter the job market and was considering investment banking she turned the evening into an interview having examined what good had come from my twenty four years on earth the asked why i did n't come and work on the salomon brothers trading floor   it 's a great book i highly recommend it

the problem is i do n't understand how such sites work is that scam or not some of my friends told me that they 've actually received the revenue after they deposited a bit of money to similar sites and i do n't have any evidence not to trust them yes there are scam stay away quite likely people got real money back into bank account or more likely it shows that there is more notional money in the sites account   if such sites really work then how and why these sites work because there are quite a few people who believe in free easy money the site could be classic pyramid ponzi scheme they could also be involved in some kind of money laundering why would anyone trust them so much to give them money for absolutely no reason okay i 'm not so clever but they ca n't make profit only because of stupid people can they the same way you did at times just for fun to experiment at times because they believe there is easy get rich way there is a reward that works so that if you see 120 you start believing in it if you try and withdraw there will be quite a few obstacles under the of holding period withdrawal fees etc but mostly they will encourage you to keep depositing small amounts and see it grow this of it this way if one can make 20 day on day one does not need someone else 's money the power of compounding would mean very quickly $ 100 would become 88 billion in 120 days

i think it would be a wise move on the part of the 3d printing small businesses if contingency plans were put in place plan on alternate locations with backup printers or better yet print offsite in several locations and employ to transport the parts to the final customer a mechanism is much harder to squash and if a business starts by using satellite printers in the first place it 's much easier to bring previously unused resources online in the event of a disruption better yet subcontract the printing to individuals around your area that have the capabilities giving them a steady stream of income in return for a reduced rate i anticipate demand for this sort of service will pick up as both variety of materials and performance characteristics of output products improves this will last until 3d printing is so ubiquitous that and hp are selling units as cheaply as you buy printers now by that time smart printing services will have figured out alternative ways to stay in business instead of fighting to stay on top just like the older business models they

the short answer is that there are no great personal finance programs out there any more in the past i found microsoft money to be slick and feature rich but unfortunately it has been discontinued a few years ago   your choices now are quicken and mint along with the several open source programs that have been listed by others in the past i found the open source programs to be both clunky and not feature complete for my every day use it 's possible they have improved significantly since i had last looked at them the biggest limitation i saw with them is weakness of integration with financial service providers banks credit card companies brokerage accounts etc let 's start with mint mint is a web based tool owned by the same company as quicken whose main feature is its ability to connect to nearly every financial institution you 're likely to use mint aggregates that data for you and presents it on the homepage this makes it very easy to see your net worth and changes to it over time spending trends track your progress on budgets and long term goals etc mint allows you to do all of this with little or no data entry it has support for your investments but does not allow for deep analysis of them quicken is a desktop program it is extremely feature rich in terms of supporting different types of accounts transactions reports reconciliation etc one could use quicken to do everything that i just described about mint but the power of quicken is in its more manual features for example while mint is on showing you your status quicken allows you to enter transactions in real time as you 're writing a check initiating a transfer etc and later them with data from your financial institutions link mint quicken has good integration with financial companies so you can generally get away with as little or as much data entry as you want for example you can manually enter large checks and transfers and later match to automatically downloaded data but allow small entries like credit card purchases to download automatically   bottom line if you 're just looking to keep track of where you are at try mint it 's very simple and free if you need more power and want to manage your finances on a more transactional level try quicken though i believe they do not have a trial version i do n't understand why the learning curve is steep although probably than that of gnucash last note on why mint.com is free it 's the usual ad supported model plus mint sells aggregated consumer behaviour reports to other institutions since mint has everyone 's transactions it can identify consumer trends if you 're not comfortable with that or with the idea of giving a website passwords to all your financial accounts you will find quicken easier to accept hope this helps

your math is correct as you point out because of the property of multiplication roth and traditional iras offer the same terminal wealth if your tax rate is the same when you pull it out as when you put it in   roth does lock in your tax rate as of today as you point out which is why it frequently does not maximize wealth most of us have a higher tax bracket when we are saving than when we are withdrawing from savings there are a few other potential considerations advantages of a roth roth and traditional iras have the same maximum contribution amount   this means the effective amount you can contribute to a roth is higher $ 5,500 after tax instead of before   if this constraint is binding for you and you do n't expect your tax rate to change roth is better roth iras allow you to withdraw your contributed money not the gains at any time without any tax or penalty whatsoever   this can be an advantage to some who would like to use it for something like a down payment instead of keeping it all the way to retirement   in this sense the roth is more flexible as your income becomes high the deductibility of traditional ira contributions goes to zero if you have a 401(k at work you can still contribute but ca n't deduct contributions   at high incomes you also may be disallowed from contributing to a roth but because of the backdoor roth loophole you can make roth contributions at any income level and preserve the full roth tax advantage which type of account is better for any given person is a complex problem with several unknowns like future tax rates   however because tax rates are generally higher when earning money for most people who can contribute to them traditional iras maximize your tax savings and therefore wealth edit note that traditional ira contributions also reduce your agi which is used to compute eligibility for other tax advantages like the child care tax credit and earned income credit   agi is also often used for state income tax calculation in retirement traditional ira distributions may or may not be state taxable depending on your state and circumstances

first things first its always good to set the records straight when you are trying to clear your debt do them one by one and ask the collection agent that you would pay in full only if the records would be deleted from your credit history and most of the collection agencies are happy to take it off your credit report as they are getting the money this would work generally only when you pay the full amount i can guarantee you this because i have tried it myself after hearing about it from my friends   if you have already paid whole amount already then records of your payments generally will not be available after 2 years with any banks even the big ones like bank of america or wells fargo that means if they do n't have the records no body else would because its a burden as your payment is written off you can file a dispute to credit bureaus for your payment history and if they could n't provide you the history they have to take your record off your history even they know that you have delinquent history because they do n't have enough proof to confirm that and when you file a dispute its always good to file it by paper as they have to write back and you can ask hard copies of the proofs which are very difficult to get one more thing if you want to dispute it might take couple of months atleast and you need to have patience because you already might have known how important credit history is

you ca n't currently avoid it the reason the legislation was introduced was to prevent the big name developers from setting up shop in a low vat country and selling apps to citizens of eu countries that would normally be paying a much higher vat   you need to register for vat and file quarterly nil returns so that you get that money back it 's a hassle but probably worth it just to recoup those funds   from an article in from late 2014 you see in the uk we have a rather sensible exemption on vat for    businesses that earn under £ a year this allows people to run    small businesses like making and selling games in your spare time    for instance without the administrative nightmare of registering as    a business and paying vat on sales unfortunately none of the other    eu member states had an exemption like this so when the new    legislation was being put together there was no exemption factored    in that means that if someone makes even £ 1 from selling something    digital to another person in another eu country they now have to be    vat registered in the uk and they have to pay tax on that sale at    whatever rate the buyer ’s country of residence has set that could be    25 in sweden 21 in the netherlands and so on there ’s one piece of good news even though anyone who sells digital    stuff now has to be vat registered in the uk they do n’t actually have    to pay vat on sales to people in the uk if they earn less than £    from it this concession was achieved earlier this month after    extensive lobbying but they ’ll still have to submit what ’s called a    nil return which is essentially a tax return with nothing on it    every quarter in order to use the vat moss service that ’s a lot of    paperwork obviously brexit may have a significant impact on all this so the rules might change   this is the official google link to how they 've implemented this and for which countries it affects   due to vat laws in the european union eu google is responsible for    determining charging and remitting vat for all google play store    digital content purchases by eu customers google will send vat for eu    customers digital content purchases to the appropriate authority you do n't need to calculate and send vat separately for eu customers    even if you 're not located in the eu this change in vat laws will    still apply

because a paying down a liability and thus gaining asset equity is not technically an expense gnucash will not include it in any expense reports however you can abuse the system a bit to do what you want   the mortgage payment should be divided into principle interest and escrow tax insurance accounts for example a mortgage payment will then be a split transaction that puts money into these accounts from your bank account for completeness the escrow account will periodically be used to pay actual expenses which just moves the expense from escrow into insurance or tax this is nice so that expenses for a month are n't inflated due to a tax payment being made now this is all fairly typical and results in all but the principle part of the mortgage payment being included in expense reports the trick then is to duplicate the principle portion in a way that it makes its way into your expenses one way to do this is to create a principle expense account and also a fictional equity account that provides the funds to pay it every time you record a mortgage payment add a transfer from this equity account into the principle payments expense account this will mess things up at some level since you 're inventing an expense that does not truly exist but if you 're using gnucash more to monitor monthly cash flow it causes the income expense report to finally make sense example transaction split

honestly the best way to manage this risk is to manage your savings appropriately many experts recommend that maintain a reasonably liquid account with 6 your minimum monthly expenses for just this occurrence i know easier said than done right as for insurance i can only speak for what is the case in the us here most mortgages will require you to get pmi insurance until you have at least 20 equity in your house however that insurance only protects the bank from losing money if you ca n't pay it does n't save you from foreclosure or ruining your credit   really the type of insurance you are talking about is unemployment insurance which all states in the us make available to workers via deductions from their paycheck   the best advice i suppose is to keep your expenses low enough to cover them with an unemployment check until you have accumulated enough savings to get through a rough patch that may mean buying a less expensive home or just waiting until you have saved a bigger down payment if you did n't plan ahead and you are already in the house another option might be to extend your mortgage for example from a 20 to a 30 year to reduce your payments to a manageable level a more risky option might be to convert to a variable rate loan temporarily which typically carries a lower interest rate however it might be hard to secure a new loan if you do n't currently have an income

from the 1st quarter 10q match funded advances on loans serviced for others result from our transfers of residential loan servicing advances to in exchange for cash the issue debt supported by collections on the transferred advances we made these transfers under the terms of our advance facility agreements these transfers do not qualify for sale accounting because we retain control over the transferred assets as a result we account for these transfers as and classify the transferred advances on our interim condensed consolidated balance sheet as match funded advances and the related liabilities as match funded liabilities we use collections on the match funded advances pledged to the to repay principal and to pay interest and the expenses of the entity holders of the debt issued by this entity can look only to the assets of the entity itself for satisfaction of the debt and have no recourse against    i 'm not an expert in the accounting of these things but i 'll take a stab from the view of a bond investor   let 's assume the in question have been pooled together and sold into the bond market in the form of a mortgage backed security mbs     when a homeowner falls behind on their payment scheduled principal and interest their monthly mortgage payment amount or is advanced as if the borrower is still current to the person who holds the mbs   this is typically done from the time they first fall behind until either they 1 catch up on their payments or 2 are foreclosed upon and the home is sold to repay the mortgage balance   in either instance the advanced monthly payments are recaptured by the servicer before the holder of the mbs is paid   in this sense the servicer develops a sort of prepaid asset over time by advancing money they are almost certain to recover at a future date usually via foreclosure and liquidation     due to a high number of borrowers falling behind on their payments since the housing crisis and the resulting time it takes to foreclose on a property the etc have built a large balance of advances on the asset side of their balance sheet   to free up this cash prior to liquidation of the home they have sold short term bonds against this asset via an thereby creating the liability you reference   so in essence they have say a home they expect to be liquidated in twelve months that they have advanced on   the short term bonds sold via the offset this asset at an equivalent term thereby making the asset and liability match funded

first you should diversify your portfolio   if your entire portfolio is in the roth ira then you should eventually diversify that   however if you have an ira and a 401k then it 's perfectly fine for the ira to be in a single fund   for example i used my ira to buy a riskier reit that my 401k does n't support    second if you only have a small amount currently invested e.g. $ 5500 it may make sense to put everything in a single fund until you have enough to get past the low balance fees   it 's not uncommon for funds to charge lower fees to someone who has $ 8000 $ 10,000 or $ 12,000 invested   note that if you deposit $ 10,000 and the fund loses money they 'll usually charge you the rate for less than $ 10,000   so try to exceed the minimum with a decent cushion    a balanced fund may make sense as a first fund   that way they handle the diversification for you   a targeted fund is a special kind of balanced fund that changes the balance over time   some have reported that targeted funds charge higher fees   commissions on those higher fees may explain why your bank wants you to buy    i personally do n't like the asset mixes that i 've seen from targeted funds   they often change the stock bond ratio which is not really correct   the stock bond ratio should stay the same   it 's the securities stocks and bonds to monetary equivalents that should change and that only starting five to ten years before retirement   prior to that the only reason to put money into monetary equivalents is to provide time to pick the right securities fund   retirees should maintain about a five year cushion in monetary equivalents so as not to be forced to sell into a bad market    long term i 'd prefer low load index funds   a bond fund and two or three stock funds   you might want to build your balance first though   it does n't really make sense to have a separate fund until you have enough money to get the best fees   70 75 stocks and 25 30 bonds should add to 100 e.g. 73 and 27   balance annually when you make your new deposit

do n't underestimate the degree to which it seemed like microsoft essentially was the entire computer industry in 2000 apple 's comeback was only understood by a few of us the smart phone market did n't exist and microsoft office and networking solutions were dominating almost everything they competed in hell internet explorer was even considered the final word in browsers at the time firefox was two years off betting on microsoft in 2000 was like betting on computers assuming computers were a growth market and even after the .com bubble no one really expected computers in general to do anything but grow then microsoft was going to grow    point is microsoft in 2000 was the king of the technology world to a degree that is hard to appreciate in 2014 they were beyond dominant they were god

the reason that the rich were so rich reasoned was because they managed to spend less money   take boots for example he earned thirty eight dollars a month plus allowances a really good pair of leather boots cost fifty dollars but an affordable pair of boots which were sort of ok for a season or two and then leaked like hell when the cardboard gave out cost about ten dollars those were the kind of boots always bought and wore until the were so thin that he could tell where he was in on a night by the feel of the   but the thing was that good boots lasted for years and years a man who could afford fifty dollars had a pair of boots that 'd still be keeping his feet dry in ten years time while the poor man who could only afford cheap boots would have spent a hundred dollars on boots in the same time and would still have wet feet   this was the captain samuel boots theory of socioeconomic unfairness   men at arms the play

some places banks credit unions will allow you to refinance a auto loan my credit union only does this if the original loan was with another lender they will send the money to the old lender then give you a loan under the new terms they are trying to get your business not necessarily looking for a way make less money for themselves   you will have to see how much you will save which will be based on the delta of the length of the loan or the change in interest rate or both my credit union has a calculator to show you the numbers based on keeping the size of the payments the same or keeping the number of payments the same   make sure you understand any limitations regarding the refinance based on the age of the car and if you are underwater

i used to be in research department for big financial data company    tell your son that there are three factors most people think that net sales vs. expectations is the only factor   it might not even be the biggest   it is simply how much money did company make   note that this is not how many units they sold   for most companies they will have adjustable pricing and incentives in their sector   for example let 's talk about a new company selling superman kid 's bikes with a cape the flips out when you hit a certain speed   the company has it in walmart at one price target at another toys r us even cheaper amazon making more profit there and other stores   they are doing ok come dec. 1 but holiday season being half way over they slash price from $ 100 to $ 80 because they have tons of inventory   what are looking at her is how much money did they make   note that marketing advertising legal setting up contracts are a bit fixed in my opinion consumer sentiment is the 1 thing for a company that sells a product   incredible consumer sentiment is like millions of dollars in free advertising   so let 's say dec. 15th comes and the reviews on the superman bike are through the roof   every loves it no major defects   company ca n't even supply the retailers now because after slashing the price it became a great buy   a common investor might be pissed that some dummy at the company slashed the prices so they could have had a much better profit margin but at the same time it would n't have led to an of sales and consumer sentiment and the last area is product sell off   this does n't apply to all product but most   some products will only have a technology shelf life some will actually go bad or out of fashion and even selling superman bikes you want to get those to the store because the product is so big   so ignoring making a profit can a company sell off inventory at or around cost   if they ca n't even if they made a profit their risk factor goes up so let 's get back to superman bikes   this is the only product company abc has   they had expected holiday sales at 100 million and profits at 40 million   they ended up at 120 million and 44 million    let 's say their stock was $ 20 before any information was gathered by the public remember for most companies info is gathered daily now so this is rather simplistic   so you might expect that the stock would rise to maybe $ 24 to which if you were an investor is a great profit however this company has a cult consumer following who are waiting for the captain america bike shoots discs and the bike turns green when you go fast   let 's say consumer sentiment and projections base off that put next holiday sales at $ 250 million   so maybe the company is worth $ 40 a share now   but consumer sentiment is funny because not only does it effect future projections but it also effects perceived present value of company which may have the stock trading at $ 60 a share think earnings and companies like google   having a company people feel proud owning or thinking is cool is also a indicator or share worth i gave you a really good example of a very successful company selling superman bikes there are just as many companies that have the opposite happening   imagine missing sales goals by a few million with bad consumer feedback and all of a sudden your company goes from $ 20 to $ 5 a share

borrow money from the central bank wrong premise they can not borrow as much as they want and they can not borrow without collateral i.e. government debt instruments they hold or any other instrument with value   and banks do n’t have unlimited collateral to borrow against   secondly central banks are n’t in the business of lending unlimited money the more money they lend out the more is the money supply which inflation which will eventually lead them to stop lending at any point of time they want a certain amount of money movement so they can control inflation and interest rates within an agreed limit and as limited by their economy no sane central bank would want to by printing money at will e g helicopter money so the only other way for banks is to accept deposits from private individuals you can also argue that banks make money by connecting lenders and borrowers and make their profit by being the middleman without using their assets so you can say they are making a profit with the minimum usage of their capital albeit they have the central bank looking over their shoulder to police their behaviour while some banks do charge fees for keeping deposits yes but many provide certain extra services for which they charge that is how they differentiate between no fee accounts and fee paying accounts

the buying service your credit union uses is similar to the one my credit union uses i have used their service several times there is no direct cost to use the service though the credit union as a whole might have a fee to join the service i have used it 4 times over the decades if you know what make and model you want to purchase or at least have it narrowed down to just a few choices you can get an exact price for that make model and options you do this before negotiating a price you are then issued a certificate you have to go to a specific salesman at a specific dealership but near a large city there will be several dealers to pick from   there is no negotiating at the dealership you still have to deal with a trade in and the financing option dealer credit union or cash but it is nice to not have to negotiate on the price of course there is nobody to stop you from using the price from the buying service as a goal when visiting a more conveniently located dealership that is what i did last time the first couple of times i used the standard credit union financing and the last time i did n't need a loan even if you do n't use the buying service one way to pay for the car is to get the loan from the credit union but get the rebate from the dealer many times if you get the low dealer financing you ca n't get the rebate doing it this way actually saves money speaking of rebates see how the buying service addresses them the big national rebates   were still honored during at least one of my purchases so it turned out to be the buying service price minus $ 1,000 if your service worked like my experience the cost to you was a little time to get the price and a little time in a different dealer to verify that the price was good

how is that possible the mutual fund does n't pay taxes and passes along the tax bill to shareholders via distributions would be the short answer your basis likely changed as now you have bought more shares but i gained absolutely nothing from my dividend so how is it    taxable the fund has either realized capital gains dividends interest or some other form of income that it has to pass along to shareholders as the fund does n't pay taxes itself did i get screwed the first year because i bought into the fund too    late in the year perhaps if you do n't notice that your cost basis has changed here so that you 'll have lower taxes when you sell your shares   is anyone familiar with what causes this kind of situation of    receiving a taxable dividend that does n't actually increase the    account balance yes i am rather familiar with this the point to understand is that the fund does n't pay taxes itself but passes this along the shareholders that hold funds in tax advantaged accounts like 401ks and iras still get the distribution but are shielded from paying taxes on those gains at that point at time is it because i bought too late in the year   no it is because you did n't know the fund would have a distribution of that size that year some funds can have negative returns yet still have a capital gains distribution if the fund experiences enough redemptions that the fund had to sell appreciated shares in a security this is part of the risk in having stock funds in taxable accounts or is it because the fund had a negative return that year   no it is because you do n't understand how mutual funds and taxes work along with what distribution schedule the fund had do i wait until after the distribution date this year to buy i 'd likely consider it for taxable accounts yes however if you are buying in a tax advantaged account then there is n't that same issue

i think something telling about this article is how people seem to be with the 1 the 1 are exactly that one fucking percent should n't we be happy that the top 1 are earning significantly more than $ 100,000   the argument of whether or not $ 100,000 is a good salary is a far different argument as many have brought up already location is a large factor in how far your money will go as well as other factors but that 's not my point   but as income inequality in the us continues to worsen a $ 100,000 salary ever closer to being an upper middle class income not a sure sign of wealth   the article seems to subtly suggest one should be unsatisfied that they are not part of or close to being included in the 1 or seen as wealthy

one opinion related to savings is to save 30 of your take home salary every month split the amount into two parts depending on your age 29 one part would be 30 of 30 and another 70 of 30 take the 70 and buy blue chip stock and take the 30 and buy govt bonds each 10 years adjust the percentages at 40 40 on bonds and 60 on stock only cash out on the day you retire otherwise ignore all market economic movements with this and the statutory savings employment retirement you should be ok

forecasts of stock market direction are not reliable so you should n't be putting much weight on them   long term you can expect to do better in stocks but obtaining this better expected return has the danger of buying in to the market at a particularly bad moment leading to a substantially lower return   so mitigate that risk while moving in a big piece of cash by dollar cost averaging   an example would be to divide your cash hoard conceptually into say six pieces and invest each piece in the index fund two months apart   after a year you will have invested the whole sum at about the average of the index for the year

congratulations on keeping better track of your finances typically there will be a class of accounts labelled income under which you will have a separate account for each type of income stock dividends paychecks home appreciation etc in that case showing your income would be a transfer from the paycheck account to your checking account   note that as there are no offsetting transactions this means your income account will steadily accrue a balance over time just ignore this number it 's only the sum of all your paychecks   there are methods of dealing with that number and making the income account have a zero balance but you do n't need to worry about it at this stage   just learning to properly track expenses is the major accomplishment

it is possible to not use checks in the us i personally use a credit card for almost everything and often have no cash in my wallet at all i never carry checks with me if we wanted to we could pay all of our monthly bills without checks as well and many people do this 30 years ago grocery stores did n't generally accept credit cards so it was cash or check though most other kinds of stores and restaurants did now the only stores that i have encountered in years that do not accept credit cards are a local chicken restaurant and the warehouse shopping store costco costco accepts its own credit card but not mastercard or visa still we do pay the majority of our monthly bills via check and it would not be shocking to see someone paying for groceries with a check i ca n't name the last time i saw someone write a check at a store exactly but i 've never seen any cashier or other patrons wonder what a check writer was trying to do large transactions like buying a car or house would still use checks probably cashier 's or certified checks and not personal checks though

let me give you the benefit of my experience i paid a bunch of points 4 when i bought my first house for similar reasons than you mentioned including why i wish i had n't 1 interest rates plummeted not as likely to happen today and i wound up refinancing the loan within the fist 10 years negating the savings that i would have had over the life of the loan also it made me feel stupid for paying close to $ 5 k to knock 1 or so off the loan rate only to have an even lower rate offered to me with no points within a decade 2 i did n't take into account that i 'm the type of person who would try to pay the loan off early and i did way early so even if i had n't refinanced the extra points were really a waste of money 3 in the us at least you ca n't always deduct all of the money you paid in points in the first year you may have to spread that deduction over several years 4 you are right about the alternative being better investing the points since the benefit of paying them is at most 1 2 on your loan you do n't even need a 6 7 return to make it a better deal to invest them however i get skeptical when people compare paying interest to returns on invested money like that if you do n't pay the points will you actually invest that money for the 30 years or whatever the term of the loan is it 's easy to say that when you are talking but $ 5k in your pocket is also pretty tempting when the deal is done good luck with the new house

prop proprietary traders trade using huge amounts of a bank 's money i.e. other people 's money so the reason why they have such low commissions and they certainly do is that the firms for which they work negotiate low commissions as the quantities and volumes as they also trade very frequently will be high and so the total commission will be very high there is no such thing as a prop trading account unless you are a big bank with a very large bank roll tens of millions of usd so you can not open one to enjoy those benefits unless you have enough money that you can negotiate your commission with brokers 25k cad is definitely not enough money to even start a conversation about those sorts of commissions note prop traders are generally banned from trading intraday with their own money by their employers and the law as it is a massive conflict of interests those who do and get caught face lengthy prison sentences

  so your question is how confident are people that fb stock will close above a certain price at a certain time   a call option contract allows you to buy shares in the future at a certain price   fb calls are available for march of 2013   the number in the strike column is the price you can buy fb stock at on the given date let 's take the strike   this allows you to buy fb shares at $ 33 each next march   if at that time it turns out they 're worth $ 50 each you can buy them at $ 33 then immediately sell them on the open market for $ 50 making money   the person selling you the option knows that there 's a chance the price will be above $ 33 in march so he 's going to charge you a few bucks to cover that possibility   in this case he 's charging you $ as of me writing this   so you can have the option to buy fb shares at $ 33 each for $   this means the guy selling you the option is reasonably confident that in march fb stock will be at or under $ otherwise he 'd lose money when you exercised the option     therefore $ is the option market 's best guess as to the highest fb stock will be going for in march

i 'm not following what 's the meaning of open a mutual fund you do n't open a mutual fund you invest in it there 's a minimum required investment $ 2000 could be some funds have lower limits you do n't have to go with the fidelity one necessarily but in general it has nothing to do with your roth ira account you can invest in mutual funds with any trading account not just roth ira or any other specific kind if you invest in etf 's   you can invest in funds just as well subject to the minimums set as to the plan itself buying and selling etf 's will cost you commission ~2 3 of your investment over several months you may get positive returns and may get negative returns but keep in mind that you start with the 2 3 loss on day 1 within a short period of time especially in the current economic climate which is very unstable just out of recession election year etc etc i would think that keeping the cash in a savings account would be a better choice while with etf you do n't have any guarantees other than -3 then with savings accounts you can at least have a guaranteed return of ~1 apy i.e. wo n't earn much over the course of your internship but you 'll keep your money safe for your long term investment for the long term the fluctuations of month to month do n't matter much so investing now for the next 50 years you should n't care about the stock market going 10 in april so keep your 1000 in savings account and if you want to invest 5000 in your roth ira invest it then assuming of course that you 're completely positive about not needing this money in the next several decades

they are just now where you might expect them they ca n't bring it to major cities yet but there are some companies bringing fiber to rural areas they are doing this where the max dsl speeds are not fast enough to be considered broadband and there is no other alternative that qualifies there is a government grant program which gives them money to bring fiber or any broadband but there 's no reason to not run fiber if you 're going to the trouble if when these companies can become profitable enough to move into territories without the grant you will see google fiber competitors in my town they are basically circling the city with fiber to the home just by covering the grant areas and expect to bring it in the city where we have charter which is actually pretty good except for the upload speeds within two years charter has already been upping their offerings in the area and has even doubled the speed at no cost for people in areas that are being served by the new fiber or will be soon as there is some overlap    fiber is n't that far off for most people because from what i understand almost everyone lives with 2 miles of a fiber run if you have cell phone access as most all cell phone towers have fiber to them and the way it works is odd in that no normal isp owns the fiber it 's by other companies that have to sell access to whoever can pay for it this is just what i 've heard from some discussions with people about the fiber company here so i do n't know everything maybe someone else here has more information

this sort of thinking is one of the problems with economics it 's way too simplistic and of how a company works no company increases the price of a product because they hired a more expensive employee unless said employee is dead weight    it might be a process engineer that right now costs the company a bit more but 12 months down the line will improve production efficiency by at least the value of his salary and if they improve it more by say 200 of their salary product price stays the same he gets a pat on his back from the boss and the company increases it 's profits    and what usually happens when you nickel and dime your employees they lose engagement and interest or worst they hire a shit employee for a shit salary and get little to no benefit from hiring

first of all bear in mind that there 's no such thing as a risk free investment if you keep your money in the bank you 'll struggle to get a return that keeps up with inflation the same is true for other safe investments like government bonds gold and silver are essentially completely speculative investments over the years their price tends to vary quite wildly so unless you really understand how those markets work you should steer well clear they 're certainly not low risk repeatedly buying a property to sell in a couple of years time is almost certainly a bad idea you 'll end up paying substantial transaction fees each time that would wipe out a lot of the possible profit and of course there 's always the risk that prices would go down not up buying a property to keep and preferably live in might be a decent option once you have a good deposit saved up it 's very hard to say where prices will go in future on the one hand london prices are very high by historical standards but on the other hand supply is likely to remain severely constrained for years to come i tend to think of a house as something that i need one of for the rest of my life and so in one sense not owning a house to live in is a gamble that house prices and rents wo n't go up substantially if you own a house you 're insulated from changes in rent etc and even if prices crash at least you still have somewhere to live however that argument only works really well if you expect to keep living in the same area under most circumstances house prices might crash in your area but not elsewhere

banks consider investment mortgages and any mortgage where you do n't live in the property as a riskier investment than an owner occupied home collateral mortgage the sources of increased risk range from concerns that you will screw up as a landlord your tenants will destroy the place you wo n't have tenants and ca n't afford to pay the bank and/or you 'll take out several other investment mortgages and over extend yourself all of these risks are compounded by the fact that it is harder for the bank to convince you to pay when they ca n't put you out on the street if you default banks lend and invest in money not real estate so they would much rather have a paying loan than a foreclosed house especially with the modern foreclosure glut the increased risk means the bank will charge higher interest for the loan may require a higher downpayment and will require higher lending standards before issuing the loan a new housing investor can get around these higher prices by living in the home for a few years before renting it out though your lender could possibly require you to renegotiate the loan if you move out too soon

the question you are asking concerns the exercise of a short option position   the other replies do not appear to address this situation suppose that apple is trading at $ 96 and you sell a put option with a strike price of $ 95 for some future delivery date say august 2016   the option contract is for 100 shares and you sell the contract for a premium of $ 3.20 when you sell the option your account will be credited with the premium and debited with the broker commission   the premium you receive will be $ 320 = 100 x $ 3.20   the commission you pay will depend on you broker now suppose that the price of apple drops to $ 90 and your option is exercised either on expiry or prior to expiry   then you would be obliged to take delivery of 100 apple shares at the contracted option strike price of $ 95 costing you $ 9,500 plus broker commission   if you immediately sell the apple shares you have purchased under your contract obligations then assuming you sell the shares at the current market price of $ 90 you would realise a loss of $ 500 = plus commission   since you received a premium of $ 320 when you sold the put option your net loss would be $ = $ 180 plus any commissions paid to your broker now let 's look at the case of selling a call option   again assume that the price of apple is $ 96 and you sell a call option for 100 shares with a strike price of $ 97 for a premium of $   the premium you receive would be $ 360 = 100 x $   you would also be debited for commission by your broker now suppose that the price of apple shares rises to $ 101 and your option is exercised   then you would be obliged to deliver 100 apple shares to the party exercising the option at the contracted strike price of $ 97   if you did not own the shares to effect delivery then you would need to purchase those shares in the market at the current market price of $ 101 and then sell them to the party exercising the option at the strike price of $ 97   this would realise an immediate loss of $ 400 = 100 x $ plus any   commission payable   if you did own the shares then you would simply deliver them and possibly pay some commission or a delivery fee to your broker   since you received $ 360 when you sold the option your net loss would be $ 40 = $ plus any commission and fees payable to the broker it is important to understand that in addition to these accounting items short option positions carry with them a margin requirement   you will need to maintain a margin deposit to show good faith so long as the short option position is open   if the option you have sold moves against you then you will be called upon to put up extra margin to cover any potential losses

never thought about the difference in goals between manufacturers and local businesses   ultimately they have the same goals sale of product services   but they have a hugely different emphasis   john deere wants you to buy john deere brand products and they really do n't care where you buy it   walmart target generally do n't really give a crap what brand you buy so long as you buy it from walmart target   so john deere 's advertising is all about convincing you to only be interested in buying a john deere from where ever   and the retailer aka local business whether a chain or independent advertising is all about getting you to come back to their store to buy well whatever which can be specific or anything and everything they sell   those things can coincide when there is some exclusive relationship so the local john deere dealer is interested in promoting the john deere brand but really only to the extent that you buy a john deere from them and not from some other dealer store   and likewise the local buick dealer wants you to buy a buick but chiefly so that you will buy one from them and/or so that you will come to them to buy parts service which most dealers actually tend to make more money on than they do from the sale of the car itself     your knowledge about the facebook ad model might be able to help me with a personal project i 'm doing    i do n't know that it i would call it knowledge about the facebook ad model it 's more general knowledge about how the advertising marketing world and speculation with back of the napkin style calculations regarding about how far away from reality facebook 's supposed super specific targeting actually is     gt;if you care to take a whack at it read on what interested me before the ipo was the debate about the value of fb 's ad model   this is was kind of my whole point though i 'm coming from a different tack than you my view is that regardless of how effective ineffective fb 's ads prove to be   1 there is only so much commerce in the world granted it can grow but it does so on an incremental basis in real money terms   2 only a certain percentage of it is going to be spent on advertising   3 a lot of that probably 50 or more is local advertising marketing done not by the big players but by smaller more local operations   4 there is no way that facebook will capture anywhere near even 50 of even the big player advertising marketing money competing against all other types of media yeah not gon na happen and they are n't even trying to get any of the local money   5 as a result of the above there is no way for facebook to achieve the revenues much less the profit margins to support anything anywhere near the valuation it at   6 ergo the price of the stock will continue to drop especially as insiders amp previous investors cash in by selling additional stock into the float until it reaches a price that can be supported by a reasonable p e say in the 10 to 20 range that is based on actual achievable revenues which i do n't see any way for the final value of fb to be anything over $ 10 a share more likely the will end up in the $ 4 to $ 5 range and possibly even lower especially if they continue to things as they have recently ultimately especially if they dilute the shares as they seem likely to it will probably end up as a $ 1 to $ 2 stock   as to your questions i think we 're barking up different trees your approach sounds interesting but i would n't have any idea where you could get hard data on any of that at best you i think whatever data you can lay hands on is going to be a lot of highly dubious and speculative bs in no small part because i do n't think anyone really has any harder data maybe gm does and that is why they dropped their use of the stuff

here are a few things that you could try but note that they are all capable of failing they will just reduce the chance of you personally having a lost decade first a quibble john bogle advocates a total stock market index something like vanguard 's vtsmx instead of an s&p fund as the latter represents only 85 or so of the us market 's total capitalization smaller companies behave slightly differently than members of the s&p so this might provide a small help bogle also advocates holding some bonds in addition to equities i 'll expand on that below account for dividends just because the value of the index is the same as its value 10 or 20 years ago does n't necessarily mean that decade was lost the companies in the s&p are currently paying out an annualized dividend of about 2 even if the actual value of the index does n't change you 're still getting that 2 per year   include bonds   as i mentioned above bogle recommends holding some bonds i have seen two common rules one is to never have less than 20 of your total holdings in bonds and never have more than 80 of your total holdings in bonds the other popular rule is to hold your age in bonds for example i 'm about 30 so i should keep about 30 of my holdings in bonds regardless of the split rebalance periodically to keep yourself at that split what effect would holding bonds have on a lost decade to make the math easy let 's say you split your holdings evenly between an s&p fund and 10 year treasuries coincidentally 10 year t notes have the same 2 yield as the s&p dividends if you 're getting that on half your holdings and nothing on the other half you 're netting 1 per year not great but not totally lost to illustrate the effect of rebalancing use my example of a 70/30 stock bond split the s&p lost about 50 of its value from its peak to the bottom of the market in early 2008 if you only held stock you would need the market to increase in value by 100 in order for you to recover that value if 30 of your holdings are in bonds and you rebalance at exactly the bottom of the stock market you only need the stock index to increase in value by about 80 from the bottom in order to make you whole again i mention those two to emphasize that your investment return is not just a function of the price of a stock index dollar cost average it 's rare that you will actually face the situation of putting say $ 100,000 into the market all at once let it sit for 10 20 years then take it all out at once the situation you face is closer to putting about $ 1000 into the market every month for 100 months if you do that then you 're getting a different price for each purchase you make your actual return will be a weighted average of the return from each of those purchases but note that this could help or hurt you using the chart victor showed in his answer if your lost decade is from one peak to the next peak your average price will be below the price you would have entered and left at so this helps but if your lost decade is from trough to trough then your average price is higher than the start and end price so this has hurt you those are the two extreme cases and the general case will be somewhere in between and you can use these regular purchases to help you carry out your regular rebalancing foreign equities since you mention the s&p500 specifically i assume that you are in the united states the us equities is approximately 45 of the world equities market so even if the s&p500 has a lost decade it 's unlikely that the rest of the world will also have a lost decade at the same time for comparison the tokyo stock exchange is the third largest in the world behind the us 's nyse and nasdaq the market cap of the tse is less than 20 that of the combined market cap of the nyse and the nasdaq which puts it at about 10 of the world 's market cap when the nikkei had its lost decades no one else had a lost decade note that buying foreign equities is more expensive than buying domestic and it exposes you to fluctuations in the exchange rate of the currencies but the benefit of diversification probably outweighs those downsides and obviously it 's easier to diversify away from japan than it is to diversify away from the united states but there are people who advocate holding exactly the market weight of every country in the world

you have no grounds for a refund the flight took off on time and you chose not to be on board the fact that the airline could not guarantee ahead of time that the flight would leave on time is not relevant you can certainly try to dispute the charge with the airline and it sounds like you have done so the airline correctly indicates that your dispute is unfounded you can call up your credit card company and explain the situation and they may accept your dispute however i am not aware of any credit card that would reimburse you that is issue a chargeback in this situation i 'm not trying to be it sucks that you felt you could not rely on the airline and are now out some money fundamentally though this was your choice the airline would be obligated to reimburse you the cost of your flight or book you on another flight if the flight was cancelled due to bad weather or other issues but they owe you nothing if the flight took off on schedule

it is absolutely feasible to move your savings into canada there are a few ways you can do it however it is unlikely you will benefit or avoid risk by doing so you could directly hold your savings in the cad investing in canadian bonds achieves a similar goal as holding your money in the cad by doing so you will be getting re payed with cad some canadian companies also trade on us markets in addition some brokerage firms allow you to trade on canadian markets the problem with any of the options is the assumption that canadian banks will fare better then us banks the entire globe is very dependent on each other especially the more developed nations if large us banks were to fail it would create a domino effect which would spiral into a global credit crunch it would n't matter if your invested in canadian companies or us companies they would all suffer as would the global economy so it would probably be more valid to refer to your question enter link description here if you are referring to weather the canadian bonds would be a safer investment over us treasuries it would all depend on the scenario at hand investors would probably flock to both treasuries

a simple way to ask the question might be to say why ca n't i just use the same trick with my own shares to make money on the way down why is borrowing someone else 's shares necessary to make the concept a viable one why is n't it just the inverse of going long a simple way to think about it is this to make money by trading something you must buy it for less than you sell it for   this applies to stocks like anything else   if you believe the price will go up then you can buy them first and sell them later for a higher price   but if you believe the price will go down the only way to buy low and sell high is to sell first and buy later   if you buy the stock and it goes down any sale you make will lose you money i 'm still not sure i fully understand the point of your example but one thing to note is that in both cases i.e. whether you buy the share back at the end or not you lost money   you say that you made $ 5 on the share price dropping but that is n't true at all you can see in your example that your final account balance is negative in both cases   you paid $ 20 for the shares but only got $ 15 back you lost $ 5 or in the other version of your example paid $ 20 and got back $ 5 plus the depreciated shares if you had bought the shares for $ 20 and sold them for say $ 25 then your account would end up with a positive $ 5 balance that is what a gain would look like   but you ca n't achieve that if you buy the shares for $ 20 and later sell them for less at a guess you seem to be confusing the concept of making a profit with the concept of cutting your losses   it is true that if you buy the shares for $ 20 and sell them for $ 15 you lose only $ 5 whereas if you buy them for $ 20 and sell for $ 10 you lose the larger amount of $ 10   but those are both losses   selling early as the price goes down does n't make you any money it just stops you from losing more money than you would if you sold later

firstly make sure annual income exceeds annual expenses the difference is what you have available for saving   secondly you should have tiers of savings from most to least liquid and least to most rewarding the core of personal finance is managing the flow of money between these tiers to balance maximizing return on savings with budget constraints for example insurance effectively allows society to move money from savings to stocks and bonds and a savings account lets the bank loan out a bit of your money to people buying assets like homes   note that the above set of accounts is just a template from which you should customize you might want to add in an fsa or hsa extra loan payments or taxable brokerage accounts depending on your cash flow debt and tax situation

suing is a legitimate option as well as screening your calls but here 's another idea which has personally worked and relates to the collections i did for awhile   talk with the collector   outstanding debt gets sold many times and each time a new collector gets their hands on an account they do their due diligence which means calling every single number multiple times   collectors a looking for consumers who actively evade collections calls for years my recommendation is to use logic and explain the situation   give your first name and describe when you received the phone number and then ask a simple question   when in the last 3 1/2 years have you or any collector had a successful hit from this number   they 'll respond never in 3 1/2 years   the collector notes the account for themselves and future collectors   debt collectors are about about making money not wasting time and they do review all notes pertaining to an account   will it work   maybe not but hopefully it will stop the calls with a short conversation   good luck

as far as i know any business can register for vat regardless of the nature of the business   if all the goods you sell or services you provide are vat exempt or zero rated then you will get refunds from hmrc on vat your business pays any business whose non vat exempt turnover which would include zero rated goods and services provided exceeds the registration threshold must register again even if that means they are forced to claim refunds so the only question would be whether your rather nebulous activities were enough to qualify you as a business or organisation to which the vat regime applies at all the one liner answer to that is   generally if goods or services are provided in return for a charge there ’s a business activity for vat purposes inevitably there 's a much bigger body of statute and case law and it wo n't always be obvious whether the one liner answer applies or not to a particular activity so it may be necessary to seek specialist advice

the time value decay is theoretically constant   in reality it is driven by supply and demand just like everything else in the market    for instance if a big earnings announcement is coming out after the close for the day you may see little or no time decay in the price of the options during the day before also while in theory options have a set value as related to the trading price of the underlying security that does not mean there will always be a buyer willing to pay a premium as they come close to expiration in the last few minutes you ca n't forget to account for the transaction fees associated with buying the options or the risk factor involved    it is rare but there are times i 've actually had to sell in the money calls at a penny or two less than they 're actually worth at the time just to unload them in the last few minutes before the market closed on expiration day

so let 's say as a counterfactual that obama did not bail out the banks what would happen the world economy would have collapsed every creditor and their funds to endless bankruptcy stays all credit would have been frozen no businesses would have been able to pay off their loans or pay their employees salaries the banks sadly were too big to fail because everyone and everything depended on them for funding the issue is not the bailout but the of the banks that forced the bailout this is why all of the current legislative schemes being put into operation are looking at way to limit systemic risk to both prevent future bankruptcies and limit their impact on the credit markets    as a last note notice how inflation did not significantly increase since the bailout despite bernanke printing trillions of dollars printing money has not caused harm in and of itself its only harm is reinforcing the too big to fail mentality this can be cured but by not bailing out the banks we would have seen a collapse

note too that being a contractor means that you will have periods between contracts you tend to be out of work more often than a salaried employee would you need to set your rates so your average income including those down times adds up to a living wage including all those benefits that are n't being covered if a company hires a contractor they understand that this is part of the trade off they avoid making a long term commitment when they do n't have a long term need and they accept that this convenience may cost a bit more in the short term

immigration increases the supply side of the labor market which drives down wages thus driving down costs for the companies that hire them that 's how the employers pay less   one of the major reasons why silicon valley firms are so outrageously profitable today is because they 've utilized the h-1b visas to reduce wages    some people libertarians especially would argue that even if wages within certain markets are decreased the economy as a whole is still better off since lower costs for businesses results in lower prices for consumers which can expand markets more people willing to buy stuff when it 's cheaper and the money saved can now be allocated elsewhere creating more jobs advancing technology etc   but that is a separate and much more complex discussion that involves a lot more variables in order to understand the true cost of the increased immigration including public services social crime etc versus economic benefits
