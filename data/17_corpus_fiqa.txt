yes you should be able to deduct at least some of these expenses   for expense incurred before you started the business what are deductible startup costs the irs defines startup costs as deductible capital expenses that are used to pay for 1 the cost of investigating the creation or acquisition of an active trade or business this includes costs incurred for markets product analysis labor supply visiting potential business locations and similar expenditures 2 the cost of getting a business ready to operate before you open your doors or start generating income these include employee training and wages consultant fees advertising and travel costs associated with finding suppliers distributors and customers these expenses can only be claimed if your research and preparation ends with the formation of a successful business the irs has more information on how to claim the expenses if you do n’t go into business once your business is underway you can deduct expenses but the exact details depend on how you organized   if you 're a sole proprietor for tax purposes then you 'll deduct them on schedule c of your form 1040 on your personal tax   if you are a partnership c corp or s corp they will be accounted at the business level and either passed on to you on a schedule k partnership and s corp or deducted directly by the company c corp in any case you will need good records that justify your expenses as business related it might be well worth at least an initial meeting with a cpa to make sure that you get started on the right foot

my preferred method of doing this is to get a bank draft from the us in euros and then pay it into the french bank my countries are canada and uk but the principle is the same the cost of the bank draft is about $ 8 so very little more than the atm method if you use bigger amounts it can be less overall cost the disadvantage is that a bank draft takes a week or so to write and a few days to clear so you would have to plan ahead i would keep enough money in the french account for one visit and top it up with a new bank draft every visit or two

one of the often cited advantages of etfs is that they have a higher    liquidity and that they can be traded at any time during the trading    hours on the other hand they are often proposed as a simple way to    invest private funds for people that do not want to always keep an eye    on the market hence the intraday trading is mostly irrelevant for    them i am pretty sure that this is a subjective idea the fact is you may buy goog aapl f or whatever you as well such as qqq spy etc and keep them for a long time in both cases if you do not want to keep an on the market it is ok because if you keep them it is called idea is collecting dividends etc if you are day trading then is it called speculation because you main goal is to earn by buying and selling of course you may loose as well so you do not care about dividends or owning some percent of the company as etfs are derived instruments their volatility depends on the volatility of the related shares i 'm wondering whether there are secondary effects that make the    liquidity argument interesting for private investors despite not    using it themselves what would these effects be and how do they    impact when compared for example to mutual funds to turn cash could create high volatility which means high risk and high reward from this point of view mutual funds are more safe because money managers know how to diversify the total portfolio and manage income under any market conditions

regardless of what they are doing you ca n't kill inflation every single dollar created by the federal reserve is done so out of debt through a promissory note loaned by the us treasury the note which is essentially debt is created amp loaned with the understanding that the federal reserve will one day pay off it off however this is impossible because more money would have to be created to pay of these notes which in turn creates more debt but wait let 's not forget to factor in tax the debt can never be paid off it is literally impossible through our current system of currency circulation carried out by the federal reserve in other words due to our crippling debt that can not be inflation will continue to occur because our currency will continue to devalue those that created the federal reserve in what the 20 's knew all of this to be true there goal was to destabilize the economy and they succeeded they being large influential families such as the and the this is the exact reason andrew jackson shut down the original central bank they are a foundation for corruption and anyone who tells you otherwise is either ill informed or in on it it is impossible to kill inflation amp the notion that one company or one man can do so is preposterous and simply click bait

to protect yourself from an increase in interest rates get a fixed rate loan the loan terms interest rate number of payments monthly payments will be fixed for the loan of course if rate for the rest of the market drops during the period of the loan you may be able to refinance the loan but if you ca n't refinance or wo n't refinance the drop in rates for the rest of the market does n't help you if you want to be able to have your rate float you can get a variable rate loan of course it can float up or it can float down so you take that risk because of that risk adjustable rate loans start at a lower rate if the market interest rate drops far enough many people will refinance into a fixed rate loan at a lower rate than they could have gotten at the start for adjustable rate loans the lender during the application process details how the rate is determined it is pegged to be x% above some national or international interest rate that they do n't have any control over if that base rate moves then your loan rate may move they also specify how often it will adjust and the maximum it can adjust between each adjustments and over the entire life of the loan   that rate that starts initially lower than the fixed rate loan is the that many people have to pick an adjustable rate loan some do it because they believe they will payoff the loan before the rates get too high or they will see enough increase in income so they can afford the higher monthly payment if rates rise if they are wrong about these things they may find themselves in trouble the terms of the adjustable rate loan still have to follow the terms of the contract the lender ca n't change the offset or the source used to used to set interest rate

in short if your expenses rise with inflation but your income does not your expenses will eventually exceed your income as the article on perpetuities says a perpetuity is an annuity that pays forever   an annuity is a financial arrangement whereby you are paid a fixed sum every so often for a period of time   hence a perpetuity is an arrangement whereby you are paid a fixed sum every so often until you die   since the sum is fixed in nominal dollars or other currency units it will become worth less and less in real dollars as time goes on which is what will erode your financial independence to adapt the example from the article that you quote if you buy an annuity that will pay you $ 101 per month and your expenses are $ 100 per month you may seem to be financially independent   however if inflation is 2 per year then next year your expenses will be $ 102 but the annuity will still only pay you $ 100   at that point you will no longer be financially independent since the annuity no longer covers your expenses there are some senses in which the article 's statement is inaccurate in practical terms e.g. annuities need not always have fixed payments but may be adjusted for inflation also there are n't many real perpetuities in existence anyway and plus it does n't matter whether the source of the income is an annuity or something else but that is the gist of what the article is saying

it depends to some extent on how you interpret the situation so i think this is the general idea say you purchase one share at $ 50 and soon after the price moves up say to $ 55 you now have an unrealized profit of $ 5 now you can either sell and realize that profit or hold on to the position expecting a further price appreciation in either case you will consider the price change from this traded price which is $ 55 and not the price you actually bought at hence if the price fell to $ 52 in the next trade you have a loss of $ 3 on your previous profit of $ 5 this even though your net p&l is calculated from the initial purchase price of $ 50 allows you to think in terms of your positions at the latest known prices this is similar to a markov process in the sense that it does n't matter which route the stock price and your position 's p&l took to get to the current point your decision should be based on the current latest price level

i agree with a lot of what you said and i know a great many esteemed economists are trying to point the big finger of blame at the rating agencies who could have and should have scrutinized what they were evaluating as opposed to because of cash however you did not mention leveraging leveraging when left unchecked becomes very dangerous although you have an opportunity to make far more than the initial investment would supply without the added leverage any loss becomes exponentially more devastating and quickly your loss from this one transaction is more than your initial investment not to mention when everyone finds out and nobody wants to buy the bullshit funds you were peddling and you ca n't repay the person who gave you leverage then

on average you should be saving at least 10 15 of your income in order to be financially secure when you retire   different people will tell you different things but really this can be split between short term savings cash long term savings 401ks iras stocks bonds and paying down debt that $ 5k is a good start on an emergency fund but you probably want a little more   as justkt said 6 months worth is what you want to aim for   put this in a money market account where you 'll earn a little more interest but wo n't be penalized from withdrawing it when its needed you may have to live off it after all beyond that i would split things up if possible have payroll deductions going to a broker sharebuilder is a good one to start with if you ca n't spare much change as well as an ira at a bank set up a separate checking account just for rent and utilities put a month 's worth of cash in there and have another payroll deduction that covers your living expenses + maybe 5 put in there automatically   then set up automatic bill payments so you do n't even have to think about it   check it once a month to make sure there are n't any surprises pay off your credit cards every month   these are by far the most expensive forms of credit that most people have   you should n't be financing large purchases with them you 'll get better rates by taking a personal loan from a bank set specific goals for savings and set up automatic payroll deductions to work towards them   especially for buying a house most responsible lenders will ask for 20 down   in today 's market that means you need to write a check for $ 40k or $ 50k   while it 's tempting to finance up to 100 of the property value it 's also risky considering how volatile markets can be   you do n't want to end up owing more on the property than it 's worth two years down the road if you find yourself at the end of the month with an extra $ 50 or so consider your savings goals or your current debt instead of blowing it on a toy   especially if you have long term debt high balance credit cards vehicle or property loans applying that money directly to principal can save you months or years paying it back and hundreds or thousands of dollars of interest all depending on the details of the loan of course above all have fun with it   think of your personal net worth as you do your gamer score on the xbox and look for ways to maximize it with a minimum of effort or investment on your part   investing in yourself and your future can be incredibly rewarding emotionally

below is just a little information on this topic from my small unique book the small stock trader   the most significant non company specific factor affecting stock price is the market sentiment while the most significant company specific factor is the earning power of the company perhaps it would be safe to say that technical analysis is more related to psychology emotions while fundamental analysis is more related to reason that is why it is said that fundamental analysis tells you what to trade and technical analysis tells you when to trade thus many stock traders use technical analysis as a timing tool for their entry and exit points technical analysis is more suitable for short term trading and works best with large caps for stock prices of large caps are more correlated with the general market while small caps are more affected by company specific news and speculation perhaps small stock traders should not waste a lot of time on fundamental analysis avoid the financial position market position and management of the focus companies it is difficult to make wise trading decisions based only on fundamental analysis company specific news accounts for only about 25 percent of stock price fluctuations there are only a few important figures and ratios to look at such as perhaps also furthermore single ratios and figures do not tell much so it is wise to use a few ratios and figures in combination you should look at their trends and also compare them with the company ’s main competitors and the industry average preferably you want to see trend improvements in these above mentioned figures and ratios or at least some stability when the times are tough despite all the exotic names found in technical analysis simply put it is the study of supply and demand for the stock in order to predict and follow the trend many stock traders claim stock price just represents the current supply and demand for that stock and moves to the greater side of the forces of supply and demand   if you focus on a few simple small caps perhaps you should just use the basic principles of technical analysis such as   i have no doubt that there are different ways to make money in the stock market some may succeed purely on the basis of technical analysis some purely due to fundamental analysis and others from a combination of these two like most of the great stock traders have done jesse livermore baruch nicolas william and steven cohen it is just a matter of finding out what best fits your personality   i hope the above little information from my small unique book was a little helpful author of the small stock trader

as other uses have pointed out your example is unusual in that is does not include any time value or volatility value in the quoted premiums the premiums you quote are only intrinsic values   for well in the money options the intrinsic value will certainly be the vast majority of the premium but not the sole component having said that the answer would clearly be that the buyer should buy the $ 40 call at a premium of $ 10   the reason is that the buyer will pay less for the option and therefore risk less money or buy more options for the same amount of money   since the buyer is assuming that the price will rise the return that will be realised will be the same in gross terms but higher in relative terms for the buyer of the $ 40 call    for example if the underlying price goes to $ 60 then the buyer of the $ 40 call would potentially double their money when the premium goes from $ 10 to $ 20 while the buyer of the $ 30 call would realise a potential 50 profit when the premium goes from $ 20 to $ 30 considering the situation beyond your scenario things are more difficult if the bet goes wrong   if the underlying prices expires at under $ 40 then the buyer of the $ 40 call will be better off in gross terms but may be worse off in relative terms if it expires above $ 30   if the underlying price expires between $ 40 and $ 50 then the buy of the $ 30 will be better off in relative term having lost a smaller percentage of their money

since most developed countries view a low but positive inflation rate as ideal it is very likely that we will end up with positive inflation   however modern societies such as japan have experienced extraordinarily long periods of deflation   in their case however it is mostly due to a political unwillingness to impose the costs on savers as savers are politically in control as to your point about things being so much cheaper in our grandparents days this is actually completely untrue for the vast majority of goods when measured in real terms e.g. relative to the median workers wages   today a decent bicycle can be bought with the average worker 's earnings over a few days whereas our grandparents would have had to work over a month   a modern radio can be bought for perhaps an hours worth of work $ 10 on amazon.com but our grandparents may have had to spend months working to buy their first radio   there is no reason for this trend not to continue point is inflation is not such a bad thing so long as wage growth keeps up or exceeds it

what you 're looking for is expected value let 's say you invest $ 1000 in option a and later discover that you are going to lose 20   so the expected value of option a is $ 800 if option b has a 50 chance of losing 50 and a 50 of gaining 20 then your expected value is $ 650 $ 650 = $ 1000 50 50 + 50 20 $ 800 > $ 650 so you should stay with option a. in the real world you usually do n't know the exact odds and percentages so substitute in your best guesses   this may lead to suboptimal results but only if your estimations are wrong the formula itself is ideal

you do n't mention what kind of insurance you 're talking about but i 'll just address one angle on the question for some kinds of insurance such as health insurance in the us auto insurance and homeowner 's insurance you may be insuring against an event that you would not be able to pay for without the insurance   for instance if you are at fault in a car accident and someone they could sue you for $ 100,000   a lot of people do n't have $ 100,000   so it 's not even a matter of i 'll take the risk of having to pay it when the time comes if the time comes you could lose virtually everything you own and still have to pay more from future earnings   you 're not just paying $ x to offset a potential loss of $ y you 're paying $ x to offset a potential of your entire life   it is plausible that you could assign a reasonable monetary value to that potential cost that would mean you actually come out ahead in the insurance equation it is with smaller expenses such as insuring a new cellphone against breakage that insurance becomes harder to justify   when the potential collateral damage of a bad event are less you must justify the insurance expenses on the financial consequences only which as you say is often difficult

i would say your decision making is reasonable   you are in the middle of brexit and nobody knows what that means   civil society in the united states is very strained at the moment   the one seeming source of stability in europe germany may end up with a very weakened government   the only country that is probably stable is china and it has weak protections for foreign investors law economics even though economics often ends up dictating the law in the long run the only thing that may come to mind is doing two things differently   the first is mentally dropping the long term versus short term dichotomy and instead think in terms of the types of risks an investment is exposed to such as currency risk political risk liquidity risk and so forth   maturity risk is just one type of risk the second is to consider taking some types of risks that are hedged either by put contracts to limit the downside loss or consider buying longer dated call contracts using a small percentage of your money   if the underlying price falls then the call contracts will be a total loss but if the price increases then you will receive most of the increase minus the premium if you are uncomfortable purchasing individual assets directly then i would say you are probably doing everything that you reasonably can do

absolutely do research on the company and come with questions make sure you send followup thank you emails as soon as possible after your interviews you have a short interview two hours is nothing so unless you interview is with a group of people you will likely have a few to write make each thank you remember key points from those people and reiterate positive parts of the interview or special things that came up that make you stand out if you do n't have all of the email addresses ask the recruiter or hr contact for them or to pass on your thank you messages take two copies of your resume with you a notebook and pen good luck

re   in retirement i do n't see how we can    be in a higher tax bracket than we are    now maybe than we will be if one of    us stops working we buy a house we    have a couple of kids etc that 's assuming tax rates remain the same   what if tax rates go up   consider the u.s. deficit and the debt and unfunded entitlement programs even though you may be in a lower bracket in retirement bracket as in ordered income ranges there 's still a possibility that at that later point in time tax rates in general could be higher than today   so even though you may find yourself in a lower bracket in retirement who is to say the tax rate for that bracket wo n't exceed what you pay today in the higher bracket do n't think switch   rather i 'd consider diversifying retirement savings across both pre tax and roth i.e. make contributions to each type of account so you 're not gambling 100 on which bracket you 'll be in what tax rates will be like in the future etc then you 'll at least have some money in a roth account that in retirement you can do with as you please without having a tax consequence assuming the u.s. government does n't get so desperate as to change the tax free nature of roth account withdrawals

dividend paying stocks are not better   in particular shareholders will get taxed on the distribution while the company can most likely invest the money tax free in their operations   the shareholder then has the opportunity to decide when to pay the taxes when they sell their shares    companies pay dividends for a couple of reasons 1 to signal the strength of the company 2 to reward the shareholders oftentimes the executives of the firm get rather large rewards without having to sell shares they control 3 if they do n't have suitable investment opportunities in their field   ie they do n't have anything useful to do with the money

now store the money in okay here think about a realistic worst case scenario   not zombie attack or mega strike but the kinds   in which you are not entirely helpless job loss stacked on top of the worst recession since the great depression along with credit drying up so you ca n't just borrow your way through the hard times    store the money in an account and investment which is   relatively liquid meaning you could extract cash value from it fairly easily in a worst case   safe essentially impossible to lose significant value in a worst case scenario   or you only count the part of its value that 's sure to be there in a worst case if you 're much too cool for an emergency fund then sorry to waste your valuable time     for the rest of us it 's a planning tool    even dot do this it 's called a burn rate and they know exactly how many more weeks their vc can fund operations     of course in practicality it may not go to x months of routine expenses most of it may get burned up in month 2 on a new transmission   you ca n't really predict this stuff the x month paradigm is just an arm wave    for the financially uneducated it 's also a training tool    in the us school does not provide financial education   most people get financial habits from their parents and like most family lessons they are deeply emotionally wired even if they are of that fact   for instance some people do n't ask for the salaries they deserve and spend until the checkbook is zero they literally push money away   suffice it to say it 's a challenge to get some people to even realize that savings is a thing when they have never in their whole lives been able to hold onto more than $ 20 for more than a week the concept of an emergency fund is a way to break through that i ca n't save mental block so i can see where you might think the emergency fund is greasy    fair   but it 's not just that it 's also a very practical planning tool

yes and no   you can not claim the maid service cleaning your home but you can cleaning your office or your office 's facilities   for example if you have a mother in law suite in the back that you converted to an office and you have a maid service cleaning just that then you should be able to claim the expense another example would be if you have a room in your house set aside as an office careful here and your maid services charges $ 20 per room you should be able to claim that $ 20   another example if you have a maid service that charges you $ 100 to clean your house and you have a dedicated office in that house then you may be   claim a portion of your expenses as a business expense however this can be very subject to your situation for example your much more likely to meet the criteria if you have clients in your office much less likely if your the only person using the office   also you need to be aware that what the irs allows you to call an office is not as clear cut as it seems   your best bet is to ask a tax consultant

i would n't like to say either way what you should do not being an financial advisor or lawyer but i did find an interesting article on walk away from your mortgage   that you might also find helpful to frame your decision it has some interesting information on defaults it says this mortgage holders do sign a promissory note which is a promise to pay but the contract explicitly details the penalty for nonpayment surrender of the property the borrower is n’t escaping the consequences he is suffering them in some states lenders also have recourse to the assets like their car and savings accounts a study by the federal reserve bank of richmond found that defaults are lower in such states apparently because lenders threaten the borrowers with judgments against their assets but actual lawsuits are rare and given that nearly a quarter of mortgages are underwater and that 10 percent of mortgages are delinquent white of the university of arizona is surprised that more people have n’t walked he thinks the desire to avoid shame is a factor as are overblown fears of harm to credit ratings probably homeowners also labor under a delusion that their homes will quickly return to value white has argued that the government should stop default scare stories and indeed should encourage borrowers to default when it ’s in their economic interest this would correct a prevailing imbalance homeowners operate under a powerful moral constraint while lenders are trying to maximize profits more important it might get the system if lenders feared an avalanche of strategic defaults they would have an incentive to renegotiate loan terms in theory this could produce a wave of loan modifications the very goal the treasury has been pursuing to end the crisis

the solution is spending restraint during the growth periods and prudent application of counter cyclical fiscal policy especially during the slow periods the usa on a strange experiment lead be greenspan of excessively low interest rates for a prolonged period of time periods of strong economic growth should feature high interest rates periods of reduced economic growth can then be countered somewhat through monetary policy the government should also endeavour to run surplus budgets during the good times and not be afraid of turning those into deficit budgets in the downturns if you run a deficit budget during a period of strong economic growth together with low cash rates you have nowhere to move when the cycle reverses   the solution now that is difficult i would say that the solution now would be to raise revenues through corporate taxes and similarly increase government spending on investments aimed at stimulating the economy use this time to invest in the much needed infrastructure maintenance and upgrades that the usa needs these need to be fast tracked into action and i would therefore consider fixing infrastructure as more important than installing new infrastructure    there are probably long term structural adjustments that need to be looked at too but i am not intimately familiar with the usa as i am australian it is clear however that austerity during economic downturns does not help end the recession or benign growth it is clear to me as an observer however that employment appears to be the big issue in the usa right now so cutting jobs is not a smart move   edit i 'll point out that my opinion comes from the australian experience our government ran surplus budgets during our period of recent growth and our reserve bank kept interest rates high when the gfc hit us in 2008 the government almost instantly reversed its fiscal policy going so far as mailing $ 900 cheques to every australian just to get cash flowing in the economy they then upon infrastructure spending programs similarly the reserve bank were able to quickly and dramatically reduce interest rates the result was that we saw 1 quarter of mildly negative growth and positive growth ever since hence no recession we ran a textbook example of counter cyclical fiscal and monetary policy which is today lauded by economists over we now have 5 unemployment low government debt relative to the oecd and high economic growth relative to the oecd

gt boeing 's union workers are overcompensated   compared to who some hypothetical unemployed north by that metric we 're all overcompensated i guarantee you that there 's someone somewhere probably many someones in many that would be happy to do your job for a lot less money does that mean that all publicly traded companies have a duty to demand tax incentives to not move to north carolina or poland or cambodia i may sound hyperbolic about this but i 'm completely serious in that question calling someone overcompensated means that the prevailing wage in the competitive labor market for the same quality of work is lower not just assuming that someone would be willing to do it if you offered them $ 40k and a wrench   the fact is boeing has not been able to produce any compelling data about overcompensated workers the nlrb just ruled that it has failed in doing so with it 's engineering union and has ordered it to back up their post nlrb judge boeing failed bargain good faith so all you 've got is a baseless assertion behind this whole argument   moreover the idea that boeing needs to reduce wages in order to remain competitive is baseless as well that 's easy to say and strikes an intuitive chord with the public but there 's no evidence that boeing needs to do this they may want to do it but they could save the same amount of money in countless other ways stopping making stupid decisions to outsource large components around the world would be a great way to save money for starters reducing wages is a desire not a need

pension in this instance seems to mean pension income as opposed to pension pot this money would be determined by whatever assets are being invested in it may be fixed it may be variable completely dependant on the underlying investments an annuity is a product in simple terms you over a lump sum of cash and receive an agreed annual income until you die the underlying investment required to reach that income level is not your concern it 's the provider 's worry so there is a mount of security to the retiree in having an annuity the downside of annuities is that the level of income may be too low for your liking for instance £ would mean £ 400 for every £ 10,000 given to the provider that 's 4 and would take 25 years to break even ignoring inflation opportunity cost of investing yourself therefore the gamble is whether you outlive the deal you could hand over £ 50,000 to a provider and drop dead a year later your £ 50k got you say £ 2k and then you popped your provider wins or you could like 40 years after retiring and then you end up costing the provider £ 80k you win best way to think of an annuity is a route to guaranteed agreed income to secure that guarantee there 's a price to pay and that is a lower income rate than you might like hope that was the kind of reply you were hoping for if not edit your op and ask again chris ps the explanation on the link you provided is pretty dire very confusing use of the term pension and even if that were better the explanation is still bad due to this is much better

yeshiva university amp all the high schools connected to them my boys former yeshiva yeshiva yeshiva yeshiva berlin and plenty of girls schools i mean there are many many many more jewish schools that teach what you are calling modern concepts   you are right that there are many that have an elitist attitude there are many who are absolutely not like that i also find the elitist attitude is more about the fact that many jews do nt have to have any interaction outside of the jewish community they can go to jewish universities work at jewish companies live in predominantly jewish neighborhood and mostly do n't need to interact with anything outside of the jewish community   i do find it wrong because while you can live a life of values we are supposed to be a light upon other nations and that requires some form of interaction   also this is fucking america we need to be a part of this nation does n't mean we need to not be but jews need to show that they are invested in the communities in politics and the like   but then again you gets what s happening with that school board which i 'm on the side that the state is really screwing with that school district with funding from what i have read up on the case so it is a catch 22   as as for not embracing modern ways there is much about political correctness and progressive attitudes that are going far over the top i find that orthodox judaism viewpoint on men amp women are actually pretty slanted towards women and always have been that jewish religious law only applies to jews and not non jews so all that stuff that the christians keep saying oh the old testament says this and blah blah blah according to jews it does n't apply to non jews only the 7 laws of noah apply to the of the world according to judaism   also by following the sorry but that does n't mean we are a part of the modern civilization if one does n't like following orthodox judaism then do n't do so no one is forcing you with a gun to your head most orthodox jews i know are respectful of conservative amp reform jews i know where we live it is very much like that two of my kids are best friends with kids whose parents belong to a conservative orthodox jews are a part of every type of career that is out there they do n't force their ideology onto others do n't try to convince people to convert do n't tell you that you are going to hell if you do n't follow their and the biggest things that set jews apart are dietary laws following the and all of our holidays and how does that hurt anyone or make us not modern   yes there are many who are not like what i wrote above but the majority are not like what you wrote

well first off yes every year the younger generation grows up but remember that the older generation also dying off leaving the market place also what happens if the younger generation ca n't take up enough debt in order to pay for previous commitments   secondly i think you 're confusing the money supply with actual production the two are pretty much divorced from each other money does n't require a resource per se at least not since leaving the gold standard it just requires that someone is able willing to take on debt for example every time you take a loan out from the bank you are effectively creating money this is called bank credit and if you live in a country that uses fractional reserve banking then it makes up a very large part of your money supply think like up to 95 when bank 's create money they only create the principle amount ie the original loan amount and not the interest amount as well this means that someone else needs to take out a loan so that you can repay the amount in interest that you owe on your new loan this does n't normally affect you because there are lots of people taking out lots of loans all the time and money is circulating around in the economy the problem is that eventually the system gets to a stage where people ca n't really take out loans any more they just have too much debt and so you end up with a liquidity crisis like in 2008    so what i was saying is that either i 'm missing something pretty obvious and i 've got this wrong or this is exactly how it works and economists like to just ignore it for the benefits that it offers

the main factors you have to consider are could you get a better return on that money by investing it somewhere   the investment rate should basically be more than the mortgage rate if you find yourself suddenly in need of money eg loss of job do you have enough savings to ride that out   if not investing the extra money in an instant access investment even at a lower rate may make sense as it gives you future flexibility do you have any other debts that are at a higher rate   if so pay those off first as you will get more bang for your buck

never trust a single source to give you a fair price especially if they are not in competition moreso if they know that 's the case   i would want to get a quote from at least one other broker in terms of what they feel they can sell the bonds for   and let them know they are not the only one you are getting a quote from   to start with you need information such as when is the last time a bond like the ones you have traded and what did it sell for also sources for where you can sell the bonds and more info on the entire subject the securities industry and financial markets association has a pretty helpful website called   i find it has a wealth of information and is relatively free of bias on the municipal markets at a glance page you can get history for various bonds if you have the pronounced que sip numbers for the bonds if these bonds are as good as the advisor is telling you they are then they should be selling for a premium and the recent sales history would reflect that   i 'd find one or two other potential sellers and get prices from each of them compare that against recent history and go with whichever one seems to be offering you the best deal in terms of choosing someone and how to go about selling bonds the same website has some excellent information and guidance on buying and selling bonds and how to choose an investment professional which includes how to check up on them to see if they have ever faced action etc   i would also consider any gains you might have to declare if you sell these for more than face value and if that would be taxable etc i would also question your too safe judgement   just because something is safe i would not necessarily throw it out   you need to look at the return relative to the risk and if you are not investing in a tax sheltered account the affect of taxes on your net return   if these are earning a really good return for fairly low risk they might be worth keeping especially if in today 's market you need to take substantially more risk to get a comparable return   taking more risk to get nearly the same return is n't very wise since an aspect of the risk is perhaps not getting any return or losing money    in a volatile market there can be a substantial benefit to having a lower risk foundation that you build upon with more risky investments in order to provide some risk diversity in your portfolio you might want to consider for example how these bonds have done over the last 13 years compared to a similar investment in the type of less safe vehicles you are considering   perhaps you 'd be better off just holding these to maturity instead of gambling on something with a lot more risk that could go south on you

very interesting i would like to expand beyond just precious metals and stocks but i am not ready just to jump in just yet i am a relatively young investor but have been playing around with stocks for 4 years on and off the problem i often find is that the stock market is often too overvalued to play ben graham type pe b so i would like to expand my knowledge of investing so i can invest in any market and still find value after reading jim rogers i was really interested in commodities as an alternative to stocks but i like to play really conservative generally thank you for your insight if you do n't mind i would like to add you as a friend since you seem quite above average in the strategy department

well then that kind of makes drug tests seem stupid then right i grew up in an area where oil money was big   heard handful of stories of people failing drug tests and being fired heard a few other rare stories of people working 20 + years in the oil industry who knew how to pass and smoked weed daily but you seem pretty convinced this has worked well for you so i guess its fair to ask then do you believe this is the best we can do what are your thoughts about medical conditions should opiates be treated the same as weed do you know that there s different types of weed i encourage you to keep learning and you can start to understand why so many people might be defending this topic the war on drugs is over the facts are out and proven its an extreme waste and set back to humanity step back for a second look more at the bigger picture is this really the best we can do

i still do n't understand this you have an option between two cars they are exactly the same except for one is cheaper and has less battery capacity that means the company who built it is making less money on the cheaper one and you have the choice between the two cars you could very easily just buy the more expensive one if you have the money then or you can afford it now until you have the money later always your choice if you do n't like it buy the more expensive bigger battery not the cheaper car that costs the same net price after the upgrade what 's wrong with that

source see if you have access to it convertible notes are often used by angel investors who wish to fund businesses without establishing an explicit valuation of the company in which they are investing     when an investor purchases equity in a startup the purchase price of the equity implies a company valuation   for example if an investor purchases a 10 per cent ownership stake in a company and pay $ 1 m for that stake this implies that the company is worth $ 10 m some early stage investors may wish to avoid placing a value on the company in this way because this in turn will affect the terms under which later stage investors will invest in the company   convertible notes are structured as loans at the time the investment is made   the outstanding balance of the loan is automatically converted to equity when a later equity investor appears under terms that are governed by the terms set by the later stage equity investor   an equity investor is someone who purchases equity in a company suppose an angel investor invests $ 100,000 using a convertible note   later an equity investor invests $ 1 m and receives 10 of the company 's shares   in the simplest possible case the initial angel investor 's convertible note would convert to 1/10th of the equity investor 's claim   depending on the exact structure of the convertible note however the angel investor may also receive extra shares to compensate them for the additional risk associated with being an earlier investor the worst case scenario would be if the issuing company initially performed well meaning that the debt would be converted into shares and subsequently went bankrupt the converted shares would become worthless but the holder of the note would no longer have any recourse will twitter have to sell their offices and liquidate staff to close this debt this depends on the of the debt debt is serviced according to seniority the higher seniority debts will be paid off first and then only the lower seniority debts be serviced this will all be in the agreements when you enter into a transaction when you say liquidate staff you mean sell off their assets and not sell their staff into slavery

the coupon should save you $ 10 either way assuming that you meet the criteria for using the coupon you 're figuring out the discount based on the cost of the food alone   you should be including the tip in your calculations yes they 're tacking on something that is otherwise optional but that 's because enough people forget that the server works just as hard regardless of whether there 's a coupon involved or not   so restaurants build the tip in to keep employee morale up which in turn encourages them to keep a good level of service up i guess it gets down to how much you tip   if you typically do n't tip which would be rather then yes you do lose money with a $ 60 meal   if you tip 18 then you save exactly $ 10 $ $ 10.00 = $   if you normally tip 10 15 a customary range then it 's somewhere in between edit following littleadv 's discussion on this question i am assuming that the 18 goes directly to the and is more or less expected if it does n't in which case one might choose not to tip at all because it would just line the pockets of the restaurant owner then you 're absolutely correct in figuring out the value of the coupon by treating the 18 as a tax

as mentioned before you 're over thinking the hard pull issue but do try to make the preapproval as close to the actual bidding as possible because it costs money at least from my experience you 'll get charged the application fee for preapproval while pre qualification is usually free if you 're seriously shopping i find it hard to believe that you ca n't find a house within 3 months if you 're already in the process and your offer has been accepted and you opened the escrow i believe the preapproval will be extended if it expires before closing i 've just had a similar case from the other side as a buyer and the seller had a short sale approval that expired before closing it was extended to make the deal happen and that 's when the bank is actually loosing money so do n't worry about that if you have n't even started the process and the preapproval expired you might have to start it all over again from scratch including all the fees the credit score is a minor issue unless you do it every 2 3 months

in the case of reward cards different cards may offer different rewards for different kind of purchases for example in the uk one of the amex cards offers 1.25 cashback on all purchases whereas one of the santander cards offers 3 on fuel 2 or 1 on certain other transactions and nothing on others of course you then have to remember to use the right card another reason is that a person may use a card for a while build up a good credit limit and then move to a different card perhaps because it has better rewards or a lower interest rate etc without cancelling the first if it costs nothing to keep the first card then it can be useful to have it as a spare

you are comparing market caps and enterprise value   if the company has four billion dollars cash in the bank then the value would be four billion plus whatever the business itself is worth as a business if the business itself is only worth 400 million then you would have market caps and 400 million enterprise value the enterprise value is basically how much the business would be worth if it had no cash or no debt   these numbers would be a very unusual situation it could happen for example if a big company has sold 90 of its business for cash when you buy a share of the company you get a tiny share of the business and you own a tiny share of the cash this stock will very likely keep its value but wo n't make much money   on the other hand more common would be a company where the business is worth 4bn but the company has also 4bn debt so it is worth exactly zero market caps close to zero but enterprise value $ 4bn because you ignore the debt in the enterprise value   edit sorry got the enterprise value totally wrong read millions instead of billions your numbers would mean that you have a huge huge company with close to debt most likely someone made a mistake here a normal situation would be say a company with a business that is worth $ 500 million but they have $ 100 million debt so market caps = $ 400 million but enterprise value = $ 500 million   ps yahoo has the same nonsense numbers on their uk site and for other companies i just checked marks and spencer 's which apparently has an enterprise value of 800 billion pound with a totally ridiculous p e ratio

the standard low risk gain very short term parking spot these days tends to be a money market account   however you have only mentioned stock for good balance your portfolio should consider the bond market too consider adding a bond index fund to diversify the basic mix taking up much of that 40 this will also help stabilize your risk since bonds tend to move opposite stocks just because everyone else is also using them as the main alternative though there are theoretical arguments why this should be so eventually you may want to add a small amount of reit fund to be mix but that 's back on the higher risk side by the way trying to guess when the next correction will occur is usually not a winning strategy guesses tend to go wrong as often as they go right even for pros rather than attempting to time the market pick a strategic mix of investments and rebalance periodically to maintain those ratios there has been debate here about dollar cost averaging see other answers but that idea may argue for investing and rebalancing in more small chunks rather than a few large ones i generally actively rebalance once a year or so and between those times let the balance suggest which fund(s new money should go into minimal effort and it has worked quite well enough

there is no simple answer to your question   it depends on many things perhaps most notably what college your daughter ends up going to and what kind of aid you hope to receive your daughter will probably fill out the fafsa as part of her financial aid application   here is one discussion of what parental assets count towards the expected family contribution on the fafsa   you can find many similar pages by googling   retirement accounts and primary residence are notable categories that do not count   so if you were looking to reduce your apparent assets for aid purposes dumping money into your mortgage or retirement account is a possibility however you should be cautious when doing this type of gaming because it 's not always clear exactly how it will affect financial aid   for one thing financial aid includes both grants and loans   everyone wants grants but sometimes increasing your eligibility may just make you or your daughter eligible for larger loans which may not be so great also each college has its own system for allocating financial aid   individual schools may ask for more detailed information such as the css profile   so strategies for minimizing your apparent assets that work for one school may not work for others   some elite schools with large endowments have generous aid policies that allow even families with sizable incomes to pay little or nothing e.g. stanford tuition for most families with incomes under $ 125,000 you should probably research the financial aid policies of schools your daughter is interested in   it can be helpful to talk to financial aid advisors at colleges as well as high school counselors not to mention general financial advisors if you really want to start getting technical about what assets to move around   needless to say it all begins with talking with your daughter about her thoughts on where to go

former financial analyst here happy to help you first off you are right to not be entirely trusting of advisors and attorneys they are usually trustworthy but not always and when you are new to this the untrustworthy ones have a habit of reaching you first you 're their target market i 'll give you a little breakdown of how to plan and a starting investment first figure out your future expenses a lot of that money may go to medical bills or associated care do n't forget the costs of modifications and customizations to items so you can have a better quality of life cars can be retrofit to assist you with a you can build a chair lift into a things like that which will be important for mobility all depending on the lingering medical conditions mobility and independence will be critically important for you your past expenses are the best predictor of future expenses so filter out the one time legal and medical costs and use those to predict second for investing there is a simple route to get into the stock market and hopefully you will hear it a lot exchange traded funds etfs you 'll hear the s&p 500 increased by 80 points today on the news the s&p is a combination of 500 different stocks and is used to gauge the market overall you can buy an exchange traded fund as a stock and it 's an investment in all those components there 's an etf for almost anything but the most popular ones are for those big indexes i would suggest putting a few hundred thousand into an s&p 500 indexed etf do it at maybe $ 10,000 per month so you spread the money out and ensure you do n't buy at a market peak and then let it sit there for many years you can buy stocks through online brokerages like scottrade or etrade and they make it fairly easy they even have local offices that you can visit for help stocks are the easiest way to invest once you 've done this you can also open a ira a type of retirement account with special tax benefits and contribute several thousand dollars to it per year i 'll be happy to give more advice if when you need it but there are a number of good books for beginning investors that can explain it better than i. i would suggest that you avoid real estate especially if you expect to move overseas as it is significantly more complicated and has maintenance costs and taxes

there is no evidence that qe had a negative effect on hedge fund alpha if you claim that hedge funds are not able to deliver positive risk adjusted return in up markets this is wrong assumption it 's been proven that with the leverage they get hedge funds can perform better in bullish markets   we recently investigated the performance of 180 funds in the past two decades we found no evidence that they could outperform their relative benchmarks not even that but we also assumed zero costs for investor where in reality costs can range from 2 to 5 funds not only fail in term of positive risk adjusted return but they also struggle to cover their costs   tl dr the lover the cost the higher the return evidence says go passive

you 're talking about porting your mortgage which may be possible if your mortgage was portable to start with or if your bank subsequently allows it note that although porting a mortgage involves keeping most of the original terms and conditions the process is still much like applying for a new mortgage including any lending requirements here 's an article on the subject edit in response to op 's comment below what will happen to the first property if i do n't sell it because porting a mortgage is treated as if you were closing one mortgage and opening a new one this means that you would need to pay off the first mortgage typically this would be done by selling the first property at the same time that you buy the second one however if you 're not doing this you 'll need to raise funds another way which could include opening a new mortgage on the first property of course if you 're doing that then there would have to be a good reason for porting the original mortgage otherwise you might as well leave it where it is and open a new mortgage on the second property instead does the article apply the to usa too that article and indeed this answer are based on the situation in the uk however they appear to exist in the us too though are rarer than in the uk

if you intend to gamble you should bring cash with you and turn your chips into cash at the end of the night   if the casino closes and you have n't cashed in your chips before you 'll be out of luck   also if you use your ship card to get money for gambling they will charge you a hefty fee if you use the electronic poker table or a machine that does n't take actual money you 'll have to use your ship card   make sure when you leave the at the end of the night that you cash in your electronic winnings   this is really confusing but the machines will debit your ship card into a casino account and if you just walk away thinking it will net out your other purchases drinks food etc you will lose all of that money   summary if you gamble use real money and convert your winnings back into real money

even if we accept these claims as being true neither the fact that their clients are more confident nor the fact that people who use an investment professional have a higher net worth tells you anything about the value of the service that such professionals provide   judging a service provider is a complex matter where you take into account multiple variables but the main ones are the cost and quality of the service the cost and quality of doing it yourself and the value you assign to your time and effort i think it 's highly likely that professional gardeners will on average maintain larger gardens than those who do their own garden work and any professional will have more experience at his profession than an average member of the public but to determine if hiring a professional is objectively better requires defining what that word means finance is a bit weird in that respect since we actually do have objective ways of measuring results by looking at performance over time but since the quotes you give here do n't address that at all we can simply conclude that they do not make the case for anything related to financial performance

the two most common scenarios are since you have more control of timing when you are the buyer compared to when you are the seller 1 is probably more common however a good real estate attorney should be able to walk you through your options should 2 come up fortunately many real estate attorneys do not charge you anything until the sale completes and you will likely get a discount if you involve them in both the sale and purchase so i would start by finding an attorney

having worked as a vendor at different walmart i will say the whole foods deal is horrible business on top of that why is everyone acting like amazon makes money on retail they are yet to make money on it and the only thing that made amazon profitable was aws and only a few years ago   walmart actually makes money and if they have a better chance to survive and beat amazon than people give them credit for amazon on the other hand never been in the physical store gig it 's a whole different ball game out there they ca n't even compete on price from a proven track record business perspective i say amazon is building their business strategy on hope and a string if they think they can turn whole foods around from the business model disaster they operate on   and walmart has slowly began realizing that to survive they need to become kroger in their grocery business and they been pushing that a lot out there it 's working for them   there 's also the issue of market walmart does n't operate in the same market segment as target or whole foods and they have failed to push their business into places they would be successful walmart main competitor is n't target or amazon it 's grocery stores and dollar general

you did n't have a situation of excess contribution if you have proof that someone in fidelity actually told you what you said you might try to recover some of your losses through a lawsuit however their first and main defense would be that they 're not in the business of providing tax advice and it is your problem that you asked random person a tax question and then acted on an incorrect answer by the way that only goes to say that anything you might read here you should as well take with a grain of salt the only one who can give you a tax advice is a licensed tax professional i explained it in details in my blog post but in short it is either an ea enrolled agent with the irs credentials or a cpa certified public accountant or attorney licensed in your state back to your question excess contribution to a ira is when you contribute in excess to the limits imposed for traditional ira in 2012 the limit was $ 5000 you contributed $ 4000 this means that you were not in excess there 's nothing they can correct the 1099-r you got seems to be correct and in order what you did have was a case of non deductible contribution non deductible contribution to your ira should have been reported to the irs on form 8606 non deductible contribution creates basis in your ira withdrawals from your ira are prorated to the relation of your basis to your total value and the taxable amount is determined based on that rate it is also calculated using form 8606 so in short you should have filed a form 8606 with your 2012 tax return declaring non deductible ira and creating $ 4000 basis and then form 8606 with your 2013 tax return calculating which portion of the $ 4000 you withdrew is non taxable if your total ira in all accounts was that $ 4000 then nothing would be taxable talk to a tax adviser you might need to amend your 2012 return or send the 2012 form separately if possible and then do some math on your 2013 return if 60 days have n't passed you might want to consider depositing the $ 4000 in a roth ira and perform what is called conversion

generally speaking the lower credit score trumps   in the case you cite the lower credit score will prevail   however you may need to do exactly that in order to qualify for the loan income wise    there are two factors when obtaining a mortgage really all loans but more so with a mortgage   the to repay credit score   and your ability to service the debt   this last one is a combination of income and debt to income ratio if you do n't have enough income to qualify for the loan or fail to meet the debt to income ration you may have to use your gf 's income to qualify despite her poor credit you might want to see past posts about buying property with non spouses   it could work but generally it requires a lot of legal work before closing on the deal   avoiding this will lead to tales of woe

you 'd be mistaken to this there is any morality involved in most corporations neither positive nor negative running a business is amoral some business missions have a moral intent such as pharmaceuticals health organization etc but all have an amoral   it 's fairly simplistic the purpose of a business is to produce a profit at some point all successful well functioning businesses will work down their list of ways to produce a profit after they 've established market share a lasting brand customer loyalty finances well in the black and eventually look towards capital preservation in most bodies with a large monetary wealth capital preservation becomes a key focus in other words once you master the art of making money you then need to master the art of keeping it   thus the ability to then focus on these things to continue to just pay taxes is like running an efficient but leaky ship the more you preserve the longer you 'll be around and the more power you 'll yield to stick around    this last point is also important to keep in mind unlike you or i a company will basically last forever well at least until society collapses you or i are only here until we die and whatever wealth we have we may try to preserve for our kids or next of kin a corporation is always here the people in the corporation amp it 's owners change hands but the corporation survives frankly any business that is n't aiming to make a profit is either going to fail quickly or is by definition a non profit   here is where i would believe the government plays a balancing role to reign in the power of corporations lest they rival their own but any good corporation will handle that problem as well regulatory capture anyone   also consider that for the most wealthy among us it 's probably not about the money anymore it 's now probably about the game this is certainly where the get that manic edge on the rest of us

no in fact you did n't really say anything your initial comment just on the fact he used the total bond market number instead of the muni bond market number from 2007 2008   and were dead on anything else about the article which would lead one to believe that that was all you saw fit to comment on       which is the equivalent to reading a story of a bank robbery and getting hung up on the article reporting the total dollar amount in the bank instead of the total dollar amount in the cash that were robbed from and not talking about anything else        also your initial complaint about what numbers he uses for the bond market is n't a lie   you personally feel that he should only mention the 2007 2008 bond market but if you actually read how he used it he was n't saying anything other than that is the size of the bond market in the context it 's used in the story there 's nothing wrong with the number   he did n't say they were scamming everything in the market it was a one off sentence about the size of the total bond market that in fact is vulnerable to the exact same type of illegal activity he talked about

the answer to almost all questions of this type is to draw a diagram   this will show you in graphical fashion the timing of all payments out and payments received   then if all these payments are brought to the same date and set equal to each other using the desired rate of return the equation to be solved is generated in this case taking the start of the bond 's life as the point of reference the various amounts are pay out = x received = a series of 15 annual payments of $ 70 the first coming in 1 year   this can be brought to the reference date using the formula for the present value of an ordinary annuity plus received = a single payment of $ 1000 made 15 years in the future   this can be brought to the reference date using the simple interest formula set the pay out equal to the present value of the payments received and solve for x i am unaware of the difference if any between current rate and rate to maturity finding the rate for such a series of payments would start out the same as above but solving the resulting equation for the interest rate would be a daunting task

loans are not taxable events the equity you took out is not income it 's a loan and you pay it back with interest you pay taxes on the capital gain of the home when you sell it the tax does not take into account any mortgages helocs or other loans secured by the house instead the tax is calculated based on the price you sold it for minus the price you bought it for which is known as the capital gain you can exclude $ 250k of that gain for a single person $ 500k for a married couple there are a few other as well that would be true regardless of the loan balance at the time

gt;when one says that corporations are people in a legal sense they are saying that they have the ability to enter into binding legal agreements in a manner similar to people    i would never use the words corporations are people to describe this corporations are legal structures given a legal status by government to facilitate the cooperation of labor production and capital by having this legal status provided by government they can establish contracts and enforce them in return the corporation is subject to regulations and laws established by government    the simple fact of the matter is that if government did n't have the authority to provide certain legal statuses to corporations corporations would n't exist as such the relationship between corporations and government is rather than which the current republican party seems to think all we hear is how bad government is for business when businesses would not even exist without it we the people control the government if we wanted to we could nationalize every corporation in this country and end capitalism as we know it we basically did this in 2008 with the banks when capitalism was on it 's death bed corporations can live or die by the hand of government     that does n't sound like a process in which one concludes corporations are people my friends    gt;if they are using it in any sense other than the legal sense it 's either hyperbole ignorance or pandering   romney never clarified what he meant by that statement and given the state of his campaign one has to wonder    gt;now if you set yourself up as inc   i have started my own business i can confirm that my personal expenses to keep me alive such as food car maintenance rent etc were not tax deductible but yet my day to day business expenses to keep it alive such as paper wages equipment etc were    edit basically i 'm just trying to say that the tax code treats corporations and people totally different as such corporations are people my friends is demonstrably false

to answer your question yes it 's often worth it to have investments that produce income do a google search for income vs growth investing and you 'll get a sense for two different approaches to investing in equities in a nutshell growth stocks think netflix etc do n't pay dividends but are poised to appreciate in price more than income stocks think banks utilities etc that tend to have less volatile prices but pay a consistent dividend in the long run decades growth stocks tend to outperform income stocks that 's why younger investors tend to pick growth stocks while those closer to retirement tend to stick with more stable income producing portfolio but there 's nothing wrong with a mixed approach either i agree with pete 's answer too

currently when implied volatility is spoken the black scholes merton model is implied   this model has been shown to be deficient thus the variance gamma model should be used however as nearly no one uses it can be assumed that bs is still being implied the bs formula has multiple variables   some are external to the underlying in question   the rest are internal when all but one variable is known or assumed the last variable can be calculated so if one has the price of the underlying and all else except the volatility the volatility can be calculated thus implied if one selects an implied volatility and all variables except the underlying price is known the underlying price can be calculated for the present one uses the current price of the underlying to calculate the implied volatility   for future option prices one assumes an implied volatility at a later date to calculate a possible price for prices not at the money the bs model is extremely   the model can better determine a potential future price

you 're right about your suspicions i 'm not a professional i suggest you talk to a real one a one with cpa ea or attorney credentials and license in your state but i would be very cautious in this case the irs will look at all the facts and circumstances to make a claim but my guess would be that the initial claim would be for this to be taxable income for your husband he 'd have to prove it to be otherwise it does seem to be related to his performance and i doubt that had they not known him through his employment they 'd give him such a gift i may be wrong so may be an irs revenue officer but i 'd bet he 'd think the same did they give gifts like that to anyone else if they did was it to other employees or they gave similar gifts to all their friends and family did those who gave your husband a gift file a gift tax return had they paid the gift tax were they principles in the partnership or they were limited partners i.e. not the ones with authority to make any decision was your husband instrumental in making their extraordinary profit or his job was not related to the profits these people made these questions are about the facts and circumstances of the transaction based on what he can find out and other potential information your husband will have to decide whether he can reasonably claim that it was a gift beware unreasonable claims lead to equally unreasonable penalties and charges irs and your state will definitely want to know more about this transaction its not an amount to slide under the radar this is not a matter where you can rely on a free opinions written by amateurs who do n't know the whole story you or rather your husband are highly encouraged to hire a paid professional a cpa ea enrolled agent or tax attorney with enough experience in fighting gift vs income characterization issues against the irs and the state do n't forget your state an experienced professional may be able to identify something in the facts and the circumstances of the situation that would lead to reducing the tax bill or shifting it to the partners but it is not something you do on your own

are there any other losses that can be expected beyond the above the lender may have to invest some money into the house in order to get it in shape to sell also while the lender possesses the house they are liable to the property taxes and possibly utilities are there any statutes or pressures to motivate the financial institution to get fair price when the property is sold the lender is motivated to at least break even when selling the property in order to limit losses on their investment this means they are very motivated to seek a higher price but they 're also motivated to sell the property quickly in order to limit their losses due to property taxes usually the lender takes a loss of the investment if foreclosure occurs only 10 percent to 20 percent   of auctioned foreclosed houses did yield a surplus when the lender sells the foreclosed property using a realtor they 're motivated to sell it as quickly as possible so long as they break even in this case there is little motivation to sell the property for a surplus if the property is being sold via auction then time is not a factor and the lender will just sell to the highest bidder

you can always take deduction for foreign tax paid on schedule a or calculate foreign tax credit using form 1116 credit is usually more beneficial but in some cases you will be better of with a deduction however in very specific cases you can claim the credit directly on your 1040 without using the form 1116 look at the 1040 instructions for line 47 exception    you do not have to complete form 1116 to take this credit    if all of the following apply all of your foreign source gross income was from interest and dividends and all of that income and the foreign tax paid on it were    reported to you on form 1099-int form 1099-div or schedule k-1 or    substitute statement the total of your foreign taxes was not more than $ 300 not more than $ 600 if married filing jointly you held the stock or bonds on which the dividends or interest were paid for at least 16 days and were not obligated to pay these    amounts to someone else you are not filing form or excluding income from sources within puerto rico all of your foreign taxes were legally owed and not eligible for a refund or reduced tax rate under a tax treaty and paid to countries that are recognized by the united states and do not support terrorism for more details on these requirements see the instructions for    form 1116

every reward program has to have a funding source if the card gives you x percent back on all purchases that means that their business is structured to entice you to pump more transactions through the system either their other costs are lower or the increased business allows them to make more money off of late fees and interest if the card has you earn extra points for buying a type of item or from a type of store home stores improvement in the spring they are trying to make sure you use their card for what can be a significant amount of business during a small window of time sometimes they cap it by saying 5 cash back at home improvement stores during the spring but only on the first $ 1500 of purchases that limits it to $ 75 maximum adding more business for them makes more money for them groceries and gas are a good year round purchase categories yes there is some variation depending on the season and the weather but overall there is not an annual cliff once the season ends gas and groceries account for thousands of dollars a year these are not insignificant categories for many families are recession proof if they perceive a value from this type of offer they will change their buying behavior   my local grocery store has a deal with a specific gas station this means that they made a monetary deal because you earn points at the grocery store and spend points at the gas station the grocery store is paying some compensation to the gas station every time you use points the gas station must be seeing an increase in business so theoretically they do n't get 100 compensation from the grocery store   in cases where credit cards give airline miles the credit card company buys the miles from the airline at a discount because they know that a significant number of miles will never be used

if you do n't have a good knowledge of finance maybe you should not put too much money in individual stocks but if you really want to invest you can just compare the rate of return of the most known stocks available to you like the one from the s&p for the us the rate of return is very simple to compute it 's share price for example a company with a current share price of usd that delivered a dividend of usd last year would have a rate of return of 100 now if you only invest in the most known stocks since they are already covered by nearly all financial institutions and analysts if you are looking for lower risk dividend companies take a sample of companies and invest those with the lowest rates of return but avoid extreme values of course since the stock prices are changing all the time you have to compare them with a price taken at the same time like the closing price of a specific day and for the dividend they can be on several basis yearly etc so you have to be sure to take the same basis you can also find the p e ratio which is the opposite indicator (= share price dividend so an higher p e ratio means a lower risk most of the time you can find the p e ratio or the rate of return already computed on specialized website or brokers

being underwater a little is not all that scary but those who talk of being underwater are typically underwater by quite a lot   the amount of money they owe is large compared to their yearly income consider a metaphor   i put you in a hole   its only 1 foot deep   you 're not too concerned   if you want to leave you can step out of it   now we look at a deeper hole 3 feet   now you 're still not too concerned   you ca n't just walk out but if you need to get out you can wiggle your way up   6 feet   now you start getting nervous   climbing out is getting trickier and trickier   you may not be able to move in response to a changing around you because you 're stuck in a hole now make the hole 10 feet   now you ca n't reach the edges   now you 're in trouble   you have lost all mobility   you ca n't get out under your own power   now if something bad happens such as losing your job or a sudden health issue you ca n't move around to solve the problem this is the issue that arise from underwater mortgages   say you lose your job because the job market in your area dried up think detroit in the big auto manufacturer crash   you need to move   you are legally to a lender for your existing underwater house by more than you can sell it for   you need to pay for the privilege to sell it   you still owe payments on it so if you just buy a new house or rent in the new state you 're paying for twice as much property   you ca n't just shuffle the from your old house to your new house because the new lender has no interest in giving a loan for more than the value of the new home the only options you have to play with is renting the old house which many underwater families did or bankrupcy   if the area you were in is depressed you may not be able to rent the house for enough to cover your mortgage   this is the fear of being underwater   you have a piece of paper which claims some lender can take money from you that you may or may not have and that the us government will allow them to take your assets if need be to settle the score if you 're underwater by a few thousand it 's typically not a big deal   if you 're underwater by 80 or 90 thousand dollars which some people were that 's a lot of money to be for without the assets to recover them if you subscribe to the realtor story that the market will recover all you have to do is scrape by holding on until the market rises again   however those who are underwater recognize that the reason much of this occurred is that we entered a bubble because realtors kept saying the market could only go up   fool me once

from a mathematical expected value standpoint there is no difference between gambling e.g. buying a lottery ticket and investing e.g. buying a share of stock   the former probably has negative expected value while the latter probably has positive expected value but that is not a distinction to include in a definition else every company that gives a bad quarterly earnings report suddenly changes categories however investment professionals have a vested interest in claiming there is a difference that justifies them charging fees to steer you into the right investment   consequently hair splitting ideas like the motive behind a purchase are introduced   the classification of an item to be purchased should not depend on the mental state of its purchaser depending on the situation it may be right to engage in negative ev behavior   for example if you have $ 1000 and need $ 2000 by next week or else you ca n't have an operation and you will die and you ca n't find anyone to give you a loan   your optimal strategy is to gamble your $ 1000 at the best odds you can get with a possible outcome of $ 2000   so even if you only have a 1/3 chance of winning and getting that operation it 's still the right bet if you ca n't find a better one

if you ended at your second paragraph no it 's simply a refund of your own money same as any time i get any cash back whether due to a credit card reward program or price match   but your 4th paragraph changes this yes you owe tax as it 's clearly not your own money coming back even barter income is taxable   per the new comments appearing this is not a case of bartering i cited bartering as an understandable example of when there 's no cash and yet tax is owed in this situation value is received and it counts as income similar to the barter situations   just because the value is n't in cash does n't negate the tax due i 'd ask how op pays his rent mortgage utilities cell phone bill etc the answer is simple non traditional income as op puts it has a tax due

you are correct it 's using accounting to accomplish different goals first relevant costs should be considered when making the decision to buy internally rather than externally second by adding the possibility for a cost centre to turn a profit even if it is only an accounting trick means that interest are better aligned profit motive and all third you are right that on the consolidated group level there is no real profit it can give a better picture of actual economic performance though

e.g. a european company has to pay 1 million usd exactly one year from now while that is theoretically possible that is not a very common case mostly likely if they had to make a 1 million usd payment a year from now and they had the cash on hand they would be able to just make the payment today   a more common scenario for currency forwards is for investment hedging   say that european company wants to buy into a mutual fund of some sort say fusex that is a usd based mutual fund you ca n't buy into it directly with euros so if the company wants to buy into the fund they would need to convert their euros to to usd but now they have an extra risk parameter they are not just exposed to the fluctuations of the fund they are also exposed to the fluctuations of the currency market perhaps that fund will make a killing but the exchange rate will tank and they will lose all their gains by creating a forward to hedge their currency exposure risk they do not face this risk flip side if the exchange rate rises in a favorable rate they also do n't get that benefit unless they use an fx option but that is generally more expensive and complicated

of course but then paper also has utility so do seashells and    there is no obvious reason why even in a perfect world we would go looking for a malleable highly conductive corrosion resistant metal as something to peg the value of our banknotes to    the argument in favor of a gold standard is not whether gold is intrinsically more valuable than paper or seal skins or anything else it 's that gold is fairly inelastic in terms of supply so it limits the ability of central bankers to mess up the value of the currency through funny business    if you picked up a rock and started going around telling people that we should use it as money because it 's highly malleable and conductive and can be used in computer parts they would look at you like you 're a crazy person that 's not why gold is was should be a currency    gold was the perfect currency for thousands of years because it was easy to identify easy to handle hard to and rare those were important characteristics when strangers had to carry physical money to different places without any atms credit cards or paypal accounts they are somewhat less critical today but still   the one characteristic that might still argue in favor of a gold standard is rarity since the amount of gold in the world is somewhat fixed forcing the currency supply to be restricted to the gold supply semi prevents governments and central bankers from getting into too much or at least that 's the theory    i will leave it to others to argue over whether a return to the gold standard would be a good idea but the argument has nothing to with the intrinsic utility of gold i 'm sure we can all agree that gold is a fine metal with many good qualities

i was in a very similar place 10 years ago i was in my mid 20 's with 45 k in combined school + personal business related debt and working in it for not very much i already had 10 15 k in debt when my college loans first came due and it was the first time i really had to come to terms with the hole i had dug myself and i spent weeks at a time obsessing over plans that would help me get out of debt it effected my health and my relationships i felt like i was never going to come out from under it my family was very much lower middle class k household income and i was n't going to get or expect any help there so i went to work and made it a point to make sure every personal and professional decision i made was conducive to my long term goals and before i knew it they became short term goals    find out what your basic monthly need is be brutally honest cut back on things like cable tv i still do n't have it reduce your phone plans borrow things when you do n't have to buy them and send that money to your debt pick up some hobbies that do n't cost much these are all minor sacrifices i got back in to playing the piano and spent a lot of time at the beach in the summer and up on books i 'd always meant to read in the winter    i ran a lot of numbers in a spreadsheet but you can play with the numbers with online loan calculators to put some real numbers behind your goals here is one that i just tried out   you 'll probably be surprised how much effect a little bit of extra towards a loan can make in the long term   put your current college loan details in to it and then see what the effect of an extra 150 a month is i know you 've implied that you really do n't have anything extra each month and that is fine figure out an amount that gets you moving towards your goals and then start working on a way to make it figuring out how to make or squeeze an extra n dollars out of your budget every 30 days is much less daunting than thinking about paying off 50k. you said you are working in it i do n't know where you live but in my city there are lots of decent it related jobs your first goal might need to be to find a better one     if possible move around balances until you 've got interest rates you can deal with and now that you have solid numbers to plan with consider the effect of making smaller goals would you feel as bad if you had half as much debt how about if you got rid of 10 k of debt or just your credit cards   i know i felt a huge relief when i cut my overall debt in half it felt like a huge part of my burden had lifted and it had i could start seeing the end of the tunnel     i think that one of the biggest changes in my life since then has been the way i look at and think about money and debt   i did n't really have to sacrifice much i learned to travel cheaply and whenever i met    a goal i 'd reward myself with a small trip today i have a very low mortgage payment and i pay my full credit balances each month so i have no revolving bad debt    i wish you luck and i know exactly where you are standing right now

you ca n't get a heloc to the best of my knowledge without actually owning the house if you get an 80 mortgage of the purchase price not the appraised value btw you still need 20 as a down payment once you own the home you can apply for a heloc presuming you have enough equity eg the purchase price is $ 40k less than the appraised value we have n't looked at the norm at least where i live of 5 down for a traditional mortgage and 3.5 for an fha which your question touches on if you can do 5 down on a $ 1,000,000 mortgage you need $ 50,000 on the day of closing if the home is worth ie appraises for $ you 're getting 20 of the house for free presuming the bank(s will go for it you could likely then open a heloc for as much as $ 250,000 again depending on individual lender rules tl;dr if you do n't have the money ready on the day of signing via if it is a loan gift or because you have been saving you can not afford the house to clarify from comments with the op i am in no way speaking to the buyer 's ability to afford the monthly payments this is only about affording the initial costs associated with the home buying process down payment closing whatever else the bank(s require etc

chip and signature cards do not substantially alter the paradigm you mention in your question the chip alters how the machine obtains your account number and it for authentication but it does not significantly alter the interaction with the clerk   it is solely intended to reduce skimming and similar card number stealing and card forging attacks specifically a clerk is still welcome to ask to see the card to verify the signature if they wish and/or to ask to see an id to use the card   some changes occurred around the same time as introducing chip and signature that meant that clerks will be less likely to ask for signatures for certain purchases raising the dollar amount for no signature required purchases mostly but those changes are distinct from the introduction of emv chip authentication

first and foremost it 's about changing habits   it seems like you 've learned a painful lesson with the car financing   that 's a good start   i 'd work on developing the habit of making a budget every month before you spend a penny as for this money i would pay off the apple loan and put the rest in savings   then pay off the entire credit card balance the month before the rate increases the point of putting the money in savings is not about making the small amount of interest   you need to get in the habit of having money in an emergency fund and paying for unexpected emergencies out of that not just throwing it on a credit card   ideally budget over the next few months to pay off the credit card out of your income not out of savings

you do n't need a book you need to dig into the business and understand what has changed how long has there been a struggle to make ends meet what seasonality exists for the business look at the period over period change for each product category as well as each line item expense and find correlations that may exist if it 's possible find similar insights about competition both brick and mortar as well as online    it 's important to analyze the results of the business to understand 1 the normal and flows of the jewelry store seasonality and 2 any erosion of the business to online or brick and mortar competitors the other important takeaway is that you have to identify any changes in the business expenses are utilities suddenly taking up more of a share of the profits or are the costs of raw materials on the rise   look at the cash flow to see where the money is going or if there is a revenue problem if business is down and revenue as a result you know where to start perhaps the answer is marketing or providing additional products or services that better match the needs of the clientele who are dropping off i.e. online ordering and free shipping or product pricing is elevated above the competition on the other side if expenses have gotten out of control you know where to apply controls keep in mind that these are not mutually exclusive and the business could have a revenue and an expense problem   if you 've studied economics you have the skills to understand the numbers and drive out the answers but this problem requires application and not philosophy sociology or economics no single book can give you the step by step process every business is unique and no one but your family can provide the insights necessary to analyze the results    best of luck reach out with any additional questions

when calculating the npv is there anything i need to do in between the project start date outlay nov 2017 and the first cash inflow july 2019 do i need to discount the cashflow to the present and if so how yes you need to discount every cash flow to the present time not just the first one    when discounting cash flows the appropriate discount rate needs to represent the opportunity cost of the initial cash outlay   meaning if you were to use that money for something else what rate of return would you expect you could be safe and assume only a risk free return like 2 3 or use the average rate of return of other investments e.g. 10 15 another common approach is to use your cost of capital if you 're raising funds for the project or would instead have use the funds to pay off existing debt once you find a relevant discount rate then just discount each cash flow by dividing them by where r is the annualized discount rate e.g. 0.10 for 10 and t is the decimal number of years between now and the cash flow e.g. 1.5 for 18 months

the big problem with lending money to friends and family is that if things go sour with the deal than you can lose something a lot more valuable than the money associated with the deal as a result of that i no longer lend money to friends and family if i have the extra money available and i know someone is really in need i 'll give them the money no strings attached before i 'll lend any if they decide to give back the amount given at some point in the future so be it but there will be no expectations thanksgiving dinner just has a different taste to it when someone at the table owes someone else money

the heart of the problem is that nothing visible substantial is happening before the next election cycle so nobody will address the issue deeply ingrained for difficult problems prevents most long time horizon issues from getting a lot of political attention it 's much easier to ignore the issue and pretend that it will go away or be resolved by others    secondly politicians are less likely to speak about any subject that has n't been funded and pumped up by lobbyists the only people speaking about this problem have no lobbyists money therefore they have no political representation

in simple terms it is a business operation when it becomes a    profit making enterprise it is a grey area but there is a difference between selling    occasional personal items on ebay and selling for profit i would imagine the sort of considerations hm revenue customs would    take into account are the size of your turnover the extent to which    you are both buying and selling and whether you are clearly    specialising in one particular commodity as opposed of disposing of    unwanted presents or clearing the loft i do n't believe that you selling your personal camera gear will be taxable but as the link says it is a grey area   they also recommend to do this it 's far better than having to deal with an investigation a few years    down the line when it comes to completing your tax return there is a section which    is headed other income and it is here where you will enter the net    earnings from the web business net here means your additional income less all expenses associated    with it if you are still worried i would always encourage people to take a cautious approach and discuss their position with hmrc via its helpline on

some of the items required as part of the home buying and mortgage process are traditionally paid prior to closing these are usually the items that the buyer purchases as part of the process home inspection credit check these expenses take place early in the process and if the deal falls through due to the inspection or credit history problems the seller does n't want to get stuck paying for the buyer will frequently have to write a check for these as they occur other items occur later in the process or even at the very end of the process determining which side pays for each item is a combination negotiation and local tradition even for the items that the buyer has to pay for there can be a negotiation between the   buyer and the lender sometimes the lender allows the buyer to roll the closing costs into the loan this does mean that they will be paying interest on the closing costs for years but not rolling in the closing costs mean that you need more cash on hand this is in addition to the down payment and the costs of moving    the closing costs covered by the seller reduce the size of the check they will receive at the end of the process their willingness to kick in this cash is a function of will they still make money on the deal how many other bidders there were and do they need the cash to buy their next house at settlement the forms identify each item involved and who agreed to pay for it then each side is credited for the items they paid for already then each side either writes a check for the balance due or receives a check for their reimbursement keep in mind there are also money exchanges that take place at the closing that are not covered by the buyer real estate commissions there are also items such as interest for the current month and property tax credit that depend on the day of the month and month of the year   sit down with your agent or your lender to get an idea of what you need to pay before closing   though telling everybody that you will have zero cash to pay for these things may make the lender very nervous about approving a loan

the first rule i follow is pretty simple get paid for what you do earn a return on what you own if you are running your company prudently you should earn a salary for the position and responsibilities you hold within the business this salary should be competitive you should be able to replace yourself in the business at this salary if your title is president or ceo look for market rate salaries for others in that position within your industry and company size if you wear multiple hats in a small business you will likely have to blend this salary based on those various positions   based on how you run your business the money left over at the end of the year after you and your team takes a competitive wage is your profit if there is n't any profit then you might want to do some work on your business model but if their is a profit then it 's a clear return on what you own and not just a payment for work completed the idea would be that you could exit the business as an operator pay someone else to do exactly what you do and you would continue to get that profit return at the end of the year this is when a business acts like a true asset   whether you take your money in salary or profit distributions or dividends depending on your structure taxes are about the same salaries get normal employee contributed taxes but then of course the company matches these it is identical if you take a guaranteed payment or distribution that gets hit with self employment taxes profits are also going to get hit with the same taxes   follow ups 1 a fair salary would be a competitive market wage for the position you hold within the business what is left over would be considered true profits and not just fabricated profits by taking a lower than market wage to boost the appearance of profitability 2 shareholders requesting salary information would be covered in your operating agreement or shareholder agreement this might be terms you set with your investors or you might simply set a term that you only need approval if a single salary exceeds a cap like $ 250,000 which would mean you would need to present why you deserve a higher salary and have your board approve if you are governed by said board via your investors profitability is a different ballpark your investors most likely have a right to see a monthly quarterly and/or annual profit loss statement which should clearly state profitability i ca n't imagine running a completely closed book company to my investors actually i ca n't really imagine ever investing in a company where i am not permitted to see the financials   something to also consider here is the threat of trying to keep your profit numbers low in order to not pay taxes or to pay yourself a higher salary if you ever plan to sell or exit the company most widely accepted valuations of a business are done from profits or you might think you are saving yourself a couple points on taxes by avoiding profits in the short term but if you exit the business and get a 3 5x or even up to in some cases multiplier on your annual profits you might be kicking yourself for trying to hide them through your accounting practices buyers will often sniff out an owner who created false profits by not paying themselves but what 's harder to do is figure out how much profits should have been when there were none on the books by saving yourself $ 100,000 in taxes this year could add up to close to $ 1,000,000 in an acquisition   good luck

you do n't need to have a bunch of credit cards lying around just a couple is fine get a rewards card without annual fee that pays you back for use and use it regularly to buy groceries for example pay it off promptly each month using the rewards if you like to reduce the amount you have to send in or you can use the rewards for other purchases some merchants offer $ 25 worth of merchandise for $ 20 in rewards it used to be the case that you could negotiate a discount for paying cash rather than use a credit card but that is a lot harder to do now in many cases because credit card company contracts with merchants prohibit this practice also merchants often prefer credit cards rather than cash because money handling is an issue pay for an armored car to come pick up the day 's receipts or risk getting mugged on the way to the bank possible if you leave the money overnight in the store daily balancing of cash register etc so not being in debt and being rich enough to not need to be in debt are goals and you have my best wishes that you will reach them soon but getting rid of all your credit cards as a part of not being in debt may be more trouble than it is worth keep a couple pay them off promptly and if you are concerned about being in debt you can time your charges so that you are in debt at   most 2 or 3 days each month

because it takes 3 business days for the actual transfer of stock to occur after you buy or sell to the next owner your cash is tied up until that happens this is called the settlement period therefore brokers offer margin which is a form of credit or loan to allow you to keep trading while the settlement period occurs and in other situations unrelated to the presented question to do this you need a margin account you currently have a cash account the caveat of having a retail margin account distinct from a professional margin account is that there is a limited amount of same day trades you can make if you have less than $ 25,000 in the account this is called the pattern day trader rule you do n't need $ 25k to day trade you will just wish you had it as it is easy to get your account frozen or downgraded to a cash account the way around that is to have multiple margin accounts at different brokerages this will greatly increase the number of same day trades you can make many brokers that offer a solution to to people that do n't have 25k to invest are offering professional trading accounts which have additional fees for data which is free for retail trading accounts this problem has nothing to do with   so be careful of the advice you get on the internet it is mostly white noise feel free to verify

from the entity wishing to do a transfer approaches a bank and gives the bank the order to transfer a certain amount of money iban and bic codes are given as well so the bank knows where the money needs to be sent   the sending bank a message via a secure system such as swift or fedwire to the receiving bank requesting that it effect payment according to the instructions given   the message also includes settlement instructions the actual transfer is not instantaneous funds may take several hours or even days to move from the sender 's account to the receiver 's account   either the banks involved must hold a reciprocal account with each other or the payment must be sent to a bank with such an account a correspondent bank for further benefit to the ultimate recipient   banks collect payment for the service from the sender as well as from the recipient the sending bank typically collects a fee separate from the funds being transferred while the receiving bank and intermediate banks through which the transfer travels deduct fees from the money being transferred so that the recipient receives less than what the sender sent the last point may not be relevant in domestic transfers

the court by itself is not expensive it is the implied need for an attorney which are very expensive your average court case costs $ 130 to file however your average attorneys charge anywhere from $ 750 to $ 200 an hour granted the need for an attorney stems from the complexity of written law i would agree with you that this is not ideal about current society but the alternative an society without written law is much less ideal to even find something like that we would almost have to refer back to my previous example somalia

no because of the balance transfer fees which could be 4 unless of course you get a deal for 12 months of no payment and you pay it back in 12 months in which case a 4 annual interest rate is much less than a loan at that point you are gambling that you will be responsible with the payments and the card company is taking the opposite bet

without the specifics of the contract as well as the specifics of the country state city you 're moving to it 's hard to say what 's legal   but this also is n't so i 'll answer this from the point of view of personal finance and what you can should do as next steps whenever paying an application fee or a deposit you need to ensure that you have in writing exactly what you 're applying for or putting a deposit in for   whether this is an apartment a car or a loan before any money changes hands you need to get in writing exactly what you 're putting that money to so for a car you 'd want to have the complete specifications make model year color extra packages and any relevant loan information if applicable   you would n't just hand a dealer $ 2000 for a toyota camry you 'd make sure it was specified which one in writing as well as the total you 're expecting to pay   same for an apartment you should have in writing email is fine the specific unit you are putting a deposit for and the specific rate you 'll be paying and the length of time the lease is for this is to avoid a common tactic bait and switch which is what it looks like you 've run into   a company puts forth a nice model everything looks good you get far enough in that it seems like you 're locked in and then it turns out you 're really getting a less nice model that 's not as ideal as whatever you signed up for   now if you want to get what you originally signed up for you need to pay extra presumably something was wrong in the original ad or something like that   and all you can hear in the background is i am altering the deal pray i do n't alter it any further so what do you do when you 've been bait and switched the best thing to do is typically to walk away try to get your application fee back you may or may not be able to but it 's worth a shot and even if you can not walk away anyway someone who is going to bait and switch on you is probably not going to be a good landlord my guess is that rent is going to keep going up beyond the level of the market and you probably can kiss your security deposit goodbye second if walking away is n't practical for whatever reason you can find out what the local laws are some locations though very few sadly require advertised prices to be accurate particularly the fact that they re advertised the unit again for the same rate suggests they are falling afoul of that you can ask around search the internet or best yet talk to a lawyer who specializes in this sort of thing some of them will be willing to at least answer a few questions for free hoping to score your business for an easy profitable lawsuit be aware that it 's not exactly a good situation to be in to be suing your landlord second only to suing your employer in my opinion in terms of bad things to do while hoping to continue the relationship   find an alternative as soon as you can if you go this route in the future pay a lot of attention to detail when making application fees   often the application fee is needed before you get into too much detail but pick a location that has reasonable application fees and no extras   for example in my area it 's typical to pay a $ 25 application fee to do the credit check and background check and a refundable $ deposit to hold the unit while doing that a place that asks for a non refundable deposit is somewhere i 'd simply not apply at all

there are some great answers on this site similar to what you asked with either a non or a us centric focus i would read those answers as well to give yourself more points of view on early investing there are a few differences between canada and the us from an investing perspective that you should also then consider namely tax rules healthcare and education i 'll get healthcare and education out of the way quickly just note the difference in perspective in canada of having government healthcare putting money into health savings plans or focusing on insurance as a workplace benefit is not a key motivating factor but more a nice to have for education it is more common in canada for a student to either pay for school while working summer part time jobs or at least taking on manageable levels of debt because it is typically not quite as expensive as private colleges in the us there is still somewhat of a culture of saving for your child 's education here but it is not as much of a necessity as it may be in the us from an investing perspective i will quickly note some common though not universal general advice before getting canadian specific i have blatantly stolen the meat of this section from ben miller 's great answer here oversimplify it for me the correct order of investing once you have a solid financial footing some of canadian investing are below for all the tax specific plans i 'm about to mention note that the banks do a very good job here of tricking you into believing they are complex and that you need your hand to be held i have gotten some criminally bad tax advice from banking reps so at the risk of sounding i recommend that you learn everything you can beforehand and only go into your bank when you already know the right answer the account types themselves just involve a few pages of paperwork to open and the banks will often do that for free they make up their fees in offering investment types that earn them management fees once the accounts are created be sure to separate the investments stocks vs bonds etc vs the investment vehicles canada has tax free savings accounts where you can contribute a certain amount of money every year and invest in just about anything you want from bonds to stocks to mutual funds any income you earn in this account is completely tax free you can withdraw these investments any time you want but you ca n't re contribute until january 1st of next year ie you invest $ 5k today in stocks held in a tfsa and they grow to $ 6k you withdraw $ 6k in july no tax is involved on january 1st next year you can re contribute a new $ 6 k and also any additional amounts added to your total limit annually tfsa 's are good for short term liquid investments if you do n't know for sure when you 'll need the money putting it in a tfsa saves you some tax but does n't commit you to any specific plan of action registered retirement savings plans allow you to contribute money based on your employment income accrued over your lifetime in canada the contributions are deducted from your taxable income in the year you make them when you withdraw money from your rrsp the amount you withdraw gets added as additional income in that year ie you invest $ 5k today in stocks held in an rrsp and get a $ 5k deduction from your taxable income this year the investments grow to $ 6k you withdraw $ 6k next year your taxable income increases by $ 6k note that if the investments were held normally outside of an rrsp you would have a taxable gain of only 50 of the total gain but withdrawing the amount from your rrsp makes the gain 100 taxable on january 1st next year you cannot this amount once withdrawn it can not be except for below items rrsp 's are good for long term investing for retirement there are a few factors at play here 1 you get an immediate tax deduction thus increasing the original size of investment by deferring tax to the withdrawal date 2 your investments compound tax free you only pay tax at the end when you withdraw not annually on earnings and 3 many people expect that they will have a lower tax rate when they retire than they do today some warnings about rrsp 's 1 they are less liquid than tfsa 's you ca n't put money in take it out and put it in again in general when you take it out it 's out and therefore useless unless you leave it in for a long time 2 income gets re characterized to be fully taxable no dividend tax credits no reduced capital gains tax rate and 3 there is no guarantee that your tax rate on retirement will be less than today if you contribute only when your tax rate is in the top bracket then this is a good bet but even still in 30 years tax rates might rise by 20 who knows meaning you could end up paying more tax on the back end than you saved in the short term home buyer plan rrsp withdrawals my single favourite piece of advice for young canadians is this if you contribute to an rrsp at least 3 months before you make a down payment on your first house you can withdraw up to $ 25k from your rrsp without paying tax to use for the down payment then over the next ~10 years you need to money back to your rrsp and you will ultimately be taxed when you finally take the money out at retirement this means that contributing up to 25k to an rrsp can multiply your savings available for a down payment by the amount of your tax rate so if you make you 'll save on your 25k deposited turning your down payment into $ getting immediate access to the tax savings while also having access to the cash for a downpayment makes the home buyer plan a solid way to make the most out of your rrsp as long as one of your near term goals is to own your own home registered pension plans are even less liquid than rrsps tax wise they basically work the same you get a deduction in the year you contribute and are taxed when you withdraw the big difference is that there are rules on when you are allowed to withdraw only in retirement barring specific circumstances typically your employer 's matching program if you have one will be inside of an note that 's and rrsp 's reduce your taxes on your employment immediately if you contribute through a work program that means you get the tax savings during the year instead of all at once a year later on april 30th note that i have attempted at all times to keep my advice current with applicable tax legislation but i do not guarantee accuracy research these things yourself because i may have missed something relevant to your situation i may be just plain wrong and tax law may have changed since i wrote this to when you read it

i 'm not an expert but here is my best hypothesis on microsoft 's and most other company 's cash flow statements they use the so called indirect method of accounting for cash flow from operations how that works is they start with net income at the top and then adjust it with line items for the various non cash activities that contributed to net income the key phrase is that these are accounting for the non cash activities that contribute to net income if the accounts receivable amount changes from something other than operating activity e.g. if they have to write off some receivables because they wo n't be paid the change did n't contribute to net income in the first place so does n't need to be reconciled on the cash flow statement

the company says it 's out of their control it is n't all they have to do is to instruct hsbc to send a certain amount of gbp and then hsbc must send gbp   obviously the bank does n't like that because they make money through the conversion that 's not your problem when told to send gbp they must send gbp   depending on what your relationship with that company is you lost money because they did n't send the gbp at the very least they sent you four percent less in euros than they should have sent you so send them a bill for the difference it 's unfortunate that your bank charged for the conversion euro to gbp but fact is that less than the agreed amount arrived at your bank and that 's the responsibility of the sender

the shift to trading at the close began in 2008 traders did not want to be caught off guard by surprise news and there was a lot of volatility during the financial crisis so they would close their position in the evening that s how it began there are two reasons why it sticks around first there has been an increase usage of index funds or passive funds these funds tend to update their positions at the end of the day from the wsj another factor behind the shift has been the proliferation of passively managed investments such as index funds these funds aim to mimic an index like the s&p 500 by owning the shares that comprise it index funds do n’t trade as often as active investors but when they do it is typically near the market close traders say that is because buying or selling a stock at its closing price better aligns their performance with the index they are trying to emulate the second reason is simply that volume attracts volume as a result of what s mentioned above you have a shift to end of day trading and the to that is that there is a liquidity shortage from 10 am to 3 pm thus if you want to buy or sell a stock but there are few buyers or sellers around you will significant move the price when you enter your order obviously this does not affect retail traders but imagine hedge funds entering or closing a billion dollar position it can make a huge impact on price and one way to mitigate that is to wait until there are more market participants to take the other end of your trade just as at the end of the day so this is a self reinforcing trend that has begun in the markets and will likely stick around

wrong on so many counts   i have worked with many start ups and the well run ones have all payed their employees good salaries   they also have mostly older employees 30 + with families and kids and work reasonable hours   if you are worried about some vc guy then do n’t let them scam you   it is their job to squeeze the most equity for the least amount   as long as whoever in charge knows what they are doing this will never happen   remember first and foremost it is a business and if you see it not making money or not having the possibility of making money then do n’t work there   know what you are getting paid and know your equity it can work out great   i know a lot of people who have ridiculous amounts of cash working at start ups and they all stick together and use their experience to have repeat successes

gt my uncle ran a horrible pizza shop downtown the trick was the heroin business on the side   i have often wondered about stuff like that   especially when i see strip malls out in the middle of suburban rural areas with stores like candles etc or i mean i can understand that in some large metropolitan shopping mall they might generate enough walk in traffic to support a specialty candle or wallpaper store    but in a rural town with a total population of maybe 5,000 people and possibly 10,000 if you include every home in the around it well i just ca n't see the numbers working out especially since you never see anyone else in the store and the clerk always seems so totally in even trying to sell anything that it 's kind of creepy   on the other hand if you posit it as a cash based retail money laundering front for some drug business well then it suddenly makes sense   edit and with a pizza shop well they can even have a delivery service right out in the open

i think there are two options you invest for very close friends who trust you completely in this case i do n't see why you need legal formalities just take their money invest and return the profits or losses to them they 'll know that you invest it as well as you can rather than spend it on your dream vacation simply because they trust you and in case they never get to see most of their money back they 'll know that you 've tried your best and wo n't be upset with you you invest for people who trust you but not 100 in this case do n't take their money if you lose and in forex you most likely will then you 'll lose not only money but also your friends even if the legal documents would prove that you were and that they knew what they 're getting into they 'll still be mad at you

how can i correctly account for having money in different currencies without currency transfers or currency fluctuations ending up as gains or losses in my view your spreadsheet should be in multiple currencies i.e. if you have gained some in specific currency make a note of it in that specific currency if you have spent something in a specific currency then make a note accordingly you can use an additional column for reporting this in a neutral currency say gbp if you are transferring the money from account of one currency to account of another change the balances as appropriate with the actual conversion rate if you need this record keeping for tax purposes then get a proper advise from accountant

my answer is n't a full one but that 's because i think the answer depends on at minimum the country your broker is in the type of order you place limit market algo etc and the size of your order for example i can tell from watching live rates on regular lot limit orders i place with my uk based broker that they hold limit orders internally until they see a crossing rate on the exchange my requested stock is trading on then they submit a limit order to that exchange   i only get filled from that one exchange and this happens noticeably after i see my limit price print and my fills are always better than my limit price whereas with my us based broker i can see my regular limit order in the order book depth of book data prior to any fills   i will routinely be notified of a fill before i see the limit price print   and my fills come from any number of us exchanges nyse arca bats etc even for the same stock i should point out that the nbbo rule in the us under sec regulation probably causes more complications in handling of market and limit orders than you 're likely to find in most countries

only having 1200 dollars sounds extremely dangerous and in my opinion is not a sound situation to intentionally put yourself into    you have what 11k total that is roughly a rainy day fund depending on your expenses and clarity of cash flow i think you should keep that money in the bank as your new baseline at least 10k of it do n't touch that money unless you need to pay for an unexpected expense   now you have $ 0 to work with but a safe ish cushion    then and only then should any extra money be used for either paying down the loan or tax advantaged accounts a retirement account is probably the right long term financial choice however if it were me and i were back in that kind of situation i would pay off the loan first primarily for personal satisfaction then start maxing retirement contributions

short term the game is supply demand and how the various participants react to it at various prices on longer term prices start to better reflect the fundamentals within something like week to some month or two if there has not been any unique value affecting news then interest options market swing traders and such play bigger part with intraday the effects of available liquidity become very pronounced the market makers have algos that try to guess what type of client they have and they prefer to give high price to large buyer and low price to small buyer as intraday trader has spreads and commissions big part of their expenses and leverage magnifies those instead of being able to take advantage of the lower prices they prefer to stop out after small move against them in practise this means that when they buy low that low will soon be the midpoint of the day and high etc if they are still holding on buy and sell are similar to long call or long put options position and options are like insurance they cost you also the longer the position is held the more likely it is to end up with someone with ability to test your margin if you 're highly leveraged and constantly making your wins from the same source   risk management is also issue the leveraged pros trade through a company not sure if they 're able to open another such company and still open accounts after the inevitable

you get to keep the money if and only if you confirm with both parties the loan and the mattress companies that you received a refund twice and both parties agree that they know that with no and they both agree to let you keep it   in writing   and even then it might be depending on amounts generally speaking you should not consider the money yours   it was refunded in error after all   and it would have made more sense to confirm your communication before you deposited it and you maybe should n't have moved it into savings either that looks kinda like keeping the money unavailable   planning to keep it or even just keep it till the shoe drops looks an awful lot like fraud   as in the crime   taking or keeping money that does n't belong to you when you know it does n't belong to you is stealing    since you know you got the payment in error it is your responsibility to make at minimum a reasonable effort to make sure the money goes where it was intended to go and by reasonable effort i mean roughly what kind of effort the companies should put in in your view if the error had worked out the other way with neither paying you back    at what point if any should they consider the money theirs in the reversed situation depending on the amount involved and the companies attitudes it is possible not necessarily likely but possible that each company will hear your story and respond confirmed in writing that they have no problem letting you keep the payment from their company   in the companies view this might be about how much it would cost to recoup the amount and is thus more likely for very small amounts or else writing off the cost for customer service or pr if both companies do this you have the money free and clear   but i would not depend on this companies have just as much reason to want money as you do especially when belongs to them

i had a chat with a coworker whose spouse also teaches music lessons one interesting insight was that after raising prices the children were much more likely to come prepared because the parents felt more invested when it cost them more they were also less likely to cancel the lessons at the last minute this is an argument in favor of 's suggestion to charge something even if we donate the income to charity along those lines it might also make sense to give discounts if the child comes prepared having practiced daily   i agree that it 's not a lot of paperwork for some additional pay the problem is that i would also be tempted to buy a new piano and find other expenses to reduce the income that 's a discussion for another day   i think the break even point is probably somewhere around $ when i weigh record keeping time verses the income so as long as we exceed that i will probably encourage her to charge for the lessons even if she charges below the market for them i will consider setting up a charitable giving account that they can pay to instead of paying us directly

first and foremost make sure where you are purchasing the product is a reputable organization   secondly coming from a biased computer geek be aware that apple is a content trap   now on to my answer to your question how do preferred account programs work they 're preferred because they tend to bring in more money to the lender   it may say no payments for 6 months but the fine print may have you being charged interest during those 6 months meaning your new shiny computer will be costing more than the sticker price   the good side is that you do n't have to send in any actual payments for 6 months but be aware that you 'll probably be paying more than advertised what are the different ways i can do it your listed options 1 2 are both good ways to pay for your new computer   yes option 1 will charge you sales tax but are you sure paying online excludes sales tax   some states mandate it    option 2 is a viable option too probably your best option 1st there is possibly no sales tax with purchases made online although there may be a delivery charge    2nd you 're not committing to an additional monthly bill you are essentially paying with cash just directly from your bank account   no interest charge 3rd that little visa logo is your friend   purchases made through visa mastercard whether it 's a credit or debit card   normally have an auto extended warranty feature you may want to verify with visa before taking my word on it   typically they double any manufacture 's warranty    lastly you can always set up a paypal account and link it to your bank account   assuming the site you plan on purchasing the computer from accepts paypal

you lease one if you are going to get an economy car if you do n't drive too much < 15 k year and you want to hang on to the car for a long time   otherwise if you are a regular driver driving a leased new quality car can be cost effective many cars now have bumper to bumper warranties that last as long as the lease say 80 k so there is rarely any extra costs apart from regular maintenance the sweet spot for most new cars is in the 5th 6th or 7th years after they are paid off but at that point you may find you have maintenance bills that are approaching an average of $ 200 $ 300 per month in which case a lease starts to look pretty good i owned a 7 year old honda accord that cost only $ 80 less per month in maintenance than the new leased vw that replaced it   have n't looked back after that into my 3rd car and 9th year of leasing

personal loans are typically more expensive have higher interest than mortgages because they are not backed by an immovable asset so you should reconsider the decision to not want a mortgage it would be cheaper aside from that once you get a personal loan you are free to do with it whatever you want this includes sending it to your parents buying something gambling it away in vegas or take out cash and burn it so yes you can sending money from the uk to other eu countries should be easy and simple once it is in your account your bank can help you to make the transfer i assume you understand that if your parents walk away with the money you are left holding the bag you are taking the full risk and you will have to pay it back

the answer to your question has to do with the an explanation of shares authorized issued and outstanding companies in their articles of incorporation specify a maximum number of shares they are authorized to issue for example purposes let 's assume facebook is authorized to issue 100 shares let 's pretend they have actually issued 75 shares but only 50 are outstanding aka float i.e. freely trading stock in the market and stock options total 25 shares so if someone owns 1 share what percentage of facebook do they own you might think 1/100 or 1 you might think or 1.3 or you might think or 2   2 is the answer but only on a non diluted basis so today someone who owns 1 share owns 2 of facebook tomorrow facebook announces they just issued 15 shares to whatsapp to buy the company   now there are 65 shares outstanding and 90 issued now someone who owns 1 share of facebook own only or 1.5 down from 2 p.s. valuation can be thought of as the price of the stock at the time of the purchase announcement

here 's how i think about money there are only 3 categories contexts buckets that my earned money falls into savings is my emergency fund i keep 6 months of total expenses expenses are anything in the consumption bucket you can be as detailed as you want with this area but i tend to leave a fudge factor in other words if i estimate that i spend approximately $ 3,000 a month in consumption dollars then i 'll save $ 3,500 times 6 in the bank this money needs to be liquid some people use a heloc other people use their roth contributions in any case you need to put this money some place you can get access to it in case you go from accumulation income exceed expenses to mode expenses exceed income this money is distinct from consumption which i will cover in paragraph three investments are stocks bonds income producing real estate small businesses etc these dollars require a strategy the strategy can include some form of asset allocation but more importantly a timeline these are the dollars that are working for you each dollar placed here will multiply over time once you put a dollar here it should n't be taken out unless there is some sort of catastrophe that your savings ca n't handle or your timeline has been achieved notice that rental real estate is included so liquidating stocks to purchase rental real estate is not considered removing investment dollars just reallocating based on your asset allocation this bucket includes 401k 's iras all tax sheltered accounts non sheltered brokerage accounts and rental real estate in general your primary residence is not included in this bucket some people include the equity of their primary residence in the investment column but it can complicate the equation and i prefer to leave it out the consumption bucket is the most important bucket and the one you spend the most time with it requires a budget this includes your $ 5 magazine and your $ 200 bottle of wine anything in this bucket is gone you can recover a portion of it by selling it on ebay for $ 3 these are earned dollars but the original $ 5 is still considered spent the reason your thought process in this area is distinct from the other two the decisions made in this area will have the biggest impact on your personal finances warren buffett was famous for on haircuts because they are worth thousands of dollars down the road if they are invested instead remember this is a zero sum game so every $ 1 not consumed is placed in one of the other buckets once your savings bucket is full every dollar not consumed is sent to investments remember to include everything that does not fit in the other two buckets most people forget their car insurance life insurance tax bill at the end of the year accountant bill etc in conclusion there are three buckets savings which serve as your emergency bucket this money should not be touched unless you switch from accumulation to investments which are your dollars that are working for you over time they require a strategy and a timeline consumption which are your monthly expenses these dollars keep you alive and contribute to your enjoyment this is a short explanation of my use of money it can get as complicated and detailed as you want it to be but as long as you tag your dollars correctly you 'll be okay imho hth

the problem comes when the borrower can not afford his home   if a borrower buys more home than they can afford as long as he can sell the house for more than he owes he 's not in a disastrous situation he can sell the house pay off the mortgage and choose more affordable housing instead   if he is upside down on his home he does n't have that option he 's stuck in his home if he sells it he will have to come up with extra money to pay off the mortgage which he does n't have because he is in a home he ca n't afford it used to be commonplace for banks to issue mortgages for 100 of the value of the home as long as the home keeps appreciating everybody is happy but if the house drops in value and the homeowner finds himself unable to make house payments both the homeowner and the bank are at risk recent regulations in the u.s. have made no down payment mortgages less common

governments borrowing money does n't create new money when banks borrow money i.e. take deposits it does effectively create money because the depositor expects to be able to get the money back at any time but the bank assumes that most wo n't actually do this and lends out most of the money to other people if everyone did actually ask for their money back at once the illusion of the extra money created by this process would collapse and the bank would go bust in contrast when governments borrow money the loan is n't on demand it has a fixed maturity and the money is only repaid at the end of that period plus interest at defined points during the period so holders of government debt do n't have money they can spend they can turn it into money they can spend but only by finding someone else to buy it so government debt does n't create inflation in itself if they printed money then they 'd be devaluing the money of everyone who had saved or invested whereas if they borrow money and use taxes to repay it the burden falls more evenly across the economy and does n't disproportionately penalise certain sets of people

who says they do n't in the united kingdom the bank of england and the bank of scotland print the money in some other countries like hong kong israel and the us commercial banks were issuing the currency at some point of time but now the governments do that the problem with commercial banks issuing currency is the control if a bank is allowed to print money how can the amount of currency be controlled if it is controlled by the government then the bank will be just a printing press so what 's the point and since governments now want to control the monetary policy banks have no reason to just be printing presses for the government the governments have their own edit apparently in hong kong it is still the case as i 'm sure it is in some other places in the world as well

most states do have a cooling off period where the buyer can rescind the purchase as well as a legally allowed limit to how long the dealer has to secure financing when they buyer has opted for dealer financing if the dealer did inform you during the allowed window they will refund your down payment minus mileage fees at a state set cost per mile that you used the car if the dealer did not inform you during the allowed window depending on the state they may have to refund the entire down payment in any case the problem is that the bank does not want to offer you the loan you can try to negotiate and have the dealer use what leverage they have to coerce the bank but there is probably no way for you to force the loan through alternatively you can seek your own financing from your own bank or credit union which will likely allow the sale to go through update colorado laws allow the dealer 10 days to inform you that they can not obtain financing on the terms agreed upon in the original contract that contract contained wording related to the mileage fees you can find that info on page 8 of the linked pdf under the heading d. usage fee and mileage charge

see solid reading literature for investment retirement income taxes not exactly the same question but a great reading list for you you are putting the cart before the horse here first you learn then you invest there 's a large danger in confusing intelligent investing with fooling around the idea that you think you 'd like to use derivatives without knowing how or why is a tough one   i suggest you go to yahoo finance and set yourself up with a portfolio click on the my portfolios tab in effect creating your own simulated account assume you are starting with some reasonable amount of money say $ 10,000 but not $ 1 m as part of real investing is to learn how to asset allocate the funds you have learning that way for a time is the smarter way to start that said individual stocks are not for everyone most investors can lead a successful investing life by using etfs or mutual funds of one type or another learning to pick individual stocks can be a life 's work and if you put too little time into it are likely to be disappointed but learning by paper trading can be a good learning experience nonetheless

trying to determine what the best investment option is when buying a home is like predicting the stock market not likely to work out forget about the investment part of buying a home and look at the quality of life monthly annual financial burden and what your goals are buy a home that you 'll be happy living in and in an area you like buy a home with the plan being to remain in that home for at least 6 years if you 're planning on having kids then buy a home that will accommodate that if you 're not planning on living in the same place at least 6 years then buying might not be the best idea and certainly might not be the best investment you 're buying a home that will end up having emotional value to you this is n't like buying a rental property or commercial real estate chances are you wo n't lose money in the long run unless the market crashes again but in that case everyone pretty much gets screwed so do n't worry about it   we 're not in a housing market like what existed in decades past the idea of buying a home so that you 'll make money off it when you sell it is n't really as reliable a practice as it once was take advantage of the ridiculously low interest rates but note that if you wait they 're not likely to go up by an amount that will make a huge difference in the grand scheme of things   my family and i went through the exact same thought process you 're going through right now we close on our new house tomorrow we over renting somewhere we do n't have a good rental market compared to buying here buying something older for less money and fixing it up we 're hgtv but we realized we just do n't have the time or emotional capacity to deal with that scenario or buying new like new there are benefits and drawbacks to all 3 options and we spent a long time weighing them and eventually came to a conclusion that was best for us   go talk to a realtor in your area you 're under no obligation to use them but you can get a better feel for your options and what might best suit you by talking to a professional for what it 's worth our realtor is a big fan of homes in our area because of their home designs and quality we know some people who have bought in that neighborhood and they 're very happy there are horror stories too same as with any product you might buy

in practical terms it should n't   market cap changes every day assuming public trading of course or even second by second and focusing on investor sentiment toward your company 's stock is not the wisest way to make strategic decisions that being said company execs do need to be mindful of unusual swings in their company 's share prices because it can sometimes be an indicator of news information of which they 're unaware   at the same time you ca n't just disregard your shareholders especially the big institutional players who may have large voting blocks with which to replace you if they feel you 're not responsive to events   they are the ones who make strategic decisions based on your company 's share price right grin the issue around swings in market cap is more about public perception than reality so it is important for companies to have a good public relations strategy ready to go that can address questions concerns in case of some market event   after all consumers who hear that a company 's share price has suddenly fallen by say 30 might be more hesitant to do business with that company because there 's a perhaps irrational fear the company 's not doing well and may not be around much longer investors are by their very nature emotional rather than rational   any kind of news can cause a toward or away from a stock for no reason that an investment professional could ever explain   that 's why it 's impossible to spend any real time focusing on market cap leave that to your department to worry about if as a company executive you focus on doing the right things to make your company successful then any questions concerns about market cap will resolve themselves good luck

has good advice here i would like to add my notes if they give a 50 match that means you are getting a 50 return on immediately i do not know of a way to get a better guaranteed roi next when investing you need to determine what kind of investor you are i would suggest you make yourself more literate in investments as i suggest to anyone but there are basic things you want to look for if your primary worry is loss of your go for conservative investments this means that you are willing to accept a reduced expected roi in exchange for lower of loss of principal this does not mean you have a 100 safe investment as the last market issues have shown but in general you are better protected the fidelity investments should give you some information as to volatility or if they deem the investments conservative conservative investments are normally made up of trading bonds which have the lowest roi in general but are the most secure you can also invest in blue chip companies although stock is inherently riskier it is pointed out in comments that stocks always outperform bonds in the long term and this has been true over the last 100 years i am just suggesting ways you can protect yourself against market downturns when the market is doing very well bonds will not give you the return your friends are seeing i am just trying to give you a basic idea of what to look for when you pick your investments nothing can replace a solid investment adviser and taking the time to educate yourself

do you have a separate bank account for your business   that is generally highly recommended i have a credit card for my single member llc   i prefer it this way because it makes the separation of personal and business expenses very clear using a personal credit card but using it for only business expenses seems to be a reasonable practice   you may be able to do one better though for your sole proprietorship you can file a dba which establishes the business name   the details of this depend on your state   with a dba i believe you can open a bank account in the name of your business and you may also be able to open a credit card account in the name of the business   i 'm not sure what practical difference it makes but it does make the personal business distinction clearer   though at that point you might as well just do the llc

what fact   gt;it 's true that some americans do n't pay federal income tax but virtually all americans pay some form of tax whether it 's sales payroll state income or property tax    60 of those who do n't pay income tax are working they pay payroll tax which goes to support social security and medicare another 22 of those who do n't pay income tax are the elderly most of them do n't work    gt;in fact only about 8 of americans pay neither federal income tax nor payroll tax because they are unemployed are students or are disabled    gt;what is missing from all this talk about tax is the fact that although the rich pay higher taxes than the poor middle class people actually pay a higher percentage of their income in total taxes true federal income tax rates are progressive with rates going to 35 for the top earners but deductions and special treatment of capital gains reduce actual tax rates for the top earners so what we end up with is upper middle class taxpayers paying the highest actual percentage of their income over 31 according to a 2010 study by the group citizens for tax justice

various types of corporate actions will a price adjustment   in the case of dividends the cash that will be paid out as a dividend to share holders forms part of a company 's equity   once the company pays a dividend that cash is no longer part of the company 's equity and the share price is adjusted accordingly for example if apple is trading at $ 101 per share at the close of business on the day prior to going ex dividend and a dividend of $ 1 per share has been declared then the closing price will be adjusted by $ 1 to give a closing quote of $ 100 although the dividend is not paid out until the dividend pay date the share price is adjusted at the close of business on the day prior to the ex dividend date since any new purchases on or after the ex dividend date are not entitled to receive the dividend distribution so in effect new purchases are buying on the basis of a reduced equity    it will be the exchange providing the quote that performs the price adjustment not google or yahoo   the exchange will perform the adjustment at the close prior to each ex dividend date so when you are looking at historical data you are looking at price data that includes each adjustment

as a minor you certainly can pay tax the government wants its cut from you just like everyone else however you do get the personal allowance like everyone else so you wo n't have to pay income tax until your net income reaches £ that 's the figure for the tax year from april 2015 to april 2016 it 'll probably change in future years once you 're 16 you will also have to pay national insurance which is basically another tax at a lower threshold the current rates are £ if you are making £ a year or more and also 9 on any income above £ up to £ your net income or profits are the income you receive minus the expenses you have to support that income note that the expenses must be entirely for the business they ca n't be for personal things the most important thing to do immediately is to start keeping accurate records keep a list of the income you receive and also the expenses you pay for hardware etc make sure you keep receipts perhaps just electronic ones for the expenses so you can prove they existed later keep track of that net income as the year goes on and if it starts collecting at the rate you 'd have to pay tax and national insurance then make sure you also put aside enough money to pay for those when the bill comes there 's some good general advice on the government 's website here in short as well as keeping records you should register with the tax office hmrc as a sole trader this should be something that anyone can do whatever their age but it 's worth calling them up as soon as you can to check and find out if there are any other issues they 'll probably want you to send in tax returns containing the details of your income and expenses if you 're making enough money it may be worth paying an accountant to do this for you

compared with a sole proprietorship the main disadvantages of an s corporation or an llc are that it adds a lot of management overhead time and possibly money if you do n't do it all yourself and there are fees you must pay to incorporate as well as additional yearly maintenance fees which vary by state you should be able to weigh the tax savings and liability protection against the extra costs and hassle and see which way the scales tip as a rule of thumb the bigger your business gets or the more income you make the more attractive incorporating becomes note there are some additional taxes that certain jurisdictions impose on business income for example il and ca charge 1.5 tax ny is less but nyc is in nyc specifically you could actually end up paying slightly more tax as an s corp than you would as a sole proprietorship in most places though the nominal local taxes will still be less than the fica taxes you could potentially save

unless you are buying a significant value of your goods in usd then the relative strength of usd versus your local currency will have little to no effect on what the value of your investments is worth to you in fact only will effect your purchasing power if your investments are in your local currency and your future expenses usage of the returns on the investments will be in your local currency fx has no effect to answer your question however since all investments involve flows of money there can be no investment other than perhaps gold which is really a form of currency that is n't bound to at least one currency in general investments are expected to be valued against the investor 's home currency i tend to call it fund currency as i work with hedge funds as the return on the investment will be paid out in the fund currency and returns will be compared on the same basis if investments are to be made internationally then it is necessary to reduce or hedge the exchange rate risk this is normally done using fx swaps or futures that allow an exchange rate in the future to be locked in today far from being from fx moves these derivatives are closely bound to any moves but are bound in the opposite direction to the hoped for fx move an example of this would be if i 'm investing my local currency in a us company xyz corp which i expect to do well suppose i get for my and so buy 1 shares in xyz no matter what happens to xyz stock any move in gbp usd will affect my p&l so i buy a future that allows me to exchange for in 6 month 's time if gbp rises i can sell the future and make money on both the higher exchange rate and the increase in xyz corp if gbp falls i can keep the future until maturity and exchange the from xyz corp for so i only take the foreign exchange hit on any profits if i expect my profits to be i can even buy futures such that i can lock in the exchange rate for in 6 months so that i will lose even less of my profit from the exchange rate move

you are correct a possible dead cat bounce is forming on the stock markets if it does form it will mean that prices have not reached their bottom as this pattern is a bearish continuation pattern for a dead cat bounce to form prices will need to break through support formed by the lows last week if prices bounce off the support and go back up it could become a double bottom pattern which is a reversal pattern the double bottom would be confirmed if prices break above the recent high a couple of days ago regarding the psychology of the dead cat bounce pattern is that after a distinct and quick reversal of prices from recent highs you have 2 groups of market participants who create demand in the market firstly you have those who were short covering their short positions to take profits and secondly you have those who are looking for a bargain buying at what they think is the low so for a few days you have the bulls taking over the bears   then as more less positive news comes in the bears hit the market again these are more participants opening short positions but more so those who missed out in selling previously because prices fell too quickly seeing another opportunity to sell at a better price so the bears take over again   unless there is very good news around the corner it is likely that the bears will stay in control and prices will fall further how to trade a dead cat bounce assuming you have been stopped out of your long already if you are aggressive you can go short as prices start reversing from the top of the bounce with your stop loss just above the top of the bounce if you are more conservative you would place your entry for a short position just below the support at the start of the bounce with your stop above the top of the bounce you could also place an order for a long position above the top of the bounce if a double bottom a one cancels the other oco would be an appropriate order for such a situation

more costs are going to be put on the consumer but that is something that would happen all the time originally those systems were not built with the expectation that average life expectancy would jump from almost a factor of a third 60 to 80 years if you wonder why the age of retirement is 65 and not more or less check out and kaiser on that subject additionally the current age population pyramid of the west and asian soon to come is put an increasing pressure on the cost of healthcare   now to me the biggest issue with the us is the belief that market driven economies will always lower prices the problem is that the insurance companies in this country form an oligopoly with the goal to make profits now here is the important question is healthcare a need or a want if it is a want then someone can live without it but if you have an accident or anything of that type then is it still a want or a need you can live without tv all your life and nothing bad may happen to you no healthcare and then you can get screwed for your life   because people will feel compelled to save themselves and be brought to the hospital those who can afford it or need it will pay for it thus you have an automatic pressure on prices as it is used by a smaller pool of people than if everyone in the country was paying for it independent of income and because the people buying health insurance feel they need to have insurance their price elasticity of demand will become inelastic the price may change a lot but the amount of demand wo n't change much so if i 'm a private insurance company i will charge as much as i can because i know that people will be willing to pay more for   the same healthcare cost    the european system will simply be a cheaper option than the us because it concentrates a larger pool of payers and is not aimed at profits additionally if there were quality issues in the healthcare provided this would have been seen long ago if you compare the amount of money spent in the us and europe on healthcare in europe the cost of healthcare is theoretically only the government spending in the us it is both and private spending     tell me what you think

separation of powers under the united states constitution   separation of powers is a political doctrine originating in the writings of charles de baron de in the spirit of the laws in which he argued for a constitutional government with three separate branches each of which would have defined abilities to check the powers of the others this philosophy heavily influenced the writing of the united states constitution according to which the legislative executive and judicial branches of the united states government are kept distinct in order to prevent abuse of power this united states form of separation of powers is associated with a system of checks and balances   during the age of enlightenment philosophers such as advocated the principle in their writings whereas others such as thomas strongly opposed it     ^ ^pm](https://www.reddit.com message compose?to = kittens_from_space ^| ^exclude ^me](https://reddit.com message compose?to = wikitextbot&amp;message = excludeme&amp;subject = excludeme ^| ^exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com r economy about banned ^| ^faq ^/ ^information](https://np.reddit.com r wikitextbot wiki index ^| ^source](https://github.com kittenswolf wikitextbot    ^ ^downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.24

as usual it depends but fundamentally an interest rate is just a function of a party 's creditworthiness and the length of time the money is being lent out for   so no if your credit entitles you to a 3 apr on a 60 month term then it should entitle you to a better interest rate over a 30 month term perhaps not double but better

you can not even if your children actually have that money your fiduciary duty is to them not to yourself you can not gift away money they own for your own purposes they have to want to gift it away since it belongs to them i doubt they do or they should since you have to have their best interests in mind you should n't allow them gift away such amounts even if they 're willing to doing otherwise will be a criminal act on your behalf embezzlement breach of fiduciary duty do talk to an attorney of course since i 'm not but that is my understanding of things if your kids do n't actually have the money then they can obviously not gift it so claiming that they did would be a tax fraud

assuming you live in the us it is quite normal when you are applying for a loan that the application will ask you to confirm your identity one of these methods is to ask you which of the following addresses you have lived at with some of them being very similar i.e. same city or maybe even the same street sometimes they will ask questions and your answer would be none of the above this is done to prevent fraudsters from applying for a loan under your identity if you see no signs of unauthorized accounts or activities on your credit reports and you initiated the car loan application then you should be fine

i 'm going to put this very very simply   the banking system does create money through leveraging and the money multiplier this is absolutely true   the current theory is that this is how the economy is expanded because of the basic premise that an economy can only grow with ample amounts of land labor and capital and it is assumed that the money multiplier allows the development and purchase of all of these things that have the net effect of growing the economy beyond the level of debt built up as part of the process of wealth creation   i have no problem with the above in principle the problem comes when the cycle of debt is built up recklessly and irresponsibly with little if any regulation   that leads to a system in which debt and interest buildup faster than wealth is created   i also have issues with who ends up holding a piece of the pie as it is called but that 's a separate issue entirely   the fed 's job is to stop the economy from collapsing overnight due to fluctuations in the price of money   it would be no different if money was backed by gold and in fact part of the reason why we abandoned that notion as laid out at bretton woods was because of how gold was being sold as a commodity thus affecting the price of money the way speculation on fiat currency occurred due in part to charles de being an asshole   in today 's world where arbitrage happens almost instantaneously and markets shift rapidly there is danger in not having a central bank that can regulate the price of currency to prevent disastrous inflation or economy unemployment   every nation in the world has one because they are necessary in the context of the current economy   banking regulation is a multi tiered problem that involves regulatory capture congressional payoffs a closed circle in terms of who is qualified to even run such institutions and numerous other problems but this is not unique to the banking industry every regulatory body in existence suffers from the same problem   at the moment the chairman of the fed is an appointed position that exists so that key economic decisions will be isolated from the political pressure that elections result in avoiding hastily thrown together and shoddy economic policy based solely upon politics   the independence of like greenspan is questionable but in theory it 's supposed to prevent decision making   in short what i just explained is what everyone else here already knows   welcome to the party

plenty of good answers here but probably the best answer is that the market relies on suckers er investors like you   the money has to come from somewhere it might as well be you so called day traders or short term investors are a huge part of the market and they perform a vital function   they provide capital that flows to the large well equipped institutional investors   thing is you can never be big enough smart enough well informed enough or quick enough to beat the big guys   you may have a run of good fortune but over the long term aggregate you 're a payor into the market not a dividend

simple if they do n't allow you easily transfer money then they get to keep your money longer and earn more interest not to mention they can continue to charge fees for wire transfers when i was in colorado springs all the banks allowed free bank to bank transfers why because their clients demanded it most of their clients were military members who needed to be able to send money home or to relatives in other states etc when i moved to texas i could not find a single bank that allowed free bank to bank tranfers they had varying fee schedules for wire tranfers ranging from $ 7 to as high as $ 22 when i asked why they charged a fee to send money basically over the internet i was told that the feds made them charge a fee big bunch of bull but i had to have a bank banks in this country will make it as hard as they legally can for you to remove your money from their greedy little i am going through this now with a bank in idaho supposedly i can send funds bank to bank but i have to jump through a bunch of hoops that are difficult because i work during the bank hours the bill pay site says i can do external tranfers but the button to set up external transfers is mysteriously missing so i have to fill out paperwork in the presence of someone at the bank and submit it i was even told that it had to be typed or it may be refused the more i travel the more i mistrust banks and their schemes to keep my money

i have a similar situation five different accounts between me and my wife just as you and b describe i maintain my asset allocation across the combination of all accounts i also maintain a spreadsheet to track the targets deviations from the targets amounts required to get back in balance and overall performance i mostly do n't use mutual funds i have selected for each category 1 or 2 etfs choosing index etfs with low expense ratios and a brokerage with cheap or free trades keeps expenses low my broker offers free etf trades if you buy off their list as long as you are n't short term trading this is great for rebalancing for free 2 or 3 times a year using etfs also solves the minimum balance problem but watch out for commissions if you pay $ 10 to buy $ 500 worth of an etf that 's an immediate 2 loss trade a couple of times a year and that etf has to gain 5 just to break even one issue that comes up is managing cash and avoiding transaction fees say your ira has all the growth stock funds and your roth has the bonds stocks do well and bonds do poorly so you sell off some stocks which creates a bunch of cash in your ira now you want to buy some bonds but you do n't have enough cash in your roth so you buy the bonds in your ira not a problem at first but if you do n't manage it you can end up with small amounts of various funds spread across all of your accounts if you 're not careful you can end up paying two commissions in two different accounts to sell off purchase enough of a category to get back to your targets another problem i had is that only one account 401k is receiving deposits on a regular basis and that 's all going into an s&p 500 index fund this makes it so that my allocation is off by a fair amount every quarter or so too much in large cap equities not enough of everything else my solution to this going forward is to over rebalance a couple of times a year sell enough spy from my other accounts so that i 'm under allocated in large caps by the amount i expect to add to my 401k over the next 3 months so that in six months at my next rebalancing i 'm only 3 months over allocated to large caps plus or minus whatever gains losses there are

of course cds are worth it compared to the stock market in fact most institutional investors are of the cds you have access to as an individual investor that are unavailable to them you just need to be competent enough to shop around for the best rates and understand your time horizon there are several concepts to understand here banks give out cds with competitive rates projecting future interest rates so while the federal funds rate is currently extremely low banks know that in order to get any takers on their cds they have to factor in the public expectation that rates will rise so if you lock in a longer term cd you get a competitive rate institutional investors do not have access to fdic insured cds and the closest analog they participate in are the auctions and secondary markets of us treasuries these two types of assets have equivalent default if held to maturity backed by the full faith and credit of the u.s. here are the current rates as of question 's date taken from vanguard that i can get on cds versus treasuries as an individual investor notice that cds outperform treasuries across any maturity timescale for fixed income and bond allocations institutional investors are lining up for buying treasuries and yet here you are saying cds are not worth it might want to rethink that now going into the stock market as an investor with expectations of those high returns you quote means you 're willing to stay there for the long term at least a decade and stay the course during volatility to actually have any hope of coming up with the average rate of return even then there 's the potential downside of risk that you still lose principal after that duration so given that assumption it 's only fair to compare against > = 10 year cds which are currently rated at 2 percent apy in addition cds can be laddered allowing you to lock in newer and potentially higher rates as they become available you essentially your into these investments and either reinvest upon the maturity dates or use as income also keep in mind that while personal emergencies requiring quick access to cash can happen at any time the most common scenario is during the sudden change from a bull market into a recession the time when stocks plummet if you need money right away selling your stocks at these times would lock in severe losses whereas with cds you still wo n't lose principal with an early exit and the only penalty is usually a sacrifice of a few months of potential interest it 's easy to think of the high yields during a protracted bull market such as now but personal finance has a huge behavioral component to it that is largely ignored until it 's too late one risk that is n't taken care of by either cds or treasuries is inflation risk all the rates here and in the original question are nominal rates and the real return will depend on inflation or deflation there are other options here besides cds treasuries and the stock market to outpace inflation if you 'd like to hedge that risk with inflation protection series i savings bonds and tips

gt simply because there are cases of market failures i do not therefore conclude that the market system is itself a failure   no but without a realistic mechanism to correct for them especially ones with effects as broad reaching as the financial crisis i do n't see how free markets can be compatible with liberty and justice   if you 're seeing some sort of mass organization of the public against market externalities that affect them then i 'm afraid i missed that   in my experience most people do n't even understand the nature of the problems let alone work together to them   that 's a shame you wo n't debate with people who hold opposing viewpoints i was looking forward to the challenge of your air tight of systems

the store has to match the price they do n't have a choice   here in canada we have a book store called chapters    they wo n't price match their own online prices in store    i have n't shopped there in 10 years      if best buy is smart they 'll stop the price match   if you want instant gratification for your purchases you should pay for it    if you go in and the tv is priced at x you pay x.    if you go home and see it 's a different price online buyer beware   i think that 'd be a brilliant move   make the brick and mortars charge more for the luxury of shopping in a store       it 's sleazy but honestly not a bad business model

our current economic situation is a mess and our current tax system is the problem but the problem is too little wealth taxation not too much     you are correct in asserting that land value tax is not the solution since we do n't live in a society where farmland is the primary source of ownership based income   if you want to look at what you can own to earn money these days look at the holdings of apple google microsoft amazon exxon mobile verizon etc it 's not farmland anymore it 's ip and it goes entirely untaxed   taxing property is completely appropriate but the problem is that we live in a world where the taxes even taxes designed to tax wealth like property taxes fall almost entirely on the individual since high value capital can move jurisdictions to dodge taxes and thus taxing wealth like we should creates a competitive disadvantage     when you push back on real estate property taxes you do n't make things better for most people   property values rise since the value of an asset is proportional to how much money it can earn for it 's owner driving affordability down rent up homeownership rates down and generally worsening the quality of life for everyone   pushed to the extreme you get a 2 class system where land ownership is for the entitled and everyone else are worthless   history is littered with examples which is why we know the word serf   for a modern day cautionary tale look at what happened in california since the reagan property tax changes   they still seem convinced it was a great change but the california real estate market is pure insanity

in my opinion it generally makes sense to focus all of your debt reduction energy and funds on one loan at a time there are two reasons for this it will allow you to more quickly move from 4 loans to 3 loans and then 2 and then 1 providing you with a sense of progress and motivation as you reduce the number of loans that you have your monthly minimum payment obligations will be reduced   then if you have a month with an emergency expense you will have more income available to you for your emergency without getting behind on your loans there is debate about whether to pay loans in order of the loan balance or in order of interest rate you can read about this here and here but in your case your highest interest loans also have the lowest balance so either method would have you picking the same loans first    you have already chosen wisely to start with the $ 1500 6.8 loans   send all of your $ 1000 to one of these loans and continue to work aggressively to knock out all four as quickly as possible

is the mortgage debt too high the rental property is in a hot re market so could be easily sold with significant equity however they would prefer to keep it given the current income there is no stress however in absence of any other liquid cash near cash assets having everything locked into mortgage is quite high even if real estate builds assets these are highly illiquid investments have debt on such investments is risky if there are no other investments essentially everything looks fine now but if there is an crisis unwinding mortgage debt is time consuming and if it forces distress sale it would wipe out any gains can they afford another mortgage and in what amount e.g. they are considering $ 50 k for a small cabin which could be rented out i guess they can but should they or diversify into other assets like stocks etc other than setting cash aside what would be some good uses of funds to make sure the money would appreciate and outpace inflation and add a nice bonus to retirement mutual funds stocks 401 k or other such retirement plans they are currently in 's if there is one key strategy or decision they could make today that would help them retire early say 's what should it be this opinion based it depends on what their lifestyle is and what would they want their lifestyle to be when they retire they should look at saving enough corpus that would give an year on year yield equivalent to the retirement expenses

first in the money options are created because most options trade at the money with the rest evenly distributed between in and out so they are at best half the market when created they are also closed before expiration the reason is still unknown but one theory is barely in the money options carry enormous exercise risk because the chance that could be turned into a potentially solvency threatening unhedged liability is great therefore option sellers prefer to close barely in the money options so not to take on unhedged liability risk statistically option sellers are risk

if you just make a capital contribution to the company it is not a taxable event   if you 're the owner lending only makes sense if you want the company to pay you interest if you have partners who are n't lending money for example and you want to be compensated for lending a loan would allow that but the interest is taxable as income to you 1099-int and the company can expense it but a capital contribution is much easier and you can take a distribution later to get paid back neither event is taxed but you can not take interest

i think the definition of on investopedia will answer this question for you   namely this part for example in the case of a mortgage backed security the principal amount of an issue may be $ 100 million while the principal value of the mortgages underlying the issue may be equal to $ 120 million the bond is packed with more mortgages than the face value indicates   it 's effectively sold at a discount to underlying value

most directly and most likely it can hurt your credit score if you miss payments since it 's being reported regardless of whether or not it benefits you this is a risk for you but a benefit for landlords since it gives renters more incentive to actually make on time payments secondarily there 's a small risk that credit ladder or one of their partners makes a mistake and you have to spend some time correcting it they do seem to have reputable partners so it 's likely that mistakes can be corrected at the cost of through customer support finally it 's important to look at where they get their money   credit ladder charges directly for premium memberships it appears that those are basically a sort of group discount thing none of the benefits seem super awesome but the cost is low enough that i think it could be worth it for some people so that 's one way to make money risk here = this service does n't make enough money and they might phase out the free tier now source of money 2 your information according to this source within the privacy policy the company states that they may use the personal information collected about you to provide third parties with statistical information about our users but this information will not be used to identify any individual user it ’s not clear if this is the intended monetization of the company it is a consideration to the user that this information may be sold risk here = they might get hacked or they might sell your non identifying information there 's no details as to whether or not they are actually doing this but they have the right to do so if they got even 10 of the renters in uk using their service then this data would be quite valuable

gt;you're fooling yourself if you think they do n't have advantages over retail investors   well clearly they have resources connections more clout when speaking to their etc but what i meant is it 's not as big of an advantage as most people believe it is also with derivatives you 're right its a whole different ball game i 'm a finance student and i invest my own money to learn and to grow my wealth slowly and intelligently the thing is i never touch because i have n't studied them much yet also i come from a very benjamin graham value investing background so that is why i think that an average investor with a retail brokerage account can beat the institutions this energy thing is not something that i think can be capitalized upon however

they are already indirectly paying these expenses   they should be built into your rates the amount per job or per hour needs to cover what would have been your salary plus the what would have been sick vacation holidays health insurance life insurance disability education overhead for office expenses cost of accountants and all taxes in many companies the general rule of thumb is that they need to charge a customer 2x the employees salary to cover all this plus make a profit if this is a side job some of these benefits will come from your main job some self employed get some of these benefits from their spouse   the company has said we give you money for the work you perform but you need to cover everything else including paying all taxes depending on where you live you might have to send money in more often then once a year they are also telling you that they will be reporting the money they give you to the government so they can claim it as a business expense so you better make sure you report it as income
