there 's not quite enough to answer the question in full for the two years of non payment were there any penalties or just accrued interest if no penalties this is a 3 step time value of money calculation first take the terms of the loan and figure out the balance after 5 years   second for two years increase the balance by the monthly interest rate   last calculate a new payment with a 13 year duration   excel or any business calculator can handle this
# 141005
it sounds like there are no provisions in the loan document for how to proceed in this case    i would view this as creating a brand new loan the amount owed is going to be principal remaining + interest from 2 years + penalties   if you created a new loan for 13 years that would not be how i would expect a lender to behave i would expect most repayment plans to be something like make double payments until you are caught up or pay an extra $ 1000 per month until caught up and then resume normal payments

no that is not a rollover many employees have experienced a change of management companies sometimes these switches are due to a merger an acquisition or just to save money it is understandable that the old employer would like to see you transfer your funds to either your new employer or roll them over into a ira roth ira so it is not unexpected that they will take this opportunity to nudge you   the thing that congress was trying to prevent were serial rollovers of iras these people would use the 60 day window to have in essence a loan some would do this multiple times a year always making sure they replaced the money in time   the ira one rollover per year rule beginning in 2015 you can make only one rollover from an ira to    another or the same ira in any 12-month period regardless of the    number of iras you own announcement   2014 15 and announcement    2014 32 the limit will apply by aggregating all of an individual ’s    iras including sep and simple iras as well as traditional and roth    iras effectively treating them as one ira for purposes of the limit direct transfers of ira money are not limited this change wo n’t affect your ability to transfer funds from one ira    trustee directly to another because this type of transfer is n’t a    rollover revenue ruling 78 1978 2 the    one rollover per year rule of internal revenue code section    applies only to rollovers note that the law does n't mention or the federal tsp when the 401 k changes management companies that is not a rollover

back in the olden days if you wanted to buy the s&p you had to have a lot of money so you can buy the shares then somebody had the bright idea of making a fund that just buys the s&p and then sells small pieces of it to investor without huge mountains of capital enter the etfs the guy running the etf of course does n't do it for free he a little bit of money off the top this is the fee the major s&p etfs all have tiny fees in the percents of a percent if you 're buying the index you 're probably looking at gains or losses to the tune of 5 10 20 unless you 're doing something really silly you would n't even notice the fee as often happens when one guy starts doing something and making money there will immediately be so now we have competing etfs all providing the same service you are technically a competitor as well since you could compete with all these funds by just buying a basket of shares yourself thereby running your own private fund for yourself the reason this stuff even started was that people said well why bother with mutual funds when they charge such huge fees and still do n't beat the index anyway so the index etfs are supposed to be a low cost alternative to mutual funds thus one thing etfs compete on is fees you can see how voo has lower fees than spy and ivv in keeping with vanguard 's philosophy of minimal management and management fees incidentally if you buy the shares directly you would n't charge yourself fees but you would have to pay commissions on each stock and it would destroy you another benefit of the etfs moreover these etfs claim they track the index but of course there is no real way to peg an asset to another so they ensure tracking by keeping a carefully curated portfolio of course nobody is perfect and there 's tracking error you can in theory compare the etfs in this respect and buy the one with the least tracking error however they all basically track very closely again the error is fractions of the percent if it is a legitimate concern in your books then you 're not doing index investing right the actual prices of each fund may vary but the price hardly matters the key metric is does it go up 20 when the index goes up 20 and they all do so what do you compare them on well typically companies offer people perks to attract them to their own product if you are a fidelity customer and you buy ivv they will waive your commission if you hold it for a month i believe vanguard will also sell voo for free but for instance fidelity will take commission from voo trades and vice versa so this would be your main factor though then again you can just make an account on robinhood and they 're all commission free a second factor is reliability of the operator frankly i doubt any of these operators are at all untrustworthy and you 'd be buying your own broker 's etf anyway and presumably you already went with the most trustworthy broker besides that like i said there 's trivial matters like fees and tracking error but you might as well just flip a coin it does n't really matter

if the company is non public your hands are tied most startups have a stock option plan with specific rules on the shares in almost all cases they have a clause preventing transfers of options and shares unless approved by the company who would almost always say no additionally they usually have a right of first refusal which states that if shares are going to be transferred the company gets the chance to buy it first in your case the company may argue your friend would sell you the shares for free and the company would exercise their and buy back the shares for free there is not much you can do in this case you may be able to write up a contract between your friend and you but it would be costly and possibly not worth the effort you may be better off asking for a lump sum or some other sort of compensation additionally your friend might want to be careful with this idea you could potentially gain access to sensitive company tools documents which could get them in a lot of trouble

see the accepted answer for this question   what effect will credit card churning for frequent flyer miles have on my credit score this does not directly answer how often that you asked but it states that the answerer opens 5 15 accounts per year   so the answer to your question is as often as you want as long as you manage your account ages the reason for this is that there are two factors in opening a new account that affect your credit card score   one is average age of accounts the other is credit inquiries   that answerer with fico in high sees about a 5 swing based on new cards and closing old ones you 'll have to manage average age of accounts   i assume this is done by keeping some older ones open to prop up the average and by closing the churn accounts finally if you choose to engage in churning and you intend to apply for a large loan and want a good credit score simply pause the account open close part of the churn a couple of months ahead of time   your score should recover from the temporary hits of the inquiries    the churning communities really do have how to guides which discuss the details of this   key phrase credit card churning

three companies may have copies of it the bank the title company aka settlement company and perhaps the real estate agent the bank assuming you had a mortgage is usually the easiest one to contact as you 're probably still making payments to them they may have sent you the form in a large packet when you sold the house and paid off the old mortgage there is a tradition of sending customers their entire mortgage file once they pay off the mortgage after 30 years which is very rare nowadays but many banks still adhere to it because the mortgage business is built on momentum and very slow to change otherwise the title company should have a copy of it if you do n't know which company was used they should be named as trustee on the deed of trust which in most states is the official name of the document that we call a mortgage the county recorder 's office will have a copy of that deed of trust on record if you ca n't find it anywhere some counties have these so you could find it online but some would require you to request a copy and pay a small printing fee for it

you have several questions in your post so i 'll deal with them individually is taking small sums from your ira really that detrimental i mean as far as tax is concerned percentage wise you pay the tax on the amount plus a 10 penalty plus the opportunity cost of the gains that the money would have gotten   at 6 growth annually in 5 years that 's more than a 34 loss   there are much cheaper ways to get funds than tapping your ira is n't the 10 penalty really to cover ss and the medicare tax that you did not pay before putting money into your retirement no you still pay ss and medicare on your gross income 401(k contributions just reduce how much you pay in income tax   the 10 penalty is to dissuade you from using retirement money before you retire if i contributed that to my ira before taxes including ss and medicare tax that money would gain 6 interest again you would still pay ss and medicare and like you say there 's no guarantee that you 'll earn 6 on your money   i do n't think you can pay taxes up front when making an early withdrawal from an ira can you   this one you got right   when you file your taxes your ira contributions for the year are totaled up and are deducted from your gross income for tax purposes there 's no tax effect when you make the contribution would it not be better to contribute that $ 5500 to my ira and if i did n't need it great let it grow but if i did need it toward the end of the year do an early withdrawal so what do you plan your tax withholdings against   do you plan on keeping it there reducing your withholdings and pay a big tax bill plus possibly penalties if you need it   or do you plan to take it out and have a big refund when you file your taxes you might be better off saving that up in a savings account during the year and if at the end of the year you did n't use it then make an ira contribution which will lower the taxes you pay   do n't use your ira as a hopeful savings account so if i needed to withdrawal $ 5500 and i am in the 25 tax bracket i would owe the government $ 1925 in 10 penalty so if i withdrew $ to cover the tax and penalty i would then be taxed $ 2600 an additional $ 675 sounds like a cat chasing it 's tail trying to cover the tax yes if you take a withdrawal to pay the taxes if you pay the tax with non retirement money then the cycle stops how can i make a withdrawal from an ira without having to pay tax on tax pay cash for the tax and penalty rather then taking another withdrawal to pay the tax   if you ca n't afford the tax and penalty in cash then do n't withdraw at all based on this year 's w-2 form i had an accountant do my taxes and the $ 27 k loan was added as earned income then in another block there was the $ 2700 amount for the penalty so you paid 25 in income tax for the earned income and an additional 10 penalty   so in your case it was a 35 overall tax instead of the 40 rule of thumb since many people are in 28 and 35 tax brackets the bottom line is it sounds like you are completely unorganized and have absolutely no margin to cover any unexpected expenses   i would stop contributing to retirement today until you can get control of your spending get on a budget and stop trying to use your ira as a piggy bank   if you do n't plan on using the money for retirement then do n't put it in an ira   stop borrowing from it and getting into further binds that force you to make bad financial decisions you do n't go into detail about any other aspects mortgage car loans consumer debt to even begin to know where the real problem is   so you need to write everything down that you own and you owe write out your monthly expenses and income and figure out what you can cut if needed in order to build up some cash savings until then you 're driving across country in a car with no tires worrying about which highway will give you the best gas mileage

pension in this instance seems to mean pension income as opposed to pension pot this money would be determined by whatever assets are being invested in it may be fixed it may be variable completely dependant on the underlying investments an annuity is a product in simple terms you over a lump sum of cash and receive an agreed annual income until you die the underlying investment required to reach that income level is not your concern it 's the provider 's worry so there is a mount of security to the retiree in having an annuity the downside of annuities is that the level of income may be too low for your liking for instance £ would mean £ 400 for every £ 10,000 given to the provider that 's 4 and would take 25 years to break even ignoring inflation opportunity cost of investing yourself therefore the gamble is whether you outlive the deal you could hand over £ 50,000 to a provider and drop dead a year later your £ 50k got you say £ 2k and then you popped your provider wins or you could like 40 years after retiring and then you end up costing the provider £ 80k you win best way to think of an annuity is a route to guaranteed agreed income to secure that guarantee there 's a price to pay and that is a lower income rate than you might like hope that was the kind of reply you were hoping for if not edit your op and ask again chris ps the explanation on the link you provided is pretty dire very confusing use of the term pension and even if that were better the explanation is still bad due to this is much better

first i 'd like to congratulate you on your financial discipline in paying off your loans and living well within your means   i have friends who make more than twice your salary with similar debt obligations and they barely scrape by month to month if we combine your student loan debt and unallocated income each month we get about $ 1,350   you say that $ per month is the minimum payment for your loans which have an average interest rate of about 3.5   thus you have about $ 1,350 a month to invest making your loan payments is basically the same as investing with the same return as the loan interest rate when it comes down to it   an interest rate of 3.5 is not great all things considered and barely above inflation     however that 's a guaranteed return of 3.5 more or less like a bond   as noted previously the stock market historically averages 10 before inflation over the long run the us stock market is right around its historic high at this point djia is at today april 6th 2017 historic high hit just over on march 1 2017   obviously no one can predict the future but i get the feeling that a market correction may be in order especially depending on how things go in washington in the next weeks or months   if that 's the case again we have no way of knowing if it is you 'd be foolish to invest heavily in any stocks at this point what i would do given your situation is invest the $ in a portfolio that 's 50/50 stocks and bonds where the bonds here are your student loans   here you have a guaranteed return of on the bond portion and you can still hedge the other 50 on stocks continuing their run and also benefiting from dividends capital gains etc over time   i would apply the extra loan payments to the highest interest loan first paying only the minimum to the others   once the highest interest loan is paid off move onto the next one once you have all your loans paid off your portfolio will be pretty much 100 stocks at which point you may want to add in some actual bonds say a or 80/20 split depending on what you want   i 'm assuming you 're pretty young so you still have plenty of time to let the magic of compounding interest do its work even if you happen to get into the market right before it drops well that and the fact that you wo n't really have much invested anyway again let me stress that neither i nor anyone else has any way of knowing what will happen with the market i 'm just stating my opinion and what my course of action would be if i were in your shoes

because swing trading is n't the only reason to buy a stock and it 's not the only way to make money on a stock   i do not have the expertise to make advice one way or the other but i personally i feel swing trading is one of the worse ways to invest in the stock market to answer your specific questions in the previous post i outlined a naive trade intended to make $ 1,000 off a $ 10k buy but it was shown this would likely fail even if the stock price would have increased by 10 had i not placed the trade another way to state this is that my trade would disrupt the stock price and not in my favor at all so that means i 'd have to settle for a smaller trade if i bought $ 100 worth of the stock that size of a buy would n't be too disruptive i might succeed and get $ 10 out of the trade 10 of $ 100 but my trade fee was $ 8 or so to summarize you are completely correct that even hoping for gains of 10 on a consistent basis in other words after every single trade is totally unrealistic   you already seem to understand that swing trading on low volume stocks is pointless   but your last question was so how do people make any significant money trading low volume stocks if they even do i assume money is made since the stocks are bought and sold i have some guesses but i 'd like to hear from the experts and in a comment then if no one does make significant money trading these stocks what are they doing there on the market   the answer is that the buying and selling is mostly likely not by swing traders   it 's by investors that believe in the company   the company is on the market because the company believes public trading to be an advantageous position for them to receive capital investments and there are people out there who think that transaction makes sense   in other words real investing

last week i dropped and the screen on my nexus 4 for a quick replacement i bought a brand new unlocked moto e from amazon for $ 129 i forgot that google bought motorola until my new phone came and had a screen protector that had motorola a google company printed on it the phone is damn nice for a budget model as it 's unlocked does n't have any carrier and is running android 4.4 vanilla it even has gorilla glass what it 's missing is a front facing camera or a flash for the rear one but one thing i like better than my nexus is that it has a micro sd card slot so i was able to add 32 gb to the built in 4 gb overall it 's a really nice phone and for only $ 129 compares to the $ 400 i paid for the nexus 4 a year and a half ago i 'm quite pleased with it

sitting for the exam wo n't really make you stand out   if it was a choice between vs. and taking cfa l1 i suppose i would take the latter   but if it was a choice between cfa l1 and w/ internship or some experience i would choose the latter   so in other words it wo n't really open doors but it certainly wo n't hurt   only take it if it is what you want to do not to stand out   also most places care more about the letters cfa than actually taking the exam and they know you need 4 years qualifying work experience   so they do n't really care if you have taken it now or a year from now cause you wo n't be able to use those letters for four years anyway   anyway good luck on your job search

government purchases of mortgages simply transfers the debt burden from households to the sovereign taxes pay sovereign debt 65 of whom are homeowners anyway no debt has been restructured it 's now paid via taxes instead of monthly mortgage payments and those paying include persons who responsibly avoided housing speculation the u.s. has a debt to gdp ratio just shy of the critical point of 90 purchasing $ 10 trillion in mortgage debt about a year of gdp would put the u.s. on an path towards insolvency and inflation there are all sorts of other risks loss of a risk free asset moral hazard nationalization of the housing industry etc but this should make the point clear that it 's not a good idea there are only three ways to reduce debt 1 default 2 restructure or 3 lower the real debt burden by de valuing currency in which the debt is denominated

as i see it the two main considerations are   total amount of money received for which the key variable is life expectancy 0.8 = so at £ 86 week she would only be better off with the lump sum if she expected to live for less than years obviously none of us have a crystal ball but you could make some assessment based on her current health risk factors etc to see whether that seemed feasible also you do have to bear in mind that the value of £ 86 in 7 years time will be less than it is now but i guess the £ 86 would be inflation adjusted her need for income versus capital if she takes a lump sum and invests it in a house that is great but does n't provide any income at all if she has sufficient income from other sources and forecasts this other income to continue until her death then the lump sum might be more attractive but if not then she would need to be sure that she was n't tying up the money unnecessarily another option here would be using the lump sum to buy an annuity and it might be exploring this but i doubt whether the rates would be good enough to beat the £ 86 week she is being offered as an alternative another lesser consideration is her future entitlement to state funded care if needed in her later years if you have assets above a certain amount you are expected to fund your own care in which case having an expensive house might actually be more of a liability than a help

paying down your mortgage now will decrease the total cost of your home loan and the time period for which your loan lasts even if you trade up in that time period you will be that much closer to being free of house payments owning your home outright gives you a significant amount of freedom to consider less lucrative and more personally fulfilling career especially if your work environment becomes unpleasant it can also help you weather the storm of a job loss more easily though you should also build an emergency fund homes are depreciating illiquid assets with significant transaction fees it is wise to get a starter home that meets your current needs and move up to a home that better meets your needs as you mature however getting on the status treadmill and buying large homes that generally exceed the utility that you get out of them is expensive a poor investment and often impairs the ability to generate long term wealth

if the gratuity is a payment from your previous indian company made when you left them then the us tax system will treat it exactly the same as wages paid by your previous company whether or not you need to pay taxes on your wages and gratuity will depend on whether your are considered resident in the us for tax purposes for this financial year it is likely that you will be assuming you are then the us requires that you pay tax on all income wherever it is earned in the world you will need to fill in a tax return and declare both your gratuity and your wages in india for that year   india and the us have a double tax agreement which means essentially that you wo n't be taxed twice if you have already paid tax on the gratuity and wages in india but you do have to declare them

i think your question might be coming from a misunderstanding of how corporate structures work specifically that a corporation is a legal entity sort of like a person that can have its own assets and debts to make it clear let 's look at your example we have two founders albert and brian and they start a corporation called corptech when they start the company it has no assets just like you would if you owned nothing and had no bank account in order to do anything corptech is going to need some money so albert and brian give it some they can give it as much as they want they can give it property if they want too usually people do n't just put money into a corporation without some sort of agreement in place though in most cases the agreement says something like each member will own a fraction of the company that is in proportion to this initial investment the way that is done varies depending on the type of corporation but in general if albert ends up owning 75 and brian ends up owning 25 then they probably valued their contributions at 75 and 25 of the total value these contributions do n't have to be money or property though they could just be general know how or connections or an expectation that they will do some work the important thing is that they agree on the value of these contributions and assign ownership of the company according to that agreement if they do n't have an agreement then the laws of the state that the company is registered in will say how the ownership is assigned now what ownership means can be different depending on the context when it comes to decision making you could own one percentage of the company in terms of votes but when it comes to shares of future profits you could own a different amount this is why you can have voting and non voting versions of a company 's stock for example so this is a critical point the ownership of a company is independent of the individual contributions to the company the next part of your question is related to this what happens when corptech sees an opportunity to make an investment if it has enough cash on hand because of the initial investment or through financing or reinvested profits then the decision to make the investment is made according to albert and brian 's ownership agreement and they spend it the money does n't belong to them individually anymore it belongs to corptech and so corptech is spending it they are just making the decision for corptech to spend it this is why people say the owners are not financially liable beyond their initial investment if the deal is bad and they lose the money the most they can lose is what they initially put in on the other hand if corptech does n't have the money then they have to figure out a way to get it they might decide to each put in an amount in proportion to their ownership so that their stake does n't change or albert might agree to finance the deal 100 in exchange for a larger share of ownership or he could agree to fund all of it without a larger stake because brian is the one who set the deal up or they might take out a loan and not need to invest any new money or they might find an investor who agrees to put in the needed money in exchange for a a 51 share in which case albert and brian will have to figure out how to split the remaining 49 if they agree to the deal the details of how all of this would work depend on the structure llc llp c corp s corp etc but in general the idea is that the company has assets and debts and the owners can have voting rights equity rights and rights to future profits in any type of split that they want regardless of what the companies assets and debts are or what their initial investment was

yes it is possible to withdraw money from your roth ira before retirement but i would n't necessarily advise you to do so   here 's the good news and the bad news the good news unlike a traditional ira money contributed to a roth ira is done so on an after tax basis meaning you do n't benefit from a tax deduction on contributions so the money you withdraw from your roth ira will not be taxed entirely as ordinary income in fact you are allowed to withdraw the amount of your original contributions also known as basis without any taxes or penalties let 's imagine you originally deposited $ 9000 of that current $ 10 k total value then in such a case $ 9000 could be withdrawn tax and penalty free the bad news when it comes to the investment earnings the other $ 1000 in my example   it 's a different story   since you would n't be age 59 1/2 at the time of withdrawal any money taken out beyond your original contributions would be considered a non qualified withdrawal and subject to both ordinary income taxes plus a 10 early withdrawal penalty   ouch perhaps you might want to restrict your withdrawal to your original contributions   i would imagine if you 've had the account for such a short period of time that much or all of your account value is original contributions anyway a good article about the rules for early ira withdrawals is about.com 's tax penalty for early distribution of retirement funds note if your roth ira funds were the result of a rollover from another account type other rules may apply see roth ira wikipedia for more detail search for rollover regarding the withdrawal process itself and the timing you should check with your account custodian on how to proceed

first of all many employees past a few years in particular are always looking for new jobs it 's how they make sure that they 're always getting the best value for their services this is doubly true for star employees   i do n't know if this is some cultural thing but i can tell you my own experience as an employer of roughly 40 people in sweden over the last half decade the business is web development my take from this is that    1 people who are about to leave do worse work   2 people who are about to leave act differently   i just do n't agree with in any way in fact quite the contrary people who have left my employment have done better in the last 3 4 months than they have before just so that they can 1 get a good reference letter and 2 leave my employment on good standing so that noone feels rational intelligent people do not burn bridges they build networks   people who are looking for other jobs act just like they always do all the ideas for behavioural change presented in this are completely circumstantial    in my experience the best way to identify employees who are very close to leaving or seriously considering it is listening to what they have to say they 'll make sure new messages get through such as this job is n't challenging enough or i 'm not having fun if they don't make those messages and still leave it means they did n't think you would be able to change those circumstances but of course that is more or less equity wiki in practice edit just to be clear the point i 'm trying to make here is that star employees have no problems their with current affairs   edited out some details that could be used to identify the business

gt;we were on the gold standard in name only since about 1910   there a few nuances behind the gold standard but all revolve around indebtedness and currency devaluation    the us actually started off in with a silver standard by the turn of the 18th century there was a fixed ratio of silver and gold to dollars silver was not required to back all of the currency gold was used as well    this bi metallic standard continued until gold and silver were legal tender    the us treasury was on a strict hard money standard doing business in only gold and silver until which the federal government from the banking system it was only after this move the federal government started the devaluation of silver in order to borrow from england silver came in gold came out this also largely the gold rush    then in the us started reducing the weight of silver coins in banks suspended payment in silver   but the basic weakness in a gold standard started with government wanting to manipulate value to unfairly skew debt loan situations    gt;there was not enough gold to remotely back the us currency   this is not true us currency did just fine and as governments print so too do prices go up so if there is only 50 billion currency units in and eggs cost 10 cents as they did for previous decades when the federal government prints its way to trillions that s where we end up with eggs costing 2 3 bucks that 's why your grandparents house cost 6,000 and ones today cost 600,000    gt;which is why during the great depression when people started wanting to turn their cash back in to gold there was no enough   no they turned back to gold because of the devaluation of the dollar if the dollar was falling as it is today why would you want to keep your assets in dollars gold can not be printed at whim this is one of the most important factors it forces government to be much more strict with debt if taxpayers were faced with higher taxes or devaluation to pay for the current iraq wars would it have happened no but since the government could print money at whim it served as an invisible tax    gt;and gold possession had to be outlawed    it was outlawed because as the dollar plummeted and gold was eventually made illegal the value of gold doubled and rapidly increased overnight this happened again in 1970 when nixon took us off the gold standard gold was made illegal to prevent hoarders and you make it sound like gold redemption is a bad thing when really its the government being naughty and citizens simply playing the game and by the rules set up by the government    gt;so no we were not on a gold standard   yeah i never said we were but there is a very important   reason we once were so government could nt devalue currency to rack up more debt a huge issue that has now played out to its logical conclusion maximum indebtedness mixed with massive mechanisms for manipulation   when you 're on a any fixed item standard your economy only can grow at roughly the rate you fond more of the fixed item    is that why the us did just fine between and 1913 over a hundred years the cost of many items was stable for decades nowadays we have a doubling effect with cars costing 4,000 in 1970 26,000 in 2000 45,000 in 2012 the same with houses food education medical services you name it   gt;there are many reasons for this and it is partially why for thousands of years of various gold standard there was so little economic growth once countries stopped limiting the amount of total economic growth to the amount of gold they could dig up that economies were able to grow at the sustained rate they have for the past years   wrong again this is because of productivity from technology and invention oil electricity automobiles airplanes and eventually computers infact as i said above fiat currency actually kills productivity    its hard to compare the turn of the century but we can see what happened after nixon took us off the gold standard here      as soon as the usa left the gold exchange standard   total factor productivity began to dramatically stagnate   the gold exchange standard was a free lunch for policymakers gdp growth could be achieved without any real gains in productivity or efficiency or in infrastructure but instead by just pumping money into the system   the gold exchange standard was a free lunch for businesses revenue growth could be achieved without any real gains in productivity or efficiency   gt;so besides the fact that the us has not in modern history been backed by gold despite the name there is ample evidence from hundreds of economies and thousands of years that being on a gold standard = little or no economic growth   since nixon took us off the gold standard in terms of dollar connection in anyway to gold the value of the dollar has plummeted 70 its over 95 if you go back to the early 1900s and currency debasement    there was plenty of economic growth while we were on the gold standard and to say otherwise is simply false

in a money market fund one share is worth $ 1 for your fund you 'll earn $ a year per share or 0.10   that is all that you will earn the apy is just another number to represent this interest rate not a separate income stream if you were expecting extra money from a separately credited dividend you were mistaken usually the apy is a slightly different number than the interest rate to reflect the way that the interest is compounded over the course of the year in this case the compounding is too slight to notice with just 2 decimal places if you were investing in a regular savings account you would see the rate you are paid expressed as an apy also but not as a dividend as no shares are involved and use that number to compare the two if you were buying a bond fund or stock fund that did not have a fixed price you could calculate the dividend yield based on the current stock price but you would not probably see an apy listed money market funds are kind of an odd hybrid of fund and savings so they list both

the rent versus buy question is a deeply personal one in which your personal desires for a living space need to be carefully combined with what makes economic sense   do you want your own place with all the of having it be yours and all the pains of having to handle all the maintenance and be the one ultimately responsible   have you tried living for a few months putting aside the amount required for not only a mortgage payment but the taxes and insurance on a house condo in your price range to see if you can really afford it   you can use a real estate website such as to see the assessments of some for sale homes and figure out tax values   the average home insurance in the us is around $ if i remember right more for homes that are more expensive and less for less expensive ones with flooding and other hazards as a factor   make sure you can afford to pay for all these items from a financial perspective realize that you 'll always be spending money on your living space   even if you pay for a house with cash you will be paying property tax and maintenance and would be wise to continue paying for insurance   the value of the house at that point is as contributor fennec often says the rent you are n't paying i personally do n't recommend trying to time the market   you ca n't predict the future will real estate in your area be a double dip or has it bottomed and is it going up   what you can do is buy a home only when you are sure that you can deal with its relative lack of liquidity by staying there for a long time   five years is usually a reasonable minimum    there is a way that i recommend figuring out if it is likely bad financial decision to buy and that 's by looking at a financial comparison of renting versus buying   in some cases even with the bursting of the bubble it is still a bad deal to buy   dc went from renting being more cost effective to buying but san francisco is one area where buying is still not necessarily the best choice   to figure out what the case is for your area look at the new york times rent versus buy calculator   find a home for rent on craigslist similar to what you 'd look to buy   find a home for sale on one of the mls aggregator sites that represents something you think you 'd like   plug in the numbers   figure out how many years you 'd have to stay in your purchase for it to be a good deal in the likely event that the calculator says buy start saving if that 's what you really want   you 're never going to be able to absolutely guarantee that you wo n't be upside down   what you can control is getting as much principal in that house as you can   the more you have the less likely you will be upside down   build a down payment now reap the rewards later

your questions in the world of technical analysis is candlestick charting an effective trading tool in timing the markets it depends on how you define effective but as a standalone and systematic strategy it tends not to be profitable see for example market timing with candlestick technical analysis using robust statistical techniques we find that candlestick trading rules are not profitable when applied to djia component stocks over period neither bullish or bearish candlestick single lines or patterns provide market timing signals that are any better than what would be expected by chance basing ones trading decisions solely on these techniques does not seem sensible but we can not rule out the possibility that they compliment some other market timing techniques there are many other papers that come to the same conclusion if used correctly how accurate can they be in picking turning points in the market technical analysts generally fall into two camps i those that argue that ta ca n't be fully automated and that interpretation is part of the game ii those that use ta as part of a systematic investment model automatically executed by a machine but generally use a combination of indicators to build a working model both groups would argue for different reasons that the conclusions of the paper i quoted above should be disregarded and that ta can be applied profitably with the proper framework psychological biases it is very easy to get impressed by technical analysis because we all suffer from confirmation bias whereby we tend to acknowledge things that confirm our beliefs more than those that contradict them when looking at a chart it is very easy to see all the when a certain pattern worked and miss the when it did not work and not missing those is much harder than it sounds conclusions

this is a really interesting question and something a lot of work is being done to understand   i 'm going to look at the closely related question do non market cap etf weighting methods consistently outperform once you take into account their investment biases let 's use revenue weighting as a reason why investment biases are so important   in revenue weighting you would own almost no fast growing tech companies as they generally have little revenue    this sounds great if we are talking about say pets.com in the late 90s but you also would miss most of the rise of google to believe in these etfs consistently outperform adjusted for risk you would have to have a strong reason to believe that earnings sales or dividends are a better predictor of company value than market value   market analysts include the above three metrics and many more when pricing stocks so out performance using only one of the above metrics seems unlikely there is one caveat to this and that is value and small cap stocks have been shown to give slightly better risk adjusted returns in the very long run see fama french and many of these alternative weighting methods will have a value or small cap bias   first it is unclear if this out performance will continue now that it is more widely known   second even if you believe this will continue you can more easily and cheaply get this bias though value small cap etfs than these weighting schemes in the end the only thing that is perfectly clear is that higher fee investments will generally under perform

i was n't 100 on which columns of the scale you were referring to but think i captured the correct ones in this comparison using the scale for ba and ma ma scale starting 2 years later with decreased income reflected for first two years applying a 1 cost of living increase each year to the scale or to prior year after the scale maxes out and assuming you borrow 40k and repay years 3 10 then the difference and cumulative difference between each scenario   so it would be about 16 years to start coming out ahead but this does n't account for the tax deduction of student loan interest some things in favor of borrowing for a ma there are loan forgiveness programs for teachers you might only make of minimum payments before having the remainder forgiven if you qualify for one of those programs not sure how retirement works for teachers in wa but in some states you can get close to your maximum salary each year in retirement additionally you can deduct student loan interest without itemizing your tax return so that helps with the cost of the debt edit i used a simple student loan calculator if you financed the full 40k at 6 you 'd be looking at $ monthly payments for 10 years or $ not calculating the tax deduction for loan interest

disclaimer i am not an attorney and i have not 100 researched the law take any advise from an online forum with a grain of salt please consult an attorney tax specialist or the irs directly for any concrete answers afaik there is n't anything that would prevent you from starting a business simply owing back taxes should n't make a difference on how you make money whether that is working for yourself or someone else all the irs is concerned about at this point is that you still owe them when going through the process of forming an llc a couple of years back i do n't recall any personal tax information being brought up except when we were discussing possible loan options regarding loan options one important issue you may come into is if the irs has filed a lien against you a federal tax lien is the government ’s legal claim against your property when you neglect or fail to pay a tax debt the lien protects the government ’s interest in all your property including real estate personal property and financial assets a lien will exist on your credit report for 7 years after it is released the irs releases your lien within 30 days after you have paid your tax debt with a lien it will be very difficult to get a loan or other financing for your small business if this ends up being the case you can try to get a discharge or subordination on specific property that would allow lenders a claim on your property ahead of the irs otherwise you may find yourself relying solely on what money you currently have a big point is the irs 's threshold on filing a lien is $ 10,000 the fresh start initiative increased the irs notice of federal tax lien filing threshold from $ 5,000 to $ 10,000 however notices of federal tax liens may still be filed on amounts less than $ 10,000 when circumstances warrant since you currently owe over the past 3 years it is possible that adding another year in back taxes will cause the irs to file a lien if they have not yet already done so so it may be something to keep an eye on if you do plan on taking out a loan for your business

bad areas are tough to value as a owner occupied property because the business model for being a slumlord is to rent apartments in usually to tenants receiving goverment subsidies such as section 8 vouchers the vouchers are based on a prevailing rent which are often on par with nice suburban apartment complexes due to how that prevailing rate is calculated so the value of the house is really an annuity calculation you figure out the potential rental cash flow and apply whatever your local market premium is the point is doing an apples to apples comparison is going to be tough and justifying the cost of repairs that are n't health and safety issues probably wo n't be recoverable from a home valuation standpoint a buyer would probably rip out your central air conditioner and sell it if i were in your shoes i 'd look at the time horizon that you think you 're going to be there and amortize the cost over that period assuming your mortgage is small and you 're staying for about 5 years spending $ 10k costs you about $ 170 a month your reward is a modern a c and heating system compare that cost to the cost of moving and your desires and see if it 's worth it to you

as others have said it depends entirely on what benefits are provided and how much of the cost of those benefits is paid by the employer and how much is paid by the employee and compare that to what it would cost to obtain the necessary equivalent coverage without employer assistance in my case my employer pays more than $ 10,000 per year toward the cost of medical dental vision disability and life insurance for myself and my family that 's almost 20 of the average total household income in my state so it is not an insignificant amount at all

your question is rather direct but i think there is some underlying issues that are worth addressing   one how to save and purchase ~$500 worth items this one is the easy one since we confront it often enough   never ever ever buy anything on credit the only exception might be your first house but that 's it simply redirect the money you would spend in non necessities pleasure and entertainment to your big purchase fund the ps4 in this case when you get the target amount simply purchase it   when you get your salary use it to pay for the monthly actual necessities rent groceries etc and go through the list the money flow should be like this two how to evaluate if a purchase is appropriate it seems that you may be reluctant to spend a rather amount of money on a single item let me try to you expensive is not defined by price alone but by utility to compare the price of items you should take into account their utility let 's compare your prized ps4 to a soda can   is a soda can expensive it your thirst and fills you with sugar tap water will take your thirst away without damaging your health and for a fraction of the price so yes soda is ridiculously expensive whenever water is available is a game console expensive sure but it all boils down to how much do you end up using it if you are sure you will end up playing for years to come then it 's probably good value for your money   an example of   wrongly spent money on entertainment my friends and i went to the cinema to see a movie without checking the reviews beforehand   it was so awful that it hurt even with the discount price we got ultimately we all ended up remembering that time and laughing about how wrong it went so it was somehow well spent since i got a nice memory from that evening   a purchase is appropriate if you get your money 's worth of utility pleasure three console and computer gaming and of the latter there are few arguments for buying a console instead of upgrading your current computer if needed except for playing console it seems unlikely that a handful of exclusive games can justify purchasing a non platform unless you can actually get many hours from said games   previous arguments to prefer consoles instead of computers are that they work out of the box capability to easily connect to the tv controller support have been superseded by now besides pc games can usually be acquired for a lower price through frequent sales more about personal finance and investment

the net return reported to you as a percentage by a mutual fund is the gross return minus the expense ratio   so if the gross return is x% and the expense ratio is y% your account will show a return of x   be aware that x could be negative too so with y = 1 if x = 10 as you might get from a stock fund if you believe historical averages will continue then the net return is 9 and you have lost y x times 100 = 10 of the gross return if x = 8 as you might get from a bond fund if you believe historical averages will continue then the net return is 7 and you have lost y x times 100 = 12.5 of the gross return and so on and so forth   the numbers used are merely examples of the returns that have been obtained historically though it is worth emphasizing that 10 is an average return averaged over many decades from investments in stocks and to believe that one will get a 10 return year after year is to mislead oneself very badly i think the point of the is that expense ratios are important and should matter a lot to you but that their impact is proportionately somewhat less if the gross return   is high but very significant if the gross return is low as   in money market funds   in fact some money market funds which   found that x < y have even foregone charging the expense ratio   fee so as to maintain a fixed $ 1 per share price   personally   i would need a lot of to invest in even a stock fund with 1 expense ratio

at your age i do n't think its a bad idea to invest entirely in stocks the concern with stocks is their volatility and at 40 + years from retirement volatility does not concern you just remember that if you ever want to call upon your 401(k for anything other than retirement such as a down payment on a home which is a qualified distribution that is not subject to early distribution penalties then you should reconsider your retirement allocations i would not invest 100 into stocks if i knew i were going to buy a house in five years and needed that money for a down payment if your truly saving strictly for a retirement that could occur forty years in the future first good for you and second put it all in an index fund an s&p index has a ridiculously low expense ratio and with so many years away from retirement it gives you an immense amount of flexibility to choose what to do with those funds as your retirement date approaches closer every year

most articles on investing recommend that investors that are just starting out to invest in index stock or bonds funds   this is the easiest way to get rolling and limit risk by investing in bonds and stocks and not either one of the asset classes alone    when you start to look deeper into investing there are so many options small cap large cap technical analysis fundamental analysis option strategies and on and on   this can end up being a full time job or chewing into a lot of personal time   it is a great challenge to learn various investment strategies frankly for the average person that works full time it is a huge effort   i would recommend also reading the intelligent asset allocator to get a wider perspective on how asset allocation can help grow a portfolio and reduce risk   this book covers a simple process

this is either laundering money or laundering non money   all the other answers point out how a cheque or bank transfer will take days to actually clear   that is a red herring there are lots of ways to illegally transfer real money out of existing accounts   stolen cheque books stolen banking details partly in connection with stolen smartphones and credit cards and cards money transfers from other people duped in a similar manner as you are it is much easier to steal money than invent it and it takes quite longer until stolen rather than invented money will blow up at the banks all of those payments will likely properly clear but not leave you in actual legal possession of money   people will notice the missing money and notify police and banks and you will be on the hook for paying back all of it cheques and transfers from non existing accounts in contrast tend to blow up very fast and thus are less viable for this kind of scam as the time window for operating the scam is rather small whether or not the cheque actually clears is about as relevant of whether or not the rolls royce you are buying for $ 500 because the owner has an toe nail and can not press down the accelerator any more has four wheels better hope for the rolls to be imaginary because then you 'll only be out of $ 500 and that 's the end of it   if it is real your trouble is only starting

what littleadv said is correct   his worth is based on the presumed worth of the total company value which is much greater than all investment dollars combined because of valuation in other words his worth is based on the potential return for his share of ownership at a rate based on the latest valuation of the company he is worth $ 17.5 billion today but the total funding for facebook is only $ 2.4 billion i do n't understand this in private companies valuations typically come from either speculation analysts or from investments   investment valuations are the better gauge because actual money traded hands for a percentage ownership however just as with public companies on the stock market there are at least two caveats just because someone else sold their shares at a given rate does n't mean that rate in both cases it 's possible the value may be much lower or much higher   some high value purchases surprise for how high they are such as microsoft 's acquisition of skype for $ 8.5 billion the formula for one owner 's worth based on a given acquisition is valuation = acquisition amount acquisition percent worth = owner 's percent × valuation according to wikipedia zuckerberg owns 24   in january goldman 's invested $ 500 million at a $ 50 billion valuation that is the latest investment and puts zuckerberg 's worth at $ 12 billion however some speculation places a facebook ipo at a much higher valuation such as as $ 100 billion   i do n't know what your reference is for $ 17 billion but it puts their valuation at $ billion between the january goldman valuation and current ipo speculation for instance originally invested $ 10,000 which at his estimated 5 ownership would now be worth $ 3 5 billion

i 'm also a uk ltd company contractor that has the same topic i afraid however that i do n't understand the maths in the original question mortgage interest is flat for the term of the mortgage rather than compounded so ignoring the at the end of the lifespan of the mortgage i get the amount of interest to something like £ 7500 x 0.05 x 25 does this make the decision any easier for you as you point out the total cost of this overpayment from your company account is £ 12,500 using the above figure it would take over 13 years to recoup the £ 5,000 difference at £ 375 interest a year   i used to be of the same opinion that the mortgage should be paid off at all costs first but now i 'm coming round to the american way of thinking £ 12,500 invested in a pension with a 5 yield will easily outstrip the interest saved by making the over payment x 1.05 ^ 25 = £ over 250 better off £ £ + £ 7,500 i now make no mortgage overpayments at all and instead pay all the money into my pension this amongst other things keeps me below the upper earnings tax threshold so i 'm only paying corporation tax for the money i 'm drawing as dividends there 's a massive caveat to this though i 'm 49 i should be able to draw the tax free element of my pension pot in six years time and pay my mortgage off and it 's quite unlikely that the government will be changing pensions policy in that time but drawing 25 tax free has been a feature of pensions for quite some time i can then chose to keep working or retire if my pension is still doing well 9 ish pa at the moment i could chose to not pay my mortgage off at all in the next twenty or so years however all this could change in your position i would do a bit of both make a regular overpayment to pay down your mortgage even a small amount that you 'll barely notice will make quite a difference to the end date of your mortgage £ 100 a month will take years off i did n't start paying properly into my pension until fairly recently and so if you 're not already i 'd also make quite substantial regular payments into one now directly from your company 15 17.5 of your gross drawings leaving it until later will only make it more painful then when you get to retirement age no matter what you 'll have a decent pension pot an actuary i worked with pointed out that if you pay something into a pension when you retire you should have some sort of pot if you pay nothing you are absolutely guaranteed to have nothing and finally if you have n't already fix your mortgage we 're three years into a five year fix the variable rate we were going to be transferred to was we fixed not because of wanting any sense of security but because the fixed rate was with no fee there are much better rates than that about now rates are starting to rise so it 's a good time

here are the risks involved with student loans so what happens if you decide or are forced not to finish school 50 of students do n't   you have no degree to boost income but still have the debt    what happens when you graduate and want to use that saved cash buy a house car etc and treat the student loans as a monthly bill   the next thing you know you 're loan poor and are struggling to make your monthly payments just like most other normal people you are n't going to earn significant interest on your cash while you 're in college and it will not outpace inflation and there 's significant risk of your college savings losing money if they 're not in risk free investments so it would not be wise to take out student loans when you have the means to cash flow it also student loans generally charge a roughly 1 fee so that actually negates the interest you earn in your savings account plus you already have money in a 529 plan that is meant for college expenses and can not be used to pay student loans use that money for what it 's for

as others have mentioned it 's important that there is a fair assessment of the market value of the items being donated   joel 's point about the government not looking kindly upon overvalued donations also applies in canada the cra does n't look kindly upon donation schemes such as buy low donate high arrangements since nobody has offered up authoritative information for canada yet here 's something to look at excerpts 3 gifts in kind of a taxpayer    include capital property depreciable    property personal use property    6 the fair market value of a gift in    kind as of the date of the donation    the date on which beneficial    ownership is transferred from the    donor to the donee must be determined    before an amount can be recorded on a    receipt for tax purposes   the    person who determines the fair market    value of the property must be    competent and qualified to evaluate    the particular property being    transferred by way of a gift property    of little or only nominal value to the    donor will not qualify as a gift in    kind used clothing of little value    would be an example of a    non qualifying contribution you will need to find a charity that would both value the books you would be donating and be willing to issue you a receipt for your charitable donation   whatever receipt they issue should be in line with fair market value of the goods donated   assume your donation receipt will be challenged and keep both finally reasonable comparables might be prices for similar used goods not a percentage of new   though if you ca n't find a price for a particular title in the used market an estimate consistent with other valuations in the lot would be better than nothing perhaps

in short pun intended the shareholder lending the shares does not believe that the shares will fall even though the potential investor does the shareholder believes that the shares will rise because the two individuals believe that a different outcome will occur they are able to make a trade by using the available data in the market they have arrived at a particular conclusion of the fair price for the trade but each individual wants to be on the other side of it consider a simpler form of your question why would a shareholder agree to sell his her shares why do n't they just wait to sell when the price is higher after all that is why the buyer wants to purchase the shares on review i realize i 've only stated here why the original shareholder would n't simply sell and rebuy the share themselves because they have a different view of the market as to why they would actually allow the trade to occur and other answers point out that the shares being lent are compensated for by an initial fee on the transaction + the chance for interest during the period that the shares are owed for

the article best stock fund of the decade focus from the wall street journal in 2009 describe the highest performing mutual fund in the usa between 2000 and 2009 the investor return in the fund what the shareholders actually earned was abysmal why because the fund was so volatile that investors panicked and bailed out locking in losses instead of waiting them out the reality is that almost any strategy will lead to success in investing so long as it is actually followed a strategy keeps you from making emotional or knee jerk decisions btw beware of anyone selling you a strategy by telling you that everyone in the world is a failure except for the few special people who have the privilege of knowing their secrets link removed as it 's gone dead

lets imagine two scenarios 1 you make 40 of total income yearly contributions to a savings account that earns 1 interest for 10 years in this scenario you put in and earned in interest for a total of 2 you make the same yearly contribution to an index fund that earns 7 on average for 10 years in this scenario you put in the same but earned in interest for a total of the main advantage is option 1 has more liquidity you can get the money out faster option 2 requires time to divest any stocks bonds so you need enough savings to get you through that period imagine another two scenarios where you stop earning income you stop working and have only your principal amount in a 1 savings account if you withdraw yearly for your current cost of living you will run through your savings in 7 years you stop working and have only 20k 2 years of savings in savings that earns 1 with in stocks that earns 7 if you withdraw your cost of living currently at you will run through your investments in 15 years and your savings in 2 years for a total of 17 years the two years of income in savings is extremely generous for how long it starts the process   in summary invest your money it was n't specified what currency we are talking about but you can easily find access to an investment company no matter where you are in the world keep a small amount for a rainy day

get fucked with that idiocy mate you can cut the data seven ways to sunday    absolutely confirm they believe america is the land of opportunity and that people should have equal opportunity if they have the skills said elliott research officer for the pew charitable economic mobility project in an interview the data fly in the face of what americans have believed and what they say they believe in our polling work    found that economic mobility is largely an accident of birth points to the fact that 66 percent of people born in the lowest two income levels remain there as adults and exactly 66 percent of people born at the highest two income levels stay there as adults a phenomenon called at the ends    gt;in particular previous analyses of economic mobility in the united states and other industrialized nations reveal that the united states has less not more mobility than its northern neighbor that is one 's family economic background is more likely to influence one 's economic outcomes in the united states than in canada   gt;one way to think of the estimated elasticity of children ’s income with respect to their is to ask how much of a given income advantage observed in the parental generation is preserved in the children ’s generation miles this for the difference observed in the united states for families with children under the age of the top fifth of such families have about 12 times as much income as the bottom fifth if the persistence of income was equal to one that income advantage would be transferred in whole to the next generation that is the children of the richest fifth would have 12 times as much income as the children of the poorest fifth if the of income were equal to zero none of that advantage would be present among the children of these groups reported that u.s. estimates of the elasticity vary in the range of corresponding to an inherited income advantage of between and for the richest fifth compared to the poorest fifth elasticity at these levels means that the children whose parents were among the richest fifth i.e. parents whose income was 12 times that of the poorest fifth grow up to earn about 3 to 4 times as much as the children whose parents were among the poorest fifth thus their income advantage was roughly half that of their parents      all you logic 100 students can go fuck a duck with your idiocy

i am currently trying out some variations moving terms around of the formula for the present value of money the relationship between yield and price is much simpler than that if you pay £ 1015 for a bond and its current yield is 4.69 that means you will receive in income each year 4.69 £ 1015 = £ the income from the bond is defined by its coupon rate and its face value not the market value so that bond will continue to pay £ each year regardless of the market price the market price will go up or down according to the market as a whole and the credit rating of the issuer   if the issuer is likely to default the market price goes down and the yield goes up if similar companies start offering bonds with higher yields the market price goes down to make the bond competitive in the market again raising yield so if the yield goes up to 4.87 what is the price such that 4.87 of that price is £ £ 4.87 = £ another way to think of it if the yield goes up from 4.69 to 4.87 then yield has increased by a factor of 4.87 4.69 = consequently market price must decrease by the same factor £ 1015 = £

some details in case you are interested being a defined benefit kind of pension plan the formula for your social security benefits is n't tied directly to fica contributions and i 'm not aware of any calculator that performs an roi based on fica contributions rather how much you 'll get in retirement is based on your average indexed monthly earnings   here 's some information on the social security calculation from the social security administration primary insurance amount for an individual who first becomes eligible for old age insurance    benefits or disability insurance benefits in 2013 or who dies in 2013    before becoming eligible for benefits his her will be the sum of        a 90 percent of the first $ of his her average indexed monthly earnings plus        b 32 percent of his her average indexed monthly earnings over $ and through $ plus        c 15 percent of his her average indexed monthly earnings over $ here 's an example   of course to calculate a benefit in the future you 'll need to calculate projected average indexed monthly earnings more details here   you 'll also need to make assumptions about what those bend points might be in the future   the average wage indexing values for calculating the are available from the social security administration 's site but future indexing values will also need to be projected based on an assumption about their inflation   you 'll also need to project the contribution and benefit base which limits the earnings used to calculate contributions and benefits also the calculation assumes benefits are taken at the normal retirement age   calculating an early or late retirement factor is required to adjust benefits for another age   then whatever benefits you get will increase each year because the benefit is increased based on annual changes in the cost of living performing the series of calculations by hand is n't my idea of fun but implementing it as a spreadsheet or a web page and adding in some roi based on fica contributions calculations might be an interesting exercise if you are so inclined for completeness sake i 'll mention that the ssa also provides source code for a social security benefit calculator

both of the other answers are correct and good answers but i think neither directly answers your question no you do not need to pay additional taxes on the wedding gifts simply because of the fact that they are going into a roth ira   similarly if you put them into a traditional ira that amount would be deductible assuming you met the other criteria including minimums and maximums of earned income in both cases   the act of putting money into a roth ira is not what makes it taxable its original source is   roth simply does not reduce your current taxes any whereas a traditional ira would the seeming exception to this is when rolling money from a tax deductible source to a non tax deductible destination such as transferring money from a traditional ira or 401(k to a roth ira or 401(k   then the taxable event is really the distribution from the traditional ira or 401(k not the deposit into a roth ira or 401(k though of course if you rolled a 401(k over to a traditional ira it would not be taxable

just a thought because this is a really good question would the buying and selling of blockchain based digital currency    using other blockchain based digital currencies be subject to like    kind treatment and exempt from capital gains until exchanged for a    non blockchain based good or service or national currency suppose someone sells 1 bitcoin to buy 100 monero   monero 's price and bitcoin 's price then change to where the 100 monero are 3 bitcoins   the person gets their bitcoin back and has monero remaining this scenario could be suppose someone sells 1 bitcoin at $ 1000 to buy 100 monero at $ 10   bitcoin crashes 80 to $ 200 while monero crashes to only $ 6 per monero   $ 6 times 100 is $ 600 and if the person gets their bitcoin back at $ 200 per they still lost money when measured in us dollars if they move that bitcoin back to us dollars in reading the irs on bitcoin they only care about the us dollar value of bitcoin or monero and in this example the us dollar value is less   the person may have more bitcoins but they still lost money if they sell

one broker told me that i have to simply read the ask size and the bid size seeing what the market makers are offering this implies that my order would have to match that price exactly which is unfortunate because options contract spreads can be wide also if my planned position size is larger than the best bid best ask then i should break up the order which is also unfortunate because most brokers charge a lot for options orders

in its basic form a corporation is a type of privileged democracy instead of every citizen having a vote votes are allocated on the basis of share ownership in the most basic form each share you own gives you 1 vote in most public companies very few shareholders vote because their vote is statistically meaningless and they have no particular insight into what they want in their board this means that often the board is voted in by a ie of shareholders who are actually large institutions like investment firms or pension funds which own many shares of the company now what do shareholders actually vote on you vote to elect individuals to be members of the board of directors bod the bod is basically an overarching committee that theoretically the company in whatever way they feel best represents the shareholders because if they do not represent the shareholders they will get voted out at the next shareholder meeting the board members are typically senior individuals with experience in either that industry or a relevant one ie someone who was a top lawyer may sit on the bod and be a member of some type of legal issues committee these positions typically pay some amount of money but often they are seen as a form of high prestige for someone nearing after retirement it is not typically a full time job it will typically pay far far less than the role of ceo at the same company   the bod meets periodically to discuss issues regarding the health of the company their responsibility is to act in the interests of the shareholders but they themselves do not necessarily own shares in the company often the bod is broken up into several committees such as an investment committee which reviews and approves large scale projects a finance committee which reviews and approves large financial decisions such as how to get funding an audit committee which reviews the results of financial statements alongside the external accountants who audit them etc but arguably the main role of the bod is to hire the chief executive officer and possibly other high level individuals typically referred to as the c suite executives ie chief financial officer chief operating officer etc the ceo is the big cheese who then typically has authority to rule everyone below him her typically there are things that the big cheese can not do without approval from the board like start huge investment projects requiring a lot of spending   so the shareholders own the company and are therefore entitled to receive all the dividends from profits the company earns and members of the board of directors the bod oversees the company on the shareholders behalf and the ceo acts based on the wishes of the bod which hires him her so how do you get to be a member of the board or the ceo you become a superstar in your industry and go through a similar process as getting any other job you network you make contacts you apply you defend yourself in interviews the shareholders will elect a board who acts in their interests and the board will hire a ceo that they feel can carry out those interests if you hold a majority of the shares in a company you could elect enough board members that you could control the bod and you could then be guaranteed to be hired as the ceo if you own say 10 of the shares you will likely be able to elect a few people to the board but maybe not enough to be hired by the board as the ceo   short of owning a huge amount of a company therefore share ownership will not get you any closer to being the ceo

slightly off topic i wondered what inflation has been like since 1850   the fed says the current dollar is worth 28 times less than the 1850 dollar   this seems low   the 1850 dollar contained of an ounce of gold which sells at $ 65    today   so the current dollar is actually worth 65 times less another way of looking at this is by salaries   most jobs have changed too much but a grunt in the us army is essentially the same a private in 1850 made $ and in 2017 it 's $ so a dollar is worth 121 times less today     i have a hard time believing the fed 's figure when it seems like inflation is two to four times more

rent does n't give you any ownership in a property so is largely irrelevant here if you were paying rent after the death of your parents that money would go to the owners of the house which may include you similarly whether or not someone was evicted is completely irrelevant if the will specifies how the estate should be divided that 's what 's relevant here you seem to imply that the house was left to 10 people barring specific other arrangements the most likely case is that the house will be sold by the and the proceeds divided evenly between all ten people again though it 's going to depend on the specifics of the will there are many possible cases where you may end up with nothing for example if there are a lot of debts these must be paid off before dividing up the money from the sale of the house if you are not getting the answers you need from the you need to consult a lawyer

so much bullshit in this article   gt;in fact libertarian writer charles murray once estimated that providing all americans over the age of 21 with a monthly check for $ 13,000 $ 3,000 of which would fund their healthcare would not only be sufficient enough to provide for their basic needs and help raise the poorest among them above the poverty line but would also be less expensive than our current welfare state which includes agricultural and corporate subsidies   there are 325 million americans 73 are over 21 so that leaves 237 million about 1 of adults are so were left with about 235 million if you gave each one $ 13,000 that would cost $ 3 trillion or basically the entire federal budget but wait that 's a per month figure per annum that would cost $ 36 trillion   please quit shit posting this ubi and do your fucking math homework

us based so i do n't know how closely this translates to the uk but generally speaking there are three things that contribute to a strong credit score length volume of credit history this is a combination of how many accounts appear in your history along with how long they have been open   having a series of accounts that were maintained in good standing looks better than only having one   maintaining an account in good standing for a prolonged period 3 + years is better than a bunch of short term items   ideally your credit history should contain a mix of term loans that were paid per contract and a few 1 revolving account that shows ongoing use   the goal is to show that you can handle ongoing obligations responsibly and manage multiple things at the same time utilization or how much you currently owe vs how much people have agreed to lend you   being close to your limits raises questions about whether or not you can really handle the additional debt   having large availability raises questions about whether you would be able to handle it if you suddenly maxed things out   finding the correct middle point can be challenging the numbers i have seen thrown around most by the experts is 20 30 utilization recent activity or how much new debt have you taken on   if someone is opening lots of new accounts it raises red flags   shopping around for a deal on a auto loan or mortgage before settling on one is fine   opening 5 new credit lines in the past 6 months probably going to knock you down a bit   one of the concerns here is have you had the accounts long enough to demonstrate that you will be able to handle them in the long term one route that was suggested to me in my early years was to go take out a loan from a bank and just place the money in a cd while i made the payments   then repeat with a longer term   worst case you can cash out the cd to pay off the loan in an emergency but otherwise it helps show the type of history they are looking for all that said i have to agree with pete b 's answer   do n't play the credit game if you do n't really need to   or play it just enough to stay in the game and plan your finances to avoid relying on it   advice i wish i had taken long ago

on top of the given answers the type of referral will also factor in when you 're up for renewal and go to a comparison site in the uk confused and struggle accurately through all their lists of questions you see that some of the data differs e.g. not all the same jobs can be entered if you have had an accident not all ask whose fault it was and/or do n't leave the option not yet resolved forcing you to guess which way it will be and/or what the total repair cost was   so as these feed slightly different data to roughly the same set of insurance providers you will get slightly different quotes on the same providers and expect your own provider to offer a slightly better quote than you 'll get in reality for renewing the 's one time cut has to be still taken off but they count it as a new client so somebody gets a bonus for that you they disregard as a captive client and give what boils down to a loyalty penalty case in point i had an car accident resolved months later in my favour with all honest data including claim and its cost and putting my accident free years factor at 0 instead of 7 my old provider quoted about 8 more than the previous year on comparison sites but my renewal papers quoted me 290 more upon telephone enquiry the promised to refund the difference if court found in my favour though they refused to give this in writing so no thanks then the other set of referrals they get is from you directly going to their website asking for a quote they know what type of link you 've followed banner or google result etc they may know some info from your browser 's cookies time spent where or other tracking service and from your data they may guess how tech savvy and shop wise you are and scale your offer accordingly comparison site shoppers are lumped together at a relatively high savvy level of course companies breaking down your data and their own in a particular way can find advantages and hence offer you better terms as said in the main answer this is like arbitration in stock exchanges ensuring a certain amount of sanity if there 's something to exploit somebody will and everybody will follow it may be that they find a certain group of people maybe more accident prone but cheaper to deal with more flexible in repair times or easy to bully in accepting shared fault when they were n't at fault or they want a certain client for women for civil servants for drivers for homeowners often for cross selling other insurance services or they claim to want pensioners because the company can offer them a familiar voice same account manager always contacting them while they 're easier to and less likely to shop around when offered a rubbish deal also 100 straight comparison of competing offers is n't possible as the fine details of the t&cs terms conditions would differ as well as various little in the claims handling process   and depreciation of a car and various ways of dealing with it you insure it for the buying prices but two years later it 's worth about 40 less on paper so in case of total loss replacing like for like will cost you still at least 80 of the value for which you 've been insuring it while they 'll probably offer you the 100 60 mostly because instead of your trusted car you have something unknown that may have hidden defects or been mistreated and about to die case in point my old dealer bought car 's died just outside the warranty period notwithstanding its inspection you can rely on in the end the national brand agreed to refund the parts 15 of what i paid for the car but not the labour a few hours and any car model 's value differs in descending order from its price private selling price part exchange price and auction price depending on your may happily insure you for price = what you paid to dealer but then point out that the value of that car is the theoretical p x value i.e. the car without anybody 's profit far less than you 've been paying for conversely if you crash it after insuring below market value they can pay you your stupidly low figure

the fsa can only pay for expenses incurred after it was open   this also applies in case of a mid year change in election such as due to marriage divorce child birth etc for example according to this page you can only be reimbursed for qualifying expenses from the election that was in place at the time the expense was incurred so say you had $ 500 available from january to june then on july 1 had a qualifying event you then elected $ 2000   you can be reimbursed for up to $ 500 in expenses incurred prior to july 1 and then an additional $ 1500 in expenses incurred after up to $ 2000 if you did n't use your full $ 500 more specifically from the irs publication generally distributions from a health fsa must be paid     only to reimburse you for qualified medical expenses you     incurred during the period of coverage the hsa question is more complicated i would talk to a tax accountant or at minimum your benefits coordinator   also read the publication i linked above the first part is about hsas   the short answer to your specific question stop contributing to the hsa unless you were contributing well under the limit of the hsa   if you know your limit and you know you 're under it you can continue contributing until april 15 of next year if you fail to be an eligible individual during     2013 you can still make contributions up until april 15     2014 for the months you were an eligible individual the general rule is you can contribute up to of months you were eligible   so if you changed jobs oct 1 and you 're single then you could contribute or just over $ 2400 in total for the year   if you 've contributed less than that to date you may continue contributing up to that amount but again contact your benefits coordinator or preferably a tax accountant as the rules can be complicated you definitely can not deduct any expenses from the account that you incur after you are no longer eligible and the rules on distributions are pretty complicated and if you get it wrong you may owe a 10 penalty on top of the tax you would normally owe so there is significant incentive not to get it wrong

what a coincidence this was an exam question for my business law class   the main reason why individuals are not allowed to deduct expenses is because income tax revenue would be zero   the reason being if an individual is allowed to deduct expenses he she would spend 100 of their income and deduct it all on their tax returns which would mean he she would pay virtually no income tax this is bad for the gov't and the economy   it 's bad for the gov't because they loose tax revenue and it 's bad for the economy because people would not have any savings for tough times which can send the economy into a negative spiral

congratulations you are in great shape financially at a very young age   great income nice equity in a home and mostly debt free    it seems like you are looking at taking out a loan of 400 k and to do so you will have to put your own home at risk as you do not have the 80 k cash for a down payment   correct   it also looks like after 2.1 k per year without regard to taxes maintenance bad tenants or vacancies   as such this will likely be a negative cash flow situation   i would say you should plan on a cost   are you okay with that   while your income can probably cover this no problem is that your objective to have this property have a negative return for the next 10 15 years or so for me this is a no   way too much risk for a negative cash flow it is hard to talk to the upside as you did not give any profit predictions and i am unsure of the market    why would you risk your great financial situation with a hail mary attempt to make money   slow down you will get there   save for a few years so there is no need to tap your home 's equity to make a down payment   it would really bother me to owe 600 k on a 121 k salary k

it 's simply supply and demand    first demand if you 're an importer trying to buy from overseas you 'll need foreign currency maybe euros   or if you want to make a trip to europe you 'll need to buy euros   or if you 're a speculator and think the usd will fall   in value you 'll probably buy euros unless there 's someone willing to sell you euros for dollars you ca n't get any   there are millions of people trying to exchange currency all over the world   if more want to buy usd than that demand will positively influence the price of the usd as measured in euros   if more people want to buy euros well vice versa there are so many of these transactions globally and the number of people and the nature of these transactions change so continuously that the prices exchange rates for these currencies fluctuate continuously and smoothly demand is also impacted by what people want to buy and how much they want to buy it   if people generally want to invest their savings in stocks instead of dollars i.e. if lots of people are attempting to buy stocks by exchanging their dollars for stock then the demand for the dollar is lower and the demand for stocks is higher   when the stock market crashes you 'll often see a spike in the exchange rate for the dollar because people are trying to exchange stocks for dollars this represents a lot of demand for dollars then there 's supply it may seem like there are a fixed number of bills out there or that supply only changes when bernanke prints money but there 's actually a lot more to it than that   if you 're coming from europe and want to buy some usd from the bank well how much usd does the bank have and what does it mean for them to have money   the bank gets money from depositors or from lenders   if one person puts money in a deposit account and then the bank borrows that money from the account and lends it to a home buyer in the form of a mortgage the same dollar is being used by two people   the home buyer might use that money to hire a carpenter and the carpenter might put the dollar back into a bank account and the same dollar might get lent out again   in economics this is called the multiplier effect the full supply of money being used ends up becoming harder to calculate with this kind of debt and re lending    since money is something used and needed for conducting of transactions the number of transactions being conducted sometimes on credit affects the supply of money demand and supply blur a bit when you consider people who hoard cash   if i fear the stock market i might keep all my money in dollars   this takes cash away from companies who could invest it takes the cash out of the pool of money being used for transactions and leaves it waiting under my mattress   you could think of my hoarding as a type of demand for currency or you could think of it as a reduction in the supply of currency available to conduct transactions the full picture can be a bit more complicated if you look at every way currencies are used globally with swaps and various exchange contracts and futures but this gives the basic story of where prices come from that they are not set by some price fixer but are driven by market forces    the bank just facilitates transactions   if the last price exchange rate is 1.2 dollars per euro and the bank gets more requests to buy usd for euros than euros for usd it adjusts the rate downwards until the buying pressure is even   if the usd gets more expensive at some point fewer people will want to buy it or want to buy products from the us that cost usd   the bank maintains a spread like buy for 1.19 and sell for so it can take a profit you should think of currency like any other commodity and consider purchases for currency as a form of barter   the value of currency is merely a convention but it works   the currency is needed in transactions so it maintains value in this global market of bartering goods services and other currencies   as supply and demand for this and other commodities goods services fluctuate so does the quantity of any particular currency necessary to conduct any of these transactions a official basket of goods and the price of those goods is used to determine consumer price indexes inflation etc   the official price of this particular basket of goods is not a fundamental driver of exchange rates on a day to day basis

shares sold to private investors are sold using private contracts and do not adhere to the same level of strict regulations as publicly traded shares you may have different classes of shares in the company with different strings attached to them depending on the deals made with the investors at the time since public can not negotiate the ipo prospectus is in fact the investment contract between the company and the public and the requirements to what the company can put there are much stricter than private sales bob may not be able to sell his special stocks on the public exchange as the ipo specifies which class of stock is being listed for trading and bob 's is not the same class he can sell it on the otc market which is less regulated and then the buyer has to do his due diligence yes otc sold stocks may have strings attached to them for example a buy back option at a preset time and price

you need to stop what you are doing right now and cut off contact with them this is an extremely common scam here 's how it works they give you a check maybe even a certified check usually in payment for something they are buying from you the check happens to be for more than the sales price they ask you to refund the difference and pressure you to do so quickly you will see why in a second the check deposits fine and the money shows up in your account assuming the bank would n't do that if it was n't a good check you let your guard down and pay them in a couple of weeks the bank that it is a fake check they remove the money from your account and may even report you for prosecution to local authorities for passing a fraudulent check   meanwhile the person has the money you gave them and you ca n't find them because they gave you a fake name to add insult to injury they may also have the property you sold them   you feel like a chump variants of this scam include them asking you to cash a check for them and you get to keep a part of the proceeds for your trouble sometimes it is presented as a work at home scheme   if you feel you absolutely must complete this deal and you should n't i would suggest you ask the person for a couple of forms of picture id and tell them you need to make sure they are n't a scammer and you are going to do a background check on them with your local police to protect yourself i predict the person will disappear and never contact you again about the money   also i suggest you talk to your bank immediately and inform them you think you might have been a victim of a scamming attempt so that you do n't look like an when this is all said and done

to be absolutely sure you should call the agent and check that said i have been renting accommodation through both agencies and directly through landlords for seven years i live in london and this is quite a common situation it normally means that the deposit is being securely held by a third party so that it can not be taken or depleted without the agreement of both parties the deposit protection scheme is one way that deposits are securely held in this manner as a third party they will have different account details it may be the case that the agency is protecting the deposit and you are paying rent to the landlord directly this means that your deposit goes to the agency 's account and the rent goes to the landlord 's account obviously your landlord and agency have different accounts a little colour to your day i am currently paying my rent to the agency who also took the deposit but because of the way they handle deposits versus rent the deposit was sent to a different account held by the same agent in my previous flat i paid the deposit to an agency and the rent directly to the landlord this resulted in an issue one time where i got the two accounts confused and paid rent to the agency who after giving me a small slap on the wrist transferred it to my landlord in the flat before that i paid rent and the deposit to my landlords holding company that is one of the few times that i paid rent and the deposit into the same account again check with the agent that one of these situations is the case but this is absolutely normal when renting through an agency

economically you would say that purchased and rented real estate are not perfect substitutes they are largely separate markets   only a few people are able to easily switch from one to the other and that choice is sticky for example once you buy a house prices would have to rise a lot for it to be worth it to sell it and move into an apartment in both markets there is a supply and demand curve but the slope of the demand curve for houses to purchase is much steeper than the demand curve for rentals the market for new housing fluctuates rapidly because it requires a large change in housing prices to change the number of people looking to buy a house   most decisions to buy a house are not driven by the state of the housing market   this describes a supply demand graph with a very steep demand curve   additionally because of the leverage provided by mortgages the demand for houses depends critically on relatively small changes in the interest rate and availability of loans   thus the steep demand curve shifts all over the place as borrowing conditions change on the other hand apartment prices are more stable because people easily move from one apartment to another and people living in their parent 's easily move into apartments if prices change   a small change in the price or quantity of rentals brings about reasonable response in quantity demanded   this is the situation where the demand curve is shallow   in addition rentals are not tied to interest rates tightly nor are they as strongly tied to economic conditions in a recession people avoid buying but renters continue to rent

the difference is that for the one year time frame the data is represented based on daily data and the sma is 20 days whilst for the 5 year timeframe the data is automatically represented as weekly data with the sma represented by 20 weeks not 20 days anymore this happens due to daily data on this chart being too much data to represent over a 5 year period so the data defaults to weekly data over such a long period if the chart is represented as weekly data then any indicators will also have to be represented in weekly data if you use a more sophisticated charting program you can actually select to see daily or weekly data over longer periods such as 5 years or more

options reflect expectations about the underlying asset and options are commonly priced using the black scholes model   and are probability functions s is the spot current price of the asset k is the strike price r is the risk free rate and t t represents time to maturity   without getting into the mathematics it to say that higher volatility or expectation of volatility increases the perceived riskiness of the asset so call options are priced lower   and put options are priced higher think about it intuitively if the stock is more likely to go downwards then there 's an increased chance that the call option expires worthless so call options must be priced lower to accommodate the relative change in expected value of the option   puts are priced similarly but they move inversely with respect to call option prices due to put call parity so if call option prices are falling then put option prices are rising note however that call prices falling does not cause put prices to rise the inverse relationship exists because of changes in the underlying factors and how pricing works so the option action signifies that the market believes the stock is headed lower in the given time frame that does not mean it will go lower and option traders assume risk whenever they take a particular position bottom line got ta do your own homework best of luck

gt upfront investment cost to create a contemporary business is challenging today and this is before a firm anticipation of the cost of labour declining in developed nations    yes today   but i think part of this future is where these costs come down due to advanced technology   look at 3d printing as an example   it 's new and expensive now but when these things are $ 99 at staples and capable of printing high quality plastic parts you essentially give every single person the ability to buy a cheap factory for his home   this helps greatly distribute and the means of production and possibly even get around copyright and with open source like   this is how i see the future in the world described in the video   cheap advanced technology that replaces human labor   when the cost of a labor robot is in the price range of 90 of the public you wo n't have to work   every human will have robots working on their behalf   i think the video warns of a future where these robots exist but they 're only owned by the rich   i think that 's the wrong prediction   that is n't how technology works   they even go over that in the video   how computers every year get cheaper and more powerful   same goes with 3d printing they get more powerful and cheaper by the day   same will go for labor robots   so it 's not that every person is going to have to operate their own small business though it will probably increase entrepreneurship which is a great thing it just means that each individual will have the means to produce without actually laboring

this is more of an interesting question then it looks on first sight in the usa there are some tax for mortgage payments which we do n’t have in the uk unless you are renting out the property with the mortgage   so firstly work out the interest rate on each loan taking into account any tax etc then you need to consider the charges for paying off a loan for example often there is a charge if you pay off a mortgage    these days in the uk most allow you to pay off at least 10 a year without hitting such a charge but check your mortgage offer document how interest is calculated when you make an early payment may be different between your loans so check then you need to consider what will happen if you need another loan    some mortgages allow you to take back any overpayments most do n’t   re mortgaging to increase the size of your mortgage often has high charges then there is the effect on your credit rating paying more of a loan each month then you need to often improves your credit rating you also need to consider how interest rates may change for example if you mortgage is a fixed rate but your car loan is not and you expect interest rates to rise do the calculations based on what you expect interest rates to be over the length of the loans however normally it is best to pay off the loan with the highest interest rate first   reasons for penalties for paying of some loans in the uk in the uk some short term loans normally under 3 years add on all the interest at the start of the loan so you do n’t save any interest if you pay of the loan quicker     this is due to the banks having to cover their admin costs and there being no admin charge to take out the loan fixed rate loans have penalties for overpayment as otherwise when interest rates go down people will change to other lenders so making it a one way bet that the banks will always loose    i believe in the usa the central bank will under right such loans so the banks do n’t take the risk

with the scenario that you laid out ie 5 and 10 loans it makes no sense at all the problem is when you 're in trouble the rates are never 5 or 10 getting behind on credit cards sucks and is really hard to recover from the problem with multiple accounts is that as the banks tack on fees and raise your interest rate to the default rate usually 30 when you give them any excuse late payment over the limit etc the banks will also cut your credit lines as you make payments making it more likely that you will bump over the limit and be back in default status one payment even at a slightly higher rate is preferable when you 're deep in the hole because you can actually pay enough to hit principal if you have assets like a house you 'll get a much better rate as well in a scenario where you 're paying 22 25 interest your minimum payment will be $ 150 200 a month and that is mostly interest and penalty one big loan will usually result in a smaller payment and you do n't end up in a situation where the banks are for position so they get paid first the danger of consolidation is that you 'll stop triggering defaults and keep making your payments so your credit score will improve then the will start circling and offering you more credit cards edit mea   i wrote this based on experiences of close friends whom i 've helped out over the years not realizing how the law changed in 2009   back around 2004 a single late payment would trigger universal default on most cards jacking all rates up to 30 and slashing credit lines resulting in over the limit and other fees credit card banks generally apply payments in order to interest on penalties penalties interest on principal principal in a way that makes it very difficult to pay down principal for people deep in debt they would also offer payment plans to entice you to pay bank b vs. bank a which would trigger fees from bank a. another change is that minimum payments were generally 2 of statement balance which often did n't cover the monthly finance charge the new law changed that resulting in a payment of 1 of balance + accrued interest under the old regime consolidation made it less likely that various circumstances would trigger default and gave the struggling debtor one throat to choke with the new rules there are definitely a smaller number of scenarios where consolidation actually makes sense

on the statement it now tracks how much is contributed to the account    pre and post tax this is the key your withdrawals will be proportional assuming you have contributed 90 in regular contributions pre tax and 10 in roth post tax when you withdraw $ 1000 it will be $ 900 from the regular taxed fully and $ 100 from the roth not taxed assuming its a qualified distribution earnings attributed proportionally to the contributions i agree with you that it is not the best option and would also prefer separate accounts but with 401k the account is per employee instead of doing 401k roth non roth consider switching to regular 401k and roth ira then you can separate the funds easily as you wish

the government pays interest on its debts just like anyone else but since it 's already the government and already taking advantage of credit your money loaned to it through the bonds it does n't need the extra benefit of taxing the interest it pays it 's better off just issuing bonds at a lower interest rate and letting you keep all the interest instead of a higher interest rate which will have some amount taxed and returned to it anyway the government wants a cut of private loan interest just like any other income which is why interest on private bonds loans is taxable   edit what about municipal bonds would n't the federal government benefit from taxing interest on municipal bonds    municipal bonds are issued to support public infrastructure amp services such as construction of water supply infrastructure since the goal is to improve facilities for the public benefit and government programs ostensibly aim to provide public benefits as well it allows the full proceeds of the bonds to go to the designated projects at the lowest possible interest rate and the public pays the interest through city rates taxing municipal bonds would result in a higher cost to the public for the same end result because of higher interest rates with the net interest going to the federal amp state governments via income tax on the interest

it 's doable but there 's a fair amount of risk involved the biggest issue is that your roommates could move out it 's possible that they could have a falling out get a job in a different city or just move on how difficult would it be to find another roommate how many roommates can you lose and still afford to pay the mortgage insurance taxes and all the rest of your living expenses even if you you retain all of your roommates until the mortgage is paid off there 's still some risk involved if you were to lose your job could you continue to make mortgage payments worst case scenario is that you could become unemployed for a time while home values in your state city neighborhood are crashing last the position on landlord has the potential to be lucrative but also comes with a fair amount of responsibility it will be a drain on your time to maintain the house and to make sure you always have tenants i know you said that your roommates are good about paying on time but are you willing to evict a friend because they won't can't pay rent it 's easier to ask the landlord for an extension on rent when you 're friends all that being said i think that this idea is worth considering my recommendation is that you consider every aspect of it and proceed cautiously if you choose to do so

i would expect that your position will be liquidated when the option expires but not before there 's probably still some time value so it does n't make sense for the buyer to exercise the option early and take your stock instead they could sell the option to someone else and collect the remaining time value occasionally there 's a weird situation for whatever reason where an option has near zero or negative time value and then you might get an early exercise but in general if there 's time value someone would want to sell rather than exercise if the option has n't expired maybe the stock will even fall again and you 'll keep it if the option just expired maybe the exercise just has n't been processed yet it may take overnight or so

the cost of paying tax should be considered an additional financial expense and the administrative burden of filing those taxes should be considered an additional labour expense simplified your question is asking how to determine whether these additional expenses are worth it there are many ways to calculate what your time is worth consider two situations where you may consider picking up additional part time work at minimum wage 1   if you are working 80 hours a week at a stressful but high paying job working another 5 hours a week at minimum wage would likely not be worth your time both because you already make a lot of money and also because your time is limited and therefore precious   2 if you are working 20 hours a week at minimum wage then another 5 hours a week at the same job would likely be worth your time both because it would increase your income by 25 and also because it would not put a heavy strain on your light schedule   these two extreme examples highlight the inferred principle that i think generally applies to weigh such decisions competes with in your specific example the actual work component will happen regardless of the money aspect that is your wife will be providing these services regardless so your question is essentially would it be worth it for my wife to make $ 5k given that she would pay tax on that money and would bear the burden of the tax filings etc   we ca n't answer this directly because it relates to what your wife values if doing this would make the activity which is otherwise just a hobby an unwanted chore then it may not be worth the post tax income if doing this would not impact her enjoyment of the teaching but would add on an unwanted ~1 hour week of paperwork is it worth spending 50 hours over the course of the year to earn $ 5k i assume the answer then would be yes

this effect has much empirical evidence as googling dividend price effect evidence will show as the financial economic schools of thought run the so do the theories   one school goes as far to call it a market inefficiency since the earning power thus the value of an equity that 's affected is no different or at least not riskier by the percentage of market capitalization paid most papers offer that by the efficient market hypothesis and arbitrage theory the value of an equity is known by the market at any point in time given by its price so if an equity pays a dividend the adjusted price would be efficient since the holder receives no excess of the price instantly before payment as after including the dividend since that dividend information was already discounted so would otherwise produce an arbitrage

i did not single out scandinavia the person answering my original comment to this thread did    the fact that economists view the structure of the us economy as different from other developed economies is a fact i can give you quotes once i get back to my books at home    yes supply of work force drives wages if you take a look at the original wealth of nations by adam smith he also states that the fluctuating death rates of the workers is a natural part of economic cycles yet we would view this as brutal today    most of the developed world views having an underpaid unregulated illegal service class as basis of the economy as brutal and a form of slavery    the people also want to come to the eu they flock to the eu in bigger numbers than to the us they are risking their lives trying to get to europe along various routes they drown in the by the thousands they succumb at they are at the hands of turkish and criminal people smuggling gangs trying to get to eu through greece they try to breach the fence in by mass runs   you may have not noticed this in world news but there has been a migration of historic proportions going on to the eu for quite some time   so why is n't there this underpaid illegal unregulated service class    you tell me i would sincerely like to know

there are two basic types of lines of credit typically offered at a retail bank overdraft line of credit is essentially a revolving personal loan that you can draw upon as needed or automatically draw on when you overdraw on your checking account typically with a commercial bank there is a fee to use the automatic overdraft in addition to interest some credit unions do n't charge a fee interest is typically computed using average daily balance a home equity line of credit is a revolving loan that is secured against your home interest on home improvement related expenses is deductible since the bank gets a lien on your home the rates are low sometimes you can even get debit cards that will hit the line i think these are a good idea if

assuming a price is set on an free market there are particular difficulties to pricing a free market is one where the price is entirely determined by the willingness of people to buy and sell at a particular price point what you perceive as price is actually the tick i.e. the quote of the last transaction the first and most serious major obstacle to pricing is a variation of the prisoners dilemma a psychological phenomenon for instance bitcoin might be worth 4 $ now but you believe it will be worth 5 $ in 3 days will you buy bitcoin if acting only on your conviction yes but what if you consider what other people will do will others believe bitcoin will be worth 5 $ in 3 days will they act on their conviction will the others believe that others believe that it wil be worth 5 $ in 3 days and will the others believe that the others who believe will act on their conviction will the others believe that others believe of still others who believe that they will act on their conviction it goes on like this ad infinitum the actual behavior of any individual on the market is essentially chaotic and unpredictable for the reason stated above and others this is related to a phenomenon you call market efficiency an efficient market always reflects the optimal price point at any given time if that is so then you can not win on this market because at the time you would have to realize a competitive edge everybody else has already acted on that information markets are not 100 efficient of course but modern electronic markets can be very very efficient as say compared to stock markets fro 100 years ago where you could get a competitive edge just by having access to a fast courier what makes matters rather more difficult for price forecasting is that not only are humans engaging in the market machines are as well the machines may not be terribly good at what they do but they are terribly fast the machines that work well i.e. do n't loose much will survive and the ones that do n't will die in short order since speed is one of the major benefits of the machines over humans they tend to make markets even more efficient another phenomenon to price forecasting is that of information and suppose you found a reliable method to predict a market at a given time you act on this information and indeed you make a profit the profit you will be able to achieve will diminish over time until it reaches zero or reverts the reason for this is that you acted on private information which you leaked out by engaging in a trade the more successful you are in exploiting your forecast the better you train every other market participant to react to their losses since for every trade you make successfully there has to be somebody who lost people or machines who lose on markets usually exit those markets in some fashion so even if the other participants are not adjusting their behavior your success is weeding out those with the wrong behavior yet another difficulty in pricing forecasts are black swan events since information can have a huge impact on pricing the sudden appearance of new information can throw a conservative forecast completely off the rails and incur huge losses or huge unexpected benefits you can not quantify black swan events in any shape or form it is my belief that you can not predict efficient and well working markets you might be able to predict some very sub optimal markets but usually hedge funds are always on the hunt for inefficient markets to exploit so by simple decree of market economics the inefficient markets tend to be a perpetually dying species

since you have no sales i 'd likely question how well could you determine the value of the company 's assets in a reasonable fashion you may be better to estimate sales and discount that back to a current valuation for example insurance companies could determine that if you wanted to be paid $ x month for the rest of your life the present day value of that is $ y. there are similar mechanisms for businesses but this does get tricky as the estimates have to be somewhat conservative and you have to be prepared for some other scenarios for example if you got the $ 200,000 then would you really never have to ask for more external equity financing in the future or is it quite likely that you 'd want another infusion down the road while you can mark it at $ 1,000,000 there will be questions about why that value that you 'd have to answer and saying cause i like big round numbers may not go over well my suggestion is to consider what kind of sales will the company have over the next 5 years that you could work back to determine a current price if you believe the company can have $ 5,000,000 in sales over the 5 years then it may make sense to place the current valuation of $ 1,000,000 on it i would n't look too much into the money and time you 've invested as that is n't likely to go over well with investors that just because you 've put in what is worth $ x the business may or may not be worth that the challenge is that without sales it is quite difficult to get an idea of what is the company worth if it makes billions then it is worth a lot more than a company that never turns a profit another way to consider this is the question of what kind of economic output do you think you could do working here for the next 5 years could you do thousands of dollars of work millions of dollars or just a few bucks consider how you want this to be seen where if you want some help look up episodes of tv shows like dragon 's den or shark tank as these give valuations often as part of the pitch which is what you are doing

month to date for the month to date the price on feb 28th is $ and the price on march 16th is $ so the return is which can be written more simply as the position is 1000 shares valued at $ on feb 28th so the profit on the month to date is calendar year to date for the calendar year to date ytd the price on dec 31st is $ and the price on feb 28th is $ so the return to feb 28th is the return from feb 28th to march 16th is so the year to date return is or more directly so the 2011 ytd profit on 1000 shares valued at $ 4600 on dec 31st is year to date starting dec 10th for the year to date starting dec 10th the starting value is and the value on dec 31st is 1000 $ = $ 4600 so the return is $ 4600 $ 1 = = the year to date profit is therefore note ytd is often understood to mean calendar year to date   to cover all the bases state both ie calendar ytd 2011 and ytd starting dec 10th 2010 edit further to comment for the calendar year to date with 200 shares sold on jan 10th with the share price at $ the return from dec 31st to jan 10th is the return from jan 10th to feb 28th is the return from feb 28th to march 16th is the profit on 1000 shares from dec 31st to jan 10th is $ 4600 = the profit on 800 shares from jan 10th to feb 28th is zero the profit on 800 shares from feb 28th to march 16th is so the year to date profit is $ 4

i do n't really like to refer to being an expert cause it is all relative really   i know excel better than anyone in my office but i do n't consider myself an expert because my skills do n't touch many of the people on excel related forums   anyway the initiative you are showing wanting to learn this on your own is great    so if you told me that you were in expert in excel but it is clear you know less than me i 'd peg you as someone with bias   what i would want to see is that you are familiar with functions common with finance related excel work that you understand under which situations certain functions are more efficient for completing a task   like math there are many ways to solve a problem but some are more efficient than others in excel the most efficient is not always the most elegant we are talking about using the least amount of processing power and memory   that if you do n't know how to do something in excel you 'll be able to figure it out without help   there are so many resources on the web and you should know how to be able to look at other examples and apply it to your situation   you should be familiar with vba not just using the macro recorder   know what situations when it is better to use vba than excel functions in most situations you want to avoid vba because 1 it makes it difficult for other users to follow your spreadsheet and 2 excel functions are much more optimized and generally perform tasks much faster   know how to build spreadsheets that are easy for others to follow you work write comments etc   nothing is worse than trying to figure out a cluster fuck of a spreadsheet   i would not expect you to be an expert in vba and to be able to write something in depth from scratch but rather be able to figure it out using outside resources   since i am not writing in vba on daily basis i forget shit all the time but if there is something that needs to be done i can guarantee you i will figure out how   knowledge of how to integrate excel with a database via vba is good for both pulling in data and updating a database   tl;dr   1 do n't your excel knowledge but do n't make yourself out to be an excel god you never know how much knowledge the other person has 2 demonstrate that you have experience with commonly used excel related functions efficient construction of 3 demonstrate that if you do n't know how to do something in excel you will be able to figure it out provide an example 4 knowledge of vba is good especially integrating with outside databases   provide example of a time you used vba and why you did   best way to learn this stuff is through experience if you want me to critique your excel work i would happy to   the following project would give you good experience   download data for 20 countries just choose at random make sure you include u.s. though on gdp in us dollar current prices and ppp basis for all years   from imf   1 build a dash board that calculates the year over year growth of both gdp $ and gdp ppp 2 set it so you can dynamically select which country to display 3 set it up so you dynamically change start and end date 3 the chart should automatically adjust its range based on the date selected 4 create three aggregates developing countries developed countries and world ex us 5 with these aggregates have an option to show the y y growth using either the average mean or on a gdp weighted basis    this is just an idea that would give you some good experience   it is not anything i need so only do it if you want to build your skills

as a sole proprietor the tax liability of your business is calculated based on combining your business income with your personal income together   it is good advice to keep all personal and business financial matters separate this makes it easier to prove to the irs that all your business expenses are actually business related in this case however the two items tax payment for personal income vs tax payment for business income are what you can do however for your own personal records is calculate how much of your tax payment relates to your business i would n't get complicated about this i would simply take the net income of your business as a of your taxable income and multiply that against your tax payment ie if your business net income is $ 10,000 and your total taxable income is $ 50,000 and you paid $ 6,000 in taxes i would record that 20 of the $ 6k was related to business income if you have a separate bank account for your sole proprietorship you could make a transfer to your personal account of $ 1,200 and then make the $ 6k payment from your personal account remember that tax payments for either your sole proprietorship and your personal income will be treated the same federal tax payments are not tax deductible and state tax payments are tax deductible whether they were paid for your sole proprietorship or the rest of your personal income so even though this method is simplistic for example it does n't factor in that different investment income types earned personally will have a lower rate than your sole proprietorship income any difference would n't have an impact on any future tax liability this would only be for your own personal record keeping

gt;for it departments internally billing is essential for managing expectations otherwise they are treated as an endless pool of free resources   it chargeback internal billing can and i have seen this in action also work the opposite way it can allow it to tax other departments and continue to operate   the devil is always in the details and the chief problem with chargeback systems is when things are   for example charging set rates to each department based on cpu count regardless of whether one unit in one department is a high power cad station or file server and the equivalent of a in other departments or likewise by the number of printers regardless of type charging a massive printer the same $ 500 per unit annual support cost as a label printer that only cost $ 50 retail etc   and likewise with the it should n't actually charge back labor you still create the endless pool of resources problem just in the form of labor rather than equipment   basically internal charge back systems can function if they are properly constructed and properly adjusted to take into account different and changing costs but far too many companies implement such a thing and then let it where it ends up creating the same kinds of unnecessary and troublesome distortions that it was purportedly put in place to solve

the yen is the source of carry it means whichever savvy people with means who want to borrow money to invest on a leveraged basis anywhere in the world come running to borrow in yen why because 1 japan is an advanced economy whose currency is freely convertible to many many currencies countries who are happy to convert yen back and forth 2 japanese interest rates are low lower than in the west b c of their earlier deflationary crises due to too much debt and due to west requiring yen to be too strong after the plaza accords so it 's cheap to borrow there   so a lot of investment around the world has in origin come from borrowing in japan   as long as that investment is on the loan to japan remains outstanding but the investor earns the carry the rate of difference between the cost of borrowing in yen and earning the return from whatever investment it is    when scary things happen like war disaster etc the big money bags investors pull their money out of their investments and put it in their banks   this means they sell their investments wherever they are convert some of that money back into buy yen to return their yen loans yen goes up

many mutual fund companies including vanguard when i checked many years ago require smaller minimum investments often $ 1000 for ira and 401k accounts   some also allow for smaller investments into their funds for   ira accounts if you set up an automatic investment plan that contributes   a fixed amount of money each month or each quarter   on the other hand   many mutual fund companies charge an annual account maintenance fee $ 10 $ 20 $ 25 more per fund for ira investments unless the balance in the fund is above a certain amount often $ 5 k or $ 10k$   this fee can be paid in cash or deducted from the ira investment and the former option is vastly better so diversification into multiple funds while starting out with an ira is not that great an idea it is far better to get diversification through investment in an s&p 500 index fund vfinx since you wo n't have access to @joetaxpayer 's viiix or a total market index fund or if you prefer a target retirement fund and then branch out into other types of mutual funds as your investment grows through future contributions and dividends etc to answer your question about fund minimums the ira account is separate from a taxable investment account and the minimum rule applies to each separately but as noted above there often are smaller minimums for tax deferred accounts

i do n't think you understand the multiplier effect   the multiplier effect does not allow a bank to loan out more money than they have   the multiplier effect is the theory that when a bank loans out money that money will come back to the bank in the form of a deposit which they can loan out again   with this banking idea if there were enough popularity then when they loan out money they could be getting it back in the form of deposits that they can lend out again

you will find lots of rules of thumb but there is no universal truth to how much you should save there are factors you do need to consider though you should start as early as possible to set money aside for retirement you should then use a retirement calculator to at least get an understanding of the amount you need to set aside each month to achieve the desired retirement income your default should be not to spend money and only spend money when you must leisure travel and eating out should come last after you have saved up you should have funds for different terms for example my wife and i have an emergency fund for unexpected expenses or losses in income the rule of thumb here generally is to have 3 6 months of salary saved up a longer term fund should be created for larger expenses like buying a car or preparing the on a property finally the retirement fund which should cover your needs after you have retired

i do n't understand the op 's desire i 'd love to have a few hundred dollars coming in each month until i really get the hang of things   when growing your wealth so that it will be large enough in retirement to throw off enough profits to live on you must not touch the profits generated along the way   you must reinvest them to earn even more profits   the profits you earn need not show up as cash   most investments also grow in re sale value this growth is called capital gains and is just as more important than cash flows like interest income or dividends     when evaluating investing choices you think of your returns as a percent of your total savings at any time   so expecting $ 100/month equals $ would require a $ 12,000 investment to earn 10%/yr from the sounds of it the op 's principal is not near that amount and an average 10 should not be expected by an investment with reasonable risk i would conclude that there is no free lunch   you need to continually save and add to your principal   you must invest to expect a reasonable return less than 10 and you must reinvest all profits whether cash or capital gains or else start a business which can not be compared to passive investing

this depends on the involved us citizen resident giving gifts is required to pay a gift tax the recipient of the gift however pays nothing the value of the gift at the time of the gift giving is used to determine the tax and an exclusion of $ 14000 per person per year as of 2013 is available to allow smaller gifts to be given without too much of a red tape there 's also a lifetime exemption which is shared between the gift tax and the estate tax this exemption is $ 5.25 m in 2013   the reason the gift tax exists in the us is because the us tax code is very aggressive this is basically double taxation similarly to estate tax gifts estates are after tax money i.e. income tax has been paid on them yet the government taxes them again why the excuse is to disallow shifting of income if one person has high income tax brackets he may give some of his income producing property to another person with lesser brackets who would then pay less income taxes for example parents would transfer property to children similarly capital gains could be shifted generation skipping tax is yet another complication to disallow people use gifts to avoid estate taxes a grandparent would gift stuff to grandchildren thus skipping a level of estate taxes the parents in between in other countries the tax codes may be less aggressive and not tax gifts inheritance as this money has been taxed before this is a more fair situation imho yet it means that wealth moves from generation to generation without the general public benefiting from it so if you 're a us person and considering giving or receiving a gift you need to consult with a tax adviser about the consequences similarly with other countries if you are subject to their tax laws

sometimes a business must keep track of overhead expenses that can be used to determine the rates they will bill their customers especially the government when determining the rates they are allowed to charge the government they have to include direct costs and indirect costs these indirect costs include allowable overhead and they can also include profit but the government limits the maximum profit any expenses have to come out of profit   expenses include costs of amusement diversions social activities and any directly associated costs such as tickets to shows or sports events meals lodging rentals transportation and are when they talk about meals and lodging being they are referring to those not needed to support the contract if the contract expects the contractor to travel they will generally provide a travel budget that is separate from the amounts used to determine the hourly rate the term slush fund has the connotation of being illegal or hidden slush funds are used to bribe officials or are leftover funds that were supposed to be spent and are now being hidden so that they can be misused at a later date

typically if the company is so out of whack that it 's liquidating it wo n't have assets to even cover all its debts never mind enough to return anything back to owners   if there was any shot of the company continuing as an ongoing concern it would file an 11 and reorganize

welcome to money se your question is similar to a number of others the how do i pay my debt down and how do i invest extra money is a bit of a continuum since there 's no consensus than one should pay off the last cent of debt before investing   oversimplify it for me the correct order of investing offers a good look at this you see pete 's answer on your question is perfectly fine but since you make no mention of say a matched 401(k i 'd suggest that any answer to a question like yours should first take a step back and evaluate the bigger picture a dollar for dollar matched 401(k beats paying off even an 18 credit card   absent any tangents any thought of investing saving for anything else etc my answer is simple line up the debt highest interest rate to lowest keep in mind the post tax rate i.e. a 6 student loan you can deduct is an effective 4.5 if you are in the 25 bracket

places can succeed with mediocre food   they just have to price things right and/or have redeeming qualities making up for the meh food   bww just does n't have anything to offer   they 're shitty to be in and their food is overpriced   so why go there   improving the quality of their food probably would n't even matter that much because bar wings and other bar food are n't going to have all that much pull no matter how great they are

allows those with access to leverage sub second delays in pricing which screws those without    yes it does just as the first web based trading systems provided investors an advantage over those using the phones to place orders all the way back to when the wheel provided advantage over those running barefoot in battles it is the cost of progress   what is different for the first time in history is that humans are no longer being replaced by other more efficient humans they are being replaced by computers to the point of eventually becoming obsolete it enables a few to amass enormous leverage but that is a social problem not an economic one

the advice to only invest what you can afford to lose is good advice most people should have several pots of money checking to pay your bills short term savings emergency fund college fund retirement when you think about investing that is the funds that have along lead time college and retirement it is never the money you need to pay your bills   now when somebody is young the money they have decided to invest can be in riskier investments you have time to recover over time the transition is made to less risky investments because the recovery time is now limited for example putting all your college savings for your recent high school graduate into the stock market could have devastating consequences your hear this advice only invest what you can afford to lose because too many people ask about to maximize the return on the down payment for their house example a example b. they want to use vehicles designed for long term investing for short term purposes imagine a 10 correction while you are waiting for closing

in the us the bank is legally required to report any cash transactions over 10k$ to the government this normally has no consequences and you will never hear about it no need to worry about it if the amount is very high or you do it repeatedly or the government has other pre existing reasons to look at your finances sharply they might ask you where the money came from and what you did with it but your explanation is perfectly fine assuming it is true the idea is to catch money that try to get large illegal cash incomes into the banking system classic example is the drug lord who makes a million a month in cash from selling drugs and needs to get this million into the banks as you ca n't buy houses or luxury cars or yachts with cash without getting fbi attention right away

on the contrary outsourcing to india and investing in india in general is quite profitable and strategically appealing   1 india 's silicon valley alone is to that of the states    2 country is more advanced than people think 3 their call centre alone is known and classified as one of their strongest    4 not to mention the strongest argument of all they have their own production lines for almost everything thus not importing anything but rather exporting and sharing its advanced products 5 one of the most if not the most it savvy countries in the world    only argument for the above post is the potential obstacle of discrepancies of culture between the outsourcing country and india india may not be as diverse as would be preferred in order to rid the possibility of potential bottlenecks with regards to diversity

i have a very hard time believing you pay 60 of gross otherwise i believe you 're right in the way this works suppose you make $ 100k and pay 25 of that in taxes 100,000 .25 = 25,000 but if you spend $ 1,000 pretax then it 's as if you were paid $ .25 = $ so the difference is $ 250   which is the same as that $ 1,000 .25

gifts from your parents are not treated as income for tax purposes you should not include that in your subsidy calculation if you are here on a student visa and have been in the us for less than 5 years then you are considered a non resident alien and you are not required to buy a qualified plan through the insurance marketplace you might be able to get a cheaper student plan through your school but the subsidy might be enough that it 's still worth it when calculated correctly if you are a resident alien or you are a citizen of the us then you are required to get coverage though you can choose not to purchase coverage and pay the tax for not having coverage that tax can not be collected by the irs unless you have already had federal tax withheld they can only confiscate your tax return money to recoup that money i do n't have enough information to recommend one way or the other what you should do but i would bet that if you recalculated your subsidy without including your parents income it would cover the majority of the cost you should also consider applying for medicaid if you meet the eligibility requirements in your state

banks worry that the large gift might be a loan that is ultimately expected to be repaid if so that affects the cash flow of the recipient and makes it more difficult to make the mortgage payments to the bank   in some cases of course it is an informal loan dad advances a large $ x to son to use as a but does not charge interest and the expectation is that the money will be returned in smaller chunks as and when the son can afford to repay dad    in some cases dad truly means it as a gift but son feels an obligation to repay the money if not explicitly then by paying for the first few months of dad 's nursing home stay etc   so banks like to have an explicit document such as a copy of a letter from dad saying that this money is a gift and some assurance that this is on the up and up    if the amount is larger than the maximum gift that can be given each year without having to file a gift tax return then some assurance that a gift tax return will be filed is helpful mentioning this in the letter is good it indicates that there are no secret or secret agreements to the effect that this is in fact a loan with or without regular repayments

gt i think all taxes are theft no matter who they come from   that is a matter of opinion obviously i disagree with that sentiment do you have a reason behind it    gt again you have n't really substantiated any claim about your financial situation    i have scanned in a tax summary sheet from my cpa i took off all the personal identifying data i would be happy to share it with you but i am not sure how to attach it to posts like this any ideas    gt additionally i 'm sure someone of your financial would have enough time to go on reddit   i am an owner if i want to sit at my work desk and reddit as i am doing right now i can do that not what i typically do but i just got off travel and trying to get back into it plus i am a little bit because we have some big projects coming up i am still human   gt literally take your pick and we can begin   okay i will pick a topic that i am more familiar with defense r&amp;d. my position is that while there are many companies that do r&amp;d in the world of defense there is also much innovation that comes from the government itself gps is one such technology and while there are many very innovative companies that have built onto and done some amazing things with this technology if it were n't for government investment and r&amp;d it would n't exist    gt and yes even people who advocate only higher taxes for the rich will end up with higher taxes for me i.e. bernie sanders   what part of bernie 's proposal leads you to believe that

if you received shares as part of a bonus you needed to pay income tax on the dollar of those shares at the time you received them this income tax is based on the dollar value of the bonus and has nothing to do with the shares if you have since sold these shares you will need to report any capital gain or loss you made from their dollar value when you received them if you made a gain you would need to pay capital gains tax on the profits if you held them for more than a year you would get a discount on the capital gains tax you have to pay if you made a loss you can use that capital loss to reduce any other capital gains in that income year reduce any other income up to $ 3000 per year or carry any additional capital loss forward to future income years to reduce any gains or income up to $ 3000 per year you do have in the future

series i savings bonds would be another option that have part of their return indexed to inflation though currently they are yielding through april 30 2016 though some may question how well is that 3 you quote as an inflation rate from the first link series i savings bonds are a low risk savings product while you own    them they earn interest and protect you from inflation you may    purchase electronic i bonds via treasurydirect or paper i bonds with    your irs tax refund as a treasurydirect account holder you can    purchase manage and redeem i bonds directly from your web browser tips vs i bonds if you want to compare these products that are rather safe in terms of avoiding a nominal loss this would be where a portion of the funds could go not all of them at once

the sears ceo eddie lampert is an ayn rand fanatic   this is what happens when you take ayn rand newshour amp making sense column this is what happens when you take ayn rand seriously   in 2008 sears ceo eddie lampert decided to restructure the company according to rand 's principles   lampert broke the company into more than 30 individual units each with its own management and each measured separately for profit and loss the idea was to promote competition among the units which lampert assumed would lead to higher profits instead this is what happened as described by a reporter for bloomberg business   an advocate of free market economics and fan of the ayn rand he created the model because he expected the invisible hand of the market to drive better results if the company 's leaders were told to act selfishly he argued they would run their divisions in a rational manner boosting overall performance   instead the divisions turned against each other and sears and kmart the overarching brands suffered interviews with more than 40 former executives many of whom sat at the highest levels of the company paint a picture of a business that 's by infighting as its divisions battle over fewer resources   a close up of the debacle was described by stuart in a salon article from 2013   it got crazy executives started undermining other units because they knew their bonuses were tied to individual unit performance they began to focus solely on the economic performance of their unit at the expense of the overall sears brand one unit kenmore started selling the products of other companies and placed them more prominently than sears own products units competed for ad space in sears units were no longer incentivized to make sacrifices like offering discounts to get shoppers into the store   sears became a miserable place to work rife with infighting and screaming matches employees focused solely on making money in their own unit ceased to have any loyalty to the company or stake in its survival   we all know the end of the story sears share prices fell and the company appears to be headed toward bankruptcy the moral of the story in 's words   what lampert failed to see is that humans actually have a natural inclination to work for the mutual benefit of an organization they like to cooperate and collaborate and they often work more productively when they have shared goals take all of that away and you create a company that will destroy itself

that is false that amazon loses money with predatory pricing   they are making a bucket load of money    they are just a hell of a lot more efficient than the department stores that are being replaced by internet sales and advanced logistics      you might point out an example of a product sold below cost   when a department store is running a loss years on year or running a clearance at a loss is n't that predatory against amazon    retail is a brutal business

here 's a good definition of a consumer loan what is a consumer loan b. pointed out there are some states california loves to be the oddball does n't it that treat some loans in a more unconventional manner but the gist of it is that a consumer loan is normally unsecured meaning there 's no collateral or lien associated with it   a signature loan would be a good example of a consumer loan   many times loans made by non banks finance companies that loan for consumer purchases for instance would be considered to be consumer loans i hope this helps good luck
