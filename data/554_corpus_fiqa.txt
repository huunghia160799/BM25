i am 17 and currently have a loan out for a car my parents also have terrible credit and because i knew this i was able to get around it your co signer on your loan does not have to be your parent at least in wisconsin i used my grandmother who has excellent credit as my cosigner with my loan we had made it so it does n't hurt her credit if i do n't get my payments in on time maybe this is something for you to look into

depending on the state this might not be possible loans are considered contracts and various states regulate how minors may enter into them for example in the state of oregon a minor may not enter into a contract without their parent being on the contract as well so you are forced to wait until you turn 18 at that time you wo n't have a credit history and to lenders that often is worse than having bad credit i ca n't help with the car other than to recommend you buy a junker for $ and just live with it for now but you could certainly get a secured credit card or line of credit from your local bank the way they are arranged is you make a deposit of an amount of your choosing generally at least $ 200 for credit cards and $ 1,000 for lines of credit and receive a revolving line with a limit of that same amount as you use and pay on this loan it will be reported in your credit history if you start that now by the time you turn 18 you will have much better options for purchasing vehicles

you should learn about it its a great program doctors in their residency or fellowship are on a visa the visa says they must leave the us and go home for two years before returning to the u.s. so to say foreign doctors affecting supply is not accurate its actually a crazy harsh rule that protects american doctors and artificially keeps americans wages higher because you know the foreign doctor has to go home even if they are the best in your class so your point about immigrants keeping wages low may be true in other cases like tech the problem occurs when the american doctors want to serve in metro areas with good homes good private schools for their kids communities and hipster restaurants and art so even though the american doctors are protected even though an graduates wages are higher because half their class was sent back to india most of the us wo nt get an american born doctor even if they wanted one   so if you 're a state like iowa or nebraska or the and you have no major attractions to lure doctors no art no houses and major shortages of doctors in your area the federal gov't gives each state 30 waivers so if you 're a hospital a couple miles outside of des iowa it does n't make sense to send a perfectly well trained home   to india when you need one now otherwise your 20,000 people do n't have a heart doctor a program to protect american workers from foreign workers actually leads foreign workers to protect lives in addition your point about wages is wrong rural areas across the us pay the most because they are the most desperate the supply of doctors wanting to practice in la chicago new york is very high so the compensation is actually low its the rural doctors in small town america making in the percentile many of them reject the great money on offer because who wants go practice in a town in the middle of nevada the numbers are produced by your point about medical schools not increasing class sizes in correct that is a problem however that is not without consequence we have seen nurse practitioners scope of medicine begin to creep into family doctors scope to med schools refuse to increase class sizes so because their is such a shortage practices and clinics now are hiring np 's which affects supply and hurts wages of primary care doctors so foreign doctors are not causing wages to go down infact if you were an american family doctor your main worry is american nurse practitioners provides all the data on this for you to enjoy lol in summary i get it i own a business supply and demand is everything but with medicine its complicated small town alabama needs a doctor too who s actually a world class that could be working at the mayo clinic chooses to practice in small town alabama just to stay here that small town gets a doctor does nt have to go home foreigners are not always the enemy of capitalism sometimes they keep it alive pay attention next time you are in a small town that foreign doctor is probably awesome

no something does n't seem right here   there would be virtually no time value to the option 10 minutes before market close on the expiration day what option is it and what is the expiration edit it appears you were looking only at the ask price it was $ however the bid price was only $ 1.35 and the last transaction was $ 1.40 so the true value is right about $ 1.35 to $ 1.40 at this second   this is a pitfall that tends to occur when you trade options with almost no volume for instance the open interest in that option is only 1 contract assuming that is yours so the bid and the ask can often be very far apart as they are only being generated by computer traders or the result of outdated irrelevant human orders

i 'm not entirely sure about some of the details in your question since i think you meant to use $ 10,000 as the value of the futures contract and $ 3 as the value of the underlying stock those numbers would make more sense that being said i can give you a simple example of how to calculate the profit and loss from a leveraged futures contract for the sake of simplicity i 'll use a well known futures contract the e mini s&p500 contract each e mini is worth $ 50 times the value of the s&p 500 index and has a tick size of 0.25 so the minimum price change is 0.25 $ 50 = $ 12.50   here 's an example say the current value of the s&p500 is 1,600 the value of each contract is therefore $ 50 1,600 = $ 80,000 you purchase one contract on margin with an initial margin of 5 or $ 4,000 if the s&p 500 index rises to the value of your futures contract increases to $ 50 = $ once you return the 80,000 4,000 = $ that you borrowed as leverage your profit is = $ 4,500   since you used $ 4,000 of your own funds as an initial margin your profit excluding commissions is 4,500 4,000 = $ 500 which is a = 12.5 return if the index dropped to the value of your futures contract decreases to $ 50 = $ after you return the $ in leverage you 're left with $ 3,000 or a net loss of 3,000 = the math illustrates why using leverage increases your risk but also increases your potential for return consider the first scenario in which the index increases to if you had forgone using margin and spent $ 80,000 of your own funds your profit would be 80,000 = this is smaller than your leveraged profit by a factor of 20 the inverse of the margin requirement .05 = 12.5 in this case the use of leverage dramatically increased your rate of return   however in the case of a decrease you spent $ 80,000 but gained $ for a loss of only 1.25 this is 20 times smaller in magnitude than your negative return when using leverage by forgoing leverage you 've decreased your opportunity for upside but also decreased your downside risk 1 for futures contracts the margin requirements are set by the exchange which is cme group in the case of the e mini the 5 in my example is higher than the actual margin requirement which is currently $ usd per contract but it keeps the numbers simple also note that cme group refers to the initial margin as the performance bond instead

the money for unemployment insurance was taken out of their paychecks so why should n't they get the payments   most unemployment insurance money goes right back into the economy anyway so this pocketed conclusion is more of a weasel word argument than anything else   furthermore this is millionaire households and not millionaires   one projection put the cost of this at $ 2 million a year so it is n't even really significant compared to the rest of the federal budget

do i need to pay for an inspection or am i likely to save enough money from skipping it to cover potential problems that they would have caught   a home inspection costs hundreds of dollars   the average is $   inspections regularly catch things that cost tens of thousands of dollars to fix e.g. a new roof or a cracked foundation    you also might find that a home inspection is required for your mortgage    do i need a realtor or can i do their job myself unless you are a licensed realtor or you buy directly from a seller without a realtor the fee charged to the seller will be the same regardless of whether you have a realtor   the seller 's realtor will share the fee with your realtor if you have one   so you can do the work yourself perhaps not as well but you wo n't save money by doing so    if you have a lot of flexibility in when you purchase you could look for especially cheap properties with motivated sellers   arrange financing ahead of time before you find a house so you can close quickly   some sellers will give you a discounted price to finish the sale quickly   even small savings on the price of a house will outweigh most savings on closing costs

the ancient roman 's paid for things in silver there were 2 main methods of silver production a mine or a neighbor and taking their silver   silver was in use by many of rome 's neighbors the tribal regions did n't accept it and the taxation method was imposed   however the roman 's also practiced money as debt just as the original poster stated caesar himself took a million pound loan to finance his bread and campaign eventually rome was saddled with such enormous debt that it is given as one of the possible factors in it 's decline and fall   money originated not to pay taxes but to replace barter once the utility of it as paying taxes to a government became known the forces leading to standardization and central banking develop taxation is a key step on the ladder toward developing a central currency it is however not the only one

i believe the reason is because society and the economy is set up a certain way and re enforced by the government your options are so people usually go with the most attractive of their limited options getting a mortgage if you want to dig deeper do some research as to why housing is expensive some things to consider you need the government 's permission to build houses thus limiting the competition in the home building market the housing bubble artificially setting house prices etc to summarize people need mortgages because houses are expensive and houses are expensive for many reasons big ones having to do with the government

this is more of a long comment but may answer user 's situation too i have dealt with joint mortgages before in 3 states in the us   basically in all three states if one party wants to sell the home goes up for sale   this can be voluntary or it can go up via auction not a great choice in 2 of the 3 states the first person to respond to the court about the property the other party pays all legal fees   yes you read this right   in one case i had an ex who was on my mortgage she had no money invested in the house $ 0 down and still in college with no job   if she was n't on the mortgage i would n't have gotten loan old days of dumb rules when we split her lawyer was using the house as a way to extort other money from me   knowing the state 's laws i already filed a petition for the property but put it on hold with the clerk   meaning that no one else could file but if someone tried mine would no longer be on hold   my ex literally spent thousands of dollars on this attorney and they wanted to sell the house and get half the money from the house   so sale price minus loan amount divided between us   this is the law in almost every state if there is no formal contract   i was laughing because she wanted what would be maybe 50 75 k for paying no rent no money down and me paying for her college finally i broke her attorney down i did n't lawyer up but had many friends who were lawyers advising   after i told her lawyer she was n't getting anything might have said it in not a nice way her lawyer gave me her break down   to paraphrase she said we are going to file now   my assistant is in the court clerk 's office   you can tell the court whatever you want   maybe they will give you a greater percentage since you put the money down and paid for everything but you are taking that chance   but you will pay for your lawyer and you will need one   and you will pay for me the entire time   and this will be a lengthy process   you would be better served to pay my client half now her office was about 2 blocks from court   i laughed at her and simply told her to have her assistant do whatever she wanted   i then left to go to clerk 's office to take the hold off   she had beat me to the office i moved my car out of her garage   by the time i got there she was outside yelling at her assistant throwing a fit and papers were flying everywhere   we settled the next day   she got nothing other than the things she had already stolen from me   if i would n't have known about this loophole my ex would have gotten or cost me through attorney 's fees around 40 50 k for basically hiring a lawyer   my ex did n't really have any money so i am pretty sure lawyer was getting a percent moral of the story in any contract like this you always want to be the one bringing in the least amount of money   there are no laws that i know of in any country where the person with the least amount on a contract will come out worse   like i said in the us the best case scenario that i know of for joint property is that the court pays out the stakeholder all of their contributions then it splits things 50/50   this is given no formal contract that the court   do n't even get me started with hiring attorneys because i have seen the courts throw out so many property contracts it is n't even funny   one piece of advice on a contract if you do one   make it open and about percentages   party a contributes 50 k party b 10 k party a will pay this of mortgage and maintenance and will get this when home is sold   i have found the more specific things are the more loopholes for getting out of them there are goofy ass laws everywhere that make no sense   why would the person first filing get their lawyers paid for   the court systems in almost all countries can have their comical corners    you will never be able to write a contract that covers everything   if the shower handle breaks who pays for it   there is just too many one off things with a house you are in essence getting in a relationship with this person   i hear others say it is a business transaction    no   you are living with this person   there is no way to make it purely business   for you to be happy with this outcome both of you must remain somewhat friends and at the very least civil with each other    to add on to the previous point the biggest risk is this other person 's character and state of mind   they are putting in the most money so you do n't exactly have a huge money risk   you do have a time and a time cost risk   your time or the money you do have in this may be tied up in trying to get your money out or house sold   a jerk could basically say that you get nothing and make you the court system for a couple years to get a few thousand back and that is n't the worst case scenario   always know your worst case scenario   yours is this dude is in love with you   when he figures out 2 3 years later after making you feel uncomfortable the entire time that you are not in love with him he starts going nuts   so he systematically destroys your house   your house worth plummets you want out you ca n't sell the house for price of loan lenders foreclose or look to sue you you pay double rent because you ca n't live with the guy and you have to push a scooter to get to work that is just the worst case scenario   would i do this if i were 25 and had no family   yea why not if i trusted the other person and was friends with them   if it were just a co worker   that is really iffy with me     edit author said he will not be living with the person   so wording can be changed to say potentially in front of living with him in my examples

usually not the total interest but all interest accrued and unpaid to date this is called the loan payoff amount and repays the bank their principal plus the true cost of capital on that principal since your last amortized payment which is probably never since you just signed the loan papers there may also be a prepayment penalty this is something that should have been disclosed to you if it exists but it 's fairly rare in u.s. mortgages anymore   the theory is the bank got the money they paid you at the start of the loan by selling a bond package backed by your mortgage and others of similar credit history and/or about the same time a mortgage backed security by turning around and paying early you meet your obligation but the bank is now stuck with at least 10 years of quarterly coupon payments on that bond which they were expecting to pay using your mortgage interest for their trouble you would pay an additional amount that either covers their call price on the portion of the bonds used for your principal or simply buys them the time to re issue a new mortgage using your repaid principal to back the bond again in the modern housing market such a prepayment penalty is very rare because so many lenders are willing to give you a mortgage without one and so many buyers balk at the thought of having to pay more if they pay early the whole point is to pay less by paying early just something to look up in your mortgage documentation

oh god you 're one of those people normally i do n't feed trolls but i 'm bored today so here goes   first i ask for peer reviewed literature and you respond with blog posts newspaper articles and links to   now to business i 'm not going to address what 's discussed in the versions of the stories you shared they are just journalists take on a few studies instead i 'll address the study itself which i 'm guessing you did n't bother to read    first study you indirectly linked gt;the results were n’t what we expected but they tie in with previous research on addiction which has found that substance people who are dependent on cocaine or for example have altered systems   i 'm not exactly seeing how that proves your point of course chronic drug addicts are not going to be productive members of society but nobody is debating that    gt;it could also explain the which has been described in cannabis users but whether such a syndrome exists is controversial   so this very study doubt on the phenomena you describe   gt;we only looked at cannabis users who have had like experiences while using the drug   hmm hardly seems like these results should be applied to the general population of all cannabis users then    second study you indirectly linked   gt;it has also been proposed that long term cannabis users might also have problems with motivation even when they are not high however we compared people dependent on cannabis to similar controls when neither group was and did not find a difference in motivation   so this study literally the core tenant of your overall argument thanks for the link    third article you linked is shit it does n't give us details on the study no a link to the research it just cherry picks a few quotes thankfully it does refer to the same research linked in your fifth article which i 'll discuss shortly but seriously kid you did n't bother to actually read any of these did you   fourth study you indirectly linked is literally the same study referenced in the second article you did n't read any of these did you   fifth study you indirectly linked as i said before it 's the same research discussed in the third link and here 's the really important part    gt; we do not to report a causal ship between cannabis dependence and economic social   problems cannabis dependence could be a marker of a   life trajectory characterized by social and economic adversity   you do know the difference between correlation and causation right but seriously this was actually a really good bit of research that i enjoyed reading and it does bring up a few points that support your point of view if you can be bothered reading articles that do n't have pictures give this one a shot   sixth study you indirectly linked again pretty hard to discuss because the denver post did not bother to include a link to the research itself but again i think you 're confusing correlation with causation all this article proves is that like cigarette use marijuana use is more strongly concentrated among lower income americans there is no claim that marijuana use caused these people to earn less money that 's your own opinion and it 's not supported by any facts     now where is that bitch slap you mentioned

you 'd have to look at the terms of the loan to be sure but if the interest compounds weekly then you 'd have to calculate the effect of 3 compounding periods then compute for weekly payments the balance after 3 weeks would be using excel 's pmt function for that principal balance i get a weekly payment of $    if the interest does n't compound the principal balance will be about $ and the weekly payment would be $ note however that the terms of the loan could be completely customized so you 'd need to be sure that the payment and the amortization schedule make sense to you before you agree to the loan   since the interest is very high i suspect this is a no credit needed car loan which are notorious for unfavorable to the borrower terms

the answer is yes and the reason is if today 's interest rates are lower than the interest rate coupon at which the bond was issued the bond 's lifetime value is 100 cents on the dollar that 's the principal repayment that the investor will get on the maturity date but suppose the bond 's coupon rate is 4 while today 's interest rate is 3 then people who bought the bond at 100 would get 4 on their money while everyone else was getting 3 to compensate a three year bond would have to rise to almost 103 so that the so called yield to maturity would be 3 then there would be a capital loss from almost 103 to 100 that would exactly offset the extra interest that is 1 more for three years if today 's interest rates are negative as they were from time to time in the 1930s and in the present decade the negative interest rates will prevent the buyer from getting the lifetime value as defined by the op of principal plus interest over the original life of the bond this happens in a flight to quality situation where people are willing to take a small capital loss on treasuries in order to prevent a large possible loss from bank failures like those that took place in 2008

basically there are 2 ways you can make money from an investment through income eg rent or dividends and through the price of the investment going up capital growth or gains most people associate negative gearing with investment properties but it can be done with shares and other investments where you borrow money to buy the investment and it produces an income of some sort if the investment does not produce an income then you can not negative gear it using a property as an example in australia if all your expenses each month loan interest payments council and water rates insurance and/or strata advertising and management fees depreciation and maintenance expense are greater than your income rent then you are negative gearing the investment property this is a monthly loss on your investment which can be used to offset and reduce the amount of tax you pay during the year so most people negative gearing an investment property will get a nice sum back when they do their tax returns the problem with negative gearing is that you have to lose money in order to save some tax so as an example if you are on a marginal tax rate of 30 for every $ 1 you lose from the investment property you will save in tax if your marginal tax rate is 45 then will save in tax for every $ 1 lost on the investment property thus negative gearing becomes more tax effective the higher your income and tax bracket but you are still losing money overall the problem is that most novice investors buy an investment property for the main purpose of reducing their taxes this can be dangerous because the main reason to buy any investment should be that you consider it to be a good investment not to save you tax because if the investment is not a good one then you will not only lose money on the income side but also on the capital side negative gearing should be looked at as a bonus or additional benefit when a good investment to buy not as the reason to buy the investment

down payment emphatically avoid pmi if at all possible it 's pouring money down the drain do 20 down if you can or pay off enough to bring you above 20 and ask for pmi to be removed as soon as you can beyond that it 's a matter of how much risk you want to accept and how long you 'll own the place and you 'll have to run the numbers for the various alternatives allowing for uncertainty in your investments to guide your decision do not assume you will be able to make a profit when you sell the house that 's the mistake which left many people under water and/or foreclosed on do not assume that you will be able to sell it quickly it can take a year of more do not assume immediate or 100 occupancy it you rent it out see many other answers here for more realistic numbers and remember that running a rental is a business and has ongoing costs and hassles you can contract those out but then you lose a good percentage of the rent income double mortgage is another great way to dig yourself into a financial hole it can be a bigger cost than the pmi it tries to dodge and is definitely a bigger risk do n't

there are several camps for stock valuation and much of it boils down to your investment style   a growth investor will not consider something with a 50x p e ratio to be overvalued but a value investor certainly would i would recommend looking up the fama french n factor model it was i believe they have released newer papers which introduce other factors and reading the intelligent investor by benjamin graham   graham 's methodology is practically canon for many investors and the methodology focuses on value while outlining quantitative factors for determining if a stock is under or over valued

i would recommend reading intelligent investor first it was written slightly more recently than security analysis 1934 more important is that a recently revised edition of intelligent investor was published the preface and were written by warren buffett intelligent investor is more practical as an introduction for a novice you may decide not to read security analysis at all as it seems more like an academic text or professional 's guide i.e. for accounting benjamin graham 's intelligent investor remains relevant it is used successfully as a guide for value investing despite the of market sentiment and day to day variations even extreme volatility for example i just read a nice article about applying the value investing principles in intelligent investor a few weeks ago it was written in the context of current markets which is amazing to be so applicable despite the passage of decades for reference you might want to glance at this book review published in march 2010 of the original 1934 edition of security analysis      the url links to a one paragraph summary by u.s. news world report it does not link to a book sales website

afaik money is a fiat currency the penny is only worth what the us government says it it worth if i choose to have my coin material made into pennies then i face an opportunity cost because i could of used that copper elsewhere if a penny worth of copper is worth 1.8 cents and i choose to make it into a a coin with a value of 1 cent then my opportunity cost is .8 cents   the whole point of a fiat currency is to take the actual material value of the money out of the equation a gold coin back before fiat currencies was worth its weight in gold this would be like saying that you are going to nominally change the value of your gold coin into a coin worth half of its weight its is equal to 1 gold coin but its spending power is equal to 1/2 a gold coin   do you lose value of course not do you lose spending power yes fiat currency is all about spending power the value is fictional    when i make the spending power less than the value the purpose of a fiat currency breaks down

in a comment you say   if the market crashes does n't regress to the mean mean that i should still expect 7 over the long run that being the case would n't i benefit from intentionally my portfolio and going all in on equities i can can still rebalance using new savings no   regress to the mean just tells you that the future rate is likely to average 7   the past rate and the future rate are entirely   consider a series    the running average is   that running average is slowly to the long term mean without ever a member of the series being above 7    real markets actually go farther than this though   real value may be increasing by 7 per year but prices may move differently   then market prices may revert to the real value   this happened to the s&p 500 in 2000 2002   then the market started climbing again in 2003   in your system you would have bought into the falling markets of 2001 and 2002   and you would have missed the positive bond returns in those years   that 's about a annual shift in returns on that portion of your portfolio   since that 's a third of your portfolio you 'd have lost 8 more than with the balanced strategy each of those two years    note that in that case the market was in an over valued bubble   the bubble spent three years popping and the actual value   so 2003 was a good year for stocks   but the three year return was still   in retrospect investors should have gone all in on bonds before 2000 and switched back to stocks for 2003   but no one knew that in 2000   people in the know actually started backing off in 1998 rather than 2000 and missed out on the tail end of the bubble    the rebalancing strategy automatically helps with your regression to the mean   it sells expensive bonds and buys cheaper stocks on average   occasionally it sells modest priced bonds and buys over priced stocks   but rarely enough that it is a better strategy overall    incidentally i would consider a 33 share high for bonds   30 is better   and that should n't increase as you age less than 30 bonds may be practical when you are young enough   once you get close to retirement five to ten years start converting some of your savings to cash equivalents   the cash equivalents are guaranteed not to lose value but might not gain much   this gives you predictable returns for your immediate expenses   once retired try to keep about five years of expenses in cash equivalents   then you do n't have to worry about short term market fluctuations   spend down your buffer until the market catches back up    it 's true that bonds are less volatile than stocks but they can still have bad years   a 70%/30 mix of stocks bonds is safer than either alone and gives almost as good of a return as stocks alone   adding more bonds actually increases your risk unless you carefully balance them with the right stocks   and if you 're doing that you do n't need simplistic rules like a 70%/30 balance

there is a highly related question which is much easier to answer what normally value increasing news about a company would cause that company to fall in value in the public stock market by answering that we can answer your question by proxy the answer to that question being anything that makes investors believe that the company wo n't be able to maintain the level of profit for example let 's say a company announces a 300 profit growth compared to the previous year this should push the stock upwards maybe not by 300 but certainly by quite a bit let 's also say that this company is in the business of designing manufacturing and selling some highly useful gadget that lots of people want to buy now suppose that the company managed such an profit increase by one of in scenario 1 firing the engineering department it is highly unlikely that the company will be able to come up with manufacture and sell a next generation gadget hence while profit is up now it is highly likely to go down in the months and years coming up because stock market investors are more interested in future profits than in past profits this should push the value of the company down in scenario 2 selling off the machinery the company may very well be able to come up with a next generation gadget and if they can manufacture it they might very well be able to sell it however no matter how you slice it the short term costs for manufacturing either their current generation gadget or the next generation gadget are bound to go up because the company will either need to rent machinery or buy new machinery neither is good for future profits so the value of the company again should go down in response in scenario 3 their product getting a large boost the company still has all the things that allowed them to come up with produce and sell gadgets they also have every opportunity to come up with manufacture and sell next generation gadgets which implies that future profits while far from guaranteed are likely in this case the probability remains high that the company can actually maintain a higher level of profit hence the value of the company should rise now apply this to a slightly more realistic scenario and you can see why the value of a company can fall even if the company announces for example record profits hence you are looking for news which indicate a present and sustained raised ability to turn a profit this is the type of news that should drive any stock up in price all else being equal obviously buyer beware your mileage may vary all else is never equal nothing ever hits the average you are fighting people who do this type of analysis for a living and have every tool known available to them etc etc but that 's the general idea

the reason they have this massive debt is largely not entirely because they have been employing keynes policies and spending more than they had for so many years as it is austerity is not the solution however reckless spending is not the solution either a lot of people arguing for keynesian policies not a bad idea in most recessions do n't grasp that investors have a limited amount of money to invest and are n't going to place it in a country that has as bad of a debt problem as you pointed out   so many people keep arguing these struggling countries need to spend more while that would help expand their economies it is not feasible where do you guys going to think the money is going to come from if investors do n't want to provide then they have to print more money which creates the risk of hyperinflation   spending could help a little maybe if it was a realistic thing to do right now any keynesian solutions are a fairy tale countries like greece need to do what they can with the resources available to them instead of spending like a bunch of millionaire on crystal meth look at the u.s. we have spent trillions and our gdp is still growing at only slightly more than half the rate it has from 2012 if people expect massive government spending to be a fix to these problems then we are a clear case that it is n't i acknowledge we could be a lot worse and possibly still be seeing a contraction without the spending but it clearly is n't fixing our problems and sooner or later we wo n't be able to take on more debt to fix it we need real solutions to generate real growth instead of dicking around like this other western countries need to do the same   edit also what we are doing right now would not be considered keynesian solutions keynes would advocate spending money to fix the problems not just dumping money into the economy that is something i would agree with but since our politicians ca n't grasp that i do n't want them in control of the purse strings anymore

from chase faq it looks like this is a regular ach transfer ach transactions can be reversed under certain conditions i have n't been able to find some authoritative link on this so i suggest this budgeting blog instead allowed reasons you can have ach transactions reversed for one of three reasons under    the rules wrong money amount wrong account or    transactions for example if your mortgage bill is for $ but    your lender 's website messes up and you 're charged $ the    transaction is reversible it because it 's the wrong dollar amount if    the website charges you $ twice the second    transaction is reversible reversal procedures you might have to bring a mistake to the originator 's attention to get    it fixed only the originator the person or company taking or    sending money can ask for a reversal for example if you have a    transaction for a wrong dollar amount from your lender 's website the    originator is the lender an originator is supposed to send the    reversal within 24 hours of the error 's discovery and within five    banking days of the original transaction when a reversal is required    because of a wrong amount or wrong account the originator must send a    correcting entry with the right information bank 's responsibility a bank should honor an ach reversal even if it means debiting a    customer 's account again because of a correcting transaction however    the bank does n't have to debit your account if you closed it or the    new transaction would overdraw it your bank does have to tell you if    a correcting entry is going to take money out of your account but the    bank does n't need your permission to do it

in general the other party will expect you to keep your promises if you promise to do something for a fixed amount of money you take on a risk and it is no longer their problem if you work slower than you planned in principle it could even be the case that you take on a project and fail after which the company may not have to pay at all so regardless of how things should be written in your books for example a theoretical pay above minimum wage but a loss for your private company an important thing to note is that if you are worried about ending up below minimum wage you are definitely asking a fee that is too low you should keep in mind that your fee should include a fair compensation for the expected work and a fair compensation for the risk that you have taken on

inflation is what happens it is not good or bad in and of itself   but consider the following in a thriving economy with low unemployment people are buying buying buying   people are not saving for later they are buying now   industry is also making purchases   now   from economics 101 high demand for goods services leads to relative scarcity leading to higher prices   inflation tends to be one byproduct of a thriving economy   governments want the thriving economy that brings inflation with it

shared a chart that showed how investors in european junk bonds are willing to accept the same no default return as they are for u.s. treasury bonds in other words the yield on european junk bonds is about the same between 2 percent and 3 percent as the yield on u.s. treasuries even though the risk profile of the two could not be more different   sounds like a strong indicator to me how might this play out in the us

this is ridiculous of course some companies do n't pay taxes each year off the top of my head nol 's net operating losses can be carried forward 20 years and will definitely reduce tax liability for that matter a loss during any year prevents paying income tax though sales property ad and other taxes may apply other companies may get capital credits green credits or other subsidies that might prevent a tax liability none of these indicate that a corporation is getting away with anything the irs is a lot better at its job than most people think   the point is you ca n't look at any individual year and make an accurate assessment of a company 's or even an individual 's tax burden it 's completely dishonest reporting   source i 'm a state tax auditor and my job is to make sure corporations pay what they are supposed to   edit additionally 2010 was the heart of the recession for a lot of companies there were a lot of corporations that took losses that year so to say that ge took in billion and paid no taxes is misleading you have to say why they paid no taxes or you 're just blowing hot air taxes are assessed on income not there is a big difference

both states will want to tax you your tax home is where you maintain a domicile are registered to vote etc and you will probably want to keep this as ma since you state that ma is your permanent residence and you are staying in a rented place in pa but be careful about voter registration that is one of the items that can be used to determine your state of residence   ok so if you and your spouse are ma residents   you should file jointly as residents in ma and as nonresidents in pa do the calculations on the nonresident return first and then the calculations on the resident   return typically on a nonresident tax return the calculations are effectively the following report all your income usually agi from the federal return   call this $ x. compute the pa state tax due on $ x.   note that you follow the rules for nonresidents in doing this not the calculations used by pa residents call the amount of tax you computed as $ y. what part of the total income $ x is attributable to pa sources if this amount is $ z then you owe pa $ y times z x on the resident return in ma you will likely get some credit for the taxes paid to pa and this will reduce your ma tax burden usually the maximum credit is limited to the lesser of actual tax paid to pa and what you would have had to pay ma for the same income as far as withholding is concerned your employer in pa will withhold pa taxes as if you are a pa resident but you can adjust the amount via the pa equivalent of irs form w4 so as to account for any additional   tax that might be due because you will be filing as a nonresident   else you can pay estimated taxes via the pa equivalent of irs form 1040es similarly your wife can adjust her withholding to account for the ma taxes that you will owe on the joint income or you can pay estimated taxes to ma too note that it is unlikely that your employer in pennsylvania will withhold   massachusetts taxes and send them to massachusetts for you e.g. if it is a ma and pa store but there may be special deals available if   your employer does business in both states i.e. is a ma and pa store

it sounds for the most part you are a buy and hold type investor and continue to contribute monthly   i follow the same philosophy and continue to contribute monthly as well   i use as my online broker for trading it costs a penny per share with a minimum cost of $ 4.95 so if you only buy 100 shares you will still pay $ 4.95 up to a maximum of $ per trade so if you buy 10,000 shares you only pay $ three trades at $ 4.95 per month across the year would be $   this is assuming you are trading less then share each trade   so switching to questrade would save you an additional $ per year   multiply over number of year before you retire plus compound interest which could accrue and that can quite a bit of extra savings you pay nothing else to questrade either   no management fees etc   you manage the accounts

because swing trading is n't the only reason to buy a stock and it 's not the only way to make money on a stock   i do not have the expertise to make advice one way or the other but i personally i feel swing trading is one of the worse ways to invest in the stock market to answer your specific questions in the previous post i outlined a naive trade intended to make $ 1,000 off a $ 10k buy but it was shown this would likely fail even if the stock price would have increased by 10 had i not placed the trade another way to state this is that my trade would disrupt the stock price and not in my favor at all so that means i 'd have to settle for a smaller trade if i bought $ 100 worth of the stock that size of a buy would n't be too disruptive i might succeed and get $ 10 out of the trade 10 of $ 100 but my trade fee was $ 8 or so to summarize you are completely correct that even hoping for gains of 10 on a consistent basis in other words after every single trade is totally unrealistic   you already seem to understand that swing trading on low volume stocks is pointless   but your last question was so how do people make any significant money trading low volume stocks if they even do i assume money is made since the stocks are bought and sold i have some guesses but i 'd like to hear from the experts and in a comment then if no one does make significant money trading these stocks what are they doing there on the market   the answer is that the buying and selling is mostly likely not by swing traders   it 's by investors that believe in the company   the company is on the market because the company believes public trading to be an advantageous position for them to receive capital investments and there are people out there who think that transaction makes sense   in other words real investing

i took a second mortgage when i moved house because i had a long term fixed rate mortgage that would have incurred punitive fees if i had cancelled it rather than doing that i took a second mortgage over the same term for the difference as my second mortgage was with the same lender they still had first charge on the property this means that in the event of default they have first call on the property to recoup their losses so the interest rate was not higher actually it was slightly less than my first mortgage my case is not that usual normally a second mortgage is with a separate provider that takes a second charge on the property the interest rates are normally higher as a result as there is more chance that the lender will not recoup their money in case of a default as the first charge has priority the second mortgage may still be cheaper than an unsecured loan as the second charge provides some collateral this might make it attractive if a sudden expense needs to be covered

not at all impossible what you need is fundamental analysis and relationship with your investment if you are just buying shares not sure you can have those i will provide examples from my personal experience   my mother has barely high school education when she saw house and land prices in bulgaria she thought it 's impossibly cheap we lived on rent in israel our horrible apartment was worth $ 1 m and it was horrible we could never imagine buying it because we were middle class at best my mother insisted that we all sell whatever we have and buy land and houses in bulgaria one house for example went from $ 20k to between 2001 and 2007 but we knew bulgaria we knew how to buy we knew lawyers we knew builders   the company i currently work for when i joined share prices were around 240 2006 they are now 2015 at 1500 i did n't buy because i was repaying mortgage at 5 i am very sorry i did n't everybody knew 240 is not a real share price for our company an established + 30 years software company with piles of cash we were not a hot startup outsiders did n't invest many developers and finance people who work in the company made a fortune again relationship knowledge   i bought a house in the uk in 2012 everyone knew house prices were about to go up i was lucky i had a friend who was a he told me buy now or lose money i bought a little house for 200k it is now worth not double but pretty good money   my point is take your investment personally do n't just dump money into something once you are an insider your risk will be almost mitigated and you could buy where you see an opportunity and sell when you feel you are near the maximal real worth of your investment it 's not hard to analyse it 's hard to make a commitment

there has been almost no inflation during 2014 2015 do you mean rental price inflation or overall inflation housing price and by extension rental price inflation is usually much higher than the basket of goods cpi or numbers the low levels of these two indicators are mostly caused by technology oil and food price deflation at least in the us uk and europe other inflation my slightly biased i 've just moved to a new rental property and entirely london centric empirical evidence suggests that 5 is quite a low figure for house price inflation and therefore also rental inflation your landlord will also try to get as much for the property as he can so look around for similar properties and work out what a market rate might be within tolerances of course and negotiate based on that for the new asked price i could get a similar apartment in similar condos with gym and pool this one does n't have anything or in a way better area closer to supermarkets restaurants etc suggests that you have already started on this and that the landlord is trying to artificially inflate rents if you can afford the extra 5 and these similar but better appointed places are at that price why not move it sounds like the reason that you are looking to stay on in this apartment is either familiarity or loyalty to the landlord so it may be time to benefit from a move

in theory in a perfect world what you state is almost true apart from transaction fees if you assume that the market is perfectly efficient ie public information is immediately reflected in a perfect reflection of future share value in all share prices when the information becomes available then in theory any transaction you would choose to take is opposed by a reasonable person who is not taking advantage of you just moving their position around this would make any and all transactions completely reasonable from a cost benefit perspective   ie if the future value of all dividends to be paid by apple ie the value of holding a share in apple exactly matches apple 's share price of $ 1,000 then buying a share for $ 1,000 is an even trade selling a share for $ 1,000 is also an even trade now in a perfectly efficient market which we have assumed then there is no edge to valuing a company using your own methods if you take apple 's financial statements press releases reported information and if you apply modern financial theory to evaluate the future dividends from apple you should get the same $ 1,000 share price that the market has already arrived at so in this example why would n't you just throw darts at a printout of the s&p 500 and invest in whatever it lands on because even if the perfectly efficient market agrees on the true value of something different investments have different characteristics as an example consider a simple comparison of corporate bonds corporations make bond offerings to the public allowing individual investors to effectively lend money to the corporation for a future benefit for simplicity assume a bond with a face value the amount to be repaid to the investor on maturity of $ 1,000 has these 3 defining characteristics 1 the price what the investor pays to acquire it 2 interest payments how much if any the corporation will pay to the investor before maturity and when those payments will be made and 3 a bond rating which is a third party assessment of how risky the bond is based on the health of the corporation now if the bond rating agency is perfect in its risk assessment and if the price of all bond 's is fair then why does it matter who you loan your money to it matters because different people want different things out of their investments if you are waiting to make a down payment on a house next year then you do n't want risk you want to be certain that you will get your cash back even if it means lower returns so even though a high risk bond may be perfectly priced it should only be bought by someone willing to bear that risk if you are retired and you need your bonds to pay you interest regularly as your sole source of income then of course a zero coupon bond one that pays no interest is not helpful to you if you are young and have a long time to invest then you may want risk because you have time to overcome losses and you want to get the most return possible in addition taxes are not universal between all investors some people benefit from things that would be tax heavy to their neighbors for example in canada there is a dividend tax credit which reduces the taxes owing on dividends received by a corporation this credit exists to prevent double taxation because otherwise the corporation would pay its ~30 of tax and then a wealthy investor would pay another of tax due to the mechanics of how the credit is calculated however someone who makes less money gets an even lower tax bill than they normally would this means that someone making under the top tax bracket in canada has a tax benefit by receiving dividends this means that while 2 stocks may be both fairly priced if one pays dividends and the other does n't ie if the other company instead reinvests more heavily in future projects creating even more value for shareholders down the road then someone in the bottom tax brackets may want the dividend paying stock more than the other in conclusion picking investments yourself does require some knowledge to prevent yourself from making a bad buy this is because the market is not perfectly efficient as well specific market mechanics make some trades more costly than they should be in theory consider for example transaction fees and tax mechanics finally even if you assume that all of the above is irrelevant as a theoretical idea different investors still have different needs just because $ 1,000,000 is the fair price for a factory in your home town does n't mean you might as well convert your retirement savings to buy it as your sole asset

as this is anonymous can you give us actual numbers i can make guesses based on your percentages but it would help lets assume you both make $ 35k since you said child care would take up the bulk of your wife 's income it must be fairly low incomes the answer usually is n't a simple do this but small adjustments in your lifestyle which add up church offering is 17 the standard is 10 lower it it 's the most obvious large non required expense transportation is almost 10 of your income if my numbers are right that is somewhere around $ 500 per month what kind of car cars do you have there are very cheap used cars which cost very little in upkeep fuel is it possible your cars are more expensive than needed my wife and i bought a used car for around $ 8k in cash a few years ago still running strong only have done oil changes since then food is 12 which would be perhaps $ 600 or $ 700 per month that seems awfully high maybe i 'm wrong about your salaries you said you were cheap but now the numbers do n't add up mortgage of 35 $ 2k with escrow if i 'm guessing on salaries right seems reasonable i 'm assuming you do n't want to downsize particularly if you 're going to have kids do you have a great mortgage rate i assume you 're on a 30 year fixed already

my answer is not specific or even maybe applicable to microsoft companies do n't want to cut dividends so they have a fixed expense but the cashflow that funds it might be quite or cyclical depending on the industry another more general issue is that taking on debt to retire shares is a capital allocation decision a company needs capital to operate this is why they went public in the first place to raise capital debt is a cheaper form of capital than equity equity holders are last in line in a bankruptcy bondholders are at the front of the line to compensate for this equity holders require a larger return often called a hurdle rate so why does n't a company just use cheaper equity and no debt some do but consider that equity holders participate in the earnings where bondholders just get the interest nothing more and because lenders do n't participate in the potential upside they introduce conditions debt covenants to help control their downside exposure for a company it 's a balance very much the same as personal finances a reasonable amount of debt provides low cost capital which can be used to produce greater returns but too much debt and the covenants are breached the debt is called due immediately there 's no cash to cover and bankruptcy a useful measure if a bit difficult to calculate is a company 's cost of capital and the return on that capital cost of capital is a blended number taking both equity and debt into account good companies earn a return that is greater than their cost of capital seems obvious but many companies do n't succeed at this in cases where this is persistent the best move for shareholders would be for the company to dissolve and return all the capital unfortunately as in the railroad tycoon example above managers incentives are n't always well aligned with shareholders and they allocate capital in ways advantageous to themselves and not the company

both names are on the deed so the property is jointly owned you 're going to need the second person 's signature to be able to sell the property ideally the way to know what happens now is to consult the written agreement you made before you purchased the house together the formula for dividing up assets when dissolving your partnership is whatever you agreed to up front your up front agreement could have said if you move out you forfeit any claim to the property it sounds like you do n't have that so you 'll have to come to some written agreement with your partner before you proceed if you ca n't come to an agreement then you 'll end up in court a judge will split up the assets and the only winners there are the lawyers

as a legal contract a mortgage is a form of secured debt in the case of a mortgage the debt is secured using the property asset as collateral so no there is no such thing as a mortgage contract without a property to act as collateral is it a good idea   in the current low interest rate environment people with good income and credit can obtain a from their bank at a rate comparable to current mortgage rates   however if you wish to setup a credit line for an amount comparable to a mortgage then you will need to secure it with some form of collateral

i would say that there is no real difference   asset management companies that is part of large banking groups usually seat in separate entities and operate independently from the rest of the bank assuming proper procedures and regulators usually check that are in place they will not share information with the rest of the bank and their assets are clearly segregated from the rest of the bank they have the same fiduciary duties as an independent am and are probably using the broker dealer services of other banks as well as their parent reputation is a key issue for banks and conflict of interests are usually managed properly independence also comes and goes the corporate history of is a good example was once an independent asset manager in 2003 it merged with lehman brothers thus loosing its independence when lehman went bankrupt in 2008 nb did not join its parent company in bankruptcy and did not lose the assets of its clients the company continued to operate until it was acquired by the management finally it is mostly a question of marketing and positioning

when i left the uk four years ago free banking is still an option and i 'm pretty sure it still is   therefore you have chosen to have a bank account with a charge    in return for this charge you will be eligible to receive certain benefits   for example reduced borrowing costs discounted mortgage rates free overdraft on small amounts rewards for paying household bills by direct debit and things of this sort    amongst these benefits may be preferential savings rates   however from hmrc 's point of view it will be the extra perks you are paying for with your monthly charge   you have chosen to pay for the account and hmrc is not interested in how you choose to spend your money only in the money you earn while i agree with you that it does have an element of unfairness the problem is how would you divide the cost amongst the various benefits

tl;dr roth earnings are not necessarily tax deferred but they might be this is a great question because imho the use of the wording tax deferred is slightly misleading when talking about a roth ira and roth 401k too the phrase tax deferred actually means you save tax now and you pay tax later i.e. you defer the tax as you pointed out this is the normal terminology used for describing a traditional ira/401k earnings on a roth ira are tax free not deferred but only if your distributions are qualified for the most part distributions are considered qualified if you wait until you are 59.5 years old before taking the money out but there are some exceptions if you choose to distribute more than your contributions meaning you are now taking out earnings the earnings are tax free only if your distribution is qualified for example if you take out the earnings before you are 59.5 and no other exceptions apply then you would pay tax on the earnings and also a 10 penalty so perhaps a better way to say it is that earnings in a roth ira are tax deferred

sometimes what happens is that a creditor will hand over accounts to a collection agency for action and after a period of time it may be to yet another collection agency if the first one was not successful   theoretically this should not be cause to reset the date of collections on your bureau file but that very well could have happened here another instance when this happens is when someone contacts a creditor about a collection item on their report either to pay or dispute it   either way this the clock on that collection item so if a debt is old enough sometimes the best course of action is to let it go   if a debt has been in collections for 4 years let 's say and you decide to pay it off now your score is n't going to improve because you paid the collection enough to offset the effect of having it refreshed on your bureau file   besides creditors know how old the debt is so waiting 4 years to pay it is n't going to win you any favors in their eyes anyway to your question though it seems to me the most likely thing is that somehow the debt was refreshed through some action by the creditor or one of the agencies assigned to collect on it i hope this helps good luck

the first red flag here is that an appraisal was not performed on an as is basis and if it could not be done you should be told why getting an appraisal on an after improvement basis only makes sense if you are proposing to perform such improvements and want that factored in as a basis of the loan it seems very bizarre to me that a mortgage lender would do this without any explanation at all the only way this makes sense is if the lender is only offering you a loan with specific underwriting guidelines on house quality common with for instance va loans and how they require the roof be of a certain maximum age among dozens of other requirements and many loan products have their own standards this should have been disclosed to you during the process but one can certainly never assume anyone will do their job properly or it may have only mentioned in some small print as part of pounds of paper products you may have been offered or made to sign already the bank criteria is reasonable to the extent that generally mortgage companies are allowed to set underwriting criteria about the current condition of the house it does n't need to be reasonable to you personally or any of us it 's to protect lender profits by their risk models your plans and preferences do n't even factor in to their guidelines not all criteria are on a a sliding scale so it does n't necessarily matter how well you meet their other standards you are of course correct that paying for thousands of dollars in improvements on a house you do n't own is lunacy and the fact that this was suggested may on it 's own suggest you should cut your losses now and seek out a different lender   given the lender being the only reason to stick with it seems to be the sunk cost of the appraisal you 've already paid for i 'd suggest you specifically ask them why they did not perform an as is appraisal and listen to the answer if you can get one you can try to contact the appraiser directly as well with this question and ask if you can have the appraisal strictly as is without having a new appraisal they might be helpful they might not as for taking the appraisal with you to a new bank you might be able to do this or you might not it is strictly up to each lender to set criteria for appraisals they accept but i 've certainly known of people re using an appraisal done sufficiently recently in this way it 's a possibility that you will need to write off the $ 800 as an education expense but it 's certainly worth trying to see if you can salvage it and take it with you you 'll just have to ask each potential lender as i 've heard it go both ways it 's not a crazy or super rare request lenders backing out based on appraisal results should be absolutely normal to anyone in the finance business to do this you can just state plainly the situation you paid for an appraisal and the previous lender fell through and so you would like to know if they would be able to accept that and provide you with a loan without having to buy a whole new appraisal this would also be a good time to talk about condition requirements in that you want a loan on an as is basic for a house that is but needs cosmetic repair and you plan to do this in cash on your own time after the purchase closes some lenders will be happy to do this at below ltv and some absolutely do not want to make this type of loan because the house is n't in perfect condition and that 's just what their lending criteria is right now   based on description alone i do n't think you really should need to go into alternate plans like buy cash and then get a home equity loan to get cash out special rehab packages etc so i 'd encourage you to try a more straight forward option of a different lender as well as trying to get a straight answer on their odd choice of appraisal order that you paid for before trying anything more exotic or totally changing your purchase finance plans

there 's no free lunch here are some positions that should be economically equivalent same risk and reward in a theoretically pure universe with no regulations or transaction costs you 're proposing to buy the call if you look at the equivalent stock plus protective put you can quickly see the catch the protective put is expensive that same expense is embedded in the call option see put call parity on wikipedia for more you could easily pay 10 a year or more for the protection which could easily eat up most of your returns if you consider that average returns on a stock index might be about 10 nominal not real another way to look at it is that buying the long call and selling a put which is a synthetic long position in the stock would give you the put premium so by not selling the put you should be worse off than owning the stock worse than the synthetic long by about the value of the put premium or yet another way to look at it is that you 're repeatedly paying time value on the long call option as you roll it in practical world instead of theory world i think you 'd probably get a noticeable hit to returns just from bid ask and commissions even without the cost of the protection options cost more a bit some practical complications of equivalency between different combinations of options and underlying are anyway roughly speaking any position without the downside risk is going to have an annual loss built in due to the cost of the protection occasionally the options market can do something weird due to supply demand or liquidity issues but mostly the parity relationships hold or hold closely enough that you ca n't profit once expenses are considered update one note i 'm talking about vanilla options as traded in the us here i guess there are some somewhat different products elsewhere i 'm not sure exactly which derivatives you mean all derivatives have a cost though or nobody would take the other side of the trade

to expand on @joetaxpayer 's answer the devil is actually in the fine print all   the credit card checks that i have ever received in the mail explicitly says that the checks can not be used to pay off   or pay down the balance on any other credit card issued by the same bank whether the card is branded with the bank logo or is branded with a department store or airline logo etc the checks can be used to pay utilities or even taxes without paying the service fee that is charged for using a credit card for such payments the payee is paid the face amount of the check in contrast to charges on a credit card from a merchant who gets to collect only about of the amount on the   charge slip generally speaking balance transfer offers are a bad deal regardless    of whether you pay only the minimum amount due each month or whether    you pay each month 's statement balance in full by the due date or    anything in between the rest of this answer is an explanation in support of the above assertion feel free to tl;dr it if you like if you make only the minimum payment due each month and some parts of the balance that you are carrying has different interest rates applicable than other parts then your payment can be applied to any part of the balance at the bank 's discretion it need hardly be said that the bank invariably chooses to apply it to pay off the lowest rate portion by law card act of 2009 anything above the minimum payment due must be applied to pay off the highest rate part and then the next highest rate part etc but minimum payment or less is at the bank 's discretion as an illustration suppose that you are not using your credit cards any more and are paying down the balances due by making the minimum payment due each month suppose also that you have a balance of $ 1000 carrying 12 apr on card a and pay off the entire balance of $ 500 on card b transferring the amount at 0 apr to card a for which you are billed a 2 fee your next minimum payment   will be likely be $ 35 computed as $ 10 interest on $ 1000 + $ 10 transfer fee + $ 15 1 of balance of $ 1500 if you make only the minimum payment due that payment will go towards paying off the $ 500 and so for next month your balance will be $ 1500 of which $ will be charged 1 interest and $ will be charged 0 interest   in the months   that follow the balance on which you owe 1 interest per month will grow and the 0 balance will shrink   you have to pay more than the minimum amount due to reduce the amount that you owe in this example in the absence of the balance transfer the minimum payment would have been $ 20 = $ 10 interest on $ 1000 at 1 per month + $ 10 1 of balance and would have left you with $ 990 due for next month   to be at the same point with the balance transfer offer you would need to pay $ 30 more than the minimum payment of $ 35 due this extra $ 30 will pay off the interest and transfer fee $ 20 and the rest will be applied to the $ 1000 balance to reduce it to $ 990 there would be no balance transfer fee in future months and so the extra that you need to pay will be a little bit smaller etc if you avoid paying interest charges on credit cards by never taking any cash advances and by paying off the monthly balance   consisting only of purchases made within the past month in full by the due date then the only way to avoid paying interest on the purchases made during the month of the balance transfer offer is to pay off that month 's statement in full including the balance just transferred over and the balance transfer fee by the due date   so depending on when in the billing cycle the transfer occurs you are getting a loan of the balance transfer amount for 25 to 55 days and being charged 2 or 3 for the privilege if you are getting offers of 2 balance transfer fees instead of 3 you are probably among those who pay their balances in full each month and the bank is trying to tempt you into doing a balance transfer by offering a lower fee it is unlikely that they will make a no transfer fee offer they would prefer laughing all the way to themselves by collecting a 2 transfer fee from you and possibly interest too if you fail to read the fine print than having you decline such offers at 3 as being too expensive can you make a balance transfer offer work in your favor sure   do n't make any purchases on the card in the month of the balance transfer or during the entire time that the 0 apr is being offered in the month of the transfer pay the minimum balance due plus the balance transfer fee in succeeding months pay the minimum balance due typically 1 of the balance owed each month all of it will go to reducing the 0 apr balance because that is the only amount owing just before the 0 apr expires anywhere from 6 to 24 months pay off the remaining balance in full   but remember that you are losing the use of this card for this whole period of time put it away in a locked trunk in the attic because using the card to make a purchase will mean paying interest on charges from the day they post something that might be totally alien to you

gt if the black scholes formula is applied to extended time periods .it can produce absurd results   gt buffett 2008 letter to berkshire hathaway shareholders   i will give your question more thought and come back with a quantitative solution it may be most fruitful to apply a backward induction options pricing model with detailed scenario based discounted cash flow valuation models supported by pro forma financial statement and investment analysis     nonetheless my initial reaction is inline with warren buffett 's belief that in the long run an assumption of the black scholes options pricing model is invalid see = = pdf and docs e web academics business economics faculty the perceived invalid assumption is that the distribution of expected future stock prices is not log normal in the long run this non log normal view is especially true for a single company stock    this invalid assumption results in over valuation of options prices from black scholes which makes it much better to sell long term options than to buy them if market participants are using black scholes pricing models   again without having done the math yet my gut tells me if the option seller is using black pricing for long dated options you would be best to avoid buying them as the prices will be inflated compared to an economic reality fair price

here 's what my wife and i did first we stopped using credit cards and got rid of all other expenses that we absolutely did n't need   a few examples cable tv home phone high end internet all shut off   we changed our cell phone plan to a cheap one and stopped going out to restaurants or bars   we also got rid of the cars that had payments on them and replaced them with ones we paid cash for   probably the most painful thing for me was selling a 2 year old and replacing it with a 5 year old random 4 door    some people might tell you do n't do this because older cars need repairs   fact is nearly all cars are going to need repairs   it 's just a matter of whether you are also making payments on it when they need them and if you can discipline yourself enough to save up a bit to cover those after doing all this the only payments we had to make were for the house plus electric gas water and the debt we had accumulated   i 'd say that if you have the option to move back into your parent 's house then do it   yes it will suck for a while but you 'll be able to pay everything off so much faster   just make sure to help around the house ignore the guys saying that this tanks your score and will make getting a house difficult   although they are right that it will drop your score the fact is that you are n't in any position to make large purchases anyway and wo n't be for quite some time so it really does n't matter   your number one goal is to dig yourself out of this hole not engage in activity that will keep you in it next if you are only working part time then you need to do one of two things   either get a full time job or go find a second part time one   the preference is obviously on the first which you should be able to do in your spare time   if for some reason you do n't have the tech skills necessary to do this then go find any part time job you can    it took us about 3 years to finally pay everything except the house off we owed a lot   during that time everything we bought was paid for in cash with the vast majority of our money going to pay off those accounts once the final account was paid off i did go ahead and get a credit card   i made very minor purchases on it mostly just gas and paid it off a few days before it was due each month   every 4 months they increased my limit    after around 18 months of using that one card my credit score was back in the 700 + range and with no debt other than the mortgage note i echo what others have said about credit repair companies   anything they can do you can too   it 's a matter of cutting costs living within your means and paying the bills   if the interest rates are killing you then try to get a consolidation loan   if you ca n't do that then negotiate settlements with them just get everything in writing prior to making a payment on it if you go this route   btw make sure you actually ca n't pay them before attempting to settle

i could n't find historical data either so i contacted vanguard canada and barclays vanguard replied that   this index was developed for vanguard and thus historical information is available as of the inception of the fund unfortunately that means that the only existing data on historical returns are in the link in your question vanguard also sent me a link to the methodology barclay 's uses when constructing this index which you might find interesting as well   i have n't heard from barclays but i presume the story is the same even if they 've been collecting data on canadian bonds since before the inception of this index they probably did n't aggregate it into an index before their contract with vanguard and if they did it might be proprietary and not available free of charge

yeah we had a guy do something similar at my job with a back problem he kept pushing off his return date later and later because of new issues and new tests eventually the bosses got tired of dealing with it and filled his position so as soon as he finally comes back to work he 'll get a pink slip    this is the 1 reason i can see businesses not wanting to hire women of age to quote the article it 's an expense they can easily avoid why pay thousands of dollars for an employee who is n't there when you can hire someone who probably wo n't leave for as long cost the company as much logically they have no incentive to hire the women because the company sees them as a liability

using the bank 's bill pay always seemed like a hassle to me there are lots of mistakes to be made by me that can result in late payments and not too many benefits other than some convenience and being able to pay bills online for accounts that require paper payment although the banking systems often screw up those payments plus there is usually a fee associated with bill pay at least to some extent i generally use the websites of my credit cards or other entities to pay bills   then again maybe i 'm a bit of a here i do n't see mailing a check 3 days ahead of the due date as a particular hassle

that 's because our financial sector is mainly an instrument to aggregate cash   rather than a way to foster innovation and growth they already have so much cash in their control that other sectors are starving   some worthwhile endeavors are not the ones that are going to make the greatest returns some will not show returns for a very long time typically these are are undertaken by the government but the government is being reduced to a blunt object used to secure resources and markets and to protect investments   so maybe we need a second tier investment sector that works with longer time lines and low immediate returns and perhaps even domestic micro loan grants

if it were my money i would n't put it in a 401(k for this purpose if you were working at a company that provided 401(k matching then it might be worth it to put the money in your employer 's 401(k because the employer chips in based on what you put in but you 're self employed so there 's no matching unless you match it yourself   correct so given that there 's no matching a 401(k arrangement would have more restrictions than a non tax advantaged account like a bank account or a taxable money market account   this would be taxable in the year you earn the money but then that 's it if you 're expecting to pull out the money pre retirement i would n't put it in in the first place

another option not yet discussed here is to allow the loan to go into default and let the loaning agency repossess the property the loan was used for after which they sell it and that sale should discharge some significant portion of the loan knowing where the friend and property is you may be able to help them carry out the repossession by providing them information meanwhile your credit will take a significant hit but unless your name is on the deed title of the property then you have little claim that the property is yours just because you 're paying the loan the contract you signed for the loan is not going to be easily with a lawsuit of any sort so unless you can produce another contract between you and your friend it 's unlikely that you can even sue them in short you have no claim to the property but the loaning agency does perhaps that 's the only way to avoid paying most of the debt but you do trade some of your credit for it hopefully you understand that what you loaned was n't money but your credit score and earning potential and that you will be more careful who you choose to lend this to in the future

the short answer to your initial question is yes the option does n't expire until the close of the market on the day of expiration because the option is expiring so soon the time value of the option is quite small   that is why the option once it is in the money will track so closely to the underlying stock price if someone buys an in the money option on the day of expiration they are likely still expecting the price to go up before they sell it or exercise it many brokers will exercise your in the money options sometime after 3 pm on the day of expiration   if this is not what you desire you should communicate that with them prior to that day

one of the best things you can do for this purpose while getting a modest roi on a passive investment is invest in a company that profitably does whatever you want to see more of for example you could invest in a for profit company that sells needed goods to low income people at lower prices   something like wal mart which is one of the most effective anti poverty engines in the us   you might also say the same of something like aldi owner of aldi stores and trader joe 's which is a discount store chain   this is true even though a company like wal mart is seeking to make money first   its customer base tends to skew heavily towards low income consumers and historically to rural and elderly consumers   when wal mart is able to provide food clothing appliances and the like to poor people at a lower cost it is making it marginally less painful to have a low income peter can explain why wal mart is a humanitarian enterprise walmart ’s customer base is heavily concentrated in the bottom income quintile which spends heavily on food the bottom income quintile spends about 25 percent of income on food compared to just 3.5 percent for the top quintile so the benefits of walmart ’s substantially lower prices to the lowest earning cohort are huge especially on food as points out this view of wal mart dramatically lowering prices that low income people pay for food was by an obama adviser that 's just one company   you can pick the industry and company that best suits your personal preferences alternatively you could invest in something like whole foods a company with multiple missions to improve the planet and the community in addition to the more typical mission of being a prosperous retail chain of course as a general proposition a less than entirely altruistic charity inclined investment does n't need to be targeted at those with low incomes or at saving the planet   you could invest in almost anything you think is good yachts yo energy production industrial inputs music performances and the company will take care of making more of that good thing   you did n't say whether your goal was to help the poor the planet arts sciences knowledge community or whatever what i understand you to be saying is you are willing to accept a lower roi in exchange for some warm from your investment   that seems perfectly valid and reasonable to me but it makes it much more subjective and particular to your tastes   so you 'll need to pick something that 's meaningful to you   if you 're going to trade roi for positive feelings then you should pick whatever gives you your optimal blend of emotions and returns alternatively you could invest in something stable and predictable to beat inflation some sort of index or fund and then annually use some portion of those profits to simply give to the charity of your choice   your investment and your charity do not necessarily need to be the same vehicle

in addition to the higher risk as pointed out by you also need to consider that there are regulations against naked shorting so you generally need to either own the security or have someone that is willing to loan the security to you in order to sell short   if you own a stock you are shorting the irs could view the transaction as a sell followed by a buy taking place in a less than 30 day period and you could be subject to wash sale rules   this added complexity most often the finding of someone to loan you the security you are shorting is another reason such trades are considered more advanced you should also be aware that there are currently a number of proposals to re the uptick rule or some circuit breaker variant designed to prevent short sellers from driving down the price of a stock and conducting bear raids etc the first requires that a stock trade at the same or higher price as prior trades before you can submit a short   in the latter shorting would be prohibited after a stock price had fallen a given percentage in a given amount of time   in either case should such a rule be then you could face limitations attempting to execute a short which you would not need to worry about doing simple buys or sells    as to vehicles that would do this kind of thing if you are convinced we are in a bear market and willing to take the risk there are a number of etf 's classified as inverse exchange traded funds etf 's for a variety of markets that via various means seek to deliver a return similar to that of shorting the market in question   one such example for a common broad market is ticker sh the short s&p500 etf which seeks to deliver a return that is the inverse of the s&p500 and as would be predicted based on the roughly + 15 performance of the s&p500 over the last 12 months sh is down roughly -15 over the same period   the wikipedia article on inverse etf 's lists a number of other such funds covering various markets    i think it should be noted that using such a vehicle is a pretty aggressive bet to take in reaction to the belief that a bear market is imminent   a more conservative approach would be to simply take money out of the market and place it in something like cd 's or treasury instruments   in that case you preserve your capital regardless of what happens in the market using an inverse etf otoh means that if the market went bull instead of bear you would lose money instead of merely holding your position

an employee costs the company in four ways salary taxes benefits and capital salary the obvious one what they pay you taxes there are several taxes that an employer has to pay for the privilege of hiring someone including social security taxes which goes to your retirement unemployment insurance tax your unemployment benefits if they lay you off and workers compensation tax pays if you are injured on the job there may be other taxes that i 'm not thinking of but in any case those are the main ones benefits in the u.s. employers often pay for medical insurance sometimes for dental life and disability there 's usually some sort of retirement plan they expect to give you some number of vacation days holidays and sick days where they pay you even though you 're not working companies sometimes offer other benefits like discounts on buying company products membership in health clubs etc capital often the company has to provide you with some sort of equipment like a computer furniture like a chair and desk etc as far as the company is concerned all of the above are part of the cost of having you as an employee if they would pay a domestic employee $ 60,000 in salary and $ 20,000 in taxes then assuming the same benefits and capital investment if a foreign employee would cost them $ 0 in taxes they should logically be willing to pay $ 80,000 any big company will have accountants who figure out the total cost of a new employee in excruciating detail and they will likely be totally rational about this a smaller company might think well taxes do n't really count this is irrational but people are not always rational i do n't know what benefits they are offering you if any and what equipment they will provide you with if any   i also do n't know what taxes if any a u.s. company has to pay when hiring a remote employee in a foreign country if anybody on here knows the answer to that please chime in balanced against that the company likely sees disadvantages to hiring a foreign remote employee too communication will be more difficult which may result in inefficiency my previous employer used some contractors in india and while there were certainly advantages the language and time zone issues caused difficulties there are almost certainly some international bureaucratic inconveniences they will have to deal with etc so while you should certainly calculate what it would cost them to have a domestic employee doing the same job that 's not necessarily the end of the story and ultimately it all comes down to negotiations even if the company knows that by the time they add in taxes and benefits and whatever a domestic employee will cost them $ 100,000 a year if they are absolutely convinced that they should be able to hire an austrian for $ 60,000 a year that might be the best offer you will get you can point out the cost savings and maybe they will concede the point and maybe not

bitcoin payments involve by far the lowest fees   for pure bitcoin to bitcoin transfers you have the option of not paying any fee at all while if you want to avoid the risk currently very small of miners ignoring your transaction you can pay a small transaction fee   currently no more than btc is ever required $ 0.01 at $ bitcoin also does not support chargebacks which is an advantage for the merchant no risk that paypal will freeze your account as it did in with a burning man nonprofit but more risk for the consumer popular sites for exchanging bitcoins with other currencies charge rates of or less   the primary barrier is that it typically takes a few days to get funds into your account from bank accounts etc   given the volatility of the bitcoin exchange rate you may want to treat bitcoin like cash and only keep a small amount on hand a variety of shopping cart interfaces are supported the obvious downside is that only a small fraction of users would be likely to go through the steps to use this option since bitcoin is new and immature so your investment in adding support may be hard to pay off   on the other hand just advertising that you accept bitcoin payments would give you a bit of free advertising another downside is the risk of government intervention   in npr 's 2011 story a law professor said it was legal for now in the us but that could change i 'd say that given the sizable current fees and other barriers to international commerce and micro payments if bitcoin does n't succeed something else will

i would use neither method   taking a short example first with just three compounding periods with interest rate 10   the start value is 1 so after three years the value is the same as 1 + depreciating like inflation by 10 to demonstrate gets us back to = 1 appreciating and depreciating by 10 cancels out appreciating by 10 interest and depreciating by 3 inflation this is the same as 1 + 1 + = so for 50 years the result is 1 + 1 + = note you can of course use subtraction but the not using the inflation figure directly   e.g. edit this appears to be the fisher equation 2nd note further to comments here is a chart to illustrate how much the relative performance improves when inflation is accounted for   the first fund 's return is 6 and the second fund 's return varies from 3 to 6   inflation is 3

there are a number of ways to measure such things and they are generally called sentiment indicators   the ones that i have seen work in the sense that they show relatively high readings near market tops and relatively low readings near market bottoms   the problem is that there are no thresholds that work consistently   for example at one market top a sentiment indicator may read 62   at the next market top that same indicator might read 55   so what threshold do you use next time   maybe the top will come at 53 or maybe it will not come until 65 there was a time when i could have listed examples for you with the names of the indicators and what they signaled and when   but i gave up on such things years ago after seeing such wide variation   i have been at this a long time 30 + years and i have not found anything that works as well as we would like at identifying a top in real time   the best i have found although it does give false signals is a drop in price coupled with a bearish divergence in breadth   the latter is described in weinstein 's secrets for profiting in bull and bear markets market bottoms are a little less difficult to identify in real time   one thing i would suggest if you think that there is some way to get a significant edge in investing is to look at the results of mark 's monitoring of newsletters   virtually all of them rise and fall with the market and almost none are able to beat buy and hold of the wilshire 5000 over the long term

when you pay interest on a loan used to fund a legitimate investment or business activity that interest becomes an expense that you can deduct against related income for example if you borrowed $ 10k to buy stocks you could deduct the interest on that $ 10k loan from investment gains   in your case you are borrowing money to invest in the stock of your company   you would be able to deduct the interest expense against investment gain like selling stock or receiving dividends but not from any income from the business see this link for more information you do not have to pay taxes on the interest paid to your father that is an expense not income   however your father has to pay taxes on that interest because that is income for him

all discount brokers offer a commission structure that is based on the average kind of order that their target audience will make different brokers advertise to different target audiences they could all have a lot lower commissions than they do the maximum commission price for the order ticket is set at $ 99 by the industry securities regulators when discount brokers came along and started offering $ 2 $ 9.99 trades it was simply because these new companies could be competitive in a place where incumbents were overcharging the same exists with robinhood the market landscape and costs have changed over the last decade with regulation and other brokerage firms never needed to update drastically because they could continue making a lot on commissions with nobody questioning it the conclusion being that other brokers can also charge a lot less despite their other overhead costs robinhood like other brokerage firms and anyone else trading directly with the exchanges are paid by the exchanges for adding liquidity not only are many trades placed with no commission for the broker they actually earn money for placing the trade if robinhood was doing you any favors they would be paying you but nobody questions free commissions so they do n't robinhood like other brokerage firms sells your trading data to the highest bidder this is called payment for order flow these subscribers see your order on the internet in route to the and before your order gets to the exchange the subscriber sends a different order to the exchange so they either get filled before you do analogous to front running but different enough to not be illegal or they alter the price of the thing you wanted to buy or sell so that you have to get a worse price these subscribers have faster computers and faster internet access than other market participants so are able to do this so quickly they are also burning a lot of venture capital like all startups you should n't place too much faith in the idea they are making enough money they also have plans to earn interest off of balances in a variety of ways and offer more options at a price like margin accounts

in the united states the general policy is that the irs would consider it income when you have access to the money i work for a company that has a contract with another company near the end of the year i turn in a time card that has my hours that i worked as of that date because they do n't pay me until early january the money on the check is counted in the new year i could n't touch the money until they issued the check if they had paid me on december 31st it would have counted as the old year even if i only had a short window to have access to it before the year ended it would even count as old year money if i held on to the december check but did n't deposit it until march so it would become income when you could use it so if you could access it via a check or debit card or transfer it to the bank it is now income of course that is in the united states you would need to see what the situation is in singapore the edge cases always depend on the country

a while back i sold cars for a living   over the course of 4 years i worked for 3 different dealerships   i sold new cars at 2 and used at the last one when selling new cars i found that the majority of people buying the higher end cars honestly should n't have been 80%+   they almost always came in owing more on their trades then they were worth put down very little cash and were close to being financially strapped    from a financial perspective these deals were hard to close not because the buyer was picky but rather because their finances were a mess   fully half and probably more we had to switch from the car they initially wanted down to a much cheaper version or try to convert to a lease because it was the only way the bank would loan the money   we called them $ 30,000 millionaires because they did n't make a whole lot but tried to look like they did   as a salesman you knew you were in serious trouble when they did n't even try to negotiate around 2 of the deals i did were actual cash deals meaning honest cash not those who came in with a pre approved loan from a bank   these were invariably for used cars about 3 to 4 years old and they never had a trade in   the people doing this always looked comfortable but never dressed up you would n't even look at them twice   the negotiations were hard because they knew exactly how much that car should go for and would n't even pay that    it was obvious they knew the value of money that said i 've been in the top 3 of wage earners for about 20 years and at no point have i considered myself in a position to afford a new luxury car   imho there are far more important things you can do with that kind of money

the key part of your question is the so far   so you did n't need a credit card today or yesterday or last month great   but what about tomorrow   the time may come when you really need to spend a little more than you have and a credit card will let you do that at a very modest cost if you pay it off promptly no cost if paid within 30 days i learned this when i was traveling and stranded due to bad weather   i had almost nothing in my bank account at the time and while i actually did have a small student type credit card i came really close to having to sleep at the train station when i did n't have enough for another night in a hotel as an example if you have close friends or family living across the country and something tragic were to happen would you be able to pay for a flight to attend the funeral   what if you 'd recently had an accident and a big medical bill it does n't take much a broken arm can cost $ 10,000   perhaps you have a solid nest egg but breaking a cd ahead of schedule or taking short term capital gains on a mutual fund will usually cost more than one or two months of interest payments

illiquid charges are charges that apply to the trading of low priced over the counter otc securities with low volumes open net buy quantity represents the total unsettled share amount per stock at any given time during a settlement cycle open net buy quantity must be less than 5,000,000 shares per stock for your entire firm basically you ca n't hold a long position of more than 5 million shares in an illiquid otc stock without facing a fee you 'll still be assessed this fee if you accumulate a long position of this size by breaking your purchase up into multiple transactions open net sell quantity represents the total unsettled share amount per stock at any given time during a settlement cycle open net sell quantity must be less than 10 percent of the average volume if you attempt to sell a number of shares greater than 10 of the stock 's average volume over the last 20 days you 'll also be assessed a fee the first link i included above is just an example but it makes the important point you may still be assessed a fee for trading otc stocks even if your account does n't meet the criteria because these restrictions are applied at the level of the clearing firm not the individual client   this means that if other investors with your broker or even at another broker that happens to use the same clearing firm purchase more than 5 million shares in an individual otc stock at the same time all of your accounts may face fees even though individually you do n't exceed the limits technically these fees are assessed to the clearing firm not the individual investor but usually the clearing firm will pass the fees along to the broker and possibly add other charges as well and the broker will charge a fee to the individual account(s that triggered the restriction also remember that when buying otc pink sheet stocks your ability to buy or sell is also contingent on finding someone else to buy from sell to if you purchase 10,000 shares one day and attempt to sell them sometime in the future but there are n't enough buyers to buy all 10,000 from you you might not be able to complete your order at the desired price or even at all

fama french would be a couple of names if you want to look at this from a value growth dichotomy   a simplified form of this was to take the stocks with a lower price book value that would be the value stocks while the others would be the growth   the principle is that some of the beaten down stocks will appreciate more than the growth stocks will   6 ways to improve your portfolio returns today also makes note of the growth vs value split if you want another reference that way   historically growth has been more volatile and produced lower returns though past performance is n't necessarily always going to hold as some people like to invest in what is known as a slice dice portfolio where a portion in invested in each of 4 corners large growth large value small growth and small value   some may add in bonds reits and foreign stocks but the idea is that in different years different parts of the market will do better and this is a way to capture that in a sense

firstly and this part is rather opinion based i would absolutely not think of making more pension contributions when you are currently totaling 6 of salary as over contributing there are some who argue that you should be putting a minimum of 20 away for retirement throughout your working life you do n't say how old you are how close to retirement you are but a common rule of thumb is to halve your age and put away that of your salary into your pension so i would certainly start with upping those contributions   i actually do n't think it makes much difference whether you go for just your workplace pension versus a separate private one in general you end up paying management fees that are a of the value so whether it is in one place or split does n't cost any less the all eggs in one basket syndrome is a possible argument but equally if you change jobs a few times and end up with half a dozen pension pots it can be very hard to stay on top of them all if you end up with everything in one pot and then transfer it when you change jobs it 's easier to manage other options    isa as you mentioned on the plus side these are tax free on the minus side you can either go for a cash isa which at the moment has very low rates of return and/or a stocks and shares isa which exposes you to risks in the stock market    if you have debt consider paying it off early overpaying student loans may or may not be the exception to this depending on your personal situation certainly if you have a mortgage you can save a vast amount by overpaying early    other investments stocks and shares btl housing fine wines bitcoin there are almost limitless possibilities but it makes sense to max out the tax efficient options before you look into these

if for every buyer there 's a seller does n't that also mean that there were $ in outflows in the same time period yes for every buyer there is a seller the inflows are not being talked in that respect about there being $ in inflows to us equity markets since the election what does that mean lets say the index was at x. after a month the index is at   so lets say there are only 10 companies listed so if the index has moved x to then share price s1 has moved to so if you sum all such shares trades that have increased in value you will get what in inflow in the same period there could be some shares that have lost value i.e. the price or another share was s2 and has moved to the sum of all such shares trades that have decreased in value you will get outflow the terms are gross outflow gross inflow in net terms for a period it can only be inflow or outflow depending on the difference between inflow and outflow the stats are done day to day and aggregated for the time period required   so generally if the index has increased it means there is more inflow and less outflow at times this analysis is also done on segments fi 's inflow is more compared to outflow or compared to inflow of or institutional investors or foreign participants etc

crank out expensive shares when markets are corporations go public sell their shares for the first time in market conditions that have a lot of liquidity a lot of people buying shares and when they have to make the concessions to appease an investing public when people are greedy and looking to make money without using too much due diligence think 's ipo in 1995 or snapchat 's ipo in 2017 they also issue more shares after already being public in similar circumstances think tesla 's 1 billion dollar dilution in 2017 dilution results in the 1 share owning less of the company so in a less investing environment share prices go down in response to dilution see 's stock for an example if you can find a chart issue debt non financial companies create bonds and sell bonds why is that surprising to you cash is cash this is called corporate bonds or corporate debt you can buy apple bonds right now if you want from the same brokers that let you buy stocks mutual fund investor bernstein is making a cynical assessment of the markets which carries a lot of truth dumping shares on your mom 's 401k is a running amongst some financial professionals basically mutual fund investors are typically the least well researched or most gullible market participants to sell to influenced by brand name more than company fundamentals who will balk at the concept of reading a prospectus financial professionals and have more information than their investors and can gain extended advantages because of this just take the emotions out of it and make objective assessments

numbers down to about 1/2 1/3 and you get the group that 's actually focused on finance many mbas do consulting marketing product development etc nowadays   agreed you also have to remember many of those mba 's are the ones that move on to get cfa charterholder as an emphasis on quantitative   gt also i 'm a bit offended by you saying i do n't understand the cfa could n't be more mistaken boss i 'm for l3 in june like you    then you should clearly understand where l2 and l3 diverge from the memorize and regurgitate that you labelled it as   gt the requirement is only 2 years in an investment decision role this also means a lot of back office risk guys qualify that 's a pretty fungible qualification you do n't have to be a pm to qualify i have a buddy who qualified having done 2 years in fund accounting not exactly sell side er    um it 's most certainly 4 candidate membership pages of qualified work exp   gt to become a regular member you must have completed four years 48 months of qualifying work experience in activities that consist to a majority extent of    gt at least 50 percent of your work experience must be   directly involved in the investment decision making process   engaged in responsibilities and/or producing a work product that informs or adds value to that process    we just had a middle office colleague pass his l3 and get denied his years as a qualifying role   cfai is moving towards a more strict criteria for qualified roles     gt i 'm also going to guess you 're a trader brokerage cap markets guy if you wanna throw titles around i 'm in a front office role at a bb too and worked at worked on buy side research at a value shop cfa is definitely more desired in sell side markets focused as opposed to ibd where an mba is more useful more strategy focused   not throwing titles around   simply informing you that my perspective unlike 90 of the people in this subreddit is from a real world environment   cfa 's are more desired and less common than mba 's in the capital markets roles and portfolio mgmt bb 's and the street based hf 's   large part of this is due to the associate programs that most ib 's employ for newly grad mba 's   this over the job market for front office with mba 's as opposed to bs w/ cfa 's   might i also add at this point you 're clearly diverging from the original discrepancy we had where i said mba 's are dime a dozen and cfa 's are far less common   gt the cfa is vital for up on quantitative skills an mba wo n't cover i 'll absolutely give you that but a lot of people fall into the trap of assuming a cfa is their ticket to bigger and better things if you 're working in back office risk management getting a cfa does n't immediately qualify you to do er which is a very common pitfall i see like an mba it teaches everyone how to do the same type of analysis too another reason the title means less and less   never argued that it was n't   just like any education it simply gives you the foundation of knowledge to be successful   it does n't teach you how to think   neither does a mba   it teaches you the nitty gritty details but you still have to hold the capacity for outside the box critical thinking as well   i 'd disagree in that it teaches you the same analysis as someone else   it may teach the same formulas but i find it as emphasizing teaching what the indicators mean rather than how to use them in your analysis   it leaves it up to you to use the calculations to form your own perspective   ps for the most part mba 's in er is becoming more and more uncommon   research roles especially in the bb are becoming more and more focused on people with hard science backgrounds ms econometrics comp sci phd in theo mathematics etc   gt last weekend i had a conversation with a friend of a friend about this very thing he 's sitting for l3 cfa works back office at a very notable hf and expects to be moved up without any indication that he will to research when he 's done i asked his opinions about things like the european situation fiscal cliff and a hard landing in china not only was he not familiar these concepts he did n't even know what hft was the cfa gives you the tools to analyze the impacts of pension liabilities on eps but it still takes a passion about the markets as well as creative analytical judgement to make it to er   i agree   just like an mba though it 's what you make of it   if you do n't invest your time in understanding and following the markets you can graduate with a mba or a cfa and you still wo n't be qualified   just a heads up er is not the holy grail of cfa candidates i do n't know what mislead you to that perception but er is actually a dying market and certainly not one that the front office people i know want to move towards   gt my only point is an mba and cfa are very similar in many ways    yep   both are certifications of certain skill sets   gt both tend to hold their noses way to high too    arrogance is a part of this industry   it 's a fueled do or die competitive market   if you ca n't stand it then bail out now   gt it 's about what you chose to get out of it and too often people care more about the title than the process which is why they are still stuck in mediocrity after completing the designations   which is true regardless the mba or cfa   people get both and are incompetent   the title is a tool to open opportunities and educate you in a specialized manner with the cfa being even more specialized than mba 's   once again you have fully from your original point of trying to say cfa are more common and less valuable than mba 's   the bottom line is there are 100,000 total in the world according to the cfai   fewer than half of which are located in the us   that is 10 20 years worth of mba target school grads and does n't take into consideration the number of mba 's that pursued cfa 's nor the number of cfa charter holders that have gone on into academia a much larger number of cfa 's move into academia than target school mba 's not to mention the total number of mba 's that have worked their way into roles over the years   i can guarantee there are more mba 's than that in this industry   the bb 's alone employ upwards of 1.1 million   to say that less than 5 of those employed at bb 's hold a mba is absurd even for back office standards

this is actually a very complicated question the key reading in this area is a seminal paper by optimal execution of portfolio transactions 2000 they show that there 's a tradeoff between liquidating your portfolio faster and knowing the value with more certainty versus liquidating more slowly and likely for a higher price but with less certainty so for example if you sold your entire position right now you would know almost certainly how much you would get for the position or you could sell off your position more slowly and likely get more money but you would have less certainty about how much you would get the paper is available online at

but now you 're suggesting that the losses made by starbucks are all because of expenses made by expanding into the market if that were the case then well i doubt the management would think the uk branch is operating on a healthy basis   also the point the article is trying to make is the losses are not just from expansion into the market no starbucks in the uk is healthy and profitable and the debt costs are inflated by bringing in debt from abroad debt that has nothing to do with the operating and expansion costs made in the uk and yet it lowers their tax rate   this moving around of debt is a scheme only suitable for large multinationals and i think it 's very fair to ask if your tax system should allow such practices after all the smaller coffee guy on the corner or your local three store branches do n't have the ability to perform such write offs and therefore pay a significantly larger tax cut

i do n't think you can really classify it as front running technically the only information that the alleged front runner in this case has over the followers is the knowledge of the trade itself knowledge of the trade may indeed be share price sensitive information for some high volume traders or those respected and with many followers but it 's not really like they ca n't know about it before everyone else parity is n't possible in this case if an company organisation i.e. the social trading platform say responsible for the details log of a trader to a following or individuals working for said company organisation were to act on the trading data before dissemination then they would be guilty of front running the alleged front runner may profit from the following of course but that 's only really occurring due to the publication of information that is share price sensitive and such information generally has to be published by law if it is by law so classified so it 's difficult to find too much fault there has to be a certain amount of consideration on the part of any trader as to who is more the fool the fool or the fool that follows them

i have no idea what the traditional accounting way of dealing with this might be but does your accounts package has the concept of subaccounts within a bank account   if so to me it would make sense that when a cheque is written you move money in the accounts package from the bank account to a subaccount named cheques written then when it is cashed move money from that subaccount to the supplier   then from a reporting perspective when you want a report that will correspond to your actual bank statement run a report that includes the when you want a report that tells you how much you have available to spend   a report that excludes the subaccount

ach transfers are reversible and traceable so what 's stopping them is the ease and the speed with which they would be caught when you give a check you have to provide some information to the payee so that they could cash it you ca n't withhold the bank or the account number how would they charge you so it has to be on it and if it is on it it can be put on any other fake check that is why checks come also with your signature and are always available for you to inspect when they 're cashed if you notice something out of the ordinary check you did n't give ach transfer you did n't authorize on your statement it is your responsibility to notify the bank within x period of time 60 days i think of the statement and it will be dealt with so the best way to protect yourself would be to keep an eye on your account and verify that the transactions that you see are all authorized and do it frequently keeping large amounts of cash on your checking account is never a good idea regardless also since checks are inherently unsafe try to only give checks to people you trust and use bill pay or credit cards with anyone else

there are several factors here firstly there 's opportunity cost i.e. what you would get with the money elsewhere if you have higher interest opportunities investing paying down debt elsewhere you could be paying that down instead there 's also domino effects by reducing your liquid savings to or below the minimum you ca n't move any of it into tax advantaged retirement accounts earning higher interest then there 's the insurance costs you are required to buy extra insurance to protect your lender you should factor in the extra insurance you would buy vs the insurance required given that you can buy the car yourself catastrophic insurance may not be necessary or you may prefer a higher deductible than your lender will allow if you 're not sufficiently capitalized you may need gap insurance to cover when your car depreciates faster than your loan is paid down a 30 percent payment should be enough to not need it though finally there 's some value in having options if you have the loan and the cash you can likely pay it off without penalty but it will be harder to get the loan if you do n't finance it maybe you can take out a loan against the car later but i have n't looked into the fees that might incur   if it 's any help i 'm in the last stretch of a 3 year car loan at the time paying in cash was n't an option and having done it i recognize that it 's more complicated than it seems

the values of 12 26 and 9 are the typical industry standard setting used with the macd however other values can be substituted depending on your trading style and goals the ema is considered the long moving average when in this case it is compared to the shorter ema if you used a ema and a ema then the ema would be considered the long ma it is based on what you are comparing it with apart from providing signals for a reversal in trend macd can also be used as an early indication to a possible end to a trend what you look out for is divergence between the price and the macd see chart below of an example   here i have used 3d and 1 for the signal as i did not want the signal to show up i am simply using the macd as a momentum indicator which work by providing higher highs in the macd with higher highs in price this shows that the momentum in the trend is good so the trend should continue however the last high in price is not met with a higher high in the macd the green lines demonstrate bearish divergence between price and the macd which is an indication that the momentum of the trend is slowing down this could provide that the trend may be about to end and to take caution i.e. not a good time to be buying this stock or if you already own it you may want to tighten up your stop loss

for this scheme to work you would require an investment with no chance of a loss money market accounts and short term t bills are about your only options the other thing is that you will need to be very careful to never miss the payment date one month 's late charges will probably wipe out a few months profit the only other caveat which i 'm sure you 've considered is that having your credit maxed out will hurt your credit score

sounds like you are drowning in debt why not just stop paying it will ruin your credit but eventually you might be able to settle for much less than you owe and a reasonable interest rate you will then have a long road to recover you credit but imho this road is much longer and stressful hey you are paying a high interest rate because you are expected to default if you were expected to pay back your rates would be lower

the particularly hilarious part was the conclusion   gt;what is to be done about it the answer is that if the world is facing such an enormous glut of savings then they have to be taxed as fast as possible to prevent they imbalances they create so we need higher corporation taxes we need withholding taxes on dividends and interest going to tax havens we need capital gains taxes at rates as high as income taxes we need an investment income surcharge to increase tax rates on unearned income to match those including national insurance on earnings and we need effective wealth taxes plus a continued crack down on tax havens of course   gt;and i mean we may need all of these the world can not afford for its wealthy people to become us$ 57 trillion richer in the next five years that would be a disaster for us all including the wealthiest so action is needed urgently and now we ca n’t wait for things to get ugly

this is almost a question in financial engineering first i will note that a discussion of the greeks is well presented at these measures are first second and higher order derivatives or rate of change comparisons for information that is generally instantaneous bear with me for example the most popular delta compares prices of an option or other derived asset to the underlying asset price the reason we are able to do all this cool analysis is because the the value of the underlying and derived assets have a direct instantaneous relationship on each other because beta is calculated over a large period of time and because each time slice covered contributes equally to the aggregate then the difference in beta would really just be showing two pieces of information summarizing those two pieces of information into delta beta would not be useful to me for further discussion please see specifically look at the huge difference in calculation of ge 's beta using end of month returns versus calculation using day before end of month returns

your premise is false   when you withdraw money from a tax free savings account tfsa there is no   tax   due   yes you can read that again   withdrawals from a tfsa are tax free   they are labeled tax free for a good reason   after tax money is deposited and then from that point forward no tax no tax no tax   on a normal non registered investment or savings account with no special treatment your investment earnings will be taxed whenever gains are realized or income received e.g. dividends or interest   you will necessarily have less in a normal non registered investment or savings account compared to a tfsa as long as the rate of return was positive i.e. growing perhaps you were thinking not of comparing a regular investment account to a tfsa but rather to a registered retirement savings plan rrsp in the case of an rrsp there is an up front tax deduction then earnings grow tax deferred and then on withdrawal income tax is paid at regular rates   even then with rrsps if your marginal tax rate remains the same over time not necessarily a reasonable assumption but let 's go with it then you should still realize more after tax income from your rrsp than from a normal non registered investment or savings account   though there 's likely an exception case when most income came as qualified dividends and the capital itself has n't appreciated

stock b could be considered to be more risky because it seems to be more volatile sharp rises on large volume increases can easily be followed by sharp drops or by further rises in the start of a new uptrend   however if both a and b are trading on low volume in general they can both be more on the risky side due to having relatively low liquidity especially if you buy a large order compared to the average daily volume but just looking at the criteria you have included in your question is not enough to determine which stock is riskier than the other and you should look at this criteria in combination with other indicators and information about each stock to obtain a more complete picture

this is allowed somewhat infrequently   you can often purchase stocks through drips which might have little or no commission   for example duke energy runs their plan internally so you are buying from them directly   there is no setup fee or reinvestment fee   there is a fee to sell other companies might have someone else manage the drip but might subsidize some transaction costs giving you low cost to invest   often drips charge relatively large amounts to sell and they are not very nimble if trading is what you are after you can also go to work for a company and often they allow you to buy stock from them at a discount around 15 discount is common you can use a discount broker as well   tradeking which is not the lowest cost broker allows buys and sells at 4.95 per trade   if trading 100 shares that is similar in cost to the drip

i think that author does a disservice by writing such seemingly sensible articles without actually knowing how things work if i did n’t know better i would think this guy was teaching me something it ’s a shame he did not do research before he started writing   let ’s say you buy a classic car you take super good care of it all original mint condition you paid cash for it out of your savings this is a balance sheet transaction that has nothing to do with income you traded your cash asset for a classic car asset   now let ’s say this car is so rare and you keep it in such good condition that it gains value every year maybe it was worth $ 15k when you bought it but this year it ’s already worth $ 17k great job on making a great purchase but is that $ 2k gain counted as income to you no it is not the value of that asset on your balance sheet went up but you did not make anything off of that increase in value because you have not sold it   if you had to pay taxes on the increase in value every year those taxes would essentially force you to sell that car to pay the taxes just because you took care of it additionally in the long term no one would want to own anything so this would destroy the value of everyone ’s stuff but i digress   in this example amazon stock is the car the author is seeing the increase in stock value adding to the balance sheets of the investors who bought the stock and confusing that with income   back to our example let ’s say your car increased in value $ 2k a year for two years and you decide to sell it for $ 19k now we are about to realize some income since you bought it for $ 15k and sold for $ 19k you earned an income of the difference or $ 4k    your income was n’t $ 19k because you originally put $ 15k in cash into the car that cash was already saved from income you made in the past and it is not counted again as income in this sale   because you did not work for this new car sale income but it was derived from asset growth the income is called capital gains you invested your capital $ 15k into the asset car and that asset appreciated when you sold it you received capital money back in exchange for that asset the capital you received is more than what you invested which is to say you gained $ 4k of capital by investing in and then selling your   asset car   because you held the car for two years you qualify for lower long term capital gains tax rate on that $ 4k had you sold it after year 1 you paid your regular normal income tax rate on those capital gains either way you owe the tax when you sell the asset not when it appreciates   i ’m sure you realize this already but if we change the car to amazon stock in my story this is exactly how it works with investors   the author gets several things wrong    1 amazon profits are not passed through to shareholders for income tax purposes if amazon paid dividends those dividends would be taxed at payout at the long term capital gains rate and they would be paid out of cash amazon has left after it already paid corporate taxes on profits    amazon has decided they can add more value to investors by using cash to grow instead of paying dividends when the investors sell the stock they will owe capital gains on the growth of that stock if amazon is correct that using cash to grow then investors will effectively pay more when they sell the stock than they would pay today if dividends were paid   2 asset appreciation is not income those investors will realize the income when they sell the stock and they will pay the tax then    3 he is missing the point entirely on why amazon runs a low profit or how business strategy translates into financials low prices are not a function of low profitability low profitability could be an adverse result of low pricing but being low profit in order to be low price is a ridiculous and failing strategy amazon ’s low pricing is a function of their unparalleled buying power unparalleled consumer and product data amazing logistics prowess clever loyalty programs like amazon prime and many other brilliant things they ’ve done their low profitability is a function of their investment in things like amazon fresh amazon alexa drone delivery automated convenience stores building out cloud computing infrastructure and many other r&amp;d projects $ 4 billion in original content spending for amazon prime video and all kinds of expenditures years ahead of when they become profitable by the time consumers want it amazon already built it three years ago this is the power of amazon sometimes multi billion dollar experiments fail and all that money was for nothing sometimes they lose money for a few years and then become the infrastructure that runs a third of the internet amazon does not let fear of failure stop them they invest in growth with their cash this is how bezos thinks how do we build the future not how can i avoid tax     i do need to make a disclaimer here there could be special tax treatment of classic cars that makes my example not work also classic cars may not appreciate in value i do n’t know anything about classic cars i just picked a politically neutral thing to put in my story and made some assumptions to illustrate how capital gains work my story is definitely how stocks work and probably cars but i just want to point out that i do n’t know shit about car collecting

similar to what adam f says above except instead of just transfering the amount you spend on the credit card into the high interest account why not keep the majority of your funds apart from a small amount say a couple of hundred for emergencies in the high interest account until the credit card needs to be paid off even better if you have a mortgage with an 100 offset account keep all your funds in this and pay off your credit card in full from it on or before the due date being a 100 offset to your mortgage interest rate you will be saving at a higher rate than a high interest rate savings account and you will be able to do all your normal banking from it unlike a high interest account which you usually have to link to an additional account to deposit and withdrawl money to and from if you are to use a credit card keep these simple rules in mind hope this has helped regards victor

   operations organized and by foreign governments have played a substantial role in the political and economic development of poorer countries around the world we look at cia backed against governments which had nationalized a considerable amount of foreign investment using an event study methodology we find that private information regarding coup authorizations and planning increased the stock prices of multinationals that stood to benefit from the regime change the presence of these abnormal returns suggests that there were leaks of classified information to asset traders consistent with theories of asset price determination under private information this information often took some time to be fully reflected in the stock price we find that coup authorizations on net contributed substantially more to stock price rises of highly exposed companies than the coup events themselves    gt;this suggests that most of the value of the coup to the affected companies had already been anticipated and incorporated into the asset price before the operation was undertaken

i would say it actually applies to more readily to things like eating dinner than moral acts the rationalization part need not be a justification it may simply be the narrative your mind creates to give the illusion of agency to the actions you perform   what i was getting at originally though is that most people rationalize emotional decisions after the fact the mark of a higher moral being is one whose rational morals are informed by but ultimately its   emotional instincts    your counterexample of deserved is telling there are two distinct lines of thought in justice punitive and preventative punitive focuses on retribution while preventative focuses on isolation or elimination of an individual from a situation where it can do further harm    i think most punitive measures are at heart an emotional response to a situation or an entity while preventative usually is informed by emotion but ultimately rational this is another division in the potential reasons why someone might cheat a large organization on the emotional side one might live in a dramatically unequal society in which such organizations often blatantly act in a manner which is contrary to all social conditioning we receive from a very young age despite this they thrive this observation might lead to resentment and a sensation that such organizations deserve to be punished for their deeds and a persons deeds might be justified because of this at least in their heads   alternatively one might think that the continued existence of such organizations and the systems which make them successful is a force for human misery and therefore work to lessen their impact and/or ultimately destroy them    i think it is interesting that most people would find the punitive motive for behavior to be childish destructive and immoral in these terms despite this they will happily apply it to individual humans who it is and frustrating to me that people in moments of anger and grief when these observations are most important will not see this even when it is presented to them plainly i chalk it up to the dominance of emotion over reason

you will owe tax on all but the deposit that was not taxed   e.g. you deposited $ for 3 years and deducted $ 5 k for each of 2 years the third $ 5 k   deposit was a nondeductible ira contribution which you reported to the irs by filing form 8606 with your tax return for that year now you convert the total balance of $ 18 k $ 15 k of contributions plus $ 3 k of interest gains in this case $ 5 k is not taxable income while the $ 13 k is taxable income this calculation is done on form 8606 for the year of the rollover edit in response to op 's comment the roth conversion is text based on the value of a day it was   converted one thing to be aware of is that you can re characterize up until the time you file your taxes for 2017 in april 2018 or with extension up until october   this offers you the opportunity to undo the conversion if for whatever reason the value is lower at the time you do your taxes or if the converted amount will put you into a higher tax bracket you do n't need to give the irs a reason it 's up to your discretion as dave note in a comment the conversion is n't all or none the recharacterization along with this fact help you to fine tune exactly how much in converted in hindsight

wire transfers normally run through either the fedwire system or the clearing house interbank payments system chips the process generally works like this you approach a bank or other financial institution and ask to transfer money you give the bank a certain code either an international bank account number or one of several other standards which informs the bank where to send the money   the bank sends a message through a system like fedwire to the receiving bank along with settlement instructions   this is where the process can get a bit tricky for the wire transfer to work the banks must have reciprocal accounts with each other or the sending bank must send the money to a bank that does have such an account with the receiver if the sending bank sends the money to a third party bank the transaction is settled between them and the money is then sent to the receiving bank from the third party bank this last transaction may be a wire transfer ach transfer etc   the federal reserve fits into this because many banks hold accounts for this purpose with the federal reserve this allows them to use the fed as the third party bank referred to above interestingly enough this is one of the significant ways in which the fed makes a profit because it along with every other bank and routing agent in the process collects a miniscule fee on this process   you 'll often find sources that state that fedwire is only for transferring large transactions while this is technically correct it 's important to understand that financial institutions do n't settle every wire transfer or payment immediately although the orders are put in immediately the financial institutions settle their transactions in bulk at the end of the business day and even then they normally only settle the difference so if chase owes bank of america $ 1 m and bank of america owes chase $ 750 k they do n't send these as two transactions chase simply credits bac $ 250k.   you did n't specifically ask about ach transfers which as littleadv pointed out are different from wire transfers but since ach transfers can often form a part of the whole process i 'll explain that process too ach is a payment processing system that works through the federal reserve system among others the federal reserve through the and systems is by far the largest payment processor   the physical cash itself is n't transferred in simple terms the money is transferred through the ach system between the accounts each bank maintains at the federal reserve   here is a simple example of how the process works i 'm summarizing the example from wikipedia let 's say that bob has an account with chase and wants to get his paycheck from his employer stack exchange directly deposited into this account assume that stack exchange uses bank of america as their bank   bob the receiver fills out a direct deposit authorization form and gives it to his employer called the originator once the originator has the authorization they create an entry with an originating depository financial institution which acts as a middleman between a payment processor like the federal reserve and the originator the odfi ensures that the transaction complies with the relevant regulations in this example bank of america is the odfi   bank of america the odfi converts the transaction request into an ach entry and submits it through an ach operator to the receiving depository financial institution rdfi which in this case is chase bank chase credits deposits the paycheck in bob 's account   the federal reserve fits into all of this in several ways through systems like and the fed acts as an ach operator and the banks themselves also maintain accounts at the federal reserve so it 's the institution that actually performs the settling of accounts between banks

i would second the advice to not do this real estate ownership is complex to begin with involving a constant stream of maintenance financing and other decisions   it is difficult enough to do for a single individual or a family as a unit a couple but at least spouses are forced to compromise friends are not and you can end up with long running conflicts and financial transactions of any kind impose tensions on relationships and friendships are no exception if you want your friendship to do not sacrifice it to the financial arrangement which seems like a good idea at the moment my advice would be to steer clear no matter how attractive on the surface the deal might look focus on your own individual finances and use discipline and patience to save the amount needed for acquiring a separate investment property but it will be 100 yours and will save tons of headache since you are still considering this deal it 's a great time to politely change your mind and walk away believe me a few minutes of inconvenience will save you years of frustration good luck

the essential and obvious thing to avoid getting back into debt or to reduce debt if you have it is to make your total income exceed your total expenses that means either increasing your income or reducing your total expenses    either take effort    basically you need a plan if your plan is to increase income work out how   if the plan is to increase hours in your current you need to allow for your needs sleep rest etc and also convince your employer they will benefit by paying you to work more hours    if your intent is to increase your hourly rate you need to convince a current or prospective employer that you have the capacity skills etc to deliver more on the job so you are worth paying more     if your intent is to get qualifications so you can get a better paying job work out how much effort studying etc you will apply over how long what expenses you will carry fees textbooks etc and how long you will carry them for will you accept working some years in a higher paying job to clear the debt most of those options involve a lot of work take time and often mean carrying debt until you are in a position to pay it off      there is nothing wrong with getting a job while studying but you have to be realistic about the demands    there is nothing about studying that means you should n't have a job    however you need to be clear how many hours you can work in a job before your studies will suffer unnecessarily and possibly accept the need to study part time so you can work which means the study will take longer but you wo n't struggle as much financially if your plan is to reduce expenses you need a budget     itemize all of your spend   do n't hide anything from that list no matter how small    work out which of the things you need paying off debt is one which you can get rid of which you need to reduce and by how much    be brutal with reducing or eliminating the non essentials no matter how much you would prefer otherwise   keep going until you have a budget in which your expenses are less than your income    then stick to it there is no other answer     revisit your budget regularly so you can handle things you have n't previously planned for say rent increase increase fees for something you need etc     if your income increases or you have a windfall do n't simply drop the budget the best way to get in trouble is to neglect the budget and get into a pattern of spending more than you have    instead incorporate the changes into your budget and plan how you will use the extra income    there is nothing wrong with increasing your spend on non essentials but the purpose of the budget is to keep control of how you do that by keeping track of what you can afford

i am probably not the most qualified person but i have taken some managerial finance courses   if company b is still in tact has its own documentation saying it 's a company and all that the only income company a would need to claim from b is that which b profited and the profits were given to a.   i see the above scenario similar to owning an asset like a bond which pays you interest   if the companies are merged most definitely but that probably was n't your question

you should be careful about mingling your personal money and that of the business even if it is a sole prop right now   it is a good habit to keep separate business and personal bank credit accounts just so that when you change to an llc it is simpler for you to separate what belongs to the company and what is yours personally   what you 're doing makes it more difficult although only marginally so to itemize business deductions that were paid with an ostensibly personal credit account   the better habit to get into now is keeping that distinct separation between personal and business that being said there 's nothing illegal in what you 're doing but it would make an accountant cringe that 's for sure chuckle hope this helps good luck

the answer likely depends a bit on which state you are in but this should be true for most states   i do n't know anything about pennsylvania specifically unfortunately the affordable care act created the shop marketplace which allows small businesses to effectively form larger groups for group coverage purposes   shop stands for small business health options program and requires only one common law employee on payroll this would effectively allow you to offer group coverage without having a group   talk to your tax accountant for more details as this is still very new and not necessarily well understood there are some other options all of which i would highly suggest talking to a tax accountant about as well   health reimbursement accounts allow the employer to set aside pre tax funds for the employee to use for approved medical expenses they 're often managed by a benefits company say wageworks etc   that would allow your employee to potentially pick a higher deductible health plan which offers poorer coverage on the individual marketplace with after tax dollars and then supplement with your there are also the concept of employer payment plans where the employer reimburses the employee for their insurance premiums but those are not compatible with the aca for the most part although there seems to be a lot of disagreement as to whether it 's possible to have something effectively the same work see for example this page versus this for example

i personally found the for dummies books on property investment very helpful and a great primer i found them unbiased and very informative laying out the basic principles depending on your knowledge it can provide you with enough of a foundation to have an informed conversation with banks real estates etc   watch the markets for a while at least 6 months to know what prices vendors will be expecting and rents tenants will be expecting most property magazines will also contain a suburb summary in the back   when you get closer to purchase make sure to ask your bank for the rp data reports on the properties you are looking at the banks will typically provide these for free i also set out some points for myself which i made clear for myself at the beginning this might provide a good starting point and really narrow down your research options as generic research on property investment can be overwhelming i ended up with a 3 in western sydney that has so far happily paid for itself building a good relationship with real estate agents and attending lots of open homes auctions and talking to other investors can only help   i was once told if you attend free property investment seminars you will always learn at least one new thing be it statistics methodologies finance options etc with that in mind always keep a level head leave your wallet at home and do n't sign up to anything   at the end of the day keep a cool head do n't stop reading and rush nothing

in the dark quantifying the effect of political uncertainty on the global economy europe at the edge of an economic its fate in the hands of political leaders at odds over how to solve the continent ’s twin debt and bank crises america may be pushed over a fiscal cliff at the end of the year by political dysfunction and even china although unlikely to take a deep dive is hostage to the will and ability of its government to stimulate growth more than at any point in recent history the global economy ’s fate is tied to the of policymakers how much does such uncertainty cost anecdotal evidence suggests that it costs a lot customers of cisco systems the world ’s biggest maker of internet gear are taking longer to make decisions according to john chambers the company ’s boss their orders tend to be smaller than before and to require more in house approvals they say they are planning to buy more stuff later this year reported mr chambers recently but then in the very next breath they say it depends on what happens on a global and macro europe firms must reckon not only with recession but also with the risk that their investments may be in a different currency or locked in by capital controls robert of a swedish bank says that several swedish corporate customers have put investment projects on hold because they do n’t know how the euro crisis will unfold if america falls over the fiscal cliff it would suffer a fiscal squeeze of 5 of gdp easily enough to push the economy into recession last summer as america ’s government came close to exhausting its legal authority to borrow barack obama and republicans in congress could not resolve their fiscal differences instead they kicked the can down the road agreeing on huge automatic spending cuts that would start on january 2nd just as all of george bush ’s tax cuts are due to expire along with a separate temporary payroll tax cut no deal to avoid this double whammy is likely before the november 6th election so any firm that sells to the federal government is left in limbo mike head of computer sciences corporation a big technology services firm recently told investors i just do n’t know what ’s going to happen none of us knows the debt ceiling makes last summer ’s weak economy weaker said james the boss of corporation a conglomerate last month and this fiscal cliff is the summer of but on steroids economists have long suspected that uncertainty could hurt growth john maynard keynes said investment was based on expectations that are subject to sudden and violent changes in a 1980 paper ben bernanke now chairman of the federal reserve this effect since most investment is irreversible uncertainty increases the value of waiting for new information and thus retards the current rate of investment in the 1990s and robert went further making an analogy between an investment opportunity and a stock option the value of which rises with the volatility of the stock price but disappears once the option is exercised if an investment is irreversible uncertainty raises the value of hoarding cash and waiting to see what happens the quantifying uncertainty is a more recent sport to measure it nick bloom and scott baker of stanford university and steve davis of the university of chicago constructed an index it counts how often uncertainty related to policy is mentioned in newspapers the number of temporary provisions in the tax code and the degree to which forecasts of inflation and federal spending differ from each other that index hit its highest in 25 years during last summer ’s debt ceiling battle and remains high by contrast the vix index of stock market volatility a conventional gauge of uncertainty remains below its peak of 2009 see chart a simpler index for europe that tracks news reports of uncertainty has similarly spiked mr bloom and his co authors fed their index into a model of growth that seeks to filter out purely economic factors by controlling for interest rates and stock prices they conclude that the rise in uncertainty between 2006 and 2011 reduced real gdp by 3.2 and cost 2.3 m jobs such estimates should be taken with a grain of salt they demonstrate that policy uncertainty and weaker economic growth are related not that the first causes the second many radical policy actions from the tarp bail out programme to the federal reserve ’s quantitative easing and the dodd frank law on financial reform were responses to unprecedented economic trauma collapsing house prices failing financial institutions and the deepest recession since the second world war that trauma did most of the damage to growth not any uncertainty about the policy response had policymakers stood still the result would have been less policy uncertainty but a far more damaging crisis clearly some policies such as mr obama ’s health care reform generate uncertainty independent of economic developments but at least obamacare comes with benefits as well as risks that can not be said for the current political as the fiscal cliff draws nearer argues harris bank of america ’s economist for north america the incentive to defer hiring and investment will grow putting pressure on the economy the process is as important as the outcome he says and the process is a disaster     thomas

the default of the country will affect the country obligations and what 's tied to it if you have treasury bonds for example they 'll get hit if you have cash currency it will get hit if you 're invested in the stock market however it may plunge but will recover and in the long run you wo n't get hit if you 're invested in foreign countries through foreign currency or foreign stocks that you hold then the default of your local government may have less affect there if at all what you should not in my humble opinion be doing is digging holes in the ground or probably not exchange all your cash for gold although it is considered   a safe anchor in case of monetary crisis so may be worth considering some diversifying your portfolio with some gold splitting between banks might not make any difference at all because the value wo n't change unless you think that one of the banks will fail then just close the account there the bottom line is that the key is diversifying and you do n't have to be a seasoned investor for that i 'm sure there are mutual funds in greece just pick several different funds from several different companies that provide diversified investment and put your money there

the short answer is no the cgt discount is only applied against your net capital gain so your net capital gain would be $ 25,000 $ 5,000 = $ 20,000 your cgt discount is $ 10,000 you will then pay cgt on $ 10,000 of course you could sell abc in this financial year and sell def next financial year   if you had no other share activities next financial year than that net capital loss can be carried forward to a future year in that case your net capital gain this year would be $ 25,000 your cgt discount is $ 12,500 you will then pay cgt on $ 12,500 next year if sell def you 'll have a $ 5000 net capital loss which you can carry forward to a future year as an offset against capital gains reference

since insurance is priced for profit the price will be more than the price of a new phone multiplied against the chance of loss and payout   otherwise insurance would not be offered since there was no money to be made by the insurance company the idea of insurance is that you are pooling your risk with everyone else   you all definitely pay a little insurance premium instead of any of you maybe paying a lot when a phone is destroyed   the question is not whether it is a good investment almost surely no but whether the loss at a random time would be too crippling to be absorbed by you when it happened   if you can afford a new phone without financial difficulty if it were destroyed then you should generally not buy insurance one other factor could be that although you are in the same risk pool as everyone else everyone pays the same rate but your situation has a higher risk than most insurance can be a better deal though the better investment over time would be to correct the risky situation instead of buying insurance   this could be that you have a habit of losing things live in an area where phones are stolen often have pets that destroy your belongings etc statistically you will come out ahead not buying insurance but you are accepting an unknown outcome

i just want to stress one point which has been mentioned but only in passing the disadvantage of a credit card is that it makes it very easy to take on a credit paying it off over time which i know is the point of the card then you fell into the trap of the issuer of the card they benefit if you pay off stuff over time that 's why taking up a credit seems to be so easy with a credit sic card all the technical aspects aside you are still in debt and you never ever want to be so if you can avoid it and for any voluntary non essential payment you can avoid it buy furniture that you can pay off in full right now if that means only buying a few pieces or used junk stuff then so be it save up money until you can buy more better pieces

vanguard 's admiral shares are like regular investor shares in their funds only they charge lower expense ratios they have higher investment minimums though for instance the vanguard total stock market index fund has a minimum of $ 3,000 and an expense ratio of for the investor shares class but a minimum of $ 10,000 and an expense ratio of for admiral shares if you 've bought a bunch of investor shares and now meet the recently reduced minimum for admiral shares or if you have some and buy some more investor shares in the future and meet the minimums you will qualify for a free no tax impact conversion to the admiral shares and save yourself some money for more information see the vanguard article on their recent changes to admiral shares minimums vanguard also offers institutional class shares with even lower expense ratios than that with a minimum of $ 5 million .06 expense ratios on the same fund a lot of the costs of operating a fund are per individual so they do n't need to charge you extra fees for putting in more money after a certain point they 'd rather be competitive and offer it at cost vanguard 's funds typically have very low expense ratios to begin with the investor shares i 've been using as an example are advertised as 84 lower than the average expense ratio of funds with similar holdings in fact vanguard 's whole reason for existing is the premise stated in founder john c bogle 's undergraduate thesis at princeton that individuals can generally get better returns by investing in a cheap fund that tracks an index than by investing in mutual funds that try to pick stocks and beat the index and charge you a steep markup the average real return of the stock market is supposedly something like 4 even a small looking percentage like 1 can eat a big portion of that over the course of 40 years waiting for retirement saving 1 on expenses could leave you with something like 50 more money when you 've retired if you are interested in the lower expense ratios of the admiral share classes but can not meet the minimums note that funds which are available as etfs can be traded from vanguard brokerage accounts commission free and typically charge the same expense ratios as the admiral shares without any minimums but you need to trade them as individual shares and this is less convenient than moving them around in specific dollar amounts

also peak is going to get a lot worse   no one is going to wait to plug their car in until bed time   they are going to plug it in as soon as they get home in the evenings   and if there are high fast chargers to get that first charged quickly before swapping to trickle charge then i have a feeling there will be peak price hikes as a result of the load increase

first thing you need to do is   to find out whether your landlord   will accept credit card payments   if yes then i recommend you to try the easiest method first pay rent though a rent payment service   so you need to log in with rental service and then chose the credit card using which you would like to pay rent and schedule your rent payments

yes you re right it 's far more complex than the m m textbook theory my view is that there 's even more advantages to debt than m m would say further you 've nailed exactly why these companies do n't follow corporate norms as they fear disruption despite their pretty much but their are slowly turning them msft now has a normal corporate structure apple is getting there and google hired morgan stanley 's cfo i disagree on your last point what an entrepreneur ceo who built a disruptive business from the ground up wants for his balance sheet is usually not the right thing for shareholders they do it because they can get away with it due to share class structure and their phenomenal operating performance that 's just my opinion

first ianal this is going to depend on the kind of points if it 's an internal point system that the business is doing on their own then they may very well give you that many extra points they may really not care specially if the cost of the points is low enough remember that steak dinner that you paid $ 60 for only really cost them $ 2 and that they use $ 60 worth of points on it   if the point system is tied to a bank or credit card then it 's far more likely that the just use them is not the proper answer the company doing the reimbursing is giving the location $ 60 and using your points the points have a much higher value   with that said your responsibility is to notify and follow their rules so notify them in writing and use the rewards card as you normally would if your being honest then the worst that happens is that your point balance is a little negative because you spent 100 points but really only had 98 after adjustment   most likely if your being honest they will just eat the few points over that you went on accident   if you get an answer in writing to just keep the points then i guess you know where your daughter 's wedding reception will be let 's hope it 's a place of course as a good person or maybe a stupid person i should call them wait 30 minutes in the queue and then try to explain the issue to the service desk i actually did that and the guy thought i am nuts to even call and told me to just use them they are yours now i do n't feel like calling again and again until i get someone that believes it just to return them their points you will want to do this in writing email will work but you really want a paper trail either way i could just toss the card and forget about it however i had quite some points on it that really belong to me so that feels like i pay for their fault there is no need to do this it 's like a bank error talk to them and they will give you an answer in the mean time do your best to only use the points you actually have use them and play stupid it 's not my duty to check their math right probably nobody will ever care let 's keep religious considerations out here what would be the consequences if they do realize their error some day in the far future i understand this borders on a legal question nope do n't do this if you play dumb and spend 5000 points when you know you only have around 100 best case scenario you end up with points effectively canceling the benefit of the card you may also be banned form the program the location the network etc worst case scenario they want the monetary value of the points and sue you for it and the legal fees it may even be considered fraud   tl;dr use your card but be honest and handle the mistake in writing

let me answer by parts when a company gives dividends the share price drops by the dividend amount   not always by that exact amount for many different reasons e.g. there are transaction costs if you reinvest dividend taxes etc i have tested that empirically now if all the shareholders choose to reinvest their dividends will the share price go back up to what it was prior to the dividend that is an interesting question the final theoretical price of the company does not need to be that when a company distributes dividends its liquidity diminish there is an impact on the balance sheet of the company if all investors go to the secondary market and reinvest the dividends in the shares that does not restore the cash in the balance sheet of the company hence the theoretical real value of the company is different before the dividends of course in practice there is not such a thing as one theoretical value in reality if everybody reinvest the dividend that will put upward pressure over the price of the company and depending on the depth of the offers meaning how many orders will counterbalance the upward pressure at the moment the final price will be determined which can be higher or lower than before not necessarily equal i ask because some like spy automatically reinvest dividends so what is the effect of this reinvestment on the stock price let us see the mechanics of these purchases when a non distributing etf receives cash from the dividends of the companies it takes that cash and reinvest it in the whole basket of stocks that compose the index not just in the companies that provided the dividends the net effect of that is a small leverage effect let us say you bought one unit of spy and during the whole year the shares pay 2 of dividends that are reinvested at the end of that year it will be equivalent to having 1.02 units of spy

interesting when you say diy you mean pencil and paper for most of us the choice came down to using a professional vs using the software   your second bullet really hits the point the tax return is a giant spreadsheet with multiple cells depending on each other short of building my own spreadsheet to perform the task i found the software at $ to be the happy medium between the full diy and the pro at $ 400 +   with a single w2 and no other items the form is likely just a and there should n't be any so long as you have the data you need pencil paper is fine   there 's no exact time to say go with the software except perhaps when you realize there are enough fields to fill out where the might be cumbersome or the need to see the exact tax bracket has value for you   you are clearly in the category that can fill out the one form at some point you might have investment income schedule d enough mortgage interest to itemize deductions schedule a etc you 'll know when it 's time to go the software route   keep in mind there are free online choices from each of the tax software providers good for simple returns up to a certain level thanks to phil for noting this in comments   i 'll offer an anecdote the distinction between using the software as a tool vs having a high knowledge of taxes i wrote an article the phantom tax zone in which i explained how the process of taxing social security benefits at a certain level created what i called a phantom tax rate i knew that $ 1000 more in income could cause $ 850 of the benefit to be taxed as well but with a number of factors to consider i wanted to create a chart to show the tax at each incremental $ 1000 of income added using the software i simply added $ 1000 noted the tax due and repeated doing this by hand would have taken a day not 30 minutes   for you the anecdote may have no value social security is too far off for others who in march are doing their return the process may hold value many people are deciding whether to make their ira deposit be pre tax or the post tax roth ira the software can help them quickly see the effect of + $ 1000 in income and choose the mix that 's ideal for them

the problem comes when the borrower can not afford his home   if a borrower buys more home than they can afford as long as he can sell the house for more than he owes he 's not in a disastrous situation he can sell the house pay off the mortgage and choose more affordable housing instead   if he is upside down on his home he does n't have that option he 's stuck in his home if he sells it he will have to come up with extra money to pay off the mortgage which he does n't have because he is in a home he ca n't afford it used to be commonplace for banks to issue mortgages for 100 of the value of the home as long as the home keeps appreciating everybody is happy but if the house drops in value and the homeowner finds himself unable to make house payments both the homeowner and the bank are at risk recent regulations in the u.s. have made no down payment mortgages less common

according to the answers to this question you generally are n't taxed on gains until you sell the asset in question none of those answered specifically for the u.k. so perhaps someone else will be able to weigh in on that to apply those ideas to your question yes your gains and losses are taxable if you originally traded something worth $ 100 for the bitcoins then when you converted back to dollars you received $ 200 you would have a $ 100 gain simply on the foreign exchange trade that is this $ 100 of income is in addition to any income you made from your business selling goods

the most likely explanation is as you say that the letter was automatically generated a day or two before you met with your advisor assuming that your advisor is competent they will probably execute the instructions you gave them at the meeting the letter said you had ten days to change the investment and your advisor should be able to do it in that time to be on the safe side since people have been known to forget things i would call your advisor and tell them you got the letter and check they are going to do what you decided i would then follow it with a polite email just saying that you both decided at your meeting on such and such a date to go with the three month plan if that does n't happen you can point to the email as evidence do n't panic about this even though the bank says you are locked in to the decision if an advisor makes a mistakes these decisions are in fact reversible with the advisor paying any penalty
