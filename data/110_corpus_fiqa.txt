to be confident in your solution and get the best solution for you consult a local accountant preferably one who is specialized in taxes for businesses   or muddle through the code and figure it out for yourself   the primary advantage in consulting with an accountant is that you can ask them to point out ways you can restructure your expenses debts and income in order to minimize your tax burden   they can help you run the numbers for the various options and choose the one that is right numerically

your best approach is to assess rent levels in your local area for offices of a similar size you need to take into account all the amenities parking etc just as if your home office was provided by a third party get your $ ft and work out the monthly amount with this figure you need to then work out what of it you can charge if the space is used exclusively for the business charge 100 if it 's used about half the time charge 50 etc i would strongly advise you to do two things 1 make sure your accountant and your attorney help you get this squared away 2 document everything about how you arrived at the cost nothing fancy but dates realtors addresses $ foot a simple table will do by doing these two things if the irs should come around to chat you should be covered

i 'm posting this because i think i can do a better job of explaining and detailing everything from start to stop a broker is just someone who connect buyers and sellers a middleman of sorts who is easy to deal with there are many kinds of brokers the ones you 'll most commonly hear about these days are mortgage broker for arranging home loans and stockbroker the stockbroker helps you buy and sell stock the stockbroker has a connection to one or more stock exchanges e.g. nasdaq nyse and will submit your orders to them in order to fulfill it this way nasdaq and nyse do n't have to be in the business of managing millions of customer accounts and submitting tax information about those accounts to the government and what not they just manage relationships with brokerages which is much easier for them to invest in a stock you will need to in this day and age most brokers that you care about will be easily accessed via the internet the applications will be available on the internet and the trading interface will be over the internet there may also be paper and/or telephone interfaces to the brokerage but the internet interface will work better be aware that post ipo social media stock is risky do n't invest any money if you 're not prepared for the possibility of losing every penny of it also do n't forget that a variety of alternative things exist that you can buy from a broker such as an s&p 500 index fund or exchange traded corporate bond fund these will earn you some reward over time with significantly less risk if you do not already have similar holdings through a retirement plan you should consider purchasing some of these sooner or later

thing is it 's already explained in the letter in the end of the first paragraph tesla ’s annualized delivery rate should exceed 100,000 units by the end of next year emphasis mine   when i first saw the number i got excited but then i read the actual sentence realized what they meant and it 's still impressive but it 's not 3x increase in production yoy which would be absurd to expect esp when tesla 's trajectory has been just increases per year so far and into the mid term foreseeable future   then they explained it again on the cc elon said something like we 'll exit next year at a 100k rate but it 's hard to tell how steep the curve will be but we 'll probably have over 60k deliveries i think yeah probably   i emailed the author of this article and he still believes that tesla has unequivocally stated that they will produce and deliver 100k cars in 2015 but that 's simply not correct   i have some people who know press contacts within tesla working on it out though their efficacy at press communications has not been ideal at times in the past   if tesla did unequivocally state that they would deliver 100k cars next year after delivering just over 35k this year and 22k last year that would be enormous news and should have sent the stock to $ 300 today up 30 50%+ instead of the 4 it did go up   but it did n't send it that high because that 's just not what 's happening   i 'm extraordinarily bullish on tesla but 100k in 2015 is just not what 's going to happen   100k+ in 2016 though sounds about right   and is in line with every other estimate everyone has done for the past several years including tesla themselves   so yeah this number is n't really news but it 's nice to see them reiterate it

i 'm a little confused on the use of the property today   is this place going to be a personal residence for you for now and become a rental later after the mortgage is paid off   it does make a difference if you can buy the house and a 100 ltv loan would cost less than 125 of comparable rent then buy the house put as little of your own cash into it as possible and stretch the terms as long as possible   scott w is correct on a number of counts   the cost of the mortgage is the after tax cost of the payments and when that money is put to work in a well managed portfolio it should do better over the long haul   do n't try for big gains because doing so adds to the risk that you 'll end up worse off if you borrow money at an after tax cost of 4 and make 6 after taxes you end up ahead and build wealth a vast majority of the wealthiest people use this arbitrage to continue to build wealth   they have plenty of money to pay off mortgages but choose not to   $ 200,000 at 2 is an extra $ 4000 per year   compounded at a 7 rate it adds up to $ 180k after 20 years not exactly chump change money in an investment account is accessible when you need it   money in home equity is not has a zero rate of return before inflation and is not accessible except through another loan at the bank 's whim   if you lose your job and your home is close to paid off but is n't yet you could have a serious liquidity issue now if a 100 mortgage would cost more than 125 of comparable rent then there should be no deal   you are looking at a crappy investment   it is cheaper and better just to rent   i do n't care if prices are going up right now   prices move around   just because canada has n't seen the value drops like in the us so far does n't mean it ca n't happen in the future   if comparable rents do n't validate the price with a good margin for profit for an investor then prices are and can not be trusted and you should lower your monthly costs by renting rather than buying   that $ 350 per month you could save in rent adds up just as much as the $ 4000 per year in arbitrage for rentals you should only pull the trigger when you can do the purchase without leverage and still get a 10 cap rate or higher rate of return after taxes insurance and other fixed costs   that way if the rental rates drop and again that is quite possible you would lose some of your profit but not all of it   if you leverage the property there is a high probability that you could wind up losing money as rents fall and you have to cover the mortgage out of nonexistent cash flow i know somebody is going to say but john 10 cap on rental real estate   that 's just not possible around here   that may be the case   it is possible somewhere   i have clients buying property in arizona new mexico alberta michigan and even california who are finding 10 cap rate properties   they do exist   they just are n't everywhere if you want to add leverage to the rental picture to improve the return then do so understanding the risks   he who lives by the leverage sword dies by the leverage sword   down here in the us the real estate market is littered with of people who thought they could handle that leverage sword   it is a gory ugly mess

the obvious disadvantage of paying loans off more slowly is that you will pay a lot more in total interest which means less savings and less disposable income on the long term unless you are doing something with the money which produces more income than the interest costs you this is very much penny wise pound foolish if you are n't making money by paying that money all you can do is loose money at the slowest rate you can afford you do that by paying off the loan as quickly as you can afford to do so it 's up to you to look seriously at your finances and decide what your real needs are how you 're going to meet them and how much you can afford beyond that while still paying off the loans as quickly as possible now will cost you much more than you expect layer due to the compounding you will have missed out on really   see the questions about how to start saving investing for answers that discuss how to prioritize your money there are some steps you should be taking asap if you have n't already done so

hahaha that sounds good but in real life pensions are almost never fully funded and almost never fully funded when starting off that is why the post office is almost always losing money they 're required by law to pre pay some crazy number like 70 of pension and retiree obligations up front which sucks up all resources   when a employee opens a pension plan their employer starts contributing a target amount dependent on the stated benefits and the actuarial projections the market does n't always go up and the actuaries are not always correct with either   you take the risk of losing that pension if you work for a bad company same as if you invest in an employee stock option plan you can usually take a lump sum payout but who would do that when you can get guaranteed money

not to be rude but i think you have an extremely naive view of how the united states operates insurance and health care are the exact same thing in this country for 99.9 of the people in it the reason for this is that there is no way that anyone can afford healthcare without an insurance company unless they are in the top .1 that is the way the system was set up and it results in millions being uninsured and millions more being uninsurable   i am not an ignorant person but clearly it makes you feel superior to say it so carry on you have no idea what you are talking about or whom you are talking to

as per chad 's request i recommend that you keep at least one card in each name   as primary card holder with the spouse being the secondary   card holder most easily done by each adding the spouse as the secondary holder to his her own card since credit reporting is usually in the name of the primary credit card holder this allows both to continue to have credit history important when the marriage ends in death or divorce as the case may be when you travel each should carry only the   cards on which he she is the primary card holder not all   cards this helps in case of a wallet or purse being stolen   you have to report only one set of cards as lost and request   their replacement and you have a set of cards that you can   use in the mean time as long as you are not in different   places when the loss occurs

in a sentence stocks are a share of equity in the company while bonds are a share of credit to the company when you buy one share of stock you own a typically percentage of the company you are usually entitled to a share of the profits of that company and/or to participate in the business decisions of that company a particular type of stock may or may not pay dividends which is the primary way companies share profits with their stockholders the other way is simply by increasing the company 's share value by being successful and thus desirable to investors a stock also may or may not allow you to vote on company business you may hear about companies buying 20 or 30 interests in other companies they own that percentage of the company and their vote on company matters is given that same weight in the total voting pool typically a company offers two levels of stocks common stock usually has voting rights attached and may pay dividends preferred stock usually gives up the voting rights but pays a higher dividend percentage maybe double or triple that of common stock and may have payment guarantees if a promised dividend is missed in one quarter and then paid in the next the preferred stockholders get their dividend for the past and present quarters before the common shareholders see a penny governments and non profits are typically prohibited from selling their equity if a government sold stock it would basically be taxing everyone and then paying back stockholders while non profit organizations have no profits to pay out as dividends bonds on the other hand are a slice of the company 's debt load think of bonds as kind of like a corporate credit card when a company needs a lot of cash it will sell bonds a single bond may be worth $ 10 $ 100 or $ 1000 depending on the investor market being targeted this is the amount the company will pay the bondholder at the end of the term of the bond these bonds are bought by investors on the open market for less than their face value and the company uses the cash it raises for whatever purpose it wants before paying off the bondholders at term 's end usually by paying each bond at face value using money from a new package of bonds in effect rolling over the debt to the next cycle similar to you carrying a balance on your credit card the difference between the cost and payoff is the interest charge on this slice of the loan and can be expressed as a percentage of the purchase price over the remaining term of the bond as its yield or apy for example a bond worth $ 100 that was sold on jan 1 for $ 85 and is due to be paid on dec 31 of the same year has an apy of 100 = typically yields for highly rated companies are more like 4 6 a bond that would yield 17 is very risky and indicates a very low bond rating so called junk status

horseshit for one it is n't the ceo that has to be a minority in these preference contracts it 's the shareholders so we know you 're full of shit   second no company is banned under any of these schemes because of the race of even shareholders even the suggestion is fucking ridiculous because that would clearly violate the 14th amendment    the federal gov and state governments have tons of vendors for which a small percentage they 've decided they want to make a conscious effort of hiring minority and women owned contractors this does not mean they will not accept white contractors it means that after bids are submitted they might still consider a minority or women owned bid that does n't come in at the lowest price in any case it 's usually a small sliver of total contracts if you 're wondering why they do this for minorities and women they do it for a bunch of different categories including veterans and small businesses it 's a feel good story   your company did not lose a contract because your ceo is white that is just a fucking lie your company might have lost a bid to a woman or minority owned contractor to which i say tough you might have lost the contract anyway to another bidder maybe your work was n't as good as you say we have no way to know without knowing your bid and their bid and if they are in fact minority owned   so as of now you 're just some guy bitching about losing his job on the internet go somewhere with that bullshit

incorrect as a given product or service becomes more complex to manufacture or support the cost of entry into that marketplace increases    any aspect of technology automatically tends towards increased barrier to entry even without regulation   increased barrier to entry requires larger investment means more risk means increased difficulty finding investment   consider computer processors in the 80s creating a processor that can compete in the fledgling marketplace against similarly available chips would cost maybe a few million   today creating a processor thousands of times more complex requiring much more complex chip of which there are a mere handful and bringing it to market to compete against that already have the infrastructure and programming history to support them would be nearly impossible and require billions   or you know you could look at the whole microsoft and intel locking out their competition from pc manufacturers by means of economic incentives or disincentives leading to a de facto monopoly that they can then abuse to force pc manufacturers to deal on their terms all possible without regulation

part a solution   assume no turnover in a.       average balance annual interest average balance annual cost of funds + annual fee = profit from a         profit from a = average balance interest rate cost of funds average balance + annual fee      so for b here is the sneaky thing the average balance is 1/12 of the volume that makes it really simple        volume interchange average balance cost of funds + annual fee = profit from a        volume = 12 x average balance so        12 x average balance interchange average balance cost of funds 0.04 + annual fee say profit from a 260        0.18 average balance 0.04 average balance = 210   average balance =   annual turnover = 12 average balance    come me bro :p

the big difference for me under the high deductible plan has been that instead of paying the co pay now i am now responsible for the negotiated rate until i reach the deductible limit the hsa is only a way to funnel medical payments through a tax free account the insurance company and the doctor do n't care about the hsa if we go out of network then i am responsible for the full rate but they only count the negotiated rate as a credit against the out of pocket deductible this big difference makes it very important to pick a doctor in network for your example i would have paid $ 50 under the ppo but $ 200 under the high plan if i go out of network i would have to pay whatever the doctor want me to pay but the insurance company would only credit me $ 200 against my deductible i can pull the extra $ 350 from the hsa it is hard to get good pricing information from some doctors but the price difference for me has been so large that in network is the only way to go for prescriptions the high deductible plan has been worse because we pay the full price with no discounts for the medicine until we reach the plan deductible that makes the cost of the prescriptions as much as 10x 's more expensive in fact the annual cost of our prescriptions all but guarantees that we hit the deductible each year

i do n't think you can really classify it as front running technically the only information that the alleged front runner in this case has over the followers is the knowledge of the trade itself knowledge of the trade may indeed be share price sensitive information for some high volume traders or those respected and with many followers but it 's not really like they ca n't know about it before everyone else parity is n't possible in this case if an company organisation i.e. the social trading platform say responsible for the details log of a trader to a following or individuals working for said company organisation were to act on the trading data before dissemination then they would be guilty of front running the alleged front runner may profit from the following of course but that 's only really occurring due to the publication of information that is share price sensitive and such information generally has to be published by law if it is by law so classified so it 's difficult to find too much fault there has to be a certain amount of consideration on the part of any trader as to who is more the fool the fool or the fool that follows them

if your regular withholding is not enough to cover your tax due then you can withhold extra   taxes to avoid owing anything the following april 15   alternatively you may make estimated tax payments to avoid owing anything the following year   some taxpayers will be required to make estimated payments typically when the tax due will be sufficiently larger than the amount of withholding if your husband says that you owed $ 5,000 in april then he wants you both to withhold $ 2,500 for the entire year   if all your income is shared then that makes sense   but if your income is not entirely shared and your personal luxury expenses come from your income then this sounds a little unfair you are paying some of the tax on his income   if you do n't share 100 of your income then he should withhold more extra than you do something more like $ for him and $ for you depending on the details   if you share everything then all the income and all the taxes are shared so the individual accounting matters little yes if you overpay taxes you may get a refund   do not do this that 's just an interest free loan to the government   instead put the extra money into a savings account of your choice and withdraw it whenever you want

about 10 years ago i used to use trader which was a very sound tool with a large number of indicators but it has been a number of years since i have used it so my comments on it will be out of date at the time it relied upon me purchasing trading data myself which is why i switched to incredible charts i currently use incredible charts which i have done for a number of years initially on the free service now on the $ for eod data access there are quicker levels of data access which might suit you but i ca n't comment on these it is web based which is key for me the data quality is very good and the number of indicators is excellent you can build search routines on the basis of specific indicators which is very effective i 'm looking at as a replacement for or in addition to incredible charts as it has very powerful backtesting routines and the ability to run test portfolios with specific buy sell criteria that can simulate and backtest a number of trading scenarios at the same time the advantage of all of these is they are not tied to a particular broker

if you were asking if you should buy silver for an emergency fund i 'd say no but you already have it   note i wrote most of the below under the assumption that this is silver bullion coins bars it did n't occur to me till the end that it could be jewelry   both of you have good arguments for your points of view breaking it down her points 1 a very good point and while she may not be irresponsible maybe the of it is good for her psychology it 's her 's so her comfort is important here 2 good make sure it 's explicitly listed on the policy 3 bad i think it will as well at least the long run but this is not a good reason for an emergency fund the whole point of which is to be stable in case of emergencies 4 good identity theft is a concern though unless her info is already out there it 's insufficient for the emergency fund and besides she could keep cash your points 1 iffy on the one hand you 're right on the other hand cyprus it is good to remember that money in accounts is in someone else 's control not yours as the found out to their and of course it ca n't happen here but that 's what they thought too there is value in having some hard assets physically in your control think of it as an emergency emergency fund cash works too but precious metals are better for these mega upheaval scenarios again find out how having such an emergency fund would make her feel does having that give her some comfort a gift from a family member of this much silver leads me to assume that her family might have a little bit of a culture if so then even if she is not a herself she may derive some comfort from having it just in case it 'll be baked into her background definitely a topic to discuss with her 2 excellent point this is precisely why you want your emergency fund in some form of cash 3 bad you can walk into any pawn shop and sell it in a heartbeat or you can send it in to a company and have cash in days 4 bad if you know a savings account that pays please please please tell me where it is so i can get one fact is all cash instruments pay negligible interest now and all such savings are being eroded by inflation 5 maybe there is value to looking at your net worth this way but my experience has been that those that do take it way too far i think there 's more value at looking at allocation within a few broad buckets emergency fund savings car house college etc and retirement fund if this is to be an emergency fund as per point 1 then you should look at it as its own bucket and maybe add a little cash too       another thought to add this is a gift from a family member they gave her a lot of silver of course it 's your so 's now and she can do whatever she wants with it but how would the family member react if she did liquidate it if that family member is a and gave her this with the emotional desire to see her they may be upset if she sold it it just occurred to me this may be jewelry your so may not have sentimental attachment to it but what about the family member 's sentiments they may not like to see family silver they loving maintained and passed on casually discarded for mere cash by your so another thing to discuss with her       wrap up generally you are right about not keeping a 6 month emergency fund in silver but there are other factors to consider here there 's also the fact that it 's already bought the cost of buying paying over market has already been taken   edit so it 's ah so it 's well scratch everything except how the family member feels about which now looms large   this does n't have much value as an emergency fund nor really as an investment if you did keep it as an investment think of it as an investment in collectibles art less so in precious metals if no one will get upset i 'd say pick out the set to keep for special occasions and sell the rest find out first if it has collectible or historical value it may be worth far more than the pure weight in silver ebay might be the way to go to sell it

there is plenty of over in the majority of these answers when the simple answer is that it is simply down to statistics say an insurer had two pieces of information about two separate drivers annual mileage and whether they had had an accident in the last 3 years driver a drives 10,000 miles a year and has n't had an accident in the past 3 years driver b drives 500 miles a year and has n't had an accident in the past 3 years which would the insurer think was the safer bet the answer is a and this makes his premiums lower the reason for this is that the insurer has a lot more data about driver a than driver b they know that driver a has driven 30,000 miles without having an accident this could of course be luck or a fluke but it is likely that driver a is actually a safe driver the chance that driver a has n't had an accident just through sheer luck and that they are actually a terrible driver is quite slim on the other hand driver b has only driven 1,500 miles in the past three years whilst this seems like prima evidence of them being as safe a driver as driver a it is much more likely that driver b could have driven 1,500 miles and avoided an accident through sheer luck even though they are a terrible driver   this means drivers who drive low amounts of mileage will be penalised relative to other drivers who have high mileage it has nothing to do with insurers taking a judgement that doing more mileage makes you more experienced or makes you a better driver as others have suggested here although it is probably true it 's not quantifiable from an insurer 's perspective

the price of the last trade is the price of the last trade it indicates what one particular buyer and seller agreed upon there is absolutely no requirement that one of them did n't offer too much or demand too little so this is nearly meaningless as an indication of what anyone else will be willing to offer or demand an average of trades across a sufficiently large number of transactions might indicate a rough consensus about the value of a stock but transactions will be clustered around that average and the average itself moves over time either you offer to sell or buy at a particular price wait for that price and risk the transaction not taking place at all if nobody agrees or you do a spot transaction and get the best price at that which may not be the best in the next or you tell the broker what the limits are that you consider acceptable trading these risks off against each other pick the one which comes closest to your intent and ignore the fact that others may be getting a slightly different price that 's just the way the market works if his price is lower why did n't you buy it there he 's out of stock well come back when i 'm out of stock and i 'll be unable to sell it to you for an even better price

canada did not introduce income taxes before world war i.   specifically deficits forced them to in the later part of the war the conservatives opposed income tax as they wanted to attract immigrants primarily from the united kingdom and the united states as opposed to eastern europe and they wanted to give their preferred choice of some incentive to come to canada expenses forced the to re consider their options and in 1917 the government imposed a temporary income tax to cover expenses despite the new tax the canadian government ran up considerable debts during the war and were unable to forego income tax revenue after the war ended with the election of the king led liberal government much of the national policy was dismantled and income tax has remained in place ever since so from a canadian point of view they were introduced as part of the war effort

talk to a good tax accountant in the uk who deals with this sort of thing as it sounds like most of the issues concern local tax you actually have at least four different ways to do this transaction you definitely need good local tax and legal advice no matter how you do it if the borrower defaults it will be socially ugly and will involve some kind of collection or legal action if you want your money back   if it were me i think i 'd choose the lease with option to buy at least that way you may be able to inspect the property from time to time make sure it is kept up and be able to get it back through eviction rather than foreclosure

on your first point banks or any large company is primarily concerned with maintaining profits i 'm very familiar with this dynamic in media with broadcast vs streaming they will try hard to charge as much as possible to sustain the stock price while competitors will be as aggressive as possible to capture market share this always happens with every industry that gets the new entrants will permanently eat away at bank profits whether they adapt or not    no comment on your second point possibly true but i do n't personally assume that yet

check with your bank   as of january 2015 the following banks and credit unions are offering free credit scores announced in the pipeline source banks to offer fico credit scores for free personal experience i 've been receiving free fico score from my credit union for more than 6 months now advice most people have multiple bank credit union accounts the fico score will be the same whoever offers it if none of your financial institutions offer you a free credit score then you may opt for free services like creditkarma.com or other paid services none of them are the widely used fico scores but they can be a good gauge of your credit standing please note that a credit score is number summarizing your credit report and should not be confused   in the news

all of this assumes that this relationship is n't as employer employee relationship which would require you to withhold taxes if you send them a small token of appreciation and you are unable to record it as a business expense or some other deductible expense you do n't have to be concerned about how they claim it they decide if they want to risk claiming it was a gift or if they want to record it as an expense even if you say some magic phrase that you think will impress the irs the recipient can still decide declare it as income to have any hope of being able to treat it as a gift they would have to be able to demonstrate that there is a non business relationship   if you can claim it as a business expense or a deductible expense   they will have to also claim it as income because your documentation could point the irs to their lack of documentation   giving them a check or sending the payment electronically will require them to claim it as an income since an audit could require them to explain every line on their bank statements

for a real estate transaction there are multiple stages from the sellers viewpoint from the buyers viewpoint if both parties are comfortable skipping some of the steps the role of the agent can be minimized how will a fair price be determined some realism might be needed to make sure that the loan appraisal will not be a problem will an inspection still be needed what warranty will exist if the a c dies this summer   if you still want help from an agent one should be able to help for far less than the normal commission the seller normally interviews three agents before selecting one do the same in this situation ask how much they would charge for a sale between friends they can complete their task in just a couple of hours if the home inspection comes back relatively clean the transaction should be very easy the paperwork is the biggest hurdle you should jointly identify a local settlement company they will be the ones actually filing the paperwork they have lawyers they will check the county records office for existing liens mortgages and address all the issues they can send the proper paperwork to the existing mortgage companies and arrange for mortgage insurance the cost will be the same regardless of the presence of real estate agents and other lawyers   when they say a lawyer is required it is only because of the paperwork

your initial plan of minimizing your interest rate and taking advantage of the 401(k match makes sense except i would put the 401(k money in a very low risk investment such as a money market fund while the stock market seems to be in a bear market   how to decide when the stock market is in a bear market is a separate question you earn a 100 return immediately on money that receives the company match provided that you stay at the company long enough for the company match to vest   this immediate 100 return far exceeds the 3.25 return by paying down debt as long as it makes sense to keep your retirement funds in low risk low return investments it makes more sense to use your remaining free cash flow to pay down debts than to save extra money in retirement funds after setting aside the 6 of your income that is eligible for the company match you should be able to rapidly pay down your debts   this will make it far easier for you to qualify for a mortgage later on   also if you can pay off your debt in a couple years you will minimize your risk from the proposed variable rate   first there will be fewer chances for the rate to go up   second even if the rate does go up you will not owe the money very long

the clusterfuck you mention was a real estate bubble built with the full backing of bankers the problem is that real estate bubbles are very profitable to selected few so there is a huge incentive in building them    i do wish some economist would be able to come up with new way of doing business in which we would not always build these bubbles that inevitably will burst    i do feel bad for all the in spain who were no longer able to sell the real estate they bought for higher amount of money as all the others before them     it is that after all the bubbles in history we still do business like this

i understand your anger still you should consider that the banks are a key factor in economic growth hurting them hurts us because its our money that makes them so rich   as for the feds you suggest private regulation firstly its slightly absurd to have the feds the regulator of private businesses controlled privately secondly atleast government is with economic policy in fear of elections private regulation would do whatever made the and hence business more money think bailout without sec   there is no denying banking is a ethically dubious business but it is important to the complexity and of the economic system change is harder than outrage it requires a stroke of both politically and economically

as an investment the trend does n't really matter what matters is the price which you buy the house and the price at which you sell   say you buy a house for $ 250k today   in general it does n't matter if the house is worth $ 200k or $ 300k tomorrow neglecting things like refinancing and home equity loans   what matters is the price when you sell   the longer you plan to stay the less the current market conditions mean of course there is a lot more that goes into the decision to buy a house since you are going to live in it you also need to take into account things like how long you plan on staying in the area the stability of your job and future family size

barney in washington us banks have big enough capital buffers to keep trading through an economic meltdown regulators said on thursday in a finding that improves their chances of boosting payouts to shareholders   in the first round of this year ’s stress tests the federal reserve how 34 banks would fare in a financial and economic slump in which the unemployment rate doubles and the stock market loses half its value the central bank calculated that the banking sector would endure $ in losses in the simulated downturn   yet officials concluded that the banks would emerge from the crash well with of shareholder funding still above the fed ’s minimum required levels   the largely results well for us banks as the fed prepares to the results of the second round next week when investors will learn how much capital they can return through dividends and share buybacks   however the figures released on thursday do not what the fed will say about payouts not least because regulators can approve or block us banks’ capital plans on qualitative as well as quantitative grounds   bank stress tests the once vital check on the industry ’s health is its usefulness    ubs analysts estimate that the four biggest by assets jpmorgan bank of america citigroup and wells fargo will be able to return a net $ this year rising to $ in 2018   citi and morgan stanley could be among about a dozen banks that will make requests to return more than 100 per cent of their annual earnings to shareholders according to goldman sachs analysts   despite the positive stress test results not all investors would be comfortable with such a bill a fixed income investment manager at asset management in philadelphia said the prospect of payouts in excess of profits does scare us a little bit   if the safety blanket is pulled away         that may come to the detriment of capital and safety   across the board passes for the stress test are a good thing he said as it shows that banks have rebuilt capital levels substantially since the crisis but from a creditor ’s standpoint you do n’t want to see all the profits go out the door    while banks have already told the fed what they propose to do on dividends and buybacks they are now able to make more conservative payout plans if based on the first round results they think it will reject them in the second round   related article regulators back trump on looser financial rules officials endorse volcker rule revamp and bank relief from burden of stress    the regulator ’s simulated downturn lasts for nine quarters banks’ overall loan losses and declines in capital under the worst crisis scenario were smaller than in last year ’s stress tests fed officials said   still the test found that some banks would come close to breaching regulatory minimums during the meltdown on some metrics for instance morgan stanley ’s supplementary leverage ratio a new measure of financial strength that takes effect in 2018 would drop as low as 3.8 per cent compared with a required level of 3 per cent   the results also drew attention to banks’ exposure to credit card lending the fed found banks would suffer the biggest losses in their card portfolios in the hypothetical crisis   fed officials said that partly reflected a rapid expansion in the size of banks’ credit card assets and rising delinquency rates in the real world   copyright

this may be a great idea or a very bad one or it may simply not be applicable to you depending on your personal circumstances and interests the general idea is to avoid passive investments such as stocks and bonds because they tend to grow by only a few percent per year instead invest in things where you will be actively involved in some form with those much higher investment returns are common but also the risk is higher and you may be tied down and have to limit the traveling you want to do so here are a few different ways to do that get a college degree but only if you are interested in the field and it ends up paying you well if you are n't interested in the field you wo n't land the $ 100k+ jobs later and if you study early childhood education you may love the job but it wo n't pay enough to make it a good investment of course it also has to fit with your life plans but that might be easier than it seems you want to travel have you thought about anthropology marine biology or pick a reputable hard to get into academic school rather than a oriented and make sure that they have at least some research program that 's one way to distinguish between the for profit schools who tend to be very expensive and land you in low paying jobs and schools that actually lead to a well paying future or if your interest runs more in a different direction start a business your best bet might be to buy a franchise many of the fast food chains such as mcdonalds will let you buy as long as you have around $ 300k net worth most franchises also require that you are qualified it may often make sense to buy not just one store but several in an area you can increase your income and your risk by getting a loan you can probably buy at least $ 5 million worth of franchises with your seed money btw i 'm only using mcdonalds as an example well known fast food franchises used to be money making machines but their popularity may well have peaked there are franchises in all kinds of industries though some tend to be very short term there is a franchise based on selling customer 's stuff on ebay while others can be very long lived many real estate brokerages are actually franchises do be careful which ones you buy some can be a license to print money while others may fail and there are some fraudsters in the franchising market out to separate you from your money advantage over investing in stocks and bonds if you choose well your return on investment can be much higher that 's generally true for any business that you get personally involved in if you do well you may well end up retiring a multimillionaire drawback you will be exposed to considerable risk the investment will be a major chunk of your net worth and you may have to put all your eggs in none basket if your business fails you may lose everything a third option but only if you have a real interest in it get a commercial driver 's license and buy an truck i hear that owner operators can easily make well over $ 100k and that 's with having to pay off a bank loan but if you do n't love culture it is likely not worth doing overall you probably get the idea the principle is to use your funds as seed money to launch something profitable and secure as well as enjoyable for you

does it ever make sense yes but almost never   if you 're in a situation where you 're invested in something with low rates think government securities or cash equivalents then you do need to think about rate spread as you mention does the savings over the life over the mortgage beat out the 35 hit now plus all the interest you would earn over those 20 years have you factored in other considerations such as mortgage interest deduction on taxes do n't forget you need to think about how rates will change down the line they ca n't go much lower so potentially you 'll get better rates in the 401(k down the line do n't forget there 's also the impact of inflation again the rates on your savings may go up but your mortgage is a fixed payment so with even a low rate of inflation your payments effectively become less over time if your investments are in something like stocks and bonds then i would say undoubtedly you would want to keep the money in the 401(k time in market and compounding are your best friends over a long time horizon also as mentioned by @johnfx the hit of your 35 now is something you will absolutely feel now hopefully not but your life situation could change where you have an emergency and need to drain your savings or you may not see the end of that 20 years

the answer will vary person to person and situation to situation   but the basic concept to always consider is this   what interest rate am i paying on my debt 10 18   and what interest rate am i making on my savings investment etc 3 7   it wo n't give you a hard and fast answer but will definitely let you know if you should take a closer look at it   i 'd suggest talking to a financial planner about it   find a fee based planner that you can turn to to make sure you are on the right track not a commission based planner a fee based one   with respectful apologies to any commission based planners who may read this my instinct is usually to pay off the debt try to clean everything up so you do n't have anything outstanding that is charging you interest   debt is clutter it 's stressful it can be a reminder of money you wish you had n't spent   as long as you have access to money in case of emergency job loss etc get your debt paid off and keep it paid off   you 'll sleep much better

i think most financial planners or advisors would allocate zero to a gold only fund that 's probably the mainstream view metals investments have a lot of issues more here what would be the signs of a bubble in silver also consider that metals and commodities despite a recent drop are on a big run up and lots of random people are saying they 're the thing to get in on usually this is a sign that you might want to wait a bit or at least buy gradually   the more mainstream way to go might be a commodities fund or all asset fund some funds you could look at just examples not recommendations might include several pimco funds including their commodity real return and all asset hussman strategic total return diversified commodities index etfs stuff like that has a lot of the theoretical benefits of gold but is n't as dependent on gold specifically another idea for you might be international bonds or stocks if you feel us currency in particular is at risk oh and reits often come up as an inflation resistant asset class i personally use diversified funds rather than gold specifically fwiw mostly for the same reason i 'd buy a fund instead of individual stocks is probably about right to put into this kind of stuff depending on your overall portfolio and goals pure commodities should probably be less than funds with some bonds stocks or reits because in principle commodities only track inflation over time they do n't make money the only way you make money on them is rebalancing out of them some when there 's a run up and back in when they 're down so a portfolio with mostly commodities would suck long term some people feel gold 's virtue is rather than being a piece of paper in an apocalypse ish scenario but if making that argument i think you need physical gold in your basement not an etf   plus i 'd argue for guns ammo and food over gold in that scenario

i would say your decision making is reasonable   you are in the middle of brexit and nobody knows what that means   civil society in the united states is very strained at the moment   the one seeming source of stability in europe germany may end up with a very weakened government   the only country that is probably stable is china and it has weak protections for foreign investors law economics even though economics often ends up dictating the law in the long run the only thing that may come to mind is doing two things differently   the first is mentally dropping the long term versus short term dichotomy and instead think in terms of the types of risks an investment is exposed to such as currency risk political risk liquidity risk and so forth   maturity risk is just one type of risk the second is to consider taking some types of risks that are hedged either by put contracts to limit the downside loss or consider buying longer dated call contracts using a small percentage of your money   if the underlying price falls then the call contracts will be a total loss but if the price increases then you will receive most of the increase minus the premium if you are uncomfortable purchasing individual assets directly then i would say you are probably doing everything that you reasonably can do

think of ether the units of ethereum as the gas that 's required to power applications and transactions on a decentralized version of aws    if you foresee a future that involves an internet that runs applications without central ownership of the cloud servers then investing in ethereum is a good idea think of it as buying futures on computational power   keep in mind ethereum unlike bitcoin is n't designed to be a long term store of value million ether exist today and ~10 million more are mined each year that being said demand still seems to be greater than existing + new supply    disclosure i hold a amount of my net worth in bitcoin with a much smaller position in ethereum

very smart viewpoint in my very humble the lesson is that there ’s more than one way for a state to have a successful economy that ’s a sentiment that is seldom shared because you ca n’t score partisan points saying things like there is more than one way to do something do n’t me but maybe states can be highly taxed and highly regulated like california or maybe they can be more business friendly like texas and they can each succeed in a way that pleases their citizens

would i only have to pay regular taxes plus the excess contribution    tax on any contributions yes you 'll pay regular taxes plus the excess contribution taxes on the contributions until you withdraw so what would be your gain in doing this the whole point in hsa is to use pre tax money for medical expenses and you 're not only going to use post tax money you 'll pay extra tax for doing that 6 for each year the contribution remains in the account are you trying to get the employer match in this way maybe just ask for a raise instead would this cause problems for my employer in any way not sure but it might is it possible to simply receive funds in my hsa even though i am not    eligible and then transfer them to his hsa to avoid any penalties no hsa is a personal account you can pay for dependents but you ca n't move money between the accounts you can roll over to your own account see the irs publication 969 for more details

i 've done exactly what you are describing and it was a great move for me a few years back i had two credit cards one had a $ 6000 balance and a fairly high interest rate that i was making steady payments to including interest   the other was actually tied to a heloc home equity line of credit whose interest rate was fixed to prime which was very low at the time i think my effective rate on the card was around 3   so i pulled out one of the cash advance checks from the heloc account and paid off the $ 6000 balance then i started making my monthly payments against the balance on the heloc and paid it off a bit more quickly and with less overall money spent because i was paying way less interest another similar tactic is to find a card that does n't charge fees for balance transfers and that has a 0 interest rate for the first 12 months on transferred balances i am pretty sure they are out there open an account on that card transfer the balance to it and pay it down within 12 months and try not to use the card for anything else if you can help it

yes you can rollover as many different 401ks into a single ira account   i have done it personally and it really cuts down on the overhead of keeping up with lots of different accounts   your brokerage or mutual fund company should be able to help you with it   if you are using a company that just gives you forms and those forms do n't mention an easy way to combine   then i suggest rolling over one 401k first then once that 's finished you can rollover the other 401k into that same account

you can in theory have the stock price go up without any trading actually occurring it depends on how the price is quoted the stock price is not always quoted as the last price someone paid for it it can also be quoted as the ask price which is the price a seller is willing to sell at and the price you d pay if you bought at market if i am a seller i can raise the asking price at any time and if there are no other sellers or at least none that are selling lower than me it would look like the price is going up because it is it now costs more to buy it but no trading has actually occurred

if it 's just an ordinary credit card i 'd think he could merely dispute the charges since he 's saying they created which i presume means applied for and received a card it should not affect his accounts directly   and especially since application details may be bogus he should be able to prove it was not him even if they got his credit card number he should be able to dispute those charges that are not his especially if they went to a different address or were charged someplace like another city where he was not present at that time otoh if they created a debit card that was linked to his bank account somehow well then that could be a lot more difficult to recover from but even then if it 's not his signature that was used to apply for the card or on any charges that had to be signed for etc he should be able to dispute it and get the bank to put the money back in his account since it will be a case of forgery etc the big problem with id theft is people tend to ruin your credit rating and you end up having to fend off bill collectors etc the primary thing it costs you speaking from experience of having checks stolen and forged using a fake drivers license is the time and hassle of getting everything straightened out and put right   in my case it took a few hours at the credit union and all the money was back in a new account the old one having been closed when i left   dealing with all the poor merchants that were taken and with bill collectors on the other hand took months   but i never once in the process needed quick money from anyone so the need for quick money seems a bit doubtful   i 'd want a lot more details of exactly why he needs money from you refer your friend to this federal trade commission site and make sure he takes the steps listed and especially pays attention to the parts about keeping notes of every single person he talks with including name date time and pertinent details of the conversation   if he has some idea how this happened as in a robbery then report it to the proper authorities and insist on getting a case number talking with bill collectors is the worst just trying to get ahold of them when they send you letters and talk to a person not a recorded number with instructions on how to pay them is sometimes nearly impossible google was my friend   and a lot of times they did n't want to back off till i gave them the case number with the police that somehow magically made it real to them and not just my telling them a story

i agree the markets that amazon competes in his extremely competitive with larger companies such as wal mart operating at smaller margins to increase volume since amazon is continuously trying to increase its customer base and customer loyalty they really need the low margins the 1 increase could be harmful to the long term growth of the company which as the executives of amazon explain really matters more than higher profits this quarter   furthermore 5 decrease in sga sounds like a company that 's downsizing particularly a company that operates as efficiently as amazon making that suggestion unreasonable and unrealistic

in the scenario you describe the first thing i would look at would be liquidity   in other words how easy is it to buy and sell shares   if the average daily volume of one share is low compared to the average daily volume of the other then the more actively traded share would be the more attractive   low volume shares will have larger bid offer spreads than high volume shares so if you need to get out of position quickly you will be at risk of being forced to take a lowball offer having said that it is important to understand that high yielding shares have high yields for a reason   namely the market does not think much of the company 's prospects and that it is likely that a cut in the dividend is coming in the near future in general the nominal price of a share is not important   if two companies have equal prospect then the percentage movement in their share price will be about the same so the net profit or loss you realise will be about the same

first price is n't artificially maintained at a level when a refining company signs a contract to buy crude from a supplier it promises to buy at a certain price with options for increase and decrease due to the fluctuating prices in the market and it buys crude to build up a certain buffer to supply itself for a certain duration in case of supply problems as it had bought oil at a higher price it would be reluctant to lower the prices even if the current crude it buys is at a lower cost if it buys oil from the open market it has no other option than to pass on the hike on to the consumers so a more intense fluctuation in the prices of oil at the point where you buy it some airlines used hedging to take care of the in the price of oil to their operating margins   and moreover refining and distribution is a very low margin business so the company has an incentive to sell at a higher cost if required

the answer for me has to do with compounding that drop in price post ex div is not compounded but if you reinvest your dividends back into the stock then you buy on those post ex div dips in price and your money is compounded because those shares you just bought will themselves yeald dividends next quarter   also with my broker i reinvest the dividend incurring no commission my broker has a feature to reinvest dividends automatically and he charges no commission on those buys edit i forgot to mention that you do not the loss from a drop in price until you sell the security if you do not sell post ex div then you have no loss as long as the dividend remains the same or increases then the theoretical roi on that security goes up the drop in price is actually to your benefit because you are able to acquire more shares with the money you just received in the dividend   so the price coming down post ex div is a good thing if you buy and hold

there are a few questions that need qualification and a bit on the understanding of what is being purchased there are two axioms that require re death and taxes now the first is eventually inevitable as most people will eventually die it depends what is happening now that determines what will happen tomorrow and the concept of certainty the second is a pay as you go plan if you are contemplating what will tomorrow you have to look at what types of insurance are available and why they were invented in the first place the high seas can be a rough travelling ground and not every shipment of goods and passengers arrived on time and one piece this was the origin of insurance when speculators would gamble on the safe arrival of a ship laden with goods at the destination and for this they received a cut on the value of the goods shipped thus the concept of underwriting and the value associated with the cargo and the method of transport based on an example of good repair and a well seasoned captain and crew a lower rate of insurance was deemed needed prior to shipment than some other rating agency or underwriter now i bring this up because it depends on the underwriter that you choose as to the payout and the associated guarantee of funds that you will receive if you happen to need to collect on the insurance contract in the case of death benefit insurance you will never see the benefit at the end however while the policy is in force the term it is an asset that would be considered in any estate planning exercise first you have to consider your occupation and the incidence of death due to occupational hazards generally this is considered in your employment negotiations and is either reflected in the salary or if it is a state sponsored employer funded it is determined by your occupational risk and assessed to the employer and forms part of the cost of doing business in that this component or occupational insurance is covered by that program the problem is disability and what is deemed the same by the experience of the particular underwriter in your location for death benefits where there is an accident for motor vehicle accidents and 50,000 people in the us die annually these are covered by motor vehicle policy contracts and vary from state to state check the registrar of state insurance co 's for your state to see who are the market leaders and the claim ratios compared to insurance in force   depending on the particular there may be significant differences and different results in premium depending on your employer warren buffet did not invest in geico because of his to those who purchase insurance policies with geico the original poster mentions some such as age smoking and other risk factors but does not mention the soft factors that are not mentioned   they are risk factors such as incidence of murder in the region you live the zip code you live at and the that you enjoy when you are not in your occupation from the time you get up in the morning till the time you fall asleep and then some you are at risk not from a event standpoint but from a risk standpoint this is the reason that all of the insurance contracts stipulate exclusions and limits on when they will pay out this is what is meant by the soft risk factors and need to be if you are in an occupation that has a limited exposure to getting killed on the job then you will be paying a lower premium than someone who has a high risk occupation   it used to be that iron workers had a high incidence of injury and death but over the last 50 years this has changed the us bureau of labor statistics lists these 10 jobs as the highest for death per 100,000 workers the scales tilt the other way for these occupations in canada the cheapest rate for occupational insurance is lawyer and politician so for the rest in sales management etc the national average is 3 to 3.5 depending on the region of deaths per 100,000 employed in that occupation so for a 30 year old bank worker the premium is more like a forced savings plan in the sense that you are paying towards something in the future the risk of payout in less than 6 months is slim for a logging worker or the risk is very high that they might not return from that for fish and seafood if you partake in extreme sports or similar risk factors then consider getting whole life where the premium is spread out over your working lifetime and once you hit retirement 55 or 65 then the occupational risk is less and the plan will payout at the age of 65 if you make it that far and you get a partial benefit if you have a pension plan then that also needs to be factored in and be part of a thinking on where you want to be 5 years from today

the benefits and taxes thing in my opinion is the most people do n't realize that the cost to the company for a full time employee with benefits can be 2x or even 3x the amount they see in their paycheck   health plans are extremely expensive even if you are having money taken from your check for health insurance it is often just a fraction of the total cost and the employer is subsidizing the rest   more expensive benefits that contractors do n't typically get are 401 k matches and paid vacation days when contractors call in sick or do n't work because it is a national holiday they do n't get paid for that day also see that line on your paycheck deducting for social security and medicare that is only half of the tax the employer pays an equal amount that is not shown on that statement also they pay taxes that go towards unemployment benefits and may be required to pay higher taxes if they churn through a lot of full time employees you can usually let contractors go with relative impunity for the unemployment tax reasons not paying for people 's days off or benefits a lot less paperwork and less risk to the business associated with committing to full time employees all provide value to the company thus companies are willing to pay more because they are getting more   think of it like a cell phone contract if you commit to a three year contract it can be a pain expensive to get out of the deal early but you will probably get a better rate in exchange for the risk being shifted to your end of the deal

if you use a room or other separately identifiable space within your apartment exclusively for your business then you might be able to recoup a fraction of your rent for that check the rules for home office at the irs and adopt a consistent and well documented approach i would pay your full rent out of your personal account and then do an expense report for the portion that 's legitimately business related but that 's not a unique approach other than that i agree with the answer by you can not reduce your tax by the full amount of your rent just by having the s corp pay and trying to do so is probably playing with fire   generally speaking do n't business and personal expenses like that

in the case of bank failures you are protected by fdic insurance   at the time i wrote this you are insured up to $ 250,000   in my lifetime it has been as high as $ 1,000,000 and as low as $ 100,000   i attached a link which is updated by fdic in the case of fraud it depends if you read this story and are horrified i was too you know that the banking system is not as safe as the other answers imply in february 2005 joe lopez a businessman from florida filed a suit    against bank of america after unknown hackers stole $ 90,000 from his    bank of america account the money had been transferred to an investigation showed that mr. lopez ’s computer was infected with a    malicious program backdoor which records every    and sends this information to malicious users via the internet this    is how the hackers got hold of joe lopez ’s user name and password    since mr. lopez often used the internet to manage his bank of america    account however the court did not rule in favor of the plaintiff saying that    mr. lopez had neglected to take basic precautions when managing his    bank account on the internet a signature for the malicious code that    was found on his system had been added to nearly all antivirus product    databases back in 2003 ouch    but let 's think about the story for a second he had his money stolen because of online banking and he did n't have the latest antivirus software   how safe is banking if you do n't do online banking   in the case of this story it would have prevented but you 're still susceptible to someone stealing your card or account information   so in the bank 's defense how does a bank not know that someone did n't wire money to a friend which is a loss for good then get some of that money back from his friend while also getting money back from the bank which had to face the loss   yes it sucks but it 's not total madness as for disputing charges from personal experience it also depends   i do n't use cards whatsoever so i 've never had to worry but both of my parents have experienced banking fraud where a fake charge on their card was not reversed   neither of my parents are rich and ca n't afford lawyers so crying lawsuit is not an option for everyone   how often does this occur   i suspect it 's rare that banks do n't reverse the charges in fraudulent cases though you will still lose time for filing and possibly filling out paperwork   the way to prevent this as much as i hate to be the bearer of bad news there is no absolutely safe place to keep your money   even if you bought metals and buried them in the ground a with a metal detector might run across it one day   you can take steps to protect yourself but there is no absolute guarantee that these will work out account closures i added this today because i saw this question and have only seen heard about this three times   provided that you get the cashier 's check back safely you should be okay but why was this person 's account closed and look at how much funds he had   from his question in the two years i banked with boa i never had an overdraft or any    negative marks on my account so the only thing that would stick out    was a check that i deposited for $ that my mom left me after she    passed naturally people are n't going to like some of my answers especially this but imagine you 're in an immediate need for cash and you experience this issue   what can you do   let 's say that rent is on the line and it 's $ 25 for every day that you 're late   other steps to protect yourself some banks allow you to use a keyword or phrase   if you 're careful with how you do this and are clever it will reduce the risk that someone steals your money

short answer go to the bank and ask them about your options for opening a business account talk to an attorney about the paperwork and company structure and taxes long answer you and your buddies jointly own an unincorporated business this is called a partnership yes there is paperwork involved in doing it properly and the fact that you guys are minors might complicate that paperwork a little bit in terms of what type of account to open a business account running a business through a personal account joint or otherwise is a sure way to get that account shut down your bank will want to know the structure of the business and will require documentation to support that for a partnership they will probably want a copy of the partnership agreement for an llc they 'll probably want a copy of the filing with ohio secretary of state as well as the operating agreement etc that said pop into a local bank and ask a business banker directly what you should do they deal with new businesses all the time and would probably be best qualified to help you figure out the bank account aspect of it regarding business structure this really impacts a lot more than just the type of bank account to open and how you file your taxes it is something you guys should really discuss with an attorney what happens if down the road one of you quits what happens if you want to bring in a new partner later   what if there is a disagreement about something   these are all things that the attorney can help you address ahead of time which is a heck of a lot easier and cheaper than trying to figure it out later you 're in enough that you should certainly be able to buy a couple hours of a lawyer 's time getting the formation stuff right could save all of you a lot of money and later

i just scanned in a single sheet summary of my last two years tax returns it is something our cpa does for us how would i post it do n't worry i marked out all the personal information     what is says is i paid over $ 50 k in taxes in 2015 last year we had one of our biggest contracts put on hold so i only paid $ 20k.    i wo n't have this years figures because we do n't submit them to our cpa until the end of the year however this year we just bought out two other owners at $ 1.2 m which makes me a 33 owner the contract is getting knock on wood which all together means my personal tax liability is going to be well over $ 100k.    my company is a commercial company but we work with the government and matter of fact some of the stuff we produce was designed and developed by the government as is many of today 's modern inventions i think you would be surprised    so lets tackle it one at a time pick one of those things that commercial does better than government    p.s higher taxes does n't mean higher for you a lot of times it means higher for guys like me or way better than me which i am perfectly fine with and matter of fact would support people who use more like large corporations should pay more for it

it depends how you do it   if you roll it from your 401k directly to a roth then you will have to pay the taxes   the contributions to the 401k are tax deferred   meaning you do not owe taxes on the money until you collect it   roth contributions are post tax but the gains are not taxed so long as they are disbursed under acceptable conditions according to the regulations if you roll it directly from the 401k to a regular tax deferred ira you should be able to do that with out penalties or taxes   you will still have to pay the taxes at disbursement if you have the money disbursed to you directly then you will have to pay the penalties fees and taxes   your contributions to an ira will then be subject to limitations based on the ira   it will literally be exactly like you are taking money from your pocket to invest in the ira    your company should give you the option of a rollover check   this check will be made out to you but it will not be able to be deposited in a regular account or cashed   it will only be redeemable for deposit into a retirement account that meets the regulatory requirements of the 401k rollover criteria   i believe the check i received a few years ago was only good for 60 days   i recall that after 60 days that check was void and i would receive a standard disbursement and would be subject to fees and penalties   i am not sure if that was the policy of price or if that is part of the regulation

the loan itself is not tax deductible unless you took it as part of a mortgage anyway it 's just a regular loan   mortgage and student loan interest deductions are special cases explicitly given tax deductible status other loans are not deductible unless part of a business expense or other qualifying reason if this were a short sale which you note it was not but included for completeness sake and some of your debt was cancelled that may have tax implications   you can not take a capital loss on your personal residence so the loss itself is not deductible

a big issue for historical data in banking is that they don't can't reside within a single system archives of typical bank will include of different archives made by different companies on different incompatible systems for example see as an illustration of bank mergers and acquisitions and afaik that does n't include many smaller deals for any given account it 's 10-year history might be on some different system often when integrating such systems a compromise is made if bank a acquires bank b that has earlier acquired bank c then if the acquisition of c was a few years ago then you can skip integrating the archives of c in your online systems keep them separate and use them only when if needed and minimize that need by hefty fees   since the price list and services are supposed to be equal for everyone then no matter how your accounts originated if 10 of archives are an expensive enough problem to integrate then it makes financial sense to restrict access to 100 of archives older than some arbitrary threshold

the rental income is indeed taxable income but you reduce the taxable portion of it by deducting expenses including mortgage interest maintenance insurance hoa real estate tax and of course depreciation due to the depreciation you may end up breaking even or having very little taxable income note that when you sell the property your basis is reduced by the depreciation you were allowed to deduct even if you have n't deducted it for whatever reason and also the personal residence exclusion might no longer be applicable i.e. you 'll have to pay capital gains tax you will not be able to deduct a loss though if you sell now so it may be better to depreciate it as a rental rather then sell at a loss that wo n't affect your taxes also consider the fact that the basis for the depreciation is not the basis you currently have in the property because you 're under water you have to remember that when calculating the taxes this is not a tax advice and you should seek a professional help

in theory when you obtained ownership of your usd cash as a canadian resident resident for tax purposes which is generally a quicker timeline than being resident for immigration purposes it is considered to have been obtained by you for the cad equivalent on that date   for example if you on dec 31 2016 and carried $ 10k usd with you when the rate was then canada deems you to have arrived with $ cad if you converted that cad to usd when the rate was 1.39 you would have received cad a gain of $ 400 to show as income on your tax return   receiving the foreign inheritances is a little more complex those items when received may or may not have been taxable on that day however whether or not they were taxable you would calculate a further gain as above if the fx rate gave you more cad when you ultimately converted it if the rate went the other way and you lost cad value you may or may not be able to claim a loss if it was a small loss i would n't bother trying to claim it due to hassle if it 's a large loss i would be very sure to research thoroughly before claiming because something like that probably has a high chance of being audited

as i see it the two main considerations are   total amount of money received for which the key variable is life expectancy 0.8 = so at £ 86 week she would only be better off with the lump sum if she expected to live for less than years obviously none of us have a crystal ball but you could make some assessment based on her current health risk factors etc to see whether that seemed feasible also you do have to bear in mind that the value of £ 86 in 7 years time will be less than it is now but i guess the £ 86 would be inflation adjusted her need for income versus capital if she takes a lump sum and invests it in a house that is great but does n't provide any income at all if she has sufficient income from other sources and forecasts this other income to continue until her death then the lump sum might be more attractive but if not then she would need to be sure that she was n't tying up the money unnecessarily another option here would be using the lump sum to buy an annuity and it might be exploring this but i doubt whether the rates would be good enough to beat the £ 86 week she is being offered as an alternative another lesser consideration is her future entitlement to state funded care if needed in her later years if you have assets above a certain amount you are expected to fund your own care in which case having an expensive house might actually be more of a liability than a help

a subsidy is a payment made by a group usually the state to individuals or corporations in order to shift the balance if the rational economic decision for the individual would be detrimental to the group as a whole otherwise for example if there are different quality kinds of crops that can be planted for example a gm that brings in high yields but can only be processed to high corn syrup or a naturally bred corn that brings lower yields but tastes well enough for direct consumption then if demand for both exceeds supply the economic choice for the individual farmer is to plant the former if the claims that contribute to obesity are founded then it is in the public interest to produce less of it and more alternative foods given that a market rather than a planned economy is desired this can not be achieved by decree but rather money is used as an incentive in the long term this investment may very well pay off through reduced health care costs so it is a rational economic decision from the state 's point of view in a world where all actors make decisions that are fully in their self interest in principle subsidies would not be needed as consumers would demand healthy rather than cheap foods and market mechanisms would provide these

when you 're selling something through a provider like craig 's list or newspapers the only thing that may limit your choices is the provider they may refuse your post if it 's against their rules or the law but luckily they usually do n't limit or enforce certain payment choices   these private business providers have the right to do so if they want you do n't need to be their customer they may state their terms for using the service and even refuse service before any payment is made   the fun part is that you may do so as well just remember to state your terms in your post so the prospective buyers are aware of them i 've found it best to put payment and delivery terms in separate lines so that they are easily noticeable for example nice victorian with gold only used once signed by the original author comes with a certificate of authenticity no delivery only cash payments

unless you 're running a self employed business with a significant turnover more than £ 150k you are entitled to use cash basis accounting for your tax return which means you would put the date of transactions as the payment date rather than the billing date or the date a debt is incurred for payments which have a lag e.g. a cheque that needs to be paid in or a bank transfer that takes a few days you might also need to choose between multiple payment dates e.g. when you initiated the payment or when it took effect you can pick one as long as you 're consistent you can choose how you record when money is received or     paid eg the date the money enters your account or the date a cheque    is written but you must use the same method each tax year

i think that westerners often overestimate how much influence the west has over developing countries like those in africa and that there are a million other factors that most of the western public simply does n't see    yes agricultural production has increased significantly because of western and eastern demand which calls more children into laboring in those fields because that 's just how it 's always been done in those cotton producing countries of course more business also means more income for those farmers who you can bet your bottom dollar would ask consumers to buy more of their cotton and not less   higher incomes leads to many other positives for the local and national economy families individuals and yes those children that 's not to say that schooling would n't be preferable to child labor but 1 that 's not ultimately our decision and 2 that makes a quite questionable assumption that decent affordable accessible schooling even exists there    so my assessment is that western demand for cotton is a positive for the kids in what 's more i will guarantee you that even with all the failings and unpleasant parts of the world cotton commodity trade cotton farmers would agree

gt would they go up at all   i assume based on the rest of your post that this is in reference to new tenants   gt if the minimum wage goes up some workers might choose to move out from living with relatives or roommates so there would be some increase in demand but we would n't be overflowing with potential   i was referring to the areas where people who are currently making $ 15/hr live people can always live in cheaper areas but the neighborhood generally reflects that so people would rather live in the nicer places with less crime and better roads    that you assume people will have relatives that they can live with tells me something   gt and if rents started going up these new entrants to the housing market would likely fallback on their original housing setup with would moderate the impact   looks like you 're starting to get it   gt as far as gas goes while i do n't have specific numbers in front of me i think it 's a reasonable assumption that us labor costs are a relatively small percentage of what you pay at the pump so even if those costs went up you would n't expect prices to surge   oh sorry i thought you meant gas for the and heat you mean gasoline maybe the have it right by calling it petrol    that will increase as the value of our dollar decreases in relation to the rest of the world due to the fact that we do n't really make anything anymore

the biggest change is the the relationship between the content providers newspapers tv etc is becoming more and more interactive    for as long as mass media has existed it 's been a one way relationship content providers shovel content to the audience   the internet has in a change so radical that it 's unlikely the centuries old model can survive except perhaps in movie theaters   who 's going to suffer the most i think is advertisers   they are still struggling to figure out what to do from all appearances   there 's evidence that a few kind of get it with heavy emphasis on a few   up to this point their business has been built on smoke and mirrors   i mean since i was a kid i 've always switched channels or got up and left during tv commercials rather than watch them and i think that 's common   in tv at least advertisers have had to convince networks that most people do n't do this but instead are watching advertisements but really could n't prove it   with more interactive models becoming predominant the smoke and mirrors are disappearing   advertisers who depend on elaborate analysis schemes to prove people are watching ads will too   i think it 's a good thing   i do n't mind content providers knowing exactly what pisses me off on the screen be it a web site or tv show and makes me skip their content   advertising will have to change from the model of selling people things they are n't interested in to a model based on finding out that people are interested in and matching them up with products accordingly   again i welcome that   if i never see another ad in my life it 's worth a bunch of starving ad execs asking for handouts on street corners

without getting to hung up on terminology here the management of a company will often attempt to keep stock prices high because of a number of reasons ideally companies keep prices up through performance   in some cases you 'll see companies do other things spending cash and/or issuing bonds to continue to pay dividends e.g. ibm or spending cash and/or issuing bonds to pay for stock buybacks e.g. ibm   these methods can work for a time but are not sustainable and will often be seen as acts of desperation   companies that have a solid plan for growth will typically not do much of anything to directly change stock prices bonds are a bit different because they have a fairly straight forward valuation model based on the fact that they pay out a fixed amount per month   the two main reason prices in bonds go down are the key here is that bonds pay out the same thing per month regardless of their price or the price of other bonds available   most stocks do not pay any dividend and for much of those that do the main factor as to whether you make or lose money on them is the stock price the price of bonds does matter to governments however   let 's say a country successfully issued some 10 year bonds last year at the price of 1000   they pay 1 per month to keep the math simple   every month they pay out $ 10 per bond   then some stupid politicians start threatening to default on bond payments   the bond market freaks and people start trying to unload these bonds as fast as they can   the going price drops to $ 500   next month the payments are the same   the coupon rate on the bonds has not changed at all   i 'm oversimplifying here but this is the core of how bond prices work you might be tempted to think that does n't matter to the country but it does   now this same country wants to issue some more bonds   it wants to get that 1 rate again but it ca n't   why would anyone pay $ 1000 for a 1 per month bond when they can get the exact same bond with basically the same risks for $ 500   instead they have to offer a 2 per month rate in order to match the market price a government or company could in fact put money into the bond market to bolster the price of it 's bonds i.e. keep the rates down   the problem is that if you are issuing bonds it 's generally caveats apply because you need cash that you do n't have so what money are you going to use to buy these bonds   or in other words it does n't make sense to issue bonds and then simply plow the cash gained from that issuance back into the same bonds you are issuing   the options here are a bit more limited   i have to mention though that the us government via a quasi governmental entity did actually buy it 's own bonds   this policy of quantitative easing qe was done for more complicated reasons than simply keeping the price of bonds up

as a used dealer in subprime sales finance has to be higher than cash because every finance deal has a lender that takes a percentage discount on every deal financed if you notice a dealer is hesitant to give a price before knowing if cash or finance because every bit of a cash deal 's profit will be taken by a finance company in order to finance the deal and then there 's no deal you might be approved but if you 're not willing to pay more for a finance deal the deal is n't happening if i have $ 5000 in a car you want to buy it for $ 6000 and the finance lender wants to take $ 1200 as a buy fee leaving me $ 4800 in the end

let 's imagine an economy where 100 of wealth creation comes from existing financial assets and 0 comes from new wealth creation that would essentially be a dead economy i do n't think it matters what your philosophy on economics is that 's a bad outcome if you do n't agree with that point we 'll stop here note if you do n't think it 's bad for this to keep going higher japan is at about 80 and we know how they 're doing   if you agree 100 would be bad then we 're 70 of the way there in the us trump 's tax plan if enacted would push us even further the question we should be asking is what is a reasonable way to encourage new wealth creation rather than protect and preserve existing wealth for starters it makes little sense to have a preferential tax rate for capital gains dividends estates as compared to earned income even if you just hate taxes and want them all to be gone i think it 's fairly easy to say if we 're going to have taxes they should not favor income transfer from existing financial assets as compared to earned income   a much more reasonable way to approach this is to say we have a lot of concentration of financial assets in the top of wealth spectrum let 's just level the tax rate so that income from financial assets is taxes at a similar rate to income from work that 's not even an eat the rich proposal it 's just a eat everyone equally proposal all it would do is tax the very substantial gains in stocks at the same rate as the very median gains from working   the fact that taxing income from financial assets at the same rate as work is a controversial idea is to me of a government completely captured by wealthy interests

i 've got £ but the maximum house price is £ 450,000 what    happens to the £ 26,000 does it stay there with ~6 interest and no bonus of course and would be available when i retire at around 75 there would be about £ by then yes anything you do n't withdraw for your house purchase stays in the lifetime isa and keeps growing there also you do keep the bonus on it which was paid at the time you subscribed unless you make a withdrawal before age 60 after age 60 you can withdraw and keep the bonus note that you need to be buying with a mortgage to be allowed to use the lifetime isa money without penalty this is mentioned on the gov.uk website as well as in the actual regulations that establish lifetime isas search for first time residential purchase and look at clause 6 that would mean you 'd need to withdraw even less than the £ 450 k and artificially borrow the rest all that said i suspect the £ 450 k limit would be raised by given inflation can i buy a house and quickly sell it again to simply access the money the regulations say that on completion of the purchase you must occupy the land as their only or main residence there are a few exceptions such as if it 's still being built or if you are at the time posted abroad by the government but essentially you have to move in as soon as possible there 's no time limit stated in the regulations so in theory you could move in and then sell quite fast but personally i 'd be nervous about this being seen as not genuinely intending it to be my main residence in theory you could be prosecuted for fraud if you claimed a valid withdrawal when it was n't though given the wording of the regulations it looks like you 'd be complying with the letter of the law

the answer is that other than a small number of applications the approx 10 of gold production that goes to industrial uses gold does not have intrinsic value beyond being pretty and rare and useful for making jewelry   there are a number of industrial applications and uses for gold see other answers for a list but the volume consumed this way is fairly small especially relative to the capacity to mine new gold and reclaim existing gold if you removed investment and jewelry usage especially driven jewelry usage then there 's no way the remaining uses for industry and dentistry could sustain the price levels we currently see for gold   furthermore and perhaps more importantly the best data i can find for this shows the total number of tons consumed for industrial uses has been shrinking for several years now and that was prior to recent price increases so it is difficult to tie that reduced demand to increasing prices   and one might postulate in a collapsed society you seem to be referring to in your question that a lot of the recent industrial demand e.g. the 50 cents of gold in each cellphone could quite possibly disappear entirely    the argument many people use for gold having value is usually been used as money for thousands of years   but this confuses gold having a value of its own with the reasons why something makes a useful currency   gold has a large number of characteristics that make it an ideal currency and of all the elements available it is perhaps the best physical element to serve as a currency but just as with a dollar bill just because it is a good currency does not give it an intrinsic value any currency is only worth what someone will trade you for it   the value is set by the economy etc not the medium used as a currency    so yes people will probably always use gold as money but that does n't make the money worth anything it 's just a medium of exchange incidentally two other things should be noted   the first is that you have a problem when the medium itself used for a currency becomes worth more than the face value   hence why we stopped using silver in coins and there were concerns over pennies due to the price of copper this leads to the second point which is that currently gold is too rare to suffice as a world currency hence why all countries went off the gold standard years ago   the size of national and global economies was growing faster than the supply of gold and hence it was becoming impossible to have enough gold to back all the currencies inflation concerns aside

well keep in mind until the housing crash fannie and freddie made money they received no help from the federal gov't the whole idea of the secondary mortgage market was to keep money flowing to home buyers and everyone who bought a home benefited via rates a few points lower than if banks had to keep all the capital on hand to back all the loans   both these institutions worked well for about 40 years the here was that ratings agency rated these bonds as aaa when in fact they were junk that 's who failed in their due diligence and really should be held accountable as if they were rated junk the banks would have no one to buy them except at junk bond interest rates meaning they would n't have made these loans to people who could n't really afford houses the rating agencies were supposed to be neutral of the debt and instead they essentially took what amounts to bribes from the banks to rate them highly

the lot size is 100 troy ounce see the contract specification at the same site so with the current price of around $ one lot would cost you around there may be other sites that offer smaller lots you would need to check with your broker if the price moves up by $ 500 you gain $ 50,000 for a lot the margin required changes from time to time   currently it 's $ with a maintenance of $ so a drop of $ per oz of gold will cause a margin call you make or lose 100 times the per oz movement as there are 100 oz in the contract you cited there 's also a broker fee analogous to the commission on a stock trade   the other option would be to buy a fund that invests in gold this will be more easier to buy and the lot sizes will be much less i hope you jumped into this great opportunity at the time experts said gold would have a straight run to $ 5000

the examples you provide in the question are completely irrelevant it does n't matter where the brokerage is or where is the company you own stocks in for a fairly standard case of an non resident alien international student living full time in the us your capital gains are us sourced let me quote the following text a couple of paragraphs down the line you quoted on the same page gain or loss from the sale or exchange of personal property generally    has its source in the united states if the alien has a tax home in the    united states the key factor in determining if an individual is a    u.s. resident for purposes of the sourcing of capital gains is whether    the alien 's tax home has shifted to the united states if an alien    does not have a tax home in the united states then the alien ’s u.s.    source capital gains would be treated as foreign source and thus    nontaxable in general under the tax home rules a person who is away or who    intends to be away from his tax home for longer than 1 year has    shifted tax homes to his new location upon his arrival in that new    location see chapter 1 of publication 463 travel entertainment    gift and car expenses i 'll assume you 've read this and just want an explanation on what it means what it means is that if you move to the us for a significant period of time expected length of 1 year or more your tax home is assumed to have shifted to the us and the capital gains are sourced to the us from the start of your move for example you are a foreign and your 4-year assignment started in may. year end you 're not us tax resident exempt but you 've stayed in the us for more than 183 days and since your assignment is longer than 1 year your tax home is now in the us you 'll pay the 30 flat tax another example you 're a foreign airline pilot coming to the us every other day flying the airline aircraft you end up staying in the us 184 days but your tax home has n't shifted nor you 're a us tax resident you do n't pay the flat tax keep in mind that tax treaties may alter the situation since in many cases they also cover the capital gains situation for non residents

seems like a bad deal to me but before i get to that a couple of points on your expenses onward you value a property by calculating its cap rate this is what you 're calculating except it does not include interest like you did that 's a loan to you and has no bearing on whether the unit itself is a good investment it also includes estimations of variable expenses like maintenance and lack of income from vacancies people argue on exactly how much to calculate for those maintenance will vary by age of the building and how damaging your tenets are vacancies vary based on how desirable the location is how well you 've done the maintenance and how low the rent is doing the math based on your numbers with just the fixed expenses 8400 rent 2400 management fee 100 insurance = income = = 3.9 cap rate and that 's not even counting the variable expenses yet so what 's a good cap rate generally 10 cap rate is a good deal and higher is a great deal below that you have to start to get cautious some places are worth a lower rate for instance when the property is new and in a good location you can do 8 on these below 6 cap rate is usually a really bad investment   so unless you 're confident you can at least double the rent right off the bat this is a terrible deal another way to think about it you 're looking to buy with your finances in just about the best position possible a huge down payment and really low interest plus you have n't accounted for maintenance taxes if any and vacancies and still you 'd make only a measly 1.2 profit would you buy a bond that only pays out 1.2 no what about a bond that only pays 1.2 but also from time to time can force you to pay into it a much larger amount every month

a bailout is money from the government to keep open a business that is no longer viable and by rights deserves to fail   what happened in this case was different all banks rely on the overnight bank lending market for liquidity it is the grease that oils the wheels of international banking that is not a sign of weakness or it is just standard banking practice in 2008 during the failure of bear stearns and the lehman shock the overnight lending market simply stopped operating as nobody knew who they could trust and as a result nobody trusted anybody something needed to temporarily replace this overnight lending until the crisis was over this is what that cash infusion was it was not a bailout

because the federal government wo n't use the money to buy a car thus generating profits for the car company the aim of cheap loans is to drive sales of cars the difference between the amount of interest paid on the loan and the amount they could have got by investing it elsewhere is simply a reduction in the profit this is true whatever the actual interest rates are

first i am not a tax lawyer this is just an educated opinion not a legally verified answer taxes are to be paid on income not on money that you handle for someone so if the idea is only that he gets and holds the money for you until a later point in time there should be no tax liability if the amount is high enough to raise a flag in the bank so the irs might look at it and he wants to be sure to not get in trouble he should keep it separate and keep a record of handing it to you note that if he makes interest on it or uses it to pay his credit down until you come or such the situation changes

if you want to monitor how well you did in choosing your investments you will want to use stock prices that account for the dividends and splits and other changes not just the closing price   the adjusted close will include these changes where the straight close will not include them   using the adjusted close you will get your true percentage change   for example i have a stock called pets that paid an $ 0.18 dividend in july 2015 the adjusted closes before that day in july are all $ 0.18 lower per share   say the closing price had been unchanged at $ 20.00   the close prices would say i made no profit but the adjusted closing price would say i made $ 0.18 per share on this investment because the adjusted close would read $ in june 2015 but would read $ 20.00 in august 2015 just like the closing price   the adjusted close allows me to know my true profit per share

exactly what you do with the money depends on various personal choices you 'll have to make for yourself   investing your money in vanguard index funds such as the ones you mentioned is certainly one smart move   however i think you 're quite right to be suspicious of an advisor with a 1 fee   in many cases such advisors are not worth their costs   the thing to remember is that typically with that type of fee structure you always pay the costs even if the advisor turns out to be wrong and your money does n't grow one thing to check is whether the advisor you mentioned is paid only by the fees he charges a fee only financial planner or whether he also makes money via the sales of financial products   some advisors earn money by selling you financial products such as mutual funds which can create a conflict of interest   you can read about fee only financial advisors and choosing a financial advisor on investopedia

with interest rates as low as they are you could lock in to a very low rate for 30 years if rates are higher in say 10 years you could conceivably be earning a much higher rate on the money you 're not putting towards monthly payments all else equal the payments will be lower on a 30y than they will be on a 10y so you 'll have more cash for other things but i 'm just looking for downsides being paid off in 10 years versus 30 sounds nice to me

gt;if the underlying economy has n't been sufficiently capitalized that will present juicy returns to investors   that is not true in an era of excessive regulation at the federal state and local levels its also not true when the machinations of government have kept interest rates artificially low for thirty years thereby causing a massive increase in household debt now we have a recession caused by the explosion of some of that debt people are wary of going into more debt and they do not have the income to spend right now in that circumstance capital investment in productive ventures is riskier than normal recovery of investment is less certain and will certainly take longer    add to that the increasing debt of the us government the debt can only grow so much before there is a shift in the economy and capital markets due to high inflation capital controls or other direct government intervention in the economy since there is exactly zero possibility of addressing the us debt with the current batch of criminals in the capitol and the white house investors are very nervous they need to be able to earn considerable profits to outweigh what they see as great risks    if on top of all that uncertainty you tell investors that if they manage to hit a home run and become profitable that the government is going to take a bigger bite out of their profits well many of them are going to say why bother i can live on my savings

there is a measure of protection for investors it is not the level of protection provided by fdic or ncua but it does exist securities investor protection corporation what sipc protects sipc protects against the loss of cash and securities such as stocks    and bonds held by a customer at a financially troubled sipc member    brokerage firm the limit of sipc protection is $ 500,000 which    includes a $ 250,000 limit for cash most customers of failed brokerage    firms when assets are missing from customer accounts are protected    there is no requirement that a customer reside in or be a citizen of    the united states a non u.s. citizen with an account at a brokerage    firm that is a member of sipc is treated the same as a resident or    citizen of the united states with an account at a brokerage firm that    is a member of sipc sipc protection is limited sipc only protects the custody function of    the broker dealer which means that sipc works to restore to customers    their securities and cash that are in their accounts when the    brokerage firm liquidation begins sipc does not protect against the decline in value of your securities    sipc does not protect individuals who are sold worthless stocks and    other securities sipc does not protect claims against a broker for    bad investment advice or for recommending inappropriate investments it is important to recognize that sipc protection is not the same as    protection for your cash at a federal deposit insurance corporation    fdic insured banking institution because sipc does not protect the    value of any security investments in the stock market are subject to fluctuations in market    value sipc was not created to protect these risks that is why sipc    does not bail out investors when the value of their stocks bonds and    other investment falls for any reason instead in a liquidation sipc    replaces the missing stocks and other securities when it is possible    to do so

nope you do n't get what i mean   if you put a statement that is not only incorrect but shows bias you will get laughed at by anyone   export means that you take something and then sell them to someone else   that 's a positive and actually exists though still not quite the correct terminology it is more apt   for example the philippines exports maids to the middle east   that helps the economy unlike what you are saying   but the other thing is that by saying export you are already assuming a net loss of jobs which would not only goes against 90 of economists beliefs and is the equivalent of starting an abortion debate with why do you kill babies and when anyone corrects you you claim   you already showed your bias and pretty much invited a circle jerk by using those words   which may be fine reddit where the hive mind this up but ask anyone who 's gone beyond studying macroeconomics and you wo n't be taken seriously   the choice is yours do you want a circle jerk or do you want to engage in an actual conversation

the answer to your question depends on what you mean when you say growth   if you mean a literal increase in the aggregate market capitalization of companies across the entire market then no this sort of growth is not possible without economic growth   the reason why is that the market capitalization of each company is proportional to its gross revenue and the sum of all revenue from selling final goods i.e. things purchased and used by consumers is apart from a few technicalities the definition of gdp   the exact multiplier might fluctuate up or down depending on investors expectations about how sales will grow or decline going forward but in a zero growth economy this multiplier should be stable over the long run   it might however still fluctuate over the short term but more about that in a minute    note that all of this applies to aggregate growth across all firms   individual firms can still grow of course but as they must do this by gaining market share from other companies such growth would be balanced by a decline for some other firm   also i 've assumed zero net exports that 's one of the technicalities i mentioned above because obviously you could have export driven growth even if the domestic economy were stationary however often when people talk about growth in the market what they really mean is return   that is how much does your investment earn for you   this is n't really the same thing as growth but people often think of it that way particularly in the saving phase of their investing career when they are reinvesting their returns and therefore their account balances are growing   it is possible to have a positive return averaged across the market even in a stationary economy   the reason why is that there are really only two things a firm can do with its net profits   one possibility is that it could invest it in growing the business   however there is not much point in doing that in a stationary economy because by assumption no increase in aggregate consumption and therefore in the long run aggregate production are possible   therefore firms are left with only the second option which is to pay them out to investors as dividends   those dividends provide a return that is independent of economic growth would the stock market still be a good investment in such an economy   yes   well sort of   the rate of return from firms dividend payouts will depend on investors demand in aggregate for returns on their investments   stock prices will rise or fall causing returns to respectively fall or rise to find that level   if your personal desire for returns is lower than the average across the investing public then the stock market would look like a good investment   if your desired return is higher than the average then it will look like a poor investment   the marginal investor will of course be indifferent   the practical upshot of this is that the people who invest in the stock market in this scenario will be precisely the ones for whom the stock market is a good investment given their personal propensity to save and desire for returns and so forth finally you mentioned that in your scenario the gdp stagnation is due to declining population   i am less certain what this means for investment but my first thought is that you would have a large retired population selling its investments to fund late life consumption and you would have a comparatively small relative to history working population buying those assets   this would lead to low asset prices and therefore high rates of return   however that 's assuming that retirees need to sell assets to fund their retirement consumption   if the absolute returns on retirees assets are large enough to fund their retirement consumption then you would wind up with relatively few sellers resulting in high prices and therefore relatively low rates of return   it 's not obvious to me which effect would dominate and so it 's hard to say whether or not the resulting returns would look attractive to the working age population

couple things i will admit i was wrong about the total graduates at each of those programs however numbers taper out the lower the program is down to about 250 300 a class also cut each of those numbers down to about 1/2 1/3 and you get the group that 's actually focused on finance many mbas do consulting marketing product development etc nowadays   also i 'm a bit offended by you saying i do n't understand the cfa could n't be more mistaken boss i 'm for l3 in june like you the requirement is only 2 years in an investment decision role this also means a lot of back office risk guys qualify that 's a pretty fungible qualification you do n't have to be a pm to qualify i have a buddy who qualified having done 2 years in fund accounting not exactly sell side er   i 'm also going to guess you 're a trader brokerage cap markets guy if you wanna throw titles around i 'm in a front office role at a bb too and worked at worked on buy side research at a value shop cfa is definitely more desired in sell side markets focused as opposed to ibd where an mba is more useful more strategy focused    the cfa is vital for up on quantitative skills an mba wo n't cover i 'll absolutely give you that but a lot of people fall into the trap of assuming a cfa is their ticket to bigger and better things if you 're working in back office risk management getting a cfa does n't immediately qualify you to do er which is a very common pitfall i see like an mba it teaches everyone how to do the same type of analysis too another reason   the title means less and less    last weekend i had a conversation with a friend of a friend about this very thing he 's sitting for l3 cfa works back office at a very notable hf and expects to be moved up without any indication that he will to research when he 's done i asked his opinions about things like the european situation fiscal cliff and a hard landing in china not only was he not familiar these concepts he did n't even know what hft was the cfa gives you the tools to analyze the impacts of pension liabilities on eps but it still takes a passion about the markets as well as creative analytical judgement to make it to er    my only point is an mba and cfa are very similar in many ways both tend to hold their noses way to high too it 's about what you chose to get out of it and too often people care more about the title than the process which is why they are still stuck in mediocrity after completing the designations    go through a list of the biggest pms in the business most do n't have either mbas or they achieved alpha by not following standard quantitative models but exploring creative and strategic avenues others undervalue while maintaining strict discipline a model is a tool to better describe behavior and understanding of markets it 's not a solution

gt;why not talk about services why should i pay more for services it 's not like more income means i use the roads and bridges more more income does n't mean more kids that need public education more income does n't mean i use fire services more   actually it does your ability to make more kinda depends on the ability of others to provide their skill or their ability to purchase more or if you own a business you need the fire service to protect your business operating during after a crisis as well as your home   this is kinda how the economy works   gt;if you ask me i 'd rather people just pay for the services they use have kids then you pay for their school drive 60 minutes to work then you pay more than someone that drives 10 minutes   except its much cheaper for everyone if it is all bound up together and provided by the government   seriously the arguments you are making are retarded like sitting in the back of the classroom eating glue retarded there is a reason that no country emphasis on no country does it the way you are saying and that is because it was done this way a couple of hundred years ago and we moved on from that because it does n't work as well   i understand the anti big government argument its just that it is taken to such an extreme now that its just stupid

high interest checking savings accounts are often a better choice than cds today for three reasons   at the time this question was asked cds were probably a better answer as rates were much higher   since cd rates have plummeted in recent years and because a cd is only semi liquid i.e. even if you ladder cds an early withdrawal fee often means foregoing the interest on that particular cd which you withdrew 1 on the other hand high interest checking and/or savings accounts are very viable options these days there are several options available that earn apy it 's not quite that simple and there are a few gotchas if you run into the balance cap problem of course nothing is stopping you from having multiple accounts across different banks 2 the high interest bank accounts are fully liquid able to be liquidated at anytime without foregoing interest 3 a minor benefit is that the high yield savings account is low maintenance whereas cd laddering is pretty hands on and may require physical trips to your bank   if you know of a way to automate the process more please comment or edit

this is basically a form of credit card kiting it 's not necessarily illegal but it can be it is however against the tos in pretty much every merchant agreement including paypal and square so you 'd most likely have your account suspended and the merchant could pursue legal action if they felt they could prove intent to deceive it 's not practical given actual fee structures but even if it were most merchants are quite good at detecting this sort of thing and quick to shut down accounts

ditto but let me add a couple of comments but more mentioned transaction costs yes many tax shelters require setting up accounts doing paperwork etc often you have to get a lawyer or accountant to do this right if the tax shelter could save you $ 1 million a year in taxes it makes sense to pay a lawyer $ 10,000 to set it up right if it could save you $ 100 a year in taxes paying $ 10,000 to set it up would be foolish in some cases the tax savings would be so small that it would n't be worth the investment of spending $ 20 on a fedex package to ship the paperwork inconvenience arguably this is a special case of transaction costs the cost of your time suppose i knew that a certain tax shelter would save me $ 100 a year in taxes but it would take me 20 hours a year to do the paperwork or whatever to manage it i probably would n't bother because my free time is worth more than $ 5 an hour to me if the payoff was bigger or if i was poorer i might be willing complexity perhaps a special case of 3 if the rules to manage the tax shelter are complicated it may not be worth the trouble you have to spend a bunch of time and if you do it wrong you may get audited and slapped with fines and penalties even if you do it right a shelter might increase your chance of being audited and thus create uncertainty and anxiety i 've never intentionally cheated on my taxes but every year when i do my taxes i worry what if i make an honest mistake but the government decides that it 's attempted fraud and nails me to the wall qualification again as others have noted tax shelters are n't generally if you fill out this form and check box d you get 50 off on your taxes the shelters exist because the government decided that it would be unfair to impose taxes in this particular situation or that giving a tax break encourages investment or some other worthy goal sometimes that worthy goal is pay off my campaign contributors but that 's another subject the rules may have unintended loopholes but any truly gaping ones tend to get plugged so if say they say that you get a special tax break for investing in medical research you ca n't just declare that your cigarette and whiskey purchases are medical research and claim the tax break or you talked about off shore tax havens the idea here is that the us government can not tax income earned in another country and that has never even entered the us if you make $ 10 in france and deposit it in a french bank account and spend it in france the us ca n't tax that so american companies sometimes set up bank accounts outside the us to hold income earned outside the us so they do n't have to bring it into the us and pay the high us tax rate us corporate taxes are now the highest of any industrialized country you could i suppose open an account in the caymans and deposit the income you earned from your us job there but if the money was earned in the us working at a factory or office in the us   by a person living in the us the irs is not going to accept that this is foreign income

if you are struggling with debt and can not realistically pay your debts off with your current level of income these businesses offer for a fee to negotiate with your debt providers a sum that you can realistically afford to pay the debt providers will consider the offer because they would rather get some money back rather than nothing as these are usually unsecured loans for you it can be a better deal than going bankrupt or trying to struggle endlessly to pay off something you ca n't afford to pay off note that even though you wo n't be bankrupt you will be treated by lenders very similar to being bankrupt in other words it will be very hard for you to get new loans in the near future

your friend would have only been liable for a tax penalty if he withdrew more 529 money than he reported for qualified expenses    that said if he took the distribution in his name it triggers a report to the irs in his name rather than his beneficiaries   this will likely be flagged by the irs since it looks like he withdrew the money but did n't pay taxes and penalties on it not the beneficiary   in other words qualified education expenses only apply to the beneficiary not the plan owner contributor   in this case the irs would request additional documentation to show that the expenses were indeed qualified    to avoid this hassle it 's easiest to make sure the distribution is payed directly to the beneficiary rather than yourself   once he or she has the check then have them sign the check over to you or transfer it into your account   otherwise you trigger an irs in your name rather than your beneficiary

equation m x 12 + = worst case scenario cost where m equals the monthly cost and is the maximum out of pocket amount   so if a plan costs $ 500 a month and the maximum out of pocket amount is $ 12,000 which in a worst case scenario you would pay it 's almost always over the deductible $ 500 x 12 + 12,000 = $ 18,000 most people look at the deductible but be aware this is incorrect in a worst case   the last one maximum out of pocket really hurts most people because they overlook it deductible vs. out of pocket maximum the difference between your deductible and an out of pocket maximum is    subtle but important the out of pocket maximum is typically higher    than your deductible to account for things like co pays and    co insurance for example if you hit your deductible of $ 2,500 but    continue to go for office visits with a $ 25 co pay you ’ll still have    to pay that co pay until you ’ve spent your out of pocket maximum at    which time your insurance would take over and cover everything new in    2016 embedded out of pocket maximums one change in 2016 is that even    with an aggregate deductible one person can not pay more than the    individual out of pocket maximum within a family plan even if the    aggregate deductible is more than the individual out of pocket    maximum which is $ for 2016 for instance even if the overall    aggregate deductible was $ 10,000 a single person in that family plan    could not incur more than $ in out of pocket expenses in 2017    the out of pocket maximum will increase to $ after they hit    that number insurance covers everything for that person even as the    rest of the family is still subject to the deductible from your question thanks not sure i totally follow you my question is essentially    say a typical large employer x gives you healthcare as a benefit on    top of your salary in fact how much does that cost corporation x    each year ie meaning in the us about how much does that typically    cost a corporation x each year that 's a good question because they may qualify for tax advantages by offering to a number of employees and there may be other benefits if they encourage certain tests like blood work and they waive the monthly fee   more than likely using the above equation may be the maximum that they 'll pay each year per employee and it might be less depending on the tax qualifications   you can read this answer of the question and it appears they are paying within the range of these premiums listed above this

the essence of your question is whether it 's worth 1000 to you to spread the payments over half a year   the longer payment plan is just a loan and buying the loan costs you more money   the question is whether you think the loan is a good price   i suspect it 's over priced the classic financial analysis would be whether you could get a better return on the loan opportunity costs   but we are talking about what are presumably not terribly big sums of money so it may make more sense to analyze this amount of money in more personalized terms   in that case remember to consider the convenience is it significantly easier to budget with the 6-month plan   watch out for other costs to the loan such as late penalties and other loan fees if you find the periodic payments convenient or you have a short horizon high yield investment then the 6-month loan might work   otherwise if you can afford it it makes more sense to buy the phone upfront

the u.s. requires money transfer services to be licensed under 31 usc in addition to any applicable laws at the state level   according to multiple sources online including the thread referenced by md tech 's answer okpay either can not or will not get a license so they are out i dug on this a bit more because i thought it was interesting and okpay has other issues with u.s. and other regulators related to its interaction with bitcoins which themselves are a hot potato for regulation right now and may explain the licensing problem   it seems to also be facing regulatory pressure in other countries by the way so it 's not strictly a problem they face in the u.s.   just for whatever reason the problem is greater here   some interesting summary points with mounting pressure on online money exchanges from us regulators payments processor okpay has announced that it is suspending processing for all bitcoin exchanges including industry leader gox earlier this month the us department of homeland security seized gox 's account with mobile payment processor dwolla on allegations that the account was in violation of us code 18 usc 1960 by operating an money transmitting business just where the bitcoin market falls under us law is unclear because the legality of bitcoin transactions has yet to be tried in court and law enforcement has refused to comment on ongoing investigations such as the dwolla case in march the us treasury said any firms dealing in the virtual currency would be considered money services businesses just like any other which means they must hand over transaction information to the government and work to prevent money laundering in the uk it apparently has also had trouble with banking partners quoting a okpay official regarding changing bank providers the uk bank that we used before did not make a final decision on whether to handle transactions in favour of crypto currencies or not therefore the compliance department of the bank asked us to restrict such transfers this apparently allowed them to reverse a policy in the uk okpay 's policy shift comes just months after it stipulated that gbp users check a box verifying that their funds would not be spent on cryptocurrency a feature that further users i had n't heard of this company prior to your question but having done some research i tend to think that at least the part of this quote about language attributed to a user is true okpay are quite paranoid about aml and another problem is that their support people seem to be very bad at english so their replies are often hard to understand their support are also slow sic however in my experience they are an honest company i found at least one case where rumors that the entire company were going to shut down were traced back to a poorly translated message issued by the company again i know only what i read just now about this company but it looked like there were a few red flags the problems with the us probably not being the most important   this type of service is probably part of the future but i 'm not sure that i 'd send money through it now in its current state or organization and regulation

there are api libraries available to various banks in various programming languages for example in perl there are many libraries in the some of these use screen scraping libraries and talk to the gui underneath so they are vulnerable to any changes the bank makes to their interface but some of the better banks do seem to provide back end interfaces which can then be used directly in either case you should still be sure that the transactions are secure some bank sites have bad security a good place to start is to call your bank and ask if they offer any programming apis for accessing their back end

this is probably the best most concise and yet detailed answer to this oft posed question i 've seen on this sub have an upvote only thing i 'd add is that hfs comparatively more active approach creates a moat vs. mutual funds which are seen as more long term passive investments this means they can charge fees and have higher expense ratios though obviously anyone in finance who has been conscious in the last five years knows that this is changing

how you can pay your rent is really up to your landlord they are however unlikely to take a credit card for at least two reasons firstly they are unlikely to have the means to take electronic payment second and more importantly merchants get charged a percentage of the transaction   these fees can be quite high to them for premium cards like travel and gold cards three four or even five percent of the value of the transaction this is sometimes why you see cash discounted pricing

the laws as written at the time required a pretty high burden of proof to show fraud   there were a lot of words like having to show intent or of the risks for it to be illegal those are always tough cases to win and the regulators themselves were reluctant to ride the banks too hard because that just reinforces the regulators own incompetence

if you make $ 10 in salary $ 5 in interest on savings and $ 10 in dividends your income is $ 25 not $ 10 if you have a billion dollars in well invested assets you can take a loan against those assets and the interest payment on the loan will be smaller than the interest you earn on the assets that means your investment will grow faster than your debt and you have a net positive gain it makes no sense to do this if the value of your asset is static in that case you would be better off just to withdraw from the asset and spend it directly since a loan against that static asset will result in you spending your asset plus interest charges if you have a good enough rate of return on your investment you may actually be able to do this in perpetuity taking out loan after loan making the loan payments from the loan proceeds while the value of your original asset pool continues to grow at any given time though a severe downturn in the market could potentially leave you with large debts and insufficient value in your assets to back the debt if that happens you wo n't be getting another loan and the merry go round will stop spinning it 's a bit of a ponzi scheme in a way the u.s. government has done exactly this for a long time and has gotten away with it because the dollar has been the world 's reserve currency you could always get a loan against the value of the u.s. currency in the past those days may be dwindling with more countries choosing alternative currencies to conduct business with and the dollar becoming comparatively weaker into the foreseeable future if you have savings you can spend more than you make which will put you into debt then you can draw down your savings to pay that debt and at the end of the month you will be out of debt but have less in savings you can not do this forever eventually you run out of savings if you have no savings you immediately go into debt and stay there when you spend more than you make this is simple arithmetic if you have no savings but you own assets real estate securities a collection of never opened beatles vinyl records a bicycle then you could spend more than you make and be in debt but have the potential to liquidate assets to pay off all or part of the debt this depends on finding a buyer and negotiating a price that helps you enough to make a real difference if you have a car and you owe $ 10 on it but you can only find a buyer willing to pay $ 8 for the car that does n't help you unless you can refinance the $ 2 and your new payment amount is lower than the old payment amount but then you 're still $ 2 in debt on the car even though you no longer possess it and you 've still increased your debt by spending more than you made if you stay on this path sooner or later you will not have any assets left and you will be in debt plain and simple as a wrinkle in the concrete example let 's say you have stock options with your employer this is a form of a call you could also purchase a call through a broker in the stock market or for a commodity in the futures market that means you pay up front for the right to buy a specific amount of an asset at a fixed price usually with an expiration date you do n't own the stock you just have the right to buy it at the call price regardless of the current market value when you buy it in the case of employee stock options your upfront cost is in the form of a vesting schedule you have to remain employed for a set time before a specific number of stocks become eligible for you to purchase at your option price the stocks vest on a certain date remain employed longer and more stocks may vest depending on your contract if you quit or are terminated before that date you forfeit your options if you stick around through your vesting schedule you pay real money to buy the stock at your option price it only makes sense to do this if the market value of the stock is higher than your option price if the current market value is lower than your option price you 're better off just buying the asset at the current market value or waiting and   hoping that the value increases before your contract expires you could drive yourself into debt by spending more than you make but still have a chance to eliminate your debt by exercising your call option and then re selling the asset if it is worth more than what you pay for it but you may have to wait for a vesting period to before you can exercise your option depending on the nature of your contract during this waiting period you are in debt and if you ca n't service your debt i.e. make payments acceptable to your creditors your things could get repossessed oh do n't forget that you 'll also pay a brokerage fee to sell the asset after you exercise your option further if you have exhausted your savings and nobody will give you a loan to exercise your stock or futures options then in the end you would be even further in debt because you already paid for the call but you are unable to capitalize it and you 'll lose what you already paid if you can get a loan to exercise your option but you 're a bad credit risk chances are good that the lender will draft a contract requiring you to immediately pay back the loan proceeds plus a fee out of the proceeds of re selling the stock or other asset in fact the lender might even draft a contract assigning ownership of your options to them and stipulating that they 'll pay you what 's left after they subtract their fee even if you can get a traditional loan you will pay interest over time the end result is that your debt has still cost you very real money beyond the face value of the debt finally if the asset for which you have a call has decreased in value lower than the current market value you would be better off buying it directly in the market instead of exercising your option but you 'll pay transaction fees to do that and the entire action would be pure speculation or investment but not an immediate means to pay off your debt unless you have reliable insider trading information but then you risk running afoul of the law frankly it might be better to get a loan to pay off your debt than to buy an investment hoping the value will increase unless you could guarantee that the return on your investment would be bigger than the cumulative interest and late fees on your debt or the risk of repossession of your belongings remember that nothing you owe a debt on is actually yours not your house not your car not your bicycle not your smartphone most of the time your best course of action is to make minimum payments on your lowest interest debts and make extra payments on your highest interest debt up to the highest total payment you can tolerate set something aside in a rainy day fund just in case as you pay off the highest interest debt shift the amount you were paying on that debt to make extra payments on your next highest interest debt until that one is paid off and repeat on down the line until you 're out of debt then live within your means so that you do n't find yourself working at mcdonald 's because you do n't have a choice when you 're in your 80 's

obama never helped with the debt on households as he promised   all the household debt due to homes with first and/or second mortgages that exceeded the value of the home was more or less by his program and other programs that were supposed to relieve households   so the debt was never addressed and is still being worked through as   millions of homeowners pay down mortgages   it 's going to continue for a few more years until people start building up equity again   this all affects the economy as consumers have less money to buy things with or maintain solvency as trillions are still being to finance companies and investors in real estate derivatives   for example a large part of the student loan bubble is due to this debt since many homeowners who would have in the past taken out tax deductible equity loans to finance their kids 's education can no longer do so   instead a portion of student debt is being carried by the kids themselves graduate under debt and ca n't buy their own homes or spend their paychecks for years or decades   there has been widespread non compliance among banks with obama 's program and other measures intended to provide homeowners from the housing bubble debt but the administration never followed through or engaged in enforcement actions that encouraged compliance   those programs were therefore ineffective and/or were always intended just to be window dressing or faux achievements   the banks are still raking in trillions of undue profits from overpriced mortgages created during the housing bubble their practices helped create   those trillions are coming out of the rest of the economy where the dollars would be better spent

based on my research the answer is both you would pay taxes on the bitcoin you mine as income and then capital gains tax when you sell them for a profit or capital loss if you lose value on the sale   you can write off a portion of your electricity bill and hardware purchased for the use of mining as a business expense but it 's recommended that you consult a tax professional for determining the proper amount that is eligible for a deduction   from forbes new bitcoin are being issued by the system roughly every 10 minutes by    a process called mining in mining computers running the bitcoin    software around the world attempt to solve math problems and the first    computer to come up with the solution adds the most recent    transactions to the ledger of all bitcoin transactions plus receives    the new bitcoins created by the system called the block reward if you are a miner and win the block reward you must record the fair    market value of bitcoin that day and mark that as an addition to your    personal or business income also note the date and timestamp at which    your coins were mined later when you dispose of those bitcoin you    will subtract the date of acquisition from the date of disposal and    you will be taxed a long term capital gains rate on any bitcoin you    held for more than a year and a short term capital gains rate on any    bitcoin you held for a year or less the timestamp is n’t absolutely    necessary but is helpful to validate the order of multiple    acquisitions or within a day the amount you pay in taxes on a long term capital gain will depend on    your income tax bracket while short term capital gains are taxed the    same as ordinary income from   another clarification in the irs 's march notice was how mining should    be treated mining is income on the day of receipt of any coins and    at the fair value of those coins this means that if you mined any    bitcoins or alt coins either solo as part of a pool or through a    cloud provider you need to report any coins you received as income where it is less clear is what that dollar value might be since the    fair value is not always as easy to determine   bitcoins    are all examples of where there is a direct usd market and    so you can easily find out their value of any given day however a    newly created alt coin that was mined in its early days has no direct    market and so how do you determine its value or for any alt coin    e.g. abc coin that has no direct usd market but does have a btc    market does it have a value do you have to make a conversion from    abc to btc to usd   since there is no clarification yet from the irs on    this issue you should discuss how to proceed with your own tax    professional has taken a prudent approach and calculates    value where a fiat or btc market exists converting an alt coin to btc    to usd as necessary and from bitcoin magazine the irs also stated mined bitcoins are treated as immediate income at    the market value of those mined coins on their date of mining most do n’t know they can write off any losses they have said    founder the irs allows you to offset income by up to    $ 3,000 per year on capital losses   if you have losses and you are n’t    writing them off then it ’s like throwing money away nobody likes    doing taxes but if you can owe less or increase your return then    doing your bitcoin taxes often results in a benefit in fact the    majority of our users are filing a capital loss which means they ’ve    actually saved money by using our tool   also gives insight for miners   mining is considered income so know the price of bitcoin at the time    you mined it he said if you make money on bitcoin trading the irs    requires that you report gains with line level detail   the    appropriate form for that is 8949 a sub form of schedule d. gains and    losses as outlined above are treated like every other capital asset

yea but they might feel and that you pulled a fast one on them and not be as willing to give you good deals in the future    like as a totally non mathematical example they have a car for $ 50k they lower the price to 40k with a financing that will bring total payment to 60k their break even on that car is let 's say 45k the financier cuts them a commission on expected profits of maybe 7k they made an expected 2k on the car but if you pay it all off asap they may lose that commission be 5k in the hole on the sale and pretty upset even more upset if they finance in house    so when you go back to buy another car they 'll say fuck this guy we need to recoup past lost profits do n't go below 4 k above break even    i 'm not really 100 on how financing workings when it comes to cars but from my background in sales this is the bar i would set for a customer that made me take a loss by doing business with them if they tried to come back in the future   this does n't take into account how car dealerships do n't own their inventory finance all of their cars and actually are willing to take a loss on a car just to get it off the lot some times

the short answer is your employer should typically deduct enough every paycheck so you do n't owe anything on april 15th and no more the long answer is your employer may make an error in how much to deduct particularly if you have more than 1 job or have any special deductions income calculate your estimated total taxes for the year by estimating all your income and deductions on a paper copy of a tax return i say paper copy so that you become familiar with what the income and deductions actually are whereas plugging into an online spreadsheet makes you blind to what 's actually going on compare that with what your employer deducts every paycheck the number of paychecks in the year this tells you how much extra you will pay be refunded on april 15th as accurately as you can estimate your income and deductions

this is a bit complicated because of all the moving parts but is a little simpler because the two warrants are now publicly traded   the main rule appears to be that your cost should be apportioned into the bases for the pieces you received by the proportions of the prices established in the market on the first day of trading in which they trade separately source   since the a and b gm warrants began trading in march 2011 at least that 's what a quick search shows use their prices and the gm price on the same day to establish the proportions   you also must include the factor of how much of each piece you received for each of your bonds so for example if the prices of gm and were $ 32 $ 23 and $ 17 on the first day of trading and you got 3 shares gm 2 a warrants and 1 b warrant for your bonds their worth on first day of separate trading would be and so the proportion of your bond cost to be allocated to your a warrants for instance would be or about using these example figures the small of additional securities you have received already i would include in the calculation above and if you in the future receive any further i would assign them a basis of $ 0 as your full bond cost would have already been completely allocated

when i first started working in finance i was given a rule of thumb to decide which price you will get in the market you will always get the worst price for your deal so when buying you get the higher ask price and when selling you get the lower bid price i like to think of it in terms of the market as a participant who always buys at the lowest price they can i.e. buys from you and sells at the highest price they can if that were n't true there would be an arbitrage opportunity and free money never exists for long

well 30 minutes outside of montreal for the same amount of money you 'd probably get a mcmansion too in the burbs i 'm talking island core problem here if you live outside of the city you have to take a bridge to commute which instantly means traffic i 'd be curious what you get for that price in the city you 're talking about by 20 min of downtown i meant 20 minutes from downtown by subway aka the neighborhoods just around the 20 min from the city would be different   vancouver is pretty bad single homes on a small island a lot smaller then montreal that sell 1 millions +   as for calgary never went there but i heard they are a in recession since the oil crude plummeted so house prices slowed down now the houses sells around the same price then montreal maybe a bit more

this is price setting algorithms running from the page you link follow the 2 new from $ link and you will see that at the time of writing there are two vendors offering this item for $ plus $ shipping and $ these are clearly not real prices and yet they are close to each other this blog post examines this phenomenon in some detail basically at most one of these vendors actually has this item in stock but to drive traffic and sales they both offer it for sale anyway if someone actually ordered it from the one who does n't have it they would have to buy it first from someone else offering it for sale who is setting their prices based on wider market pricing you can say how a crazy price spiral might develop

as a 24 year old single your needs for insurance are minimal why you might consider it are for these reasons you are young so it will be cheaper than buying say at 34 insurance is always on sale two there is no guarantee that your health will always be good you may have to pay additional premiums later or even be refused coverage ask me i pay 70 more than others my age for the same coverage   three insurance ownership with equity values can grow tax free as you accumulate the monies consider it like a bond portfolio offering guaranteed returns on portions of the growth and a long term return of 5.5 or more four stating sooner versus later means more cash buildup just like being in a pension will generate more cash for you by age 65 than if you had started at age 34 insurance is only one tool in getting a good start it is not a panacea

it depends on the definition of earnings   a company could have revenue that nets in excess of expenses so from that perspective a good cash flow or ebitda but have debt servicing costs taxes depreciation amortization that alters that perspective so if a company is carrying a large debt load then the bondholders are in the position to capture any excess revenues through debt service payments and the company is in a negative equity positions no equity or dividends payable to shareholders and has not produced earnings if a company has valuable preferred shares issued and outstanding then depending on the earnings definition there may be no earnings for the common stock until the preferences are satisfied by the returns so while the venture itself revenues minus costs could be cash flow positive this may not be sufficient to produce earnings for shareholders whose claim on the company still entitles them to zero current liquidation value i.e. they get nothing if the company immediately all value goes to bondholders or preferred   it could also be that taxes are eating into revenue or the depreciation of key assets is greater than the excess of revenues over costs e.g. a bike rental company by the beach makes money on a weekly basis but is out half its stock every 3 months and replacement costs will overwhelm the operating revenues

in the us the title company usually collects all money being paid by parties to the sale including the buyer seller and mortgage companies and then pays out money where its due to the respective parties the seller and possibly mortgage companies housing inspectors etc   if you have equity meaning that you sold your house for a price greater than what you owed on your mortgage you 'll typically get them money from the title company but they are really passing through money that they got from the buyer less whatever fees are going to the title company itself and other third parties involved one misconception however is that if you paid off part of your mortgage over time that you automatically have equity   that 's really only true if you find a buyer willing to pay a price greater than what 's left on your mortgage   when housing prices decline it 's possible that you as the seller may need to bring a check to closing and do not get any money back they buyer is presumably bringing a bigger check but you would need to make up the difference between what the buyer pays and what you still owe on your mortgage

if i buy property when the market is in a downtrend the property loses    value but i would lose money on rent anyway so as long i 'm viewing    the property as housing expense i would be ok this is a bit too rough an analysis   it all depends on the numbers you plug in   let 's say you live in the boston area and you buy a house during a downtrend at $   two years later you need to sell it and the best you can get is $   you are down $ 70k and you are also out two years of property taxes maintenance insurance mortgage interest maybe etc   say that 's another $ 10k a year so you are down $ 70k + $ 20k = $ 90k   it 's probably more than that but let 's go with it in those same two years you could have been living in a fairly nice apartment for $   in that scenario you are out $ 2k 24 months = $ 48k and that 's it   it 's a difference of $ 90k $ 48k = $ 42k in two years   that 's sizable if i wanted to sell and upgrade to a larger property the larger    property would also be cheaper in the downtrend yes the general rule is   if you have to spend your money on a purchase it 's best to buy when things are low so you maximize your value    however if the market is in an uptrend selling the property would    gain me more than what i paid but larger houses would also have    increased in price but it may not scale   when you jump to a much larger more expensive house you can think of it as buying 1.5 houses   that extra 0.5 of a house is a new purchase and if you buy when prices are high relative to other economic indicators like salaries and rents you are not doing as well as when you buy when they are low    do both of these scenarios negate the pro cons of buying in either    market i do n't think so   i think in general buying more house either going from an apartment to a house or from a small house to a bigger house when housing is cheaper is favorable   houses are goods like anything else and when supply is high after overproduction of them and demand is low during bad economic times deals can be found relative to other times when the opposite applies or during housing bubbles    the other point is as with any trend you only know the future of the trend after it passes   you do n't know if you are buying at anything close to the bottom of a trend though you can certainly see it is lower than it once was    in terms of practical matters if you are going to buy when it 's up you hope you sell when it 's up too this graph of historical inflation adjusted housing prices is helpful to that point   let me just say that if i bought in the latest boom i sure hope i sold during that boom too

there are two reasons leases are generally a worse deal than buying first inherent in the lease is the concept of trading in the car at the end of the lease term as we all know cars depreciate the most in the first year or two by repeatedly leasing cars on short time frames you own the vehicles during those most expensive years of course there 's nothing stopping you from doing the same thing when buying be it via cash or loan but leasing builds in a schedule and encourages you to stick to it second it is easier for the dealer salesperson to hide things from the consumer in a lease contract most salespeople will try to get a car purchaser to focus on the monthly payment or they 'll four box the purchaser but even then there 's only 4 numbers and most consumers have a rough idea what they are and what they mean but in a lease the numbers in question are renamed and price becomes capitalized cost interest rate becomes money factor and is divided by 2400 making it look really small and not easily without a calculator or pencil and paper down payment becomes a capitalized cost reduction there 's a new concept residual value neither of those reasons change when interest rate is lower

the law says that you can not make a contribution whether tax deductible or not to a traditional ira for any year unless you or your spouse if you are filing a joint tax return have taxable compensation income earned from the sweat of your such as wages salary self employment income commissions on sales and also alimony or separate maintenance payments received under a divorce decree etc during that year and you will not be 70.5 years old by the end of the year for which you are making the contribution the contribution of course can be made up to tax day of the following year and is limited to the lesser of the total compensation and $ 5500 $ 6500 for people over 50   assuming that you are ok on the compensation and age issue yes you can make a contribution to a traditional ira for an year in which you take a distribution from a roth ira whether you can deduct the traditional ira contribution depends on other factors such as your income and whether or not you or your spouse is covered by a workplace retirement plan

aca has market stabilizing mechanisms like cost sharing reduction subsidies   republicans have been blocking that in recently causing many insurance companies to pull out of some states   i imagine repeal will just be a continuation of that until there is less competition and insurance companies make higher margins to offset the risk of unprofitable quarters   so maybe they make more money because of higher margins or maybe they do n't because they lose subsidies

i have found the drip investing resource center to be a useful resource for more information about drip investing   offers a list of companies offering both direct purchase options and dividend reinvestment plans for those offering dividend reinvestment plans but not direct purchase you have the option of using a service to purchase your first shares to enroll in the drip program   the tax paperwork for drips is a pain due to the partial shares purchased over time when you have to figure out your own cost basis upon sale of shares but a spreadsheet and a fifo first in first out approach makes it not too much of a headache

you 've asked a number of questions i can answer a few i 've quoted your question before each answer    what are the ins and outs of a foreigner like myself buying rental    property in canada this is a pretty broad question which can address location finances basic suggestions etc   here 's some things to consider provincial considerations   some ins and outs will depend on what province you are considering and what area in that province if you plan on owning in montreal for example that 's in the province of quebec and that means you or someone will need to be able to operate in the french language there are other things that might be different from province to province see stat info below canadian vs. us dollar   now might be a great time to buy property in canada since the canada dollar is weak right now to give you an idea at a non cash rate of a little over $ us will get you over $ 100k canadian that 's using the currency converter at   taxes for non resident rental property owners   according to the income tax guide for electing under section 216 2015 when you receive rental income from real or immovable property in canada the payer such as the tenant or a property manager has to withhold non resident tax at the rate of 25 on the gross rental income paid or credited to you the payer has to pay us the tax on or before the 15th day of the month following the month the rental income is paid or credited to you if you prefer to send a separate canadian tax return you can choose to elect under section 216 of the income tax act a benefit of this way is that electing under section 216 allows you to pay tax on your net canadian source rental income instead of on the gross amount if the non resident tax withheld by the payer is more than the amount of tax payable calculated on your section 216 return they will refund the excess to you   you can find this guide at canada revenue 's site stats a good place for stats is the canada mortgage and housing corporation cmhc   so if you are interesting in vacancy rates for example you can see a table that will show you that the vacancy rate in ontario is 2.3 and in british columbia it 's 1.5   however in new it 's 8 the rate for metropolitan areas across canada is 2.8   if you want to see or download this table showing the vacancy rates by province and also by metropolitan areas go to the canada mortgage and housing corporation site   you can get all sorts of housing information reports and market information there   i 've done well with condos town homes and would be interested in the    same thing over there is it pretty much all the same see the stat site mentioned above to get market info about condos etc what are the down payment requirements for non owner occupied properties the down payment is at least 20 update in response to comments about being double taxed regarding being taxed on income received from the property if you claim the foreign tax credit you will not be double taxed according to the irs the foreign tax credit intends to reduce the double tax burden that would otherwise arise when foreign source income is taxed by both the united states and the foreign country from which the income is derived   from irs topic 856 foreign tax credit    about property taxes from my understanding these would not be claimed for the foreign tax credit but can be deducted as business expenses there are various exceptions and stipulations based on your circumstance so you need to read publication 856 foreign tax credit for individuals   here 's an excerpt in most   cases   only   foreign   income   taxes   qualify for the foreign tax credit other taxes such as foreign real and personal property taxes do not qualify   but   you   may   be   able   to   deduct   these other   taxes   even   if   you   claim   the   foreign   tax credit for foreign income taxes in most cases you can deduct these other taxes   only   if   they   are   expenses incurred   in   a trade   or   business   or   in   the   production   of     however   you   can   deduct   foreign   real property taxes that are not trade or business   as   an   itemized   deduction   on   a form 1040 disclaimers   sources irs topic foreign tax credit and publication 856 foreign tax credit for individuals

you are correct however romney is touting his record at creating american jobs if his record is actually shipping jobs overseas then he 's lying a politician lies that being said it 's very said that we as americans put up with this they only lie because we so easily forget and it 's probably not that we forget but that our two party system limits our options rather than creating useful debate both sides have started pandering to the far sides of their party we 've allowed ourselves to become so with what the party is for or against that we really do n't even know what we are fighting for in most cases   it 's very sad that we live in a world where people feel it 's impossible to see the other persons point of view just because we 've convinced ourselves we are right it is impossible to have the solution to every problem and pretending that we do just shows our own ignorance

that is absolute rubbish   warren buffet follows simple value and tenants that literally anyone could follow if they had the discipline to do so   i have never once heard of an investment made by warren buffet that was n't rooted in fundamentals and easy to understand   the concept is fairly simple as is the math buying great companies trading at discounts to what they are worth due to market fluctuations or to key sectors etc   if i buy abc corp at $ 10 knowing it is worth $ 20 it could go down or trade sideways for five years doing seemingly nothing and then one day catch up with its worth due to any number of factors   in that case my 100 return which took five years to accounts for an average 20 return per year   also and this should be obvious but diversification is a double edged sword   every year hundreds of stocks individually beat the market return   owning any one of these stocks as your only holding would mean that you beat the market   as you buy more stocks and diversify your return will get closer and closer to that of an index or mutual fund   my advice is to stick to fundamentals like value and investing learn to separate when the market is being silly from when it is responding to a genuine concern do your own homework and analysis on the stocks you buy be patient after buying stock that your analysis gives you confidence in and do n't over diversify   if you do these things congrats   you are warren buffet

the first 3 are the same as owning stock in a company would be measured in shares and would constitute some percentage of the overall shares outstanding if there are 100 shares in the company in total then owning 80 shares is owning 80 is the same as owning 80 of the common stock this would be the typical ownership case though there can also be restricted stock as something to note here convertible debt would likely carry interest charges as well as the choice at the end of becoming stock in the company in this case until the conversion is done the stock is n't issued and thus is n't counted taking the above example one could have a note that could be worth 10 shares but until the conversion is done the debt is still debt some convertible debt could carry options or warrants for the underlying stock as there was the berkshire convertible notes years ago that carried a negative interest rate that was studied in the negative coupon bond if you want an example here options would have the right but not the obligation to buy the stock where there are incentive stock options to research this in more depth in this case one could choose to not exercise the option and thus no stock changes hands this is where some companies will experience dilution of ownership as employees and management may be given options that put more shares out to the public issuing debt would n't change the ownership and is n't direct ownership unless the company goes through a restructuring where the creditors become the new stock holders in the case of a chapter 11 situation in the us note that this is n't really investing in a small business as much as it is making a loan to the company that will be paid back in cash if the company runs into problems then the creditor could try to pursue the assets of the company to be repaid

owing taxes to two or more levels of government is n't double taxation it 's a feature of the american union i 'm not for this bill in general mostly for the timing and the loss of the highest bracket but both the state and federal governments have to generate revenue and basing rates on pure incomes with a few loopholes as possible is the most progressive way to do it by owing taxes unadjusted for other taxes paid there 's more incentive for states to lower local taxes and to balance state programs with federal programs and for state reps to more fairly redistribute federal transfers instead of targeting states with usually artificially low local taxes and fewer state programs usually republican

what are the consequences if i ignore the emails if you ignore the emails they will try harder to collect the money from you until they give up unlike what some other people here say defaulting on a loan is not a crime and is not the same as stealing there is a large number of reasons that can make someone unable to pay off a loan lenders are aware of the risk associated with default they will try to collect the debt but at the end of the day if you do n't have money assets there is not much they can do    as far as immigration goes there is nothing on a form that asks you about bankruptcies or unpaid obligations i doubt the officer will know of this situation but it is possible it is not grounds for visa however so you will be fine if everything else is fine the only scenario in which unpaid student loans can come up relevant in immigration to the us is if and when you apply for us citizenship one of the requirements for citizenship is having good moral character having a large amount of unpaid debt constitutes evidence of a poor moral character but it is very unlikely you 'd be denied citizenship on grounds of that alone   i got a social security number when i took up on campus jobs at the school and i do have a credit score can they get a hold of this and report to the credit bureaus even though i do n't live in america yes they probably already have   how would this affect me if i visit america often does this mean i would not ever be able to live in america no see above you will have a hard time borrowing again   will they know when i come to america and arrest me at the border or can they take away my passport no unpaid debt is no grounds for so even if the cbp agent knows of it he will not do anything and again unpaid debt is not a crime so you will not be arrested

plus you already have money in a 529 plan that is meant for college expenses and can not be used to pay student loans use that money for what it 's for i disagree with as a current college student i would say to take out loans most of the time i am against loans though   so why there are very few times you will receive loans at 0 interest for 4 + years you have money saved currently but you do not know what the future entails if you expend all of your money on tuition and your car breaks down what do you do you can not used student loans to pay for your broken car student loans as long as they are subsidized serve as a wonderful risk buffer you can pay off your loans with summer internships and retain the initial cash you had for additional activities that make college enjoyable i.e clubs dinners and social nights another benefit to taking these loans would assist in building credit with an additional caveat being to get a credit card in general debt loans credit cards are non beneficial but you have to establish debt to allow others to know that you can repay establishing this credit rating earlier than later is critical to cheaper interest rates on say a mortgage   you have made it through you have watched your expenses and you can pay your debt finish it if you do it right you will not have loans when you graduate you will have a stunning credit rating and you will have enjoyed college to its fullest potential remember you only really go through it once but this is contingent on   good luck   edit i did not realize the implication of this penalty which made me edit the line above to include to the extent you can per year for now student loan repayment is n't considered a qualified educational expense this means that if you withdraw from a 529 to pay your debts you may be subject to income taxes and penalties source furthermore   currently taxpayers who use 529 plan money for anything other than qualified education expenses are subject to a 10 federal tax penalty source my advice with this new knowledge save your 529 if you plan on continuing higher education at a more prestigious school if you do not use it later in your undergraduate years

as well as the visual impact employees do n't see the money disappearing directly from their paycheck so do n't feel as heavily taxed there 's usually one practical difference at least in the uk employers are generally prohibited in law from explicitly passing the tax onto their employees of course the presence of the tax will affect how much they are willing to pay especially over the long term and when deciding on pay rises but if there 's a sudden increase in the tax rate that will fall on employers immediately they would n't be able to reduce their employees pay directly

you made 94 $ on an investment of 100 = $ for an approx holding period of 1 year so the return is which is not much better than the short term us treasury rate the current 1 year treasury rate is 0.27 so yes you have a risk free portfolio so you make the risk free rate remember this is an european option so you are stuck for 1 year if you found the same mispricing in an american option then you found an arbitrage

in older days the merchants and their merchant service providers would take funds in their currency say in this case usd when the charge hits the issuer bank the merchant and merchant bank gets there usd and were happy the user would get charged in local currency in this case the rate applied by his bank and card provider visa master also take a cut is the standard shelf rate to individuals    when business growing and banking becoming more sophisticated lots of merchant banks and merchants have created a new business if you offer to all users then you have lots of that you can convert into usd so in this model the merchant makes some more profit from fx spread the merchant bank makes good money in fx your bank and card network loose out you stand to gain because you potentially get a better rate all this theory is good but the rates are moving and its quite difficult to find out if the rates offered directly by ei ai would be better than those offered by your bank i have no experience in this example but i have tried this with large shops buy 2 items one charge in gbp and other in local currency around 2 3 times spread over a year the difference in rate was close to identical at times better or worse in range of .02

very true but that 's not the point of my post or at all how it relates to this article i even said that   my point though is how the thing affects the economy in comparison to the 1980s or even 90s    in many places are begging for help at the moment   but nowadays there is no 2nd chances and are n't giving it one felony and you re done for life even if you somehow get it   there 's millions and millions of potheads and felons and always will be 20 years ago those people could easily find jobs when now they can not   factor in that mexicans who likely do a much better job are taking the under the table jobs   i do n't think there 's much we can do about it but it absolutely affects the economy and society it 's certainly something people should be looking at

as i understand it if the borrower puts a down payment of 20 and the bank puts down 80 then the bank and the borrower own the home jointly as   tenants in common with a split of the asset amongst them the   borrower moves into the home and pays the bank 80 of the fair rental   value of the home each month   material added changed in edit for the purposes of illustration suppose that the borrower and the bank agree that the fair rental per month is 0.5 of the purchase cost the   borrower pays 80 of that amount i.e. 0.4 of the purchase cost   to the bank on a monthly basis   the borrower is not required to do   so but may choose to pay more money than this 0.4 of the purchase cost each month or pay some amount in a lump sum if he does so he will own a larger percentage of the house and so future monthly payments will be a smaller fraction of the agreed upon fair rental per month so there is an incentive to pay off the bank if and when the house is sold the sale price is divided between borrower and bank according to the percentage of ownership as of the date of sale so the bank gets to share in the profits if any on the other hand if the house is sold for less than the original purchase price then the bank also suffers in the loss it is not a case of a mortgage being paid off from the proceeds and the home owner gets whatever is left or even suffering a loss when the dust has settled the bank gets only its percentage of the sale price even if this amount is less than what it put up in the first place minus any additional payments made by the borrower i have no idea how other costs of home ownership property taxes insurance repair and maintenance or improvements additions etc are handled ditto what happens on schedule a if   such a loan is made to a us taxpayer

summary the corporation pays tax on dividends it receives and gets a tax refund at the same rate when it pays dividends out according to the corporate tax rates for 2015 are according to page 3 the federal and provincial tax rates shown in the tables apply to investment income    earned by a other than capital gains and dividends received from canadian    corporations the rates that apply to capital gains are one half of the rates shown in    the tables dividends received from canadian corporations are deductible in computing    regular part i tax but may be subject to part iv tax calculated at a rate of 33 1/3 if i understand that correctly this means that a corporation in quebec pays on investment income other than capital gains and dividends on capital gains and on dividends i 'm marking this answer as community wiki so anyone can correct these numbers if they are incorrect update according to page 22 the tax rate on taxable dividends received from certain canadian corporations is 33 1/3 further this is refunded to the corporation through the refundable dividend tax on hand mechanism at a rate of $ 1 for every $ 3 of taxable dividends paid my interpretation is as follows if the corporation receives $ 100 of dividends from another company it pays $ tax if that corporation then pays out $ 100 of dividends at a later time it receives a tax refund of $ meaning the original tax gets refunded note the first line is for the 2015 tax year while the second link is for the 2014 tax year the numbers might be a little different but the tax refund process remains the same
