there 's no standard formula you can compare the going rates on the market for unsecured and take that as the starting anchor unsecured lines of credit run in the us at about 8 18 your risk should be reflected in the rate and i see no reason why the rate would change throughout the loan as to the amount of principal changing just chose one of the standard compounding options daily most precise but most tedious to calculate monthly average balance etc

compared to a lot of other parts of the country it most certainly is specially near the coast my old neighbors in nh just sold their 2200 sqft 20 year old home on about an acre for $ 4 bed 3 bath pool 2 car garage nice driveway on a quiet de sac updated inside excellent school district and all that crap listed for $ and sold in less than 2 days that home is 15 mins from the ma state line and 30 mins west of beach now i 'm in san diego and $ would buy me a 1100 sqft 60 year old home on maybe a 7 10k sqft lot out in east county mountains and desert not the ca most people think of still only 30 mins from the beach which is nice but if it was anything close to my neighbor 's old house it would be $ m so yeah while maybe not cheap southern nh is pretty affordable for what you get

since you acknowledge that you legitimately owe this money and the debts are relatively small you should pay them without trying to settle for less   do n't bother with a consolidation loan for these the loan if you can get approved would be more trouble than it is worth at the time frame you are looking at   just pay these off in full as fast as you can once you do that your credit will start to heal   get a written statement from the collectors to ensure that you and they are in agreement on exactly how much you owe when you pay them do n't pay electronically use a check debt collectors have been known to clean out bank accounts if you set up an electronic payment after you 've cleaned these up i would encourage you to aggressively tackle your student loans and any other debt you have now when you are starting your career is the time to dig yourself out of the hole and eliminate your debt this will set you up for success in the future

i 'm sure it depends on the company but i routinely run balances greater than 0 on my credit card the reason is simple i already budgeted to spend the money i know i 'm going to spend the money and it 's easier to put the extra money on the card at the beginning of my budget period rather than waiting until i spend the money and get a bill there are 2 relevant numbers first is the balance on your bill it can show a positive or negative value as people have talked about the balance on my card tends to update fairly infrequently the second is the available credit when i overpay on my card the available credit does not show more than the available debt the latter value however updates for me immediately i can see within minutes any transaction on my credit card based on the credit available one important caveat refunds do n't always immediately process you may have to wait days or weeks until that money shows up in your account spending the money before it appears in your account will cause your card to behave exactly as if you do n't have the money

no the stock market is not there for speculation on corporate   at its base it is there for investing in a business the point of the investment being of course to make money   a successful business earns money and that makes it valuable to its owners since that money can be distributed to them   shares of stock are pieces of business ownership and so are valuable    if you knew that the business would have profit of $ 10,000,000 every year and would distribute that to the owners of each of its 10,000,000 shares each year you would know to that each share would receive $ 1 each year   how much would such a share be worth to you   if you could instead put money in a bank and get 5 a year back to get $ 1 a year back you would have to put $ 20 into the bank   so maybe that share of stock is worth about $ 20 to you   if somebody offers to sell you such a share for $ 18 you might buy it for $ 23 maybe you pass up the offer but business is uncertain and how much profit the business will make is uncertain and will vary through time   so how much is a share of a real business worth   this is a much harder call and people use many different ways to come up with how much they should pay for a share   some people probably just think something like apple is a good company making money i 'll buy a share at whatever price it is being offered at right now   others look at every number available build models of the company and the economy and the risks all to estimate what a share might be worth more or less   there is no value for a share of a successful business so what effect does a company 's earnings have on the price of its stock   you can only say that for some of the people who might buy or sell shares higher earnings will all other thing being equal have them be willing to spend more to buy it or demand more when selling it   but how much more is not quantifiable but depends on each person 's approach to the problem   higher earnings would tend to raise the price of the stock   yet there are other factors such as people who had expected even higher earnings whose actions would tend to lower the price and people who are ok with the earnings now but suspect trouble for the business is appearing on the horizon whose actions would also tend to lower the price this is why people say that a stock 's price is determined by supply and demand

basically no you have retirement plan options and can either go with a roth option which wo n't change your current tax burden or go with a traditional plan which is tax deductible   but wo n't change your business deductions or self employment taxes this article has an explanation of options for setting up sep or solo 401k plans key quote for all the pre tax retirement plans because pre tax employer and employee contributions are deducted in    the same way neither one is more tax efficient than the other the article goes on to say that if you were an s corp or llc that elected to be taxed as an s corp a solo 401(k plan would allow the business to make an employer contribution to your 401(k and even then there 's no tax advantage to the employer contribution conclusion for s corps employer contributions would reduce the amount of income from the s corporation that    would be passed through to you as the owner thereby reducing your    income tax but because this income is not subject to payroll taxes    in the first place these contributions will not reduce your payroll    taxes

as a buyer one of the easiest ways to save on closing costs is to avoid title insurance   this will only apply if you are a cash buyer as a mortgage writer will typically require title insurance    it is also one of the most ill advised ways to save money   you need title insurance    for the most part there is really no way to truly save on closing costs   wrapping costs into a loan saving on interest or taxes through timing do n't truly save money   sometimes you can obtain discounts on closing by using an targeted lender but that may cost you in higher interest rates    by paying points on your loan you may increase your costs at closing in order to save money on interest paid    certainly you ca n't discount required government imposed fees like doc stamps    you may be able to shop around and find a bit lower fees for appraisal credit reports title company fees and title insurance   however that is a lot of work for not a lot of return   title companies seem to be pretty tight about their fees    the best yield of your time is to get the other party in the transaction to pay your costs   the market or local tradition may not allow this   an additional way to lower your costs is to ask the realtors involved to discount their commissions   however they could always say no    the bottom line is transacting real estate is very expensive

one of the things that you have to be aware of is a little gotcha in the credit utilization rate they or at least the credit company i worked for used the high balance in figuring the credit utilization not the ending balance for example say you had a single card with a $ 2000 credit limit and used it to charge everything during the month say that the high balance was $ 1900 and you paid it down to zero at the end of the month the company would calculate your credit utilization at 95 this is not good and not really fair but that was the way it was done increasing the credit limit helps but you can also usually make interim payments say as a paycheck comes in during the month if you have an online account

regarding the opportunity cost comparison consider the following two scenarios assuming a three year lease option a keep your current car for three years in this scenario you start with a car that 's worth $ 10,000 and end with a car that 's worth $ 7,000 after three years option b sell your current car invest proceeds lease new car here you 'll start out with $ 10,000 and invest it   you 'll start with $ 10,000 in cash from the sale of your old car and end with $ 10,000 plus investment gains you 'll have to estimate the return of your investment based on your investing style    option c use the $ 10k from proceeds as down payment for new car in this scenario you 'll get a reduction in finance charges on your lease but you 'll be out $ 10,000 at the end overall cost comparison to compare the total cost to own your current car versus replacing it with a new leased car first look up the cost of ownership for your current car for the same term as the lease you 're considering   edmunds offers this research and calls it true cost to own    specifically you 'll want to include depreciation fuel insurance maintenance and repairs   if you still owe money you should also factor the remaining payments   so the formula is cost to keep car = depreciation + fuel + insurance + maintenance + repairs on the lease side consider taxes and fees all lease payments fuel and maintenance   assume repairs will be covered under warranty   assume you will put down no money on the lease and you will finance fees taxes title and license when calculating lease payments   you also need to consider the cost to pay off your current car 's loan if applicable   then you should subtract the gains you expect from investing for three years the proceeds from the sale of your car assume that repairs will be covered under warranty   the formula to lease looks like lease cost = fuel + insurance + maintenance + lease payments gains from investing $ 10k for option c where you use the $ 10k from proceeds as down payment for new lease it will be lease cost = fuel + insurance + maintenance + lease payments + $ 10,000 a somewhat intangible factor to consider is that you 'll have to pay for body damage to a leased car at the end of the lease whereas you are obviously free to leave damage on your own vehicle

the fee to withdraw cash from an atm using your credit card as opposed to your debit card is akin to the merchant fees paid by any business that accepts your credit card as payment these fees range from around 2.75 of the transaction to upwards of 5 and are charged to the merchant the fees are split among the various vendors that provide the infrastructure to conduct the credit card transaction resulting in the merchant receiving the money and the charge on your credit account these fees are used by each vendor to cover their costs and ultimately generate a profit note most vendors in the value chain do not receive any revenue from any interest you may pay on your outstanding balance therefore when you withdraw cash from an atm you are paying the merchant fees instead of whatever merchant you are purchasing goods services from with the cash withdrawn

question 1 who do i report such fraud to walmart or their card processor they may be in their right to require the original purchaser to do the report generally credit card and debit card fraud must be reported to the bank within 60 days of the statement for them to take responsibility i do n't see why gift cards would be different you can also report it to the police but i believe you 'll be asked to file a report in the jurisdiction where the card was used again time is of the essence and there 's nothing much they could do with your report now question 2 how can i recover the $ 100 value of my walmart gift card at this point 2.5 years later when the card was used to buy prepaid cards there 's no way to catch the thief and recover the funds had you reported it promptly could have block the prepaid cards sold or track their usage but now is too late question 3 is citibank in any way liable the gift card was    fraudulently used shortly after within the same month i received    it from citibank i doubt it unless you can show a pattern it could be someone working for the citibank someone working for the usps or someone just stole a bunch of numbers and waited until they became activated

i suppose it depends on what you mean by replicate   i do n't take his meaning as to be able to create a brain with real and such this is actually possible   i take it to mean replicate the functionality of the brain as closely as possible   i 've been tracking the progress of the blue brain project which is attempting to do just this via software abstraction and simulation   it 's a lofty goal   i like lofty goals   i think they often accomplish more faster   but having said that i think trying to do this with hardware without the abstraction is even more difficult because as you say we do n't completely understand how the brain works   it 's much easier to write or adjust simulation code than it is to redo hardware   of course the simulation route is less efficient but it 's more flexible as new theories and information are generated you just revise the simulation software   have a baby or do something like this   edit would someone mind replying instead of just downvoting

is there more on where dalio gets his definitions for the short term debt cycle 5 8 years or so and deleveraging and the long term debt cycle 75 100 years or his evidence that separates the two   at one point he says the difference is that in a deleveraging interest rates hit 0 and can no longer go lower but i do n't know if that works as a definition per se   there are other things that central banks do when interest rates hit 0 like buy up assets which he does mention and include in the print money category of things that can be done during a deleveraging   and one of the he cites england in the 1950s according to wikipedia was due to difficulty in transitioning out from war production and according to this excel statistics documents rates from the bank of england on historical rates it does n't say interest rates went to 0 at that time unless dalio is referring to another point in history when he cites 1950s england     his definition of a depression is when debt restructuring or defaults happen   interesting   what i learned was that there is n't really a hard and fast definition for recessions and depressions e.g. a recession is two quarters of negative growth in a row and a depression is just a bad long recession   and i do n't think i recall in the past an attempt to define what a deleveraging event of an economy is     is debt reduction and redistribution of wealth deflationary   i think it depends on how much the debt reduction or redistribution hurts the spending of the lender or wealthy versus how much it helps the spending of the borrower or the poor   both are actually similarly giving some from the haves to the have nots and especially redistribution of wealth is similar to fiscal spending which is mentioned as a valid inflationary way to try to help the economy   are deflationary methods say austerity needed to balance out the inflationary methods central bank buying assets and fiscal spending   are n't central bank interest rates quantitative easing and the government fiscal policy still the main things that move inflation or deflation   i would think that debt reduction and redistribution of wealth are good when needed but i would n't think you would do those things mainly for their supposed see above for my doubts deflationary effects     still a very interesting video and one of the best presented videos on a difficult subject

graphs are nothing but a representation of data every time a trade is made a point is plotted on the graph after points are plotted they are joined in order to represent the data in a graphical format   think about it this way   1 walmart shuts at 12 am is selling almonds at $ 10 a pound   3 walmart says that the price is going to reduce to $ 9 effective tomorrow 4 you are inside the store buying almonds at pm   5 till you make your way up to the counter it is already am so the store is technically shut 6 however they allow you to purchase the almonds since you were already in there   7 you purchase the almonds at $ 9 since the day has changed 8 so you have made a trade and it will reflect as a point on the graph 9 when those points are joined the curves on the graph will be created 10 the data source is walmart 's system as it reflects the sale to you in your case the nyse exchange records this trade made buying a stock is just like buying almonds there has to be a buyer there has to be a seller there has to be a price to which both agree as soon as all these conditions are met and the trade is made it is reflected on the graph the only difference between the graphs from 9 pm and 4 am is the time the trade has happened regardless and any other stock exchange has recorded it the graph is just made from that data cheers

the calculation is to figure out how many dollars you get in return for the amount of dollars you spend in your case you know you get 1000 points for $ 1000 dollars and can redeem one movie ticket for 1000 points therefore granted that you could also redeem a $ 8 9 ticket making your return 0.8 0.9   in addition this can get more complicated for some points cards that may give out free points and is especially so if there 's an intermediary such as air miles for which points can be earned in numerous ways to get really nitty gritty you could to keep a spreadsheet where you list number of dollars spent number of points gained number of points redeemed and value of reward received thus you can figure out exactly what your cost is for each point second factor from above as well as the ultimate value of each point with respect to rewards redeemed first factor i 'm considering doing that myself since i 'm prone to spreadsheet addiction but this method is likely overkill for most points cards

the fund will take a small percentage of its assets to cover the expenses   reported returns come after the expense ratio has been factored into things money market mutual funds can have a zero yield in some cases though breaking the buck can happen in some cases as noted on wikipedia the first money market mutual fund to break the buck was first    for daily income in 1978 liquidating and    nav at 94 cents per share an argument has been made that was not    technically a money market fund as at the time of liquidation the    average maturity of securities in its portfolio exceeded two    however prospective investors were informed that would invest    solely in short term 30 90 days money market obligations    furthermore the rule which restricts the maturities which money    market funds are permitted to invest in rule of the investment    company act of 1940 was not until 1983 prior to the    adoption of this rule a mutual fund had to do little other than    present itself as a money market fund which did seeking higher    yield had purchased increasingly longer maturity securities and    rising interest rates negatively impacted the value of its portfolio    in order to meet increasing redemptions the fund was forced to sell a    certificate of deposit at a 3 loss triggering a of its    nav and the first instance of a money market fund breaking the    buck the community bankers us government fund broke the buck in 1994    paying investors 96 cents per share this was only the second failure    in the then history of money funds and there were no further    failures for 14 years the fund had invested a large percentage of its    assets into adjustable rate securities as interest rates increased    these floating rate securities lost value this fund was an    institutional money fund not a retail money fund thus individuals    were not directly affected no further failures occurred until september 2008 a month that saw    events for money funds however as noted above other    failures were only averted by of capital from the fund    sponsors thus consider how likely is fidelity investments prepared to have people question how safe is their money with them which is why fund sponsors rarely break the buck

h.r. basically publication 15 this is the link to 2015 to determine how much to hold based on filing status exemptions and pay amount what 's described here is a form of estimation or in other words h.r. withholds what would be your actual taxes dividing across the number of paychecks you receive assuming your gross pay and exemptions do not change this usually results in a zero sum for taxes owed you will receive nothing and owe nothing as you can see from the charts the year is basically broken down into equal tax units that reflect how much you would owe if you worked at that bracket all year this estimation works best when you have steady hours from check to check in other words your taxes are based on the estimate of what you 'd make if you earned that much all year scaled down to the time frame e.g. if you are paid weekly or if you paid biweekly they do not go up near the end of the year because they 're estimated in advance you do n't move up a tax bracket but are instead taxed at a particular bracket every paycheck there 's also other forms of estimation mentioned there but basically follow the same scheme note that all estimation forms are just estimates it 's best to use a calculator and compare your current taxes whenever a significant change a raise a new child getting married or divorced etc you 'll want to be able to alter your exemptions so that enough taxes are coming out that 's also the reason for the withhold extra box so that you can avoid owing for example if you 're making $ 44 a week for the first 26 weeks and then you make $ a week for the second 26 weeks of the year you 'll end up with an actual tax liability of $ but end up paying only $ you would owe $ of course the actual math is a lot more complicated if you 're an employee paid by the minute for example or you have a child go to college etc paychecks that vary wildly like $ 10,000 one week and $ 2,000 the next tend to have the hardest to predict estimates e.g. jobs with big commission payouts you should avoid living check to check with jobs that pay this way because you 'll probably end up owing taxes conversely if you 've done your estimates right and you 're paid salary or exactly the same number of hours every week you 'll find that the taxes are much easier to predict and you can usually easily create a refund situation simply by having the correct exemptions on your check so in summation if your check falls in the 25 category which is of course 25 above the tax bracket break point you 're already paying the correct amount and no further drop in your check would be expected

i do n't think so in your case unless the account generates so much interest income that it became reportable i do n't know the exact limit but i think it 's in the hundreds if not thousands of dollars you might get a 1099 form if it generates over $ 10 of interest income but you do n't have to file taxes if your overall income is too low anyways the us does not typically tax assets only income there are some states florida is the only one i can think of that has odd tax treatment of intangible assets but i doubt that would apply in your case if this were a large enough amount usually over $ 10,000 it might trigger some reporting requirements possibly by your home country

both names are on the deed so the property is jointly owned you 're going to need the second person 's signature to be able to sell the property ideally the way to know what happens now is to consult the written agreement you made before you purchased the house together the formula for dividing up assets when dissolving your partnership is whatever you agreed to up front your up front agreement could have said if you move out you forfeit any claim to the property it sounds like you do n't have that so you 'll have to come to some written agreement with your partner before you proceed if you ca n't come to an agreement then you 'll end up in court a judge will split up the assets and the only winners there are the lawyers

an old question but the recent answer for me turned out to be check formerly note check was recently purchased by intuit and is now the only thing check does n't do that paytrust did was accept paper bills from payees that could n't do but that 's a rare problem anymore for me anyways   i went through each of my payees in paytrust and added them into check it found almost all of them i added my security info for their logins and it was setup the few that check could n't find it asked me for the details and would contact them to try and get it setup but in the meantime i just added them to my bank 's billpay system with automatic payment rules my mortgage company was the only one it could n't find and i know what my mortgage is every month so it 's easy to setup a consistent rule check does so much more than paytrust will ever do check has a mobile app and it is really the of the whole system you never really log into the website from your desktop except to setup all the payees most of the time you just get alerts on your phone when a bill is due and you just click pay and choose a funding source and bam you 're done it 's been awesome so far i highly recommend dumping paytrust for it fyi   check is clearly winning at this point but some of the competition are   are not sure if you can pay your bills through them though and

cfds contracts for difference are basically a contract between you and the broker on the difference in price of the underlying between the time you open a position and close a position you are not actually buying the underlying with share cfds the outcome is a bit like buying the underlying shares on margin you pay interest for every day you hold the cfds overnight for long cfds however with short positions you get paid interest for every day you hold your short position overnight most people use cfds for short term trading however they can be used for medium to longer term trading just as you would hold a portfolio on margin what you have to remember is that because you are buying on margin you can lose more than your initial contract amount a way to manage this risk is by using position sizing and stop loses with your position sizing if you wanted to invest $ 10,000 in a particular share trading at $ 10 per share you would then buy 1000 shares or 1000 cfds in that share your initial expense with the cfds might be only $ 1000 at a margin rate of 10 so instead of increasing your risk by having an initial outlay of $ 10,000 with the cfds you limit your risk to the same as you were buying the shares directly

this is a reasonable question about inflation   i would just like to note that inflation is nearly zero at the moment   and interest rates are very low   for a stable enterprise borrowing cash is very easy right now   naturally things could change in a year   but the reason a company like microsoft but not just them might hoard cash right now is that it gives them weight for buying up smaller firms rivals and signaling their comfort level with the way things look for them   it could also be because they are out of ideas for what to invest in and/or are waiting for conditions to change before making any big decisions   but with an interest rate at close to zero and an inflation rate at close to zero at the moment inflation is not going to be a consideration in evaluating such a company

there is some sense that negative interest rates make no sense because then two things appear to happen neither of these are true in reality but then we are edging towards a deflationary time during which the common understanding of money and what to do with money reverses during deflation spending is better to an extent because the buying power of money is less as time passes so also saving is less worthwhile but for the bond market and your question the reason why people are still investing in negative interest bonds is that they are going to be looking to capital gain to make their money over time the bond price fluctuates and as the bond approaches maturity the bond price equates to the face value minus whatever interest will be received or in this plus whatever interest will need to be payed

as a common shareholder why would i want to approve an increase in the number of authorized shares because it could increase the value of your existing shares companies sell new shares to raise capital and they use capital to among other things expand if whole foods issues new shares and uses the capital to opens new stores then profit could increase enough to offset the dilution effect and your stock price will go up you should ask yourself   what areas is is your company of choice planning on expanding into will they do well there are there better ways for the company to raise capital debt cash in hand cut expenses elsewhere etc if you think that the management has a good plan for expanding then authorizing new shares makes good sense for you personally

this might sound harsh but the first thing i would suggest is to stop making excuses   i was n't able to continue due to pressure from college and family the college i went to was horrible employers can very easily hire foreign work force for    very cheap for example as a citizen if i work $ 10 an hour they can    get someone from outside to work for $ 5 per hour there 's no guarantee that the project will succeed i can not really work and at the same time develop software on my free    time   despite my failures in the past i was not the main person that 's    responsible for those failures even if all of this is true it 's not helping you move forward and it seems to be getting in the way of creating a good action plan and motivating yourself to succeed if you believe based on past experiences that you are doomed to fail then you are indeed doomed to fail you need to take a step back and re evaluate your current circumstances and what you can do to reach your goals you have a couple of things working in your favor here it 's great that you are debt free that already puts you ahead of a lot of your peers   you have the option of living with your parents presumably for no rent or at least much lower rent than you would have to pay if you move out this is worth literally thousands of $ for every year you stay now onto your questions 1 should i quit regular programming for a normal job because i never programming so i can move out of my parents home are you being paid for this regular programming if so are you being paid more than minimum wage if not it 's perfectly acceptable to consider alternative ways to spend your time and generate income however this does n't have to be at the expense of living with your parents have you thought about getting a new or second job while still living with them if you absolutely must move out of your parent 's home consider renting a room in a house with other people to keep the rent costs to a minimum that way even if your main job is low paying you should be able to put aside some money each month for future endeavors   2 should i monetize programming and gamble with the future what does this mean are you thinking you 'll write a mobile app and sell thousands of copies for each that would indeed be a big gamble but maybe that 's not what you meant so you 'll need to clarify 3 would it be wise to essentially quit programming for the sake of a minimum wage job i 'm not sure how this is different from question 1 so i 'll reiterate what i said there moving out is going to be expensive you can still do it but you 're asking on a personal finance site where the focus is usually how to minimize living costs and maximize income without knowing more about where you live employment opportunities cost of living the default recommendation is usually to save money by staying in your parents house tldr do n't focus on anyone else they are not preventing you from getting the job you want look at your own skills and qualifications not just programming consider all of your abilities what are you good at who might need those skills what is the cost of reaching those people commute time moving nearer what is the reward if the reward exceeds the cost start approaching those people show them what you can do

i 'm assuming your talking usa there are two ways to look if you know you should pay on the cap gains the best way to handle that separately from your salary is to file a quarterly tax payment   that i understand is what the self employed have to do i 'm in the situation where at some point probably this year the company that employs me will be bought out and i will owe capital gains taxes on my shares up in the buy out   it 's a cash for stock transaction   so in my case i 've just adjusted my w-4 to take advantage of the safe harbor provision related to taxes i payed in 2016 and my salary   the details vary depending on your situation but in my case i 've calculated what it will take in w-4 allowances to make sure i pay 110 of my 2016 tax payment after refund   i 'm not worrying about what the actual taxes on those shares of company stock will be because i 've met the rules for safe harbor safe harbor just means that they ca n't penalize you for under withholding or underpayment   it does n't mean i wo n't have to write a check on april 15

powers makes a good point trading costs may eat up a significant portion of your roi a fee as little as 2 can consume more than 50 of your long term roi a rule of thumb is keep your fees to less than 1 one way to do that is to buy stock in companies that have a drip with a share purchase plan often the allows investors to purchase shares for low fees or free once you have the ability to purchase shares for virtually free you can   use roughly you send more money to the companies whose share prices are near their 52-week low and less money to those who are near their 52-week high getting back to your original question

as a resident of new york state you will in addition to the federal income tax handled by the irs be responsible for state and local income taxes for new york the state tax forms are also used to determine your new york city tax if hr was either not aware of the local tax requirement for new york or you filled out the new york state version of the w-4 incorrectly you may have had too little tax withheld for new york state the refund from the irs is not dependent on the refund owe status for state and local taxes it is possible that your state taxes are fine but that you owe taxes to the city that tax you owe to the city will reduce the refund from the state and may require you to pay money to new york of course if you do itemize what you pay to the state and city may result in deductions on your federal form if you owe back taxes to the state or local government this could result in the irs seizing a federal refund but that does n't happen right away

as the answer from noted any expense you have before the hsa is established is not considered a qualified medical expense for an hsa distribution however it is important to note that since you now have the hsa established any medical expense you have from this point on is a qualified medical expense even if you do n't take an hsa distribution for it right away for example let 's say that you have a medical expense this year but you do n't take an hsa distribution to reimburse yourself right away   maybe it is because you do n't have enough money in your hsa to reimburse yourself at this time   you can reimburse yourself in the future for this expense   as long as you had an hsa in place when the expense was incurred it does n't matter if you wait to take the distribution

how does paying off a mortgage early work example i have a 30 year fixed rate mortgage of 3.5 the amount borrowed is $ 300,000 i have just inherited $ 300,000 i am in the first year of the mortgage can i give the bank the $ 300,000 to clear the mortgage or must i pay off the total interest that was agreed upon for the 30 year term this depends on the country regulation and your agreement generally speaking the calculations are on daily reducing balance so you just pay 300 k i 'm curious why the bank would let you do this since they will lose out on a lot of profit

this is a speculative question and there 's no correct answer but there are definitely some highly likely outcomes let 's assume that the united states defaults on it 's debt it can be guaranteed that it will lose its aaa rating although we do n't know what it will drop to we know it will be aa or lower   a triple a rating implies that the issuer will never default so it can offer lower rates since there is a guarantee of safety there people will demand a higher yield for the lower perceived security so treasury yield will go up   the us dollar or at least forex rates will almost certainly fall since us treasuries will no longer be a safe haven the dollar will no longer be the safe currency it once was and so the dollar will fall the us stock market and international markets will also have a strong fall because so many institutions financial or otherwise invest in treasuries so when treasuries tumble and the us loses triple a investments will be hurt and the tendency is for investors to overreact so it is almost guaranteed that the market will drop sharply financial stocks and companies that invest in treasuries will be hurt the most a notable exception is nations themselves for example china holds over $ 1 trillion in treasuries and a us default will hurt their value but the yuan will also appreciate with respect to the dollar thus other nations will benefit and be hurt from a us default now many people expect a double dip recession worse than the crisis if the us defaults i count myself a member of this crowd nonetheless we can not say with certainty whether or not there will be another recession or even a depression we can only say that a recession is a strong possibility so basically let 's pray that washington gets its act together and raises the ceiling or else we 're in for bad times and lastly a funny quote i could end the deficit in 5 minutes    you just pass a law that says that    anytime there is a deficit of more    than 3 of gdp all sitting members of    congress are ineligible for       warren buffett

your lack of numbers makes the question a difficult read   what i 'm hearing is i want a house requiring a mortgage my income   this alone is enough to suggest it 's a bad deal on a personal note when my wife and i bought our house it was 2.5x our income 20 down so the mortgage was exactly 2x income and my wife was convinced we were in over our heads   the use of a partner who will take a portion of the profit is interesting but does n't change the fact that you are proposing to live in a house that costs far too much for you if you are determined to buy such a house i 'd suggest you do it with the plan to rent out a room or two to roommates if you are living in an area where the cost of buying is so high the demand for rentals is likely high as well   absent a plan to bring ion more income i see no good coming from this heed the warnings posted in the other two answers as well

the euro will collapse because spain italy portugal and greece will have to default on their debt in order to keep up with current payments they have to take emergency loans at the same time that their economies are in recession and demands on social programs are increasing there is simply no way that they can cut enough spending and raise enough revenue to balance their budgets that is not opinion it is arithmetic    if they can not pay their loans they will either voluntarily leave the euro or they will be forced out    next comes france who also has a large and growing budget deficit and a large public debt it is unsustainable that which is unsustainable will end    the last reason that the euro will fail and that it will be soon is germany up to now all the bailouts of ireland portugal italy greece and spain have come predominantly from germany in order to float the that some idiots think might save europe the german people have to authorize their government to participate and thereby take on another mountain of debt the german people will not vote for that authorization   is that enough reasons because there are more lots more read mike

the answer to your question is very simple the preauth and the shipment of the goods have no connection within the credit card system it is possible to process a payment that does not cancel a preauthorization this is needed for the case where you place two orders and the one you placed second ships first a preauth can remain active for some time unless it is captured or cancelled so in your case a preauth was placed and remained active that you were shipped and billed for some goods had no effect on the preauth because one side or the other failed to attach them

i am currently trying out some variations moving terms around of the formula for the present value of money the relationship between yield and price is much simpler than that if you pay £ 1015 for a bond and its current yield is 4.69 that means you will receive in income each year 4.69 £ 1015 = £ the income from the bond is defined by its coupon rate and its face value not the market value so that bond will continue to pay £ each year regardless of the market price the market price will go up or down according to the market as a whole and the credit rating of the issuer   if the issuer is likely to default the market price goes down and the yield goes up if similar companies start offering bonds with higher yields the market price goes down to make the bond competitive in the market again raising yield so if the yield goes up to 4.87 what is the price such that 4.87 of that price is £ £ 4.87 = £ another way to think of it if the yield goes up from 4.69 to 4.87 then yield has increased by a factor of 4.87 4.69 = consequently market price must decrease by the same factor £ 1015 = £

i really like keshlam 's answer your age is also a consideration if you make your own target fund by matching the allocations of whatever vanguard offers i 'd suggest re balancing every year or every other year but if you 're just going to match the allocations of their target fund you might as well just invest in the target fund itself most not all just most target funds do not charge an additional management fee so you just pay the fees of the underlying funds same as if you mirrored the target fund yourself check the prospectus to see if an additional fee is charged or not you may want to consider a more aggressive approach than the target funds you can accomplish this by selecting a target fund later than your actual retirement age or by picking your own allocations the target funds become more conservative as you approach retirement age so selecting a later target is a way of moving the risk reward ratio i 'm not saying target funds are necessarily the best choice you should get professional advice etc etc

start with his website specifically his seven steps most everything else is around motivating people to actually do the plan as he often says personal finance is 80 personal and 20 finance by which he means that things that make sense financially paying off high interest debt first do n't necessarily motivate action so instead pay off the smallest debt first to get motivation really the rest is details around those seven concepts on his site there is a link to a free one hour podcast for the ipod and you can pay for the full three hours of his radio show on podcast he started on radio and it is probably his best format the reason dave ramsey has limited appeal beyond the us is that he is explicitly he views his system as an extension of his christian beliefs that sells very well in parts of the us but does n't port very well there is actually nothing religious in his program other than the occasional reference to biblical verses in an attempt to tie his program into his religion but people who are really interested and want to teach his program not just practice it are going to find they need to be an or at least a christian to fit in addendum i should mention that dave ramsey is changing the program and i expect it will trickle into other things to be more explicitly although apparently not overtly religious and have a stronger emphasis on budgeting see here

news about a company is not the only thing that affects its stock 's price there is also supply and demand   that of course is influenced by news but it is not the only actor   an insider with a large position in their company 's stock may want to diversify his overall portfolio and thus need to sell a large amount of stock   that may be significant enough to increase supply and likely reduce the stock 's price somewhat that brings me to another influence on stock price perception   executives and other insiders with large positions in their company 's stock have to be careful about how and when they sell some of that stock as to not worry the markets   many investors watch insider selling to gauge the health of the company which brings me to another important point   there are many things that may be considered news which is material to a certain company and its stock   it is not just quarterly filings earnings reports and such   there is also news related to competitors news about the economy or a certain sector news about some weather event that affects a major supplier news about a major earthquake that will impact the economy of a nation which can then have knock on effects to other economies etc there are also a lot of investors with varying needs which will influence supply and demand   an institutional investor needing to diversify may reduce their position in a stock and thus increase supply enough that it impacts the stock 's price   meanwhile individual investors will make their transactions at varying times during the day   in the aggregate that may have significant impacts on supply and demand the overall point being that there are a lot of inputs and a lot of actors in a complicated system   even if you focus just on news there are many things that fall into that category news does not come out at regular intervals and it does not necessarily spread evenly   that alone could make for a highly variable environment

does this make sense i 'm concerned that by buying shares with post tax income i 'll have ended up being taxed twice or have increased my taxable income the company will then re reimburse me for the difference in stock price between the vesting and the purchase share price sure   assuming you received a rsu for shares worth $ 10 and your marginal tax rate is 30 all made up numbers either or so you 're in the same spot either way   you paid $ 300 to get $ 1,000 worth of stock taxes are the same as well   the full value of the rsu will count as income either way and you 'll either pay tax on the gains of the 100 shares in your rsu our you 'll pay tax on gains on the 70 shares in your rsu and the 30 shares you bought   since they 're reimbursing you for any difference the cost basis will be the same although you might get taxed on the reimbursement but that should be a relatively small amount this first year i wanted to keep all of the shares due to tax reasons and because believe the share price will go up i do n't see how this would make a difference from a tax standpoint you 're going to pay tax on the rsu either way either in shares or in cash   how does the value of the shares going up make a difference in tax additionally i 'm concerned that by doing this i 'm going to be hit by my bank for exchange fees foreign money transfer charges broker purchase fees etc   that might be true if that 's the case then you need to decide whether to keep fighting or decide if it 's worth the transaction costs

an option gives you the option rather than the obligation to buy or sell the underlying so you do n't have to exercise you can just let the option expire so long it does n't have an automatic expiry after expiration the option is worthless if it is out of the money but other than that has no hangover option prices normally drop as the time value of the option decays an option has two values associated with it time value and exercise value far out of the money when the price of the underlying is far from the strike price on the losing side options only have time value whereas deep in the money options as yours seems to be has some time value as well as the intrinsic value of the right to buy sell at a low high price and then sell buy the underlying   the time value of the option comes from the possibility that the price of the underlying will move further in your favour and make you more money at expiry as expiry closes it is less likely that there will be a favourable mood so this value declines which can cause prices to move sharply after a period of little to no up to now what i have said applies to both otc and traded options but exchange traded options have another level of complexity in their trading because there are fewer traders in the options market the size of trade at which you can move the market is much lower on the equities markets you may need to trade millions of shares to have be substantial enough to significantly move a price on the options markets it could be thousands or even hundreds if these are european style options which sounds likely and a single trading entity was holding a large number of the exchange traded options and now thinks that the price will move significantly against them before expiry their sell trade will move the market lower in spite of the options being in the money their trade is based on their supposition that by the time they can exercise the option the price will be below the strike and they will lose money they have cashed out at a price that suited them and limited what they will lose if they are right about the underlying if i am not correct in my excise style assumption european i may need more details on the trade as it seems like you should just exercise now and take the profit if it is that far into the money

it depends what you mean by gain over long period of times the market increases so using a blind monkey with a dart or index fund should be sufficient to get an average returns the key difference is that changes in currency are close to zero sum game while money in equity or bonds is actually used for something building a company etc if you mean get above average returns then you will likely get answers depending on person if you think that markets are efficient then you wo n't beat the market consistently over long periods the returns are likely to be no better then average because of large number of smart people trying to beat each other and even them are likely to have below average returns if you do n't think so then it is possible to get above average consistently as long as you know how to beat those smart people

it depends on the bank according to the uniform commercial code a bank is not obliged to pay a cheque after six months but may do so if it wants to 4 404   bank not obliged to pay check more than six months old a bank is under no obligation to a customer having a checking account to pay a check other than a certified check which is presented more than six months after its date but it may charge its customer 's account for a payment made thereafter in good faith official link to 4 404 as for your second question if you stamp void after 60 days on your cheque i do n't have a specific answer for that part yet update i can find no specific rules about someone putting an arbitrary void after xxx days on their personal check are to but again the overriding rule seems to be that after six months it 's the bank 's choice and you certainly could n't make a cheque expire before six months so i do n't think that putting a stamp would make any difference it 's still up to the bank in the end

i dislike this argument that government pressure to make bad loans is the origin of subprime loans    in fact the term subprime is because those type of loans ca n't be underwritten by the government   usually the concept of government forcing bad loans is government forcing banks to give minorities and low income people loans for their first houses    the government requires w-2 income and a base credit score to procure these loans   at the peak of the bubble the majority of home sales were for investment purposes not homeownership purposes    those who declared the housing market was wildly unstable and who were proven right were talking about the problem of mortgage brokers being incentivized to lie about a person not being qualified for prime government loans in order to make more money by putting them in lucrative subprime loans or simply advising them they were better off in subprime and could get cash out up front   also liar no doc loans were booming and speculators and house flippers were getting multiple properties in order to flip them for profit   once upon a time these speculators would make sure they could rent out the house for the carrying costs if they needed to   0 down 0 interest meant a whole different ballgame     ah but maybe these speculators would n't have anyone to sell to if low income people could n't get prime loans from the gov   all evidence points to them selling to other speculators until there was no fool left to hold the bag   see miami las vegas etc   edit   i forget that the argument has from fannie to the end of to the cra and now to changes made to the cra where the argument finally gains a bit of traction gt law professor michael s. a treasury department official under president stated that approximately 50 of subprime loans were made by independent mortgage companies that were not regulated by the cra and another 25 to 30 came from only partially cra regulated bank subsidiaries and affiliates noted that institutions fully regulated by cra made perhaps one in four sub prime loans and that the worst and most widespread abuses occurred in the institutions with the least federal oversight   further the discussion into whether the idea and enthusiasm of the rest started as a seed from the regulated banks how much removing risk by wall street with non government backed home loans through credit instruments had its origination in the cra and how much of the failure of ratings agencies to properly rate those credit instruments has to do with the us government and the cra and not regular wall street   so originally i stated no relationship but yes once you get into the complexity of it all i 'm sure we could find a way to say a global mania in speculation in real estate is due to the american government getting poor people into their first home and generally has nothing to do with the human condition of wanting something for nothing and getting excited when the government allows you to sell blue sky returns to foolish speculators

i 've had a mortgage changing hands with mid size companies for many years with no problems   i 've handled many complex financial and technical transactions with multiple parties with no problems over the course decades then after my last refinance my mortgage fell into the hands of jp morgan chase the bank sent one letter to let me know of the transfer and in the next week they sent my loan to collections for what i later found to be chase 's process error in the transfer    for the next three months i ended up in customer service hell as one chase group threatened to foreclose on my house while another group told me to ignore the imminent foreclosure notices one started to investigate the transfer while the collections group tried to make me pay my mortgage payment twice   the mess only ended up being taken care of after i tracked down the old owner of my loan and had them refund the lost payment directly to me normally they would have sent it to the company buying the loan but could not get chase to accept the payment then i paid chase that exact same mortgage payment     all the time the chase internal investigations and collections department were completely incapable of a simple call to previous holder of the loan a company handling millions of mortgage transactions is somehow incapable of handling a minor glitch in a mortgage transfer it 's either utter incompetence or total malice in picking up extra penalty fees or maybe an occasional if homeowners did n't say on top of the details this is what we used our collective tax dollars to bail out

while this question is old and i generally agree with the answers given i think there 's another angle that needs a little insurance if you go with an 84 month loan your car will likely be worth less than the amount owed for substantially all of the entire 84 month loan period this will be exacerbated if you put zero down and include the taxes and fees in the amount borrowed   your lender will require you to carry full comprehensive collision liability coverage likely with a low maximum deductible   while the car is underwater it will probably also be a good idea to carry gap insurance because the last thing you want to do is write a check to your lender to shore up the loan to value deficit if the thing is totaled   these long term car loans i 've seen as high as 96 months are a bear when it comes to depreciation and related insurance costs there is more to this decision than the interest calculation    obviously if you had the cash at the front of this decision presumably you 'll have the cash later to pay off the loan at your convenience   but while the loan is outstanding there are costs beyond interest to consider

not for the tax break no as others have said that still costs you money however with rates being low right now and brought a bit lower by the tax break this is an opportunity for the safest form of leveraged investing you will ever find if you invest that money the returns on investment will probably be better than the mortgage rate and that leaves you with a net profit there is some risk if the market collapses but it 's less risk than any other form of borrowing to invest that also leave you with more flexibility if you need cash in a hurry you can draw down the investments rather than taking another loan if the risk bothers you you can do what i did and split the difference i put 50 down and financed the rest i sometimes regret not having pushed it harder since it has worked out well for me but that was the level of risk i was comfortable with

i live in one of the highest cost of living areas in my country   for the cost of less than half the down payment my spouse and i have saved up for a house we could easily buy a home in most of the lower cost of living areas and several homes in say detroit as for the rest of your question though we 've chosen not to live that way   because like all high cost of living areas ours is near a city there are more free and inexpensive things to do than you would think at first   while others in our area think a great time is pre gaming drinks at a nice bar an expensive restaurant then some more drinks we 've taught ourselves how to make great meals from scratch using sale and inexpensive ingredients from the grocery store and often do that on weekends topped off by a movie from the that we promptly return the next day   we have chosen friends who will hang out with us over dinners and board games instead of out on the town   on weekend days we visit free do hikes wander around downtown strips or play at the local parks   our groceries as i mentioned are sale items or use coupons and we go for less expensive meats and produce   we visit our local farmer 's market for fun not to buy the expensive produce   we might find ourselves wandering through the mall to window shop but when it comes time to actually buy clothing or goods for the apartment we shop around for up to months to find a good deal plenty of our friends have money enough to spend and the most debt they are usually in is a big car payment no consumer debt   at the same time i have trouble imagining some of them buying a house any time soon because they simply ca n't be saving all that much since i know their incomes   they may eventually be able to afford a condo and ride rising housing prices to a and then a house it 's what lots of people do around here loosing buckets money in realtor fees and closing costs along the way   even with these choices it 's hard to view my friends as selfish knowing that most of them give around 10 of their income to charity there are probably plenty of people around here swimming in debt somebody recently asked in a q&a with the local paper editors how she could stop going to the city 's most expensive restaurants and start living within her means when she only liked expensive places but lots of folks can stretch themselves and afford to get by while wasting a lot of money   it 's not what my spouse and i have chosen to do because we want to be able to live very responsibly and plan for a rainy day but the longer you live with and around the money that tends to high cost of living areas the more it will seem normal to you also if it 's really $ 1000/mo for a 2 br apartment your cost of living is still lower than mine is if i were you i would n't try to myself to the habits of your surroundings   instead i 'd find friends who are frugal and work on maintaining your good financial habits   if you ever want one of those $ 4 $ 5 or $ 6 k plus houses you 're going to need them

gt our corporations pay some of the lowest taxes in the world with some of the larger ones actually paying none   no they do n't the top marginal rate for income taxes is 38 meanwhile in the republic of ireland rates vary from 12.5 25 depending on the exact source of the income so no our corporations do not pay the lowest taxes in the world as far as them paying none that stems from one of two things one corporations that pay out all their money in salaries and therefore have no retained earnings hence all their money is taxed at the individual level and workers get at a full 35 and two corporations that create a price transfer agreement with a foreign corporation so that income is shifted to a low tax region where they end up paying nothing to uncle sam that money will still be taxed if they ever try to bring it home and distribute it but as long as it stays overseas then no one can touch it because technically it has n't been earned as income yet that 's how companies avoid greedy bastards trying to take their money because contrary to your opinion you 're not actually entitled to any of their money or anyone else 's money either it 's not your money or our money its their money and they have an effective method to make sure it stays that way   gt btw if wanting decent opportunity to take care of me and mine is greed then yes i 'm greedy    you can already do that it 's called getting a fucking job and living within your means you do n't deserve anything in life you have to earn it no one is obligated to just give you things just because you want them ultimately this whole lets sock it to the rich attitude does n't actually take any money out of their pockets the only people harmed are workers who ca n't take advantage of the methods they use to shift income overseas in short you 're not simply wrong you 're criminally ignorant

i looked this up on wikipedia and was hoping the answer would be no stores can not refuse legal tender but unfortunately it 's not the case   if the retailer wants to go to the lengths of refusing certain denominations to protect themselves from counterfeit currency they are fully within their rights to do so the legal tender page on wikipedia says this about canadian bills retailers in canada may refuse bank notes without breaking the law according to legal guidelines the method of payment has to be mutually agreed upon by the parties involved with the transactions for example convenience stores may refuse $ 100 bank notes if they feel that would put them at risk of being counterfeit victims what is interesting about what i found out is that legal tender can not be refused if it is in repayment of an existing debt i.e. not a store transaction for which there existed no previous debt   so you could offload your $ 100 bills when repaying your sears credit card account or pay in pennies if you wanted to and they could n't refuse you

the fsa can only pay for expenses incurred after it was open   this also applies in case of a mid year change in election such as due to marriage divorce child birth etc for example according to this page you can only be reimbursed for qualifying expenses from the election that was in place at the time the expense was incurred so say you had $ 500 available from january to june then on july 1 had a qualifying event you then elected $ 2000   you can be reimbursed for up to $ 500 in expenses incurred prior to july 1 and then an additional $ 1500 in expenses incurred after up to $ 2000 if you did n't use your full $ 500 more specifically from the irs publication generally distributions from a health fsa must be paid     only to reimburse you for qualified medical expenses you     incurred during the period of coverage the hsa question is more complicated i would talk to a tax accountant or at minimum your benefits coordinator   also read the publication i linked above the first part is about hsas   the short answer to your specific question stop contributing to the hsa unless you were contributing well under the limit of the hsa   if you know your limit and you know you 're under it you can continue contributing until april 15 of next year if you fail to be an eligible individual during     2013 you can still make contributions up until april 15     2014 for the months you were an eligible individual the general rule is you can contribute up to of months you were eligible   so if you changed jobs oct 1 and you 're single then you could contribute or just over $ 2400 in total for the year   if you 've contributed less than that to date you may continue contributing up to that amount but again contact your benefits coordinator or preferably a tax accountant as the rules can be complicated you definitely can not deduct any expenses from the account that you incur after you are no longer eligible and the rules on distributions are pretty complicated and if you get it wrong you may owe a 10 penalty on top of the tax you would normally owe so there is significant incentive not to get it wrong

jamie dimon calling bitcoin a fraud for price is hilarious considering jp morgan literally got bailed out by us tax dollars for investing in trash mortgage loans ok   knocks aside i 'm just buying low the problem with financial analysis on bitcoin is that inevitably financiers do n't know anything about computer science and they are n't in the business of making applications bitcoin is an application of an interesting concept the distributed ledger and the ability to have a distributed ledger verify and lock the ledger the problem with this analysis is that he does n't have application knowledge to infer the positive externalities of having a distributed ledger and most of those use cases for the applications are in their infancy or have n't been though of yet blockchain is an idea that can later power other tools it 's like when the microsoft ceo said apps are n't useful on phones he did n't see the big picture because the use cases were n't defined yet and the same thing is going on here we have n't really fleshed out all the possible use cases of a distributed ledger with a decentralized oracle   does it work for payments yes bitcoin is proof of that and the fact that it 's been bailed out a total of zero times by american taxpayers is so far a strong indicator that it works are there other applications that are being developed yes are there some applications out there that are absolute shit yes are there some applications out there that are absolute gold yes

the essence of your question is whether it 's worth 1000 to you to spread the payments over half a year   the longer payment plan is just a loan and buying the loan costs you more money   the question is whether you think the loan is a good price   i suspect it 's over priced the classic financial analysis would be whether you could get a better return on the loan opportunity costs   but we are talking about what are presumably not terribly big sums of money so it may make more sense to analyze this amount of money in more personalized terms   in that case remember to consider the convenience is it significantly easier to budget with the 6-month plan   watch out for other costs to the loan such as late penalties and other loan fees if you find the periodic payments convenient or you have a short horizon high yield investment then the 6-month loan might work   otherwise if you can afford it it makes more sense to buy the phone upfront

the money is transferred through an electronic funds transfer which is an umbrella term that encompasses wire transfers direct debits etc the application form for key trade bank the only place i can find that uses that exact phrasing lists a swift number this usually indicates that the transfer of funds is done through an international wire transfer   in the most basic sense the process works like this key trade bank uses the swift number to notify your current bank of the transfer   your bank instructs the settlement bank e.g. the central bank of your country where your bank is located to transfer funds to key trade   if key trade is in another country from your current country your central bank will send money to the central bank where key trade is located which will in turn send the money to key trade otherwise your central bank deposits the money into the account that key trade also has with them and the transfer is complete

if you want to prove the actual tax liability you have in the us you have to file a tax return if the government believes you that the withholding is your actual tax fine but that would be a lie withholding is not a tax the american payers must withhold from foreigners enough to have transferred more than the actual tax the foreigners would have paid the standard withholding is 30 but the actual tax on dividends varies in case the tax treaty limits the tax on dividends the withholding is usually up to the maximum of the tax allowed by the treaty but allowed does n't mean that would be the actual tax in many cases it is not so if you want to claim the us tax paid as a credit towards your tax you 'll need to file a tax return in the us calculate the actual tax liability and that would be the amount of credit you can claim the difference between that amount and the amount withheld by the payer will be refunded to you by the irs you do n't have to file a us tax return that is true but the withholding is not the tax the actual tax liability may have been less and the tax authority may deny your credit in whole or in part based on the fact that you have n't filed a us tax return and as such have no proof of your actual tax paid you had some experience with the uk tax treaty and you think all the treaties are the same that may be a reasonable line of thought but it is incorrect treaties are not the same more importantly even if the treaty is the same the tax law is not while in the uk the tax on dividends may be flat and from the first pound in the us it is neither flat nor from the first dollar thus while in the uk you may have been used to paying tax at source and that 's it in the us it does n't work that way at all

yes you can certainly keep it in a savings account until you spend it you 'll get much less interest than you will be paying on the loan but it will be better than nothing however you may want to ask if you can use the loan flexibly instead i.e. only draw down the money you need when you need it and not start paying interest until that happens that would save you a lot more money note that the isa limit is currently £ and the limit is on total deposits so you wo n't be able to reuse the amount later in the tax year since that ends on april 5th that probably wo n't be an issue for you

one other consideration is that by paying off your mortgage early versus for example investing that capital in a mutual fund is that you are reducing your net liquidity to some degree that is if you find yourself needing an emergency infusion of cash it is easier to sell a stock fund than to sell your house or get a equity loan   i suppose if you were planning to need a lot of cash to start a business or invest in real estate then maybe it would make sense to keep your cash more liquid however in your situation i agree with joe pay it off it feels really good to write that last check

first of all going risky does n't mean driving to las vegas and playing roulette the real meaning is that you can afford higher risk return ratio compared to a person who will retire in the following ten years higher return is very important since time works for you and even several extra percent annually will make a big difference in the long run because of compound interest effect the key is that this requires the investment to not be too risky if you invest in a single venture and it fails you lose all the money and that 's worse that some conservative investment that could yield minimum income so you still need the investment to be relatively safe next as user chris w. rea mentions in the comment funds and etfs can be very risky depending on the investment policy they can invest into some very risky ventures or into some specific industry and that poses more risk that investing into blue chips for example so a fund or an etf can be a good fit for you if you choose a right one

sell 200 at 142 what does that mean i have n't seen the movie so i wo n't try to put anything in story context   sell 200 at 142 means to sell 200 units usually shares but in this case it would likely be gallons or barrels of orange juice or pounds or tons of frozen juice    in general this could mean that you have 200 units and want to sell what you have   or you could borrow 200 units from someone and sell those this is called a naked short   in this case it seems that what they are selling is a futures contract   with a futures contract you are promising to obtain orange juice by some future date and sell it for the agreed price   you could own an orange and plan to turn your oranges into juice   or you could buy a futures contract of oranges to turn into juice   or you could arbitrage two futures contracts such that one supplies the other what they 're doing here    in general people make profits by buying low and selling high   in this case they did so in reverse order   they took the risk of selling before they had a supply   then they covered their position by purchasing the supply   they profited because the price at which they bought was lower than the price at which they sold    the reason why this is necessary is that before buying the oranges the orange juice makers need to know that they can make a profit   so they sell orange juice on the futures market   then they know how much they can afford to pay for oranges on a different market   and the growers know how much they can get for oranges so they can pay people to water and pick them    without the futures markets growers and orange juice makers would have to take all the risk themselves   this way they can share risks with each other and financiers   combined with insurance this allows for predictable finances   without it growers would have to be wealthy to afford the variation in crop yields and prices

let me make sure i understand the point of what adam smith is going on about in discussion of relative poverty he relates the idea that an individual can be considered in poverty if they do not meet the customary amount of goods considered by their society to be the minimum to be polite in public you have thus transferred his meaning of what poor means to be what is considered   basic living you have then taken this concept and tied the cost of basic living which you still have n't actually narrowed down towards the tax rate on income for a citizen of a community this is all in the context that you 're concerned with the community level of price for basic living and whether its too high however you also have n't said what too high is nor why you 're concerned with the literal price which is why i 've said you can only control the price of a good through central authority   i never made the assertion you wanted to invoke a centrally planned economy i simply stated that the only way to control prices across a community is through central authority you 've stated that we collect taxes on local state and federal levels this is true however it does not mean that they control the price they simply modify the price set by the market and only serve to increase the price from the base set by market participants    when i want to buy beer i do n't just pay for the cost of the beer i pay the cost of the beer + the city tax + county tax + state tax + state sales tax on the beer which raises the price also these taxes are not income taxes which is what was being discussed    i still do n't know what your point is because you can not seem to define phrases you 've used that i have stated i do not know if you can not define what you 're talking about how it relates to the actual discussion and why its relevant then please stop as its simply a

if i invest x each month where does x go an existing low yield    bond or a new bond at the current interest rate this has to be viewed in a larger context   if the fund has outflows greater than or equal to inflows then chances are there is n't any buying being done with your money as that cash is going to those selling their shares in the fund   if though inflows are greater than outflows there may be some new purchases or not   do n't forget that the new purchase could be an existing bond as the fund has to maintain the duration of being a short term intermediate term or long term bond fund though there are some exceptions like or high yield where duration is n't likely a factor does that just depend on what the fund manager is doing at the time    buying selling no it depends on the shares being created or redeemed as well as the manager 's discretion if i put y into a fund and leave it there for 50 years where does y    go when all of the bonds at the time i made the purchase mature   you 're missing that the fund may buy and sell bonds at various times as for example a long term bond fund may not have issues nearing maturity because of what part of the yield curve it is to mimic does y just get reinvested in new bonds at the interest rate at that time y gets mixed with the other money in the fund that may increase or decrease in value over time   this is part of the risk in a bond fund where nav can fluctuate versus a money market mutual fund where the nav is somewhat fixed at $ 1/share

in such a situation is there any reason financial or not to not pay    as many points as mortgage seller allows i can think of a few reasons not to buy points in the scenario you described if interest rates decrease you could be better off refinancing to a lower rate than buying points now if buying points reduced your down payment below 20 then the pmi would more than offset the benefit of having purchased points your situation changes and you are n't able to stay in the home as long as planned   that said current interest rates are pretty low so i 'd probably gamble on them not getting too much lower anytime soon i also assume that if you can afford as many points as they allow that you would n't have to dip below 20 down payment even with points edit others have mentioned that it 's important to note opportunity cost when calculating the benefit of purchasing points i agree you would n't want to buy points at a rate that saved you less than you could earn elsewhere personally i 've not seen a points scenario that did n't yield more benefit than market average returns but that could be due to my market or just coincidence you should definitely calculate the benefit for your scenario and shop for a good lender do n't forget that points are tax deductible in the year paid when calculating their benefit

we ’re buying the home right over $ 200,000 so that means he will only need to put down as a roughly $ 7000 i 'm with the others do n't call this a gift unless it is a gift    i 'd have him check with the bank that previously refused him a mortgage if putting both of you on a mortgage would their concerns   your cash flow would be paying the mortgage payment and if you failed to do so then they could fall back on his   that may make more sense to them even if they would deny each of you a loan on your own   this works for them because either of you is responsible for the whole loan   it works for him because he was already willing to be responsible for the whole loan   and your alternative plan makes you responsible for the whole loan so this is just as good for you    at what percentage would you suggest splitting ownership and future expenses typically a cash financing partnership would be 50/50 but since it ’s only a 3.5 down payment instead of 20 is that still fair surprisingly enough a 3.5 down payment that accumulates is about half the equity of a 20 down payment   so your suggestion of a split makes sense if 20 would give a split    i expected it to be considerably lower   the way that i calculated it was to have his share increase by his equity share of the rent which i set to the principal plus interest payment for a thirty year loan   with a 20 down payment this would give him 84 equity   with 3.5 about 40 equity   i 'm not sure why 84 equity should be the equivalent of a 50 share but it may be a side effect of other expenses   perhaps taking property taxes out would reduce the equity share    note that if you increase the down payment to 20 your mortgage payment will drop substantially   the difference in interest between 3.5 and 20 equity is a couple hundred dollars   also you 'll be able to eliminate any pmi payment at 20    it could be argued that if he pays a third of the monthly mortgage payment that that would give him the same 50 equity stake on a 3.5 down payment as he would get with a 20 down payment   the problem there is that then he is effectively subsidizing your monthly payment   if he were to stop doing that for some reason you 'd have what is effectively a 50 increase in your rent   it would be safer for you to handle the monthly payment while he handles the down payment    if you could n't pay the mortgage it sounds like he is in a position to buy out your equity rent the property and take over the mortgage payment   if he stopped being able to pay his third of the mortgage it 's not evident that you 'd be able to pick up the slack from him much less buy him out   and it 's unlikely that you 'd find someone else willing to replace him under those terms   but your brother could construct things such that in the face of tragedy you 'd inherit his equity in the house   if you 're making the entire mortgage payment that 's a stable situation    he 's not at risk because he could take over the mortgage if necessary   you 're not at risk because you inherit his equity share and can afford the monthly payment   so even in the face of tragedy things can go on   and that 's important as otherwise you could lose your equity in the house

i think people are conflating two sets of terms unsecured secured and good bad are not synonyms debt may be secured or unsecured if i take a loan against a car or house it is typically secured so the object is collateral against the loan bad debt in financial terms is a loan that is not expected to be recovered a bank might write off a loan or a portion of a loan as bad debt if the borrower goes bankrupt or into administration for example both secured and unsecured loans may be considered bad debt i think the context in which the question is being asked is how to distinguish between sensible and borrowing an extreme example of borrowing would be to buy a pc on a store card pcs devalue very quickly and a store card may charge 30 apr so paying the minimum off each month would mean paying   more than twice the sticker price for a product that is now worth less than half the original borrowed amount on the other hand a 3 mortgage when borrowing less than 60 of the value of a property is a good bet from a lender 's perspective and would be a good debt to have not as good as no debt but better a high apr one

you could be in a bit of a bind   i would n't push it any more until you read your loan papers very carefully going back to the lender for a refinance after you converted it to a rental presumably without their knowledge is risky   i doubt they 'd let you refinance anyway as the house is underwater if the loan is performing then i would n't think they 'd look too hard for reasons to upset the flow of checks by calling the loan due but if you advertise the change of property use to them they may reconsider read your loan papers carefully to see what they can do before you lean on them too much as for managing the finances on that property i 'd build up a cushion to deal with the fact that your payment is going to shoot up considerably in year 8   also consider building up a side business to get another income stream going to compensate as well   you have a little time before it shoots up

one thing is for sure no matter how you look at it obama 's 8 years will prove to be lost years in america congress health care reform and the inevitable double dip depression will be the blame and most of it will be directed towards the policies of the last 16 years   i used to be a stone cold republican super conservative that is when i thought i had the entire world ahead of me now with having to work a minimum wage job and paying back my student loans to clear my debt my views have changed a little    i want to believe that america will take their eyes away from fox news and msnbc and look outside of both the dems and gop point of view and invite a third party into the discussion i believe the libertarians may be able to bridge the gap most americans would fit their beliefs and political platform and they do raise some great questions i just hope it does not get sabotage by the like the tea party did   but in short if their is no unity and a split in america things could get ugly by 2018

if you receive a 1099-misc from youtube that tells you what they stated to the irs and leads into most tax preparation software guided interviews or wizards as a topic for you to enter   whether or not you have a 1099-misc this discussion from the irs is pertinent to your question you could probably elect to report the income as a royalty on your copyrighted work of art on schedule e but see this note in most cases you report royalties in part i of schedule e form 1040 however if you are in business as a self employed writer inventor artist etc report your income and expenses on schedule c or schedule c ez form 1040 whether reporting on schedule e or c is more correct or better for your specific circumstances is beyond the advice you should take from strangers on the internet based on a general question however know that there are potentially several paths for you    note that this is revenue from a business so if you paid for equipment or services that are 100 dedicated to your pc upgraded broadband video editing software vehicle miles to a shoot props etc then these are a combination of depreciable capital investments and expenses you can report against the income reducing the taxes you may owe   if the equipment services are used for business and personal use there are further guidelines from the irs as to estimating the split these apply whether you report on sch e sch c or sch c ez     quote self employment income it is a common misconception that if a taxpayer does not receive a form 1099-misc or if the income is under $ 600 per payer the income is not taxable there is no minimum amount that a taxpayer may exclude from gross income all income earned through the taxpayer ’s business as an independent contractor or from informal side jobs is self employment income which is fully taxable and must be reported on form 1040 use form 1040 schedule c profit or loss from business or form 1040 schedule c ez net profit from business sole proprietorship to report income and expenses taxpayers will also need to prepare form 1040 schedule se for self employment taxes if the net profit exceeds $ 400 for a year do not report this income on form 1040 line 21 as other income independent contractors must report all income as taxable even if it is less than $ 600 even if the client does not issue a form 1099-misc the income whatever the amount is still reportable by the taxpayer fees received for babysitting and lawn cutting are all examples of taxable income even if each client paid less than $ 600 for the year someone who repairs computers in his or her spare time needs to report all monies earned as self employment income even if no one person paid more than $ 600 for repairs

when you hold units of the tsx etf you are indirectly holding u.s. dollars cash or cash equivalents the etf can be thought of as a container the container gives you the convenience of holding usd in say cad denominated accounts that do n't normally provide for usd cash balances the etf price $ and $ in your example simply reflects the cad price of those usd and the change is because the currencies moved with respect to each other and so necessarily given how the etf is made up when the value of the u.s. dollar declines vs. the canadian dollar it follows that the value of your units of declines as quoted in canadian dollar terms currencies move all the time similarly if you held the same amount of value in u.s. dollars directly instead of using the etf you would still experience a loss when quoted in canadian dollar terms in other words whether or not your u.s. dollars are tied up either in or else sitting in a u.s. dollar cash balance in your brokerage account there 's not much of a difference you lose canadian dollar equivalent when the value of usd declines with respect to cad selling more quickly your units in a usd denominated account to yield u.s. dollars that you then directly hold does not insulate you from the same currency risk what it does is reduce your exposure to other cost risk factors inherent with etfs liquidity spreads and fees however i doubt that any of those played a significant part in the change of value from $ to $ that you described

yes it 's a gross over simplification we can certainly agree on that   you do n't need a degree to make a good living defined as 50k+ work for you this is a popular lie that was fed to young people which aided in creating this student loan crisis in the first place truck drivers construction workers skilled laborers in general etc make good money right put of hs of course it can be difficult to land one of these jobs but working as say a dock worker for $ 10 12 for a few years and working your way up to a higher paying job is a fantastic route to in this case that would likely be a truck driver this requires some school and a license but every semi major company will pay for that if you 've been working for them for a few years and they can trust you the issue that is far too prevalent is that kids either are n't getting a reasonable education or they are n't graduating from topics for another day probably    school costs have gone up because the govt was a loan to everyone with a pulse    i 'm with you on education public education is an abject failure we have failed to educate our youth and minimum wage laws price those poorly educated unskilled right out of the job market i 'll leave the rest of the third paragraph alone as i think we differ in fundamental values that neither of us are likely to change and a discussion of those values would be

enrolled agents typically specialize only in tax matters   their status allows them to represent clients before the irs which a cpa can also do see the irs site regarding enrolled agents their focus is much narrower than a cpa and you would only hire them for advice or representation with tax related matters   e.g. you 'd not hire an enrolled agent to do an external audit   a cpa is a much broader certification covering accounting in general of which taxes are only a portion a cpa may or may not specialize in tax matters so if you have a tax related issue especially an audit review or appeal you may want to query a prospective cpa as to their experience with tax matters and representing clients appeals etc you would likely be better off with an ea than a cpa who tax work and specializes in other things such as financial the other hand if you have need of advice that is more generalized to accounting audits etc then you 'd want to talk with a cpa as opposed to an ea

i 've been taking all the cheap fixed rate debt banks would like to give me lately what rate in practice i find the only way i get a low enough rate on a term fixed rate loan is to use collateral that is auto loans and home loans i have n't seen any personal loans with a low enough fixed rate student loans may be cheap enough if they 're subsidized i guess here 's how i think of the rate if you look at the average annual return on 80 bonds 20 stocks is 6.7 with worst year that 's a nominal return not a real return if you subtract taxes say your marginal rate the rate you pay on your last dollar of income is 28 federal plus 5 state then if you have no tax deferral the 6.7 becomes about a 4.5 average with reasonably wide variation year by year you can mess with this e.g. using tax exempt bonds and tax efficient stock funds etc which would be wise but for deciding whether to take out debt getting too detailed is false precision the 6.7 number is only an average to begin with not a guarantee say you pay 4.5 on a loan and you keep your money in very conservative investments that 's probably at least going to break even if you give it some years it certainly can and sometimes will fail to break even over some time periods but the risk of outright catastrophe is low if your annual loss is 10 that sucks but it should not ruin your life in practice i got a home loan for close to 4.5 which is tax deductible so a lower effective rate and got an auto loan subsidized by the manufacturer for under 3 both are long term fixed rate loans with collateral so i was happy to borrow this money paying about a 3 effective rate in both cases well below my rough threshold of 4.5 i do not however run a credit card balance even though one of my cards is only 7 right now 7 is too high and it 's a floating rate that could rise the personal loans i 've seen have too high rates also thoughts overall i think using debt as a tool requires that you 're already financially stable such that the debt is n't creating a risky situation the debt should be used to increase liquidity and flexibility and perhaps boost investment returns a bit where you 're likely to get into trouble is using debt to increase your purchasing power especially if you use debt to buy things that are n't necessary for me the primary reason to use debt is flexibility and liquidity and the secondary bonus reason is a possible spread between the debt rate and investment returns

here 's the purely mathematical answer for which fees hurt more you say taking the money out has an immediate cost of $ 60,000 we need to calculate the present value of the future fees and compare it against that number let 's assume that the investment will grow at the same rate either with or without the broker that 's actually a bit generous to the broker since they 're probably investing it in funds that in turn charge fees we can calculate the present cost of the fees by calculating the difference between as it turns out this number does n't depend on how much we should expect to get as investment returns doing the math the fees cost 1 = $ that is the cost of the fees is comparable to paying nearly $ 100,000 right now nearly half the investment if there are no other options i strongly recommend taking the one time hit and investing elsewhere preferably in low cost index funds details of the derivation for simplicity assume that both fees and growth compound continuously the growth does compound continuously we do n't know about the fees but in any case the distinction is n't very significant fees occur at a continuous rate of rf = which is negative and growth occurs at rate the ops current principal is p and the present value of the fees over time is f. we therefore have the equation p = p f t solving for f we notice that the components cancel and we obtain f = p p t = p p t = p p 1 t

it 's very hard to measure the worth of an abstract concept like money particularly over long periods of time in the modern era we have things like the consumer price index cpi in the united states where the bureau of labor statistics literally sends shoppers out to find prices of things and surveys people to find out what they buy this results in a variety of indexes which get reported by media outlets as inflation or deflation if the change in value goes the other way there are also other measurements available like the mit billion prices project which attempt to make their own reading of the worth of currencies those kinds of things are about the only ways to measure a currency 's change in value to itself because a currency is basically only worth what one can buy with it while it is n't all the world 's currencies combined there is a concept of the international monetary fund 's special drawing rights which is a basket of five currencies used by world central banks to help back each other 's currencies and is very occasionally used as a unit of currency for international contracts one might be able to compare the price of one currency to that of the or even to any other weighted average of world currencies that one wanted but i do n't think it 's done nearly as often as comparing currencies to the basket of goods one can buy to find inflation even though one might think what would be important to measure would be overall money supply inflation much more often people care more about measuring price inflation occasionally people worry about wage inflation but generally that 's considered a result of high price inflation in order to try to keep this on topic as a personal finance thing rather than an economics thing i guess the question is why do you want to know if you have some assets in a particular currency you probably care most about what you 'll be able to buy with them in the future when you want or need to spend them in that sense it 's inflation that you 're likely caring about the most if you 're trying to figure out which currency to keep your assets in it largely depends on what currency your future expenses are likely to be in though i can imagine that one might want to move out of a particular currency if there 's a lot of political instability that you 're expecting to lead to high inflation in a currency for a time

answering this question is weird because it is not really precise in what you mean do you want all stocks in the us do you want a selection of stocks according to parameters   do you just want a cool looking graph however your possible misuse of the word derivative my interest your reference to   gold and silver seems to indicate that you do not know what a derivative actually is or what it would do in a portfolio   the straightforward way to see an efficient frontier is to do the following for a set of stocks in this case six randomly selected ones                rai amzn msft twx from = 2012 06 01 to = 2017 06 01      returns lt;- null   tickerlist lt;- rai amzn msft twx   for ticker in tickerlist    returns lt;-     lt;- tickerlist   returns lt;-     frontier lt;-   width = 800 height = 600   which = all       constraints =     portfolio weights         rai    amzn    msft     twx             covariance risk budgets         rai    amzn    msft     twx             target returns and risks    mean            var          the minimum variance portfolio of these six assets has a mean return is and variance is amzn does not get any weight in the portfolio   it kind of means that the other assets span it and it does not provide any additional diversification benefit    let us add two etfs that track gold and silver to the mix and see how little difference it makes     from = 2012 06 01 to = 2017 06 01     returns lt;- null   tickerlist lt;- rai amzn msft twx gld   for ticker in tickerlist    returns lt;-     lt;- tickerlist   returns lt;-    frontier lt;-     width = 800 height = 600         optimal weights   out lt;- constraints =   lt;-   lt;-   lt;-   lt;- optimal portfolio     equal weights   lt;- 8)   lt;-   lt;-   lt;- equal weights portfolio    width = 800 height = 600   =   chart ylim = c(0 2   chart ylim = c(0 2   chart main = drawdown ylim = 0   chart main = drawdown ylim = 0         adding gold changes the minimum variance mean return to and the variance stays about the same you can see how the weights change at different return and variance profiles in the picture   the takeaway is that adding gold decreases the return but does not do a lot for the risk of the portfolio   you also notice that silver does not get included in the minimum variance efficient portfolio and neither does amzn     we can also compare the optimal weights to an equally weighted portfolio and see that the latter would have performed better but had much   larger drawdowns which is because it has a higher volatility which might be undesirable     everything below here is false but illustrative   so what about the derivative part let us assume you bought an out of the money call option with a strike of 50 on msft at the beginning of the   time series and held it to the end   we need to decide on the the annualized cost of carry rate the annualized rate of interest the time to maturity is measured in years the annualized   volatility of the underlying security is by the historical volatility       lt;- months   t lt;- 60 months 5 years   vol lt;- annualized volatility     lt;- 60 1   for t in    s lt;-    lt;- = c s = s x = 50 time = t t 12 r = 0.001 b = 0.001 sigma = vol    lt;-       lt;-   lt;-     lt;-   lt;-     returns lt;-     lt;- 9     lt;-   lt;-   lt;- equal weights derivative portfolio     width = 800 height = 600   =   chart ylim = c(0 4.5   chart ylim = c(0 4.5   chart main = drawdown ylim = 0   chart main = drawdown ylim = 0        even though we have a massively profitable instrument in the derivative the portfolio analysis does not include it   because of the high volatility however if we just use equal weighting and essentially take a massive position in   the out of the money call which would not be possible in real life we get huge drawdowns and volatility but   the returns are almost two fold but nobody will sell you a five year call   others can correct any mistakes or misunderstandings in the above it hopefully gives a starting point   read more at      the album

paying the minimum balance on a loan can be devastating and is highly un recommended it is important you understand your loan and the terms associated with it loans are given for a period of time but if you pay the minimum it does not mean you will pay it all off by the end when paying a loan money is applied to the interest first and any extra amount is then applied to the principle here 's an example if i have a $ 12 loan for 1 year the interest is 100 my minimum payment each month is $ 1 if i pay that minimum only i will be stuck paying $ 12 at the end of the loan why you ask because each month i 'm being charged $ 1 interest and the payment i am making is only going towards that interest however if i paid $ 2 instead now $ 1 goes to the principal the original $ 12 i borrowed this means that next month i will only be charged interest on $ 11 dollars instead of $ 12 you need to know how much is going towards the interest of your loan and how much is going towards the principle you can speak with your bank about this and they will help you understand in many cases they actually provide you with the numbers on your with examples of how long it would take to payoff your loan with minimum only and how long it would take if you added an extra x amount each month i recommend using the snowball method to pay of your debt it 's simple and effective how much you should add to each monthly payment depends on how much you can afford to add here are some calculators you can play around with cnn money bank rate calc edit so with the additional information you provided we can estimate that you have about 2200 free cash flow each 's your cash after you pay all your bills we can put away 500 each month for a rainy day fund just to be loss accidents or anything we ca n't predict so assuming that is all your expenses including the money you spend on entertainment that leaves you with $ 1700 you can add on to your loan payments so you can pay off your third loan in 1 month then add the remaining balance to the 2nd loan with this income it should take you less then a year to pay off all your loans

saving money for the future is a good thing whether spending those savings on a business venture makes sense will depend on a few factors including 1 how much money you need that business to make ie will you be quitting your job and relying on the business for your sole income or will this just be a hobby you make some pocket change from 2 how much the money the business needs up front some businesses like simple web design consulting might have effectively $ 0 in cash startup costs where starting a franchise restaurant might cost you $ m on day 1 3 how risky it is the general stat is that something like 50 of all new businesses fail in their first year and i think for restaurants that number is often given as but if you do n't have a business idea yet and save for one in the future but never get that perfect idea the good news is that you 've saved a bunch of money that you can instead use for retirement or whatever other financial goals you have so it 's not the saving for a new business that is risky it 's the spending part of good personal financial management is making financial goals tracking your progress to those goals and changing them as needed in a simpler case many people want to own their own home this is a common financial goal just like early retirement or starting your own business or paying for your kids college education all those goals are helped by saving money so your job as someone mindful of personal finances is to prioritize those goals in accordance to what is important for you

well arbitrage is a simple mean reversion strategy which states that any two similar commodity with some price difference usually not much   will converge so either you can bet on difference in prices in different exchanges or also you can bet on difference in futures value   for example if current price of stock is 14 $ and if futures price is   then you can buy one futures contract and short one stock at the market price this would lock in a profit of 4 $ per share

the economy stinks because the government targets a straight line rate of ngdp growth that is ever diverging from the rate of sustainable economic growth which has been flattening since the 1970s when the cost of energy sustained significant rises in price and never looked back the only way to make the economy not stink is to find a miraculously cheap energy source that is as cheap as fossil fuels were before the 1970s   since the possibility of this is practically zero the best we can do is make the economy stink less in the long run by intentionally flattening the rate of ngdp growth by gradually pulling back on massive debt spending and tightening loose monetary policies if we do n't do this we are just setting ourselves up for a future economic correction whose will not only be bigger than the great recession but will also be relatively bigger than the great depression

the policy you quoted suggests you deposit 6 minimum that $ 6,000 will cost you $ 4,500 due to the tax effect yet after the match you 'll have $ 9,000 in the account taxable on withdrawal but a great boost to the account   the question of where is less clear there must be more than the 2 choices you mention most plans have too many choices this into my focus on expenses a few years back pbs frontline aired a program titled the retirement gamble in which fund expenses were discussed with a focus on how an extra 1 in expenses will wipe out an extra 1/3 of your wealth in a 40 year period very simple to illustrate this go to a calculator and enter .99 raised to the power of 40 is the result my 401(k has an expense of .02 that 's of 1 raised to the same 40 gives in other words a cost of .8 over the full 40 years my wife and i are just retired and will have less in expenses for the rest of our lives than the average account cost for just 1 year   in your situation the knee jerk reaction is to tell you to maximize the 401(k deposit at the current 2016 $ 18,000 that might be appropriate but i 'd suggest you look at the expense of the s&p index sometime called large cap fund but see the prospectus and if it 's costing much more than i 'd go with an ira roth if you ca n't deduct the traditional ira much of the value of the 401(k beyond the match is the tax differential i.e. depositing while in the 25 bracket but withdrawing the funds at retirement hopefully at 15 it does n't take long for the extra expense and the holy cow my 401(k just turned decades of dividends and long term cap gains into ordinary income effect to take over understand this now not 30 years hence   last to answer your question how much i often recommend what may seem a cliche continue to live like a student half the country lives on $ 54 k or less there 's certainly a wide gray area but in general a person starting out will choose one of 2 paths living just at or even above his means or living way below and saving say 30 40 off the top even 30 does n't hit the extreme saver level if you do this you 'll find that if when you get married buy a house have kids etc you 'll still be able to save a reasonable percent of your income toward retirement   in response to your comment what counts as retirement savings there 's a concept used as part of the budgeting process known as the envelope system for those who have an income where there 's little discretionary money left over each month the method of putting money aside into small buckets is a great idea in your case say you take me up on the 30 40 challenge 15 of it goes to a hard and fast retirement account the rest to savings according to the general order of emergency fund 6 12 months expenses to cover a job loss another fund for random expenses such as new transmission i 've never needed one but i hear they are expensive and then the bucket towards house down payment keep in mind i have no idea where you live or what a reasonable house would cost regardless a 20 25 downpayment on even a $ 250 k house is $ that will take some time to save up if the housing in your area is more bump it accordingly   if the savings starts to grow beyond any short term needs it gets invested towards the long term and is treated as retirement money there is no such thing as saving too much when i turned 50 and was let go from a 30 year job i was n't unhappy that i saved too much and could call it quits that day had i been saving just right i 'd have been 10 years shy of my target

am i wrong   yes the exchanges are most definitely not good ole boys clubs they provide a service a huge liquid and very fast market and they want to be paid for it additionally since direct participants in their system can cause serious and expensive disruptions they allow only organizations that know what they 're doing and can pay for any damages the cause is there a way to invest without an intermediary certainly but if you have to ask this question it 's the last thing you should do typically such offers are only superior to people who have large investments sums and know what they 're doing as an inexperienced investor chances are that you 'll end up losing everything to some fraudster honestly large exchanges have become so cheap e.g. xetra costs eur + per trade that if you 're actually investing then exchange fees are completely irrelevant the only exception may be if you want to use a dollar cost averaging strategy and do n't have a lot of cash every month fixed fees can be significant then many banks offer investments plans that cover this case

it is definitely legal however none of such expenses will be allowed as a tax deduction for the corporation basically you 'll end up paying more to maintain the entity and pay taxes on its income the rent you 're paying to yourself as a corporation at corporate rates for no apparent benefit being the director executive in the corporation will make you liable for whatever the corporation is liable so liability is n't going away the reason corporation is considered limited liability for owners is because shareholders are shielded from the corporate liability not directors or executives which are explicitly not shielded

there was a time when government policy was actually pretty damn smart there were a range of automatic that kicked in when there was a recession and they had a fast and large impact   it was n't until reagan that we started to chip away at those as well as go into a perpetual debt stimulus posture these two actions helped to prime the system for an inevitable large shock   even now after one of the longest expansions in history we 're still running a substantial deficit and as such the appetite to expand it when the next recession hits will be diminished as it was during the great recession when we really needed 3 trillion in stimulus spending and got less than 1

liquidity is highly correlated to efficiency primarily because if an asset 's price is not sampled during the time of a trade it 's price is unknown therefore inefficient   past prices can be referenced but they are not the price of the present   prices of substitutes are even worse spy is extremely efficient for an equity   if permitted it could easily trade with much lower ticks and still have potential for a locked market ideal exchange an ideal exchange has no public restrictions on trade   this is not to say that private restrictions would need to be put in place for various reasons but one would only do that if it were responsible for its own survival instead of being too big to fail in this market trades would be approximately continuous for the largest securities and almost always locked because of continuous exchange fee competition with ever dropping minimum ticks a market that can provide continuous locked orders with infinite precision is perfectly efficient from the point of view of the investor because the value of one 's holdings are always known emh in terms of the theory the efficient market hypothesis this is irrelevant to the rational investor the rational investor will invest in the market at large of a given asset class only increasing risk as wealth increases thus moving to more volatile asset classes when the volatility can be absorbed by excess wealth here liquidity is also helpful the two heads are better than one way of thinking   the more invested in an asset class the lower the class 's variance and vice versa   bonds the least variant dwarf equities which dwarf options all in order of the least variance   believe it or not there was a day when bonds were almost as risky as equities for those concerned with emh liquidity is also believed to increase efficiency in some forms because liquidity is proportional to the number of individuals invested thus reducing the likelihood of an insufficient number of participants external inefficiency in the case of etfs that do not perfectly track their underlying index less costs at all times between index changes this is because they are forbidden from directly trading in the market on their own behalf if they were allowed and honest the price would always be perfect and much more liquid than it otherwise should be since the combined frequency of all index members is much higher than any one alone if one was dishonest it would try to defraud with higher or lower numbers however if insider trading were permitted both would fail due to the prisoner 's dilemma that there is no honor among thieves   here the market would detect the problem much sooner because the insiders would arbitrage the false price away    indirect internal efficiency taking emerging market etfs as an example the markets that those are invested into are heavily restricted so their etf to underlying price inefficiencies are more pronounced even though the etfs are actually working to make those underlying markets more efficient because a price for them altogether is known

intuitive i doubt it derivatives are not the simplest thing to understand   the price is either in the money or it is n't by the way exactly at the money is not in the money an option that 's not in the money has time value only as the price rises and the option is more and more in the money the time value drops we have a $ 40 stock it makes sense to me that a $ 40 strike price is all just a bet the stock will rise there 's no intrinsic value the option prices at about $ 4.00 for one year out with 25 volatility but the strike of $ 30 is at $ with $ 10 in the money and only in time premium there 's a great calculator on line to tinker with   volatility is a key component of options trading think about it if a stock rises but rarely goes up any more or less just steady up why would you even buy an option that was even 10 out of the money the only way i can describe this is to look at a bell curve and how there 's a 1/6 chance the event will be above one standard deviation if that standard deviation is small the chance of hitting the higher strikes is also small   i wrote an article betting on apple at 9 to 2 in which i describe how a pair of option trades was set up so that a 35 rise in apple stock would return and apple had two years to reach its target i offer this as an example of options trading not being theory but something that many are engaged in what i found curious about the trade was that apple 's volatility was high enough that a 35 move did n't seem like the 4.5 to 1 risk the market said it was as of today apple needs to rise 13 in the next 10 months for the trade to pay off disclosure the long time to expiration was both good and bad two years to recover 35 seemed reasonable but 2 years could bring anything in the macro sense another recession some worldwide event that would impact apple 's market etc the average investor will not have the patience for these long term option trades

bonds released at the same time have different interest rates because they have different levels of risks and liquidity associated   risk will depend on the company country municipality that offers the bond their financial position and their resulting ability to make future payments avoid default riskier organizations must offer higher interest rates to ensure that investors remain willing to loan them money liquidity depends on the terms of the loan principal only bonds give you minimal liquidity as there are no ongoing interest payments and nothing received until the bond 's maturity date all bonds provide lower liquidity if they have longer maturity dates bonds with lower liquidity must have higher returns to compensate for the fact that you will have to give up your cash for a longer period of time bonds released at different times will have different interest rates because of what the general market rate for interest was in those periods ie if a bond is released in 2016 with interest rates approaching 0 even a high risk bond would have a lower interest rate than a bond released in the 1980s when market rates were approaching 20 some bonds offer variable interest tied to some market indicator those will typically have higher interest at the time of issuance because the bondholder bears some risk that the prevailing market rate will drop note regarding sale of bonds after market rates have changed the value of your bonds will fluctuate with the market if a bond was offered with 1 interest and next year interest rates go up and a new identical bond is offered for 2 interest when you sell your old bond you will take a loss because the market wo n't want to pay full price for it anymore whether you should sell lower interest rate bonds depends on how you feel about the factors above do you want junk bonds that have stock like levels of returns but high risks of default maturing in 30 years or do you want bonds that have essentially 0 returns maturing in 30 days if you are paying interest on debt it is quite likely that you could achieve a net income benefit by selling the bonds and paying off debt assuming your debt has a higher interest rate than your low rate bonds paying off debt is sometimes referred to as a zero risk return because essentially there is no real risk that your lender would otherwise go bankrupt that is you will owe your bank the car loan until you pay it and paying it is the only thing you can do to reduce it   however some schools of thought suggest that maintaining savings + liquid investments makes sense even if you have some debt because cash + liquid investments can cover you in some emergencies that credit cards ca n't help you with ie if you lose your job perhaps your credit could be pulled and you would have nothing except for your liquid savings to tide you over how much you should save in this way is a matter of opinion but often repeated numbers are either 3 months or 6 months worth which is sometimes taken as x months of expenses and sometimes as x months of after tax income you should look into this issue further there are many questions on this site that discuss it i 'm sure

from the banks point of view the point of a current account like this is to get you as a regular customer they want to be your main bank the bank you interact with the most the bank you turn to first when you need financial products and services the bank whose advertising you see every time you log into online banking or walk into a branch the bank knows that if they just offer the high interest rate or other perks with no strings that people will open the account and dump a bunch of savings in it but wo n't actually move their financial life over their old bank will still be their main bank so they strings like a required minimum deposit a minimum number of direct debits and similar these have minimal effect on people actually using the account as their main current account while being a pain for people trying to game the system of course as you point out it is still possible to game the system but they do n't need to make gaming the system impossible they just need to make it enough that most people wo n't bother

if you want to make a profit from long term trading whatever long term means for you the best strategy is to let the good performers in your portfolio run and the bad ones   of course that strategy is hard to follow unless you have the perfect foresight to know exactly how long your best performing investments will continue to outperform the market but markets do n't always follow the assumption that perfect information is available to all participants and hence momentum has a real world effect on prices whether or not some theorists have chosen to ignore it but a fixed strategy of daily rebalancing does exactly the opposite of the above it continuously reduces the holdings of good performers and increases the holdings of bad   if this type of rebalancing is done more frequently than the constituents of benchmark index are adjusted it is very likely to underperform the index in the long term other issues in a real world market are the impact of increased dealing costs on smaller parcels of securities and the buy sell spreads incurred in the daily rebalancing trades if the market is up and down 1 on alternate days with no long trend quite likely the fund will be repeatedly buying and selling small parcels of the same stocks to do its daily balancing

there are many reasons for buying stock for dividends   you are right in the sense that in theory a stock 's price will go down in value by the amount of the dividend as the amount of dividend was adding to the value of the company but now has been paid out to shareholder so now the company is worth less by the value of the dividend however in real life this may or may not happen sometimes the price will drop by less than the value of the dividend sometimes the price will drop by more than the dividend and other times the price will go up even though the stock has gone ex dividend we can say that if the price has dropped by exactly the amount of the dividend then there has been no change in the stockholders value if the price has dropped by more than the value of the dividend then there has been a drop to the stockholder 's value and if the price has gone up or dropped by less than the value of the dividend then there has been a increase to the stockholder 's value benefits of buying stocks with good dividends what you should n't do however is buy stocks solely due to the dividend be aware that if a company starts reducing its dividends it could be an early warning sign that the company may be heading into financial troubles that is why holding a stock that is dropping in price purely for its dividend can be a very dangerous practice

well it is a negative point of view but nobody in the history of money has ever loaned money because they like you   i suppose you could paint it as an honest point of view all money lending is for profit   if you have a high score you are very likely to repay your loan because you are lower risk   we always hear lower risk but the risk is that they wo n't make money off of you i think that just like we buy previously owned vehicles cars instead of used cars and we banks call them service fees instead of junk fees our credit score discusses our credit worthiness instead of profitability but none of that means you ca n't benefit from it   it is n't a fear tactic it is a way to judge each other   you probably pay interest and fees to keep it high but that is price of lending i think the questioner has a negative view of credit which i suppose is fine and is their right i will defend their right to an opinion but the way we do and judge credit is neither evil or benevolent i could certainly agree that more transparency would be good but only for honest folks   if the credit bureaus made it public how they judged us there would be a new industry for people who want to game the system update since it always will cost to use credit and using credit is the only way to prove your a low credit risk it will therefore always cost money to raise your credit score however the return on investment is in this question   a person with no credit was able to get a loan but at serious out of pocket cost   later after establishing credit at a price of real money he was able to secure a nearly identical loan for considerably less cost in terms of interest paid because he had proven himself worthy   when i say proven i mean paid interest there is nothing wrong with questioning the system change only occurs when people question the status quo   and for sure our current system is not perfect but like many employed systems while it is terrible but there is nothing better

a home is an investment but the value it returns is n't primarily financial $ $ they are consumption a place to live this gives it different characteristics than other investments e.g. increasing the amount invested by buying a more expensive home does n't do much to assist your financial well being and future income and is n't necessarily the responsible thing to do you may get some capital gains typically in line with inflation sometimes less sometimes more but those are n't the most reliable and it 's difficult to realize them it involves selling your house and moving its main value as a hedge is a hedge against rising rent but if you 're still working full time and can expect cost of living increases that hedge may not be as valuable to you as it would to say someone living on a fixed income but as for treating it as a low risk investment that 's very problematic real low risk investments are things like government bonds where you ca n't lose principal unless you 're going to live into your house until the day you die the real estate crash should have you of any notion that housing values never go down rather your house is a single illiquid investment imagine if you will going to your brokerage and borrowing a hundred thousand dollars or more on margin to invest in a single real estate investment trust then take away whatever diversification the trust offered by holding multiple properties also you ca n't sell any of it until you move away and the transaction fee will take something like 3 still sound safe moreover it 's exactly the wrong kind of risk your house 's value is tied to what people are willing to pay for housing where your house is which is usually subject to the whims of the local economy this means that in a recession and housing bust in the local economy you can lose your job and have your mortgage go underwater at the same time it totally makes sense to treat your house as an investment to some extent and it makes double sense for a financial adviser to consider it as part of your investment recommendations safety is not the way you should be thinking of it though

most financial guru 's recommend between three and six months of savings modified by how likely you think it is you 'll lose your job   note that the months here are months of expenses not income dave ramsey on the other hands recommends saving only $ 1000 until you 've paid all debts except your home   this strategy only makes sense if you 're paying off debt very aggressively since you have many relatively small debts you would benefit greatly from the debt snowball recent research shows it 's more effective in practice than paying off high interest first   as you quickly pay off the smaller loans you reduce the amount you must pay each month reducing your risk your emergency fund now goes that much farther and enabling you to put more on the next debt   in your particular case the debt snowball would be etc    again this is good because it quickly reduces your monthly required debt payments

many years ago i worked on software that had to print the date payee and amounts on pre printed checks   other than the micr line which had a particular placement with respect to the bottom edge and required a particular font in a particular point size most aspects of the check layout and format were up to the particular check provider then there was a desire to start using optical character recognition to further automate check handling   a standard came out that most checks i see now seem to follow   the standard dictated the exact dollar sign to be printed to the left of the amount box   this was used by the ocr to locate the amount   there were specific tolerances for where you could print write the amount relative to that dollar sign   there were also some requirements for the box containing the amount to have some clearance from the noisy backgrounds pre printed on many checks   but what font you used inside the amount box was as far as i could tell   after all customers could always hand write the amount interestingly the part of the check where you spell out the amount is known as the legal amount   if the amount in and the amount in words do n't match the spelled version takes precedence legally   the theory being that it 's easier to doctor the to change the apparent value of the check than it is to change the words   i always found it ironic that the layout standard to enable ocr standard was focused on reading the rather than the legal amount   ocr has come a long way since then so i would n't be surprised if nowadays both amounts are read even on hand written checks a little search shows that current voluntary standards are put out by the group

the value of the asset does n't change just because of the exchange rate change if a thing valued in usd costs usd $ 1 and usd $ 1 = can $ 1 so the thing is also valued can $ 1 today and tomorrow can $ 1 worth usd $ 0.5 the thing will continue being worth usd $ 1 if the thing is valued in can $ after the exchange rate change the thing will be worth usd $ 2 but will still be valued can $ 1 what you 're talking about is price quotes not value price quotes will very quickly reach the value since any deviation will be used by the traders to make profits on arbitrage and algo traders will make it happen much quicker than you can even notice the arbitrage existence

according to this q&a by a houston law professor the law however is not designed to interfere with an individual 's right to stop payment on a valid check because of a dispute with someone if he did n't deliver as promised you do not owe the money and have the right to stop payment assuming that you had enough money in the bank to cover the check stopping payment is not a crime i found several other pages essentially saying the same thing   all the usual disclaimers apply i am not a lawyer this is not legal advice etc   in particular laws might vary by state basically though it does n't seem there 's any reason why you ca n't stop payment on the check just because you feel like it   if you then provide a cashier 's check for the payment your ex partner will not really have anything to complain about   if you 're worried about annoying him by doing this that 's a separate issue but given the situation you describe i do n't see why you should be   if you feel he is being a pain in the neck feel free to be a pain in the neck right back and force him to accept the payment in the manner you decide instead of allowing him to string you along note two things obviously if you have reason to believe the guy will sue you you should act with caution   also i 'm not suggesting withdrawing payment completely only stopping the check and issuing a new payment that you do n't have to wait on e.g. cashier 's check

it is a good idea to keep the receipts the reason being that the from the atm and the debit to the account are process there are multiple during this process between the hardware of the atm the software controlling the atm and the core banking software like any software programming there are chances of errors ie amounts being debit wrong due to bugs or duplicate of transactions being posted such errors would normally get caught during recon between the atm software and the core banking postings its advisable to keep the receipts and verify erroneous debits in such cases the receipts would provide additional information required by the bank to rectify the errors promptly

in many most cases luxury cars are leased rather than purchased so the payments on even an expensive car might not be as high as you 'd expect for simplicity take a $ 100,000 car if you were to buy that in cash or do a standard five year auto loan that would be incredibly expensive for all but the wealthiest of people but a lease is different when you lease a car you are financing the car 's depreciation over the lease term so let 's suppose that you 're signing up for a three year lease the car manufacturer will make an estimate of what that car will be worth when you bring it back in three years this is called the residual value if this number is $ 80,000 that means the is only financing the $ 20,000 difference between the car 's price and its residual value after three years rather than the full $ 100,000 msrp at the end of the lease he or she just turns the car back in luxury cars are actually especially amenable to leasing because they have excellent brand power just because of the name on the hood there are many people who would be happy to pay a lot for a three year old mercedes or bmw with a or low range car the brand is not as powerful and used cars have a lower residual value as a percentage of the msrp than luxury cars so do n't look at an $ 80,000 luxury car and assume that the owner has paying for the entire $ 80,000

you say   my work is steady even if i lost my job it 'd be easy to get another location has been static for a few years now but i 'm not sure that 'll extrapolate to the future i 'm lazy so i do n't want to move but for a significantly better job opportunity i would n't mind    the general rule of thumb is that you 'll come out ahead if you buy a house with a mortgage and live there for five years   what you lose in interest you make up in rent   and living there for five years you make back your closing costs in equity   if you 're there less than five years though you do n't make back the closing costs   you 'd have been better off renting    historically up to about twenty years ago your mortgage payment and rent payment for the same basic property would be about the same   i.e. if your current landlord sold you what you are renting your mortgage payment would be roughly the same as your rent   maybe a little lower or a little higher but about the same   more recently it has n't been strange to see a divergence in those   now it is not uncommon for a mortgage payment to be 50 higher than rent on the same property    this has some consequences   first your $ 1000 rent probably wo n't stretch as far as a $ 1000 mortgage payment   so you 'll be buying something that you 'd only pay $ 650 or $ 700 rent   second if you move and ca n't sell immediately you 'll get less in rent than you 'd pay in mortgage   rather than contributing to your income the property will require subsidy just to maintain the mortgage   and in the early years of the mortgage this means that you 're paying all of the principal equity and some of the interest    buying a duplex makes this worse   you have your side and their side   you can substitute your $ 1000 rent for half of the mortgage payment   meanwhile they are paying $ 700 in rent   you have to subsidize the mortgage by $ 300   plus you are talking about hiring a property management company to do things like lawn maintenance   there goes another $ 100 a month   so you are subsidizing the mortgage by $ 400    i do n't know real estate prices in utah but a quick search finds a median house price over $ 200,000   so it seems unlikely that you are buying new construction with new appliances   more likely you are buying an existing duplex with existing appliances   what happens when they fail   the renter does n't pay for that   the property management company does n't pay for that although they 'll likely arrange for it to happen   you pay for it    also it often takes a bit of time to clean up the apartment after one tenant leaves before the new tenant starts paying rent   that 's a dead weight loss   if this happens during a local recession you could be carrying the mortgage on a property with no offsetting rental income for months    there are some forces   for example if house prices in your area are increasing the rent will increase with them not necessarily at the same pace   but your mortgage payment stays the same   so eventually the rent may catch up with the mortgage payment   if you wait long enough in a strong enough market the rent on the other half of the duplex may cover the entire mortgage payment    if you currently have an urban apartment within walking distance of work and switch to a suburban apartment with a commute you have a better chance of finding a duplex where the entire mortgage payment is only the $ 1000 that you pay in rent   your half of the duplex wo n't be as nice as your apartment is and you 'll have a half hour or hour long commute every morning and the same to get home in the evening   but on strictly fiscal terms you 'll be doing about as well   plus you have the income from the other half   so even if your mortgage payment is more than your rent payment you can still break even if the rent covers it    consider a $ 1400 mortgage and $ 400 in rent from the other half after property management fees   so long as nothing goes wrong you break even   perhaps the agreement is that your parents take care of things going wrong broken appliances troublesome tenants time between tenants   or perhaps you drain your emergency fund and adjust your 401(k payment down to the minimum when that happens   once your emergency fund is replenished restore the 401(k    if you 're willing to live in what 's essentially a $ 500 apartment you can do better this way   of course you can also do better by living in a $ 500 apartment and banking the other $ 500 that you spend on rent   plus you now have the expenses of a commute and five hours less free time a week    you describe yourself as essentially living paycheck to paycheck   you have adequate savings but no building excess   whatever you get paid you immediately turn around and spend   your parents may view you as profligate   your apartment is nicer than their early apartments were   you go out more often   you 're not putting anything aside for later except retirement    it did n't use to be at all strange for people to move out of the city because they needed more space   for the same rent they were paying in the city they could buy a house in the suburbs   then they 'd build up equity   so long as they stayed in roughly the same work location they did n't need to move until they were ready to upgrade their house    the duplex plan leads to one of two things   either you sell the duplex and use the equity to buy a nicer regular house or you move out of the duplex and rent your half   now you have a rental property providing income   and if you saved enough for a down payment you can still buy a regular house    from your parents perspective encouraging you to buy a duplex may be the equivalent of asking you to cut back on spending   rather than reducing your 401(k deposits they may be you trading in your car for a cheaper one and trading in your nice but expensive apartment for something more reasonable in a cheaper neighborhood   rather than working with a property management company you 'll be out doing rather than with your friends   and maybe the new place would have more space to share when you meet someone you are n't going to provide many grandkids alone    if you get a mortgage on a duplex you are responsible for paying the mortgage   you are responsible even if something happens to the house   for example if a fire burns it down or a takes it away   or you just find that the house is n't solid enough to support that party where all of your friends are jumping up and down to the latest pop sensation   so beyond losing whatever you invest in the property you may also lose what you borrowed    now consider what happens if you invest the same amount of money in general motors as in the house   let 's call that $ 10,000 and give the house a value of $ 200,000   with general motors even if they go bankrupt tomorrow you 're only out $ 10,000   with the house you 're out $ 200,000   admittedly it 's much hard to lose the entire $ 200,000 value of the house   but even if the house loses $ 80,000 in value you are still $ 70,000 in the hole    you do n't need a disaster for the house to lose $ 80,000 in value   that 's pretty much what happened in the 2006 2010 period   people were losing all of what they invested in houses plus having to declare bankruptcy to get out of the excess debt   of course if they had been able to hold on until 2015 markets mostly recovered   but if you lost your job in 2008 they would n't let you not make mortgage payments until you got a new one in 2012    when you declare bankruptcy you do n't just lose the house   you also lose all your emergency savings and may lose some of your belongings    there are some pretty disasters too   for example you and your tenant both go away for a weekend   it rains heavily and your roof starts to leak due to weak maintenance so not covered by insurance   the house floods destroying all the electronics and damaging various other things   bad enough if it 's just you but you 're also responsible for the tenant 's belongings   they sue you for $ 20,000 and they move out   so no rent and big expenses   to get the house livable again is going

everything here is yours and can be rolled into your new plan or ira you can generally move your 403(b assets into your traditional ira or into your new employer 's plans assuming your new employer 's plan allowing incoming roll overs   you can probably roll your pension out as well actually the right person to ask about this is the company with whom you have your ira   the easiest and best way to get assets from one tax sheltered account to another is by contacting the company you want to roll into and having them take care of everything for you

international wires using swift are reliable way of getting funds the issue could be because you are not giving the right details to your counterparty any incorrect details on wires would get it rejected the timelines typically would be around 2 4 days depending on various things there are alternatives like getting a paper check mailed to you and you cash it this takes more time or depending on which countries you operate in there could be special remittance services

while i totally agree with you talking to free market people you have to address it this way    their point is that they should pay what the market bears not what you want to make   that is fair     but that market has shown they need to pay more but they ca n't do it      roofing is a perfect example    charge $ 6000 for a roof materials cost $ 2000    labor costs $ 800    the rest is additional expenses and profit   even if you have to give your roofers a 25 raise that is $ 200   you are n't going out of business even if you have to absorb the increase and you ca n't tell me you ca n't raise your prices by $ 200 when your competitors are all over the board   i guarantee that if the cost of shingles go up the cost of a roof is raised no second thought    the problem is that they think their competitors are still paying the old rate   they are no longer competitive if they give a raise they are no longer competitive

even if you expect to work you might not be able to due to health reasons or economic factors that make it difficult to obtain employment so it 's good to have a safety net a pension scheme especially if it 's tax advantaged or there 's a company match can be a useful savings scheme   so even if you 're still working when you reach normal retirement age it provides you with a handy pot of money you can use for travel recreation or whatever as others have mentioned the pension might benefit other family members such as a spouse or children you might change your mind about working until you drop with nhs cuts and austerity you might need the money to supplement whatever care benefits you 're entitled to when you do fall ill in your old age

to answer your precise question your plans are not at all misguided and are in fact very reasonable you are clearly financially very comfortable and from the tone of your post it sounds like you value security and simplicity over maximizing your investment return over the coming years   if money was the most important thing to you then you would stay to your high paying jobs @joetaxpayer 's answer has some great information for a person who is interested in maximizing their investment return   if you followed that advice you might increase your return on investments by up to i 'm just throwing a ball park number out there so your choice is simple   peace of mind on one hand and perhaps 1 additional return on investments on the other hand

when a question is phrased this way i.e. for tax purposes i 'm compelled to advise do n't let the tax tail wag the investing dog   in theory one can create a loss up to the $ 3 k and take it against ordinary income when sold the gains may be long term and be at a lower rate in reality if you are out of the stock for the required 30 days it will shoot up in price if you double up as littleadv correctly offers it will drop over the 30 days and negate any benefit the investing dog 's water bowl is half full

investing in the stock market early is a good thing   however it does have a learning curve and that curve can and eventually will cost you one basic rule in investing is that risk and reward are proportional   the greater the reward the higher the risk that you either a wo n't get the reward or b lose your money instead   given that do n't invest money you ca n't afford to lose you mentioned you 're on a student budget if you want to start with short but investments try finding a high interest savings account or cd   for example the bank i use has an offer where the first $ 500 in your account gets ~6 interest certainly not bad if you only put $ 500 in the account   unfortunately most banks are offering a pittance for savings rates or cds if you 're willing to take more risk you could certainly put money into the stock market   before you do i would recommend spending some time learning about how the stock market works it 's flows and and how stock valuations work   do n't buy a stock because you hear about it a lot understand why that stock is being valued as such   also consider buying index funds such as spy which is like a stock but tracks an entire index   that way if a specific company suddenly drops you wo n't be nearly as affected   on the flip side if only 1 company goes up but the market goes down you 'll miss out   but consider the odds of having picked that 1 company

anything related to the central bank will have a large impact as they are the ones who determine interest rates and interest rates have a big effect on currency flows   gdp is also important as when there is an economic slowdown it may result in the central bank reducing rates to boost economic activity the opposite is also true large increases in gdp may mean that an interest rate hike might be needed inflation data is also very important again large changes in inflation either way may push the central bank towards changing rates this data typically is in the form of cpi note that each central bank is different they all have specific mandates and specific pieces of economic data that they place emphasis on the federal reserve as of late has closely been watching inflation data especially wage inflation data and employment significant deviations in these data points from what s expected by investors can greatly move the market however these specific factors are a little less important for say mexico which is mostly concerned with headline inflation read the statements issued by the central banks to find out what s important to them central banks also issue expectations for things like growth cpi etc if these expectations are not met it may result in a policy change or at least talk of a policy change at the next meeting of the central bank anticipating these policy changes and trading accordingly is one strategy to be a profitable forex trader also there are several forex news calendars online that indicate what is likely to be high impact news these can be helpful starting out

you bought a rental property in 2001 hopefully you paid fair value else other issues come into play   say you paid $ you said you have been taking depreciation which for residential real estate is taken over 27.5 years so you are about halfway through since you do n't depreciate land you may have taken a total $ 50 k so far   with no improvements and no transaction costs you have $ 50 k in depreciation recapture taxed at a maximum 25 or your lower marginal rate and a cap gain of the 5 10 k you mentioned either can be offset by losses you 've been carrying forward if you suffered large stock losses at some point

gt;so where is all the money i mean labor has been produced to make things and wages paid to the laborers the things are purchased by other laborers who were paid for producing goods or services etc it 's a closed loop right    almost right the problem is that the wages paid to the laborers are not high enough to buy all the goods produced so there is constant overproduction and at the same time there are people who would want to buy these goods but ca n't afford them some people lose their jobs which reduces demand for goods even further it 's a vicious circle and loses in the long run

i 'm not going to tackle the 2nd part of your question as any number of the questions tagged with international transfer should cover you on that there 's no way to transfer an isa into an australian tax free savings account so no need to worry about anything special there do n't forget that the fx rates change quite a bit over time and different methods have varying fees so moving at the wrong time could easily cost you more than the missed interest for the first part it depends one thing you should seriously consider right away is switching your isa money into one paying a better rate check the best buy tables online or in a paper as you can get a lot better than 0.1 on a transfer in even with current depressed rates at least that way you 'll earn more interest while you decide as for when to transfer that 's something you 'll have to calculate for yourself based on your marginal tax rate and your view of how the fx rates will shift if you 're a 40 taxpayer then 2 in an isa is worth the same to you as 3.3 gross do n't forget to consider both your uk and australian tax rates in the year you move as most likely you 'll have to pay the higher of the two the westpac rate looks like you might struggle to beat a decent isa over the course of a year were you a higher rate tax payer oh and do n't forget that you 'll likely loose the tax free status of your isa once you 're an australian tax resident so you 'll need to start paying tax on interest in the isa once you 're out there

does your town not have atms at alternative locations   or grocery stores or corner stores with debit card with cash back options the bank of gamestop method seems like a bad idea   gamestop might easily shut you off from doing and should if you do this more than a few times   and you 'd certainly hit their fraud detection algorithms even though you 're not really defrauding them you 're actually helping them out by giving them interest free loans it looks like you 're a serial if you find yourself in need of cash at times when grocery stores are n't available well talk to your wife perhaps or find a location not a mattress to store a small amount of emergency cash
