in general   what does this mean assume 10 holidays and 2 weeks of vacation so you will report to the office for 240 days 48 weeks 5 days a week   if you are a w2 they will pay you for 260 days 52 weeks 5 days a week at $ 48 per hour you will be paid 260 8 48 or $ as a 1099 you will be paid 240 8 50 or 96,000 but you still have to cover insurance the extra part of social security and your retirement through an ira a rule of thumb i have seen with government contracting is that if the employee thinks that they make per year the company has to bill x hour to pay for wages benefits overhead and profit if the employee thinks they make x hour the company has to bill at 2x hour when does a small spread make sense the insurance is covered by another source your spouse or government military retirement program   still $ 2 per hour wo n't cover the 6.2   for social security let alone the other benefits the irs has a checklist to make sure that a 1099 is really a 1099 not just a way for the employer to shift the costs onto the individual
# 234436
another thing to consider however is the deductibility of business expenses   let 's assume that the employer can legitimately hire you as a 1099 contractor   would you be able to would you have a high degree of control over when you worked and when you did n't   these factors also affect whether you 're a true independent 1099 contractor or not   as a legit 1099 contractor you 're able to deduct certain business expenses directly from your income you can find a list of the rules at irs.gov   as a w2 employee by contrast can deduct only business expenses that exceed 2 of the your agi adjusted gross income   so you also have to consider your personal circumstances in making the calculus and comparing whether a legitimate 1099 contractor job is or is not good for you   it 's not just a comparison of what they 'd pay w2 employees versus what they 'd pay 1099 contractors
# 77245
careful   i would personally need a lot more than $ 5 more per hour to go from w-2 employment to 1099 employment   it boils down to two reasons 1 employers pay a huge amount of taxes on behalf of their employees and 2 you would have to pay all of your own withholding up front your current proposal from them does n't account for that there are also risks that you face as a 1099   on the first item your employer currently pays 6.2 of your social security tax you pay the other 6.2 if you go to 1099 status you will be self employed as an independent contractor and have to pay the full 12.4 out of your increased 1099 wages   on the second item your employer also does your withholding out of your paychecks based on what you tell them on a form w-4 if you 're disciplined enough to pay this out yourself in estimated taxes every time you get a paycheck great many people are n't and just see a much bigger paycheck with no taxes out of it and end up with a large tax bill at the end of the year   overall there are some other considerations like healthcare and other benefits these will not be available to you as a 1099 employee you can also be terminated unless you have a specific contract length with the company   as i see it not including any benefits you would receive you 're looking at less money in your pocket at $ as a contractor than at your $ your pay net social security deductions is $ 48 x 40 hrs x 52 weeks = = as a 1099 $ you would net $ 50 x 40 hrs x 52 weeks = =   then there are the rest of taxes etc to figure out your real take home pay   i 'm not a tax advisor but i would be very careful to get the whole picture figured out before jumping i would ask for a lot more with the added risk you would take as an independent too
# 394871
in general that 's illegal if you 're a w2 employee you do n't miraculously become a 1099 contractor just because they pay you more if your job does n't change then your status does n't change just because they give you a raise they can be sued by you and by the irs for that other issues have already been raised by other respondents just wanted to point out this legal perspective

to explain the capital gains part of the question non qualified stock options are always treated like earned income and have payroll taxes withheld it 's advantageous for the company to issue these because they can deduct them as expenses just as they do your salary articles talking about capital gains would probably be referring to incentive stock options isos or possibly even restricted stock units rsus if you were granted the option to buy the stock and/or hold it for a period of time then the stock options could be treated as capital gains short term gains if you held them for less than a year and long term gains if you held them for more than a year this payment for your is exactly like a cash bonus the withholding follows the same guidelines you may wish to look at what this will mean for your annual salary and adjust your w-4 withholding up or down as appropriate depending on whether the 25 federal withholding rate is more or less than what you think your final marginal rate will be with this bonus included in your annual salary

there is no tax code i know that would grant you such a privilege and it just is n't in your examples you always sold your product and were thus able in retrospect to give a value to your work what if you do n't sell your product what if in one case your worked hour is reimbursed with one price with the next product at another i.e. difference in margin no it wo n't work like that   and by the way i think you might have got some definitions upside down what you want is a salary that your own company pays out to yourself and you can deduct from other profits but as long as you ca n't afford to pay yourself a salary and you do n't have access to investors who are willing to front you the money the time invested is your personal investment and can not be deducted anywhere though it might pay off nicely in the long run that 's the risk entrepreneurs take

there are two scenarios to determine the relevant date and then a couple of options to determine the relevant price if the stocks were purchased in your name from the start then the relevant date is the date of the purchase if the stocks were willed to you i.e. you inherited them then the relevant date is the date at which the person who willed them to you had died you can check with the company if they have records of the original purchase if it was in street name they may not have such records and then you need to figure out what broker it was to hold them once you   figured out the relevant date contact the company 's investor relationships contact and ask them for the adjusted stock price on that date adjusted for splits mergers acquisitions whatever that would be the cost basis per share you would be using alternatively you can research historical prices on your favorite financial information site google yahoo bloomberg or the stock exchange where the company is listed if you can not figure the cost basis or it costs too much you can just write cost basis as $ 0 and claim the whole proceeds as gains you 'll pay capital gains tax on the whole amount but that may end up being cheaper than conducting the investigation to reveal the actual numbers

generally no   a mortgage is a lien against the property which allows the bank to exercise certain options primarily power of sale force you to sell the property and outright seizure    in order to do this title needs to be clear which it is n't if you have half title however if you have a sales agreement you can buy your brother 's half and then mortgage the entire property   this happens all the time   when you buy a house from someone you get pre approved for that house which at the time you have no title to    through some black magic and this is all sorted out at closing time

edit new ideas based on the full story i would n't worry about the price history   while it is certainly true that some buyers might try to leverage that information against you the bottom line is the price is the price   both the buyer and the seller have to agree    if the initial listing was too high then lower the price   if that is n't low enough then readjust down   i see no harm in moving the price down over time repeatedly   in fact i thin that is a good tactic to getting the most for the house   if you happen to have the luxury of time then keep lowering that price until it sells   do n't fret how that behavior appears you can lower the price as often as you like until it sells   i am not a real estate agent and i am a terrible negotiator but i would lower the price every quarter until it sells   you ca n't go down to fast a buyer might wait you out and you ca n't wait to long as you stated   also if you house is priced inline with the neighborhood you can at least get offers and negotiate buy asking for such a premium 25 folks might not even make an offer you simply need to decide what is more important the selling price or the time frame in getting it sold if you house does n't sell because the market does n't support your price then consider keeping it as a rental   you can do it yourself or if you are not interested in that large amount of work then hire a rental management company to do it for a fee renting a home is hard work and requires attention to detail a good amount of your time and much labor   if you just need to wait a couple of years before selling renting it can be a good option to cover your costs while you wait for the market to reach you you should get advice on how to handle the money how to rent it how to deal with renters and the the laws are in your jurisdiction rent it out to a trusted friend or family member for a steal of a deal   they save money and you get the luxury of time waiting for the sale with a real estate lawyer you hire get a contract for a lease option or owner finance deal on the house   sometimes you can expand the market of people looking to buy your house   if you have a willing purchaser will bad credit you can be doing them a favor and solving your own issue   it costs money and you will make less on the sale but it could be better than nothing take heed there is a reason some people can not get a traditional loan on their own   before you extend your good name or credit think about it   it is another hassle for sure this wo n't help if you have to pay off a mortgage but you could donate it   this is another tricky deal that you really need to speak with a lawyer who specialize in charitable giving   there are tax benefits but i would make any kind of a deal where tax deductions are the only benefit this is common enough these days   if you are unable to pay for the mortgage it benefits you and the bank to get into a short sale arrangement   they bank gets probably more money than if they have to foreclose and they save money on legal fees and you can get rid of the obligation you will do a deed in lieu or the short sale depending on how the market it and what the house can be sold for   you and the bank will have to work it out this will ruin for a credit for a while and you will not likely qualify to get a new mortgage for at least a few years you can stop paying your mortgage tell the bank and they will foreclose   this is going to ruin your credit for a long time as well as disqualify you from mortgages in the near future   do n't do this   if you are planning a foreclosure take the time to contact your bank and arrange a short sale or a deed in lieu   there is n't really any excuse to go into foreclosure if you are having problems   talk to the bank and work out a deal

credit cards are a golden goose for banks as they get to issue high interest loans and simultaneously generate alot of fee income debit cards are n't quite as good but they still generate substantial fee income ~2 of every credit non pin debit transaction goes to the bank and credit card network credit histories exist because they are the most effective tool available to predict whether you will pay back your loans or not you do n't need a credit history to buy most things you need a credit history to get a large loan think of it from perspective of a lender credit scoring is the bank 's way screening out people who are expensive to do business with it 's objective does n't discriminate on the basis of race sex or other factors and you have recourse if the rating agencies have incorrect information

let 's think like a real estate developer first you need to check with the zoning commission the restrictions for the area let 's say that the plot is actually suitable for 10 homes you buy the land you also need to finance the build itself if you do n't have enough cash you need to acquire financing from banks and perhaps from other sources as well because banks wo n't loan you the entire amount   next you need to divide the plot into 10 pieces making sure that each piece has driveway access to the street and plan access to utilities water sewer electricity broadband phone lines plan the size and position of each house get building approval this is a process that can take some time especially if they have follow up questions get a builder to build the houses including ground work and preparation for utilities get approval for the finished houses a building inspector will check that the houses follow the permission and all laws and regulations that apply this step can entail time and added cost   get a real estate agent to sell the new homes often the selling process starts in the planning phase and early buyers are able to influence both the layout of the house and the finish your cost estimate included a profit of 140k for each house from that a builder needs to subtract financing costs real estate agent costs any costs that you forgot to factor in budget overdrafts contingency costs and salaries for your staff and yourself i estimate the project time to 1.5 2 years so we have an $ 8 m project with a gross profit of $ 1.4 m not including all costs net profit probably just a few hundred thousand or less   real estate developers with local knowledge would be able to make a much more accurate estimate on both time and cost my guess is that they have and since the plot has n't sold in a while either the price is at the upper end of what makes a profitable project or there are other restrictions that limit the number size of homes that can be built on it

you do realize there is such a thing as price which is what the market tend to however a single private individual can set any price on anything that does n't mean it sells though   believe it or not overproduction of electricity is a problem power lines get when that happens they need to turn the costs down to negative so people consume it instead of it damaging infrastructure hence negative cost because at that moment people wish there were less solar panels not more   also my comments were basically a joke i do n't know how you did n't realize that lol

i can just get the exact same mortgage in a 30-year version and just pay it off within whatever year window i choose this is an assumption which often does not come true the advantage of a 15 year mortgage is you hopefully never decide you want more toys or to go out to eat and suddenly your mortgage takes 30 years to pay off instead of 15 plus if i get a 30-year mortgage then i have a cushion in case i run into major financial hardship that same cushion can turn into other luxuries maybe you want new furniture i wo n't pay extra on the mortgage this year suddenly it 's year 22 this is not a 100 guarantee by any means but it is something which is relatively likely yet everywhere i look i see people online going on about how unwise 30-year mortgages are i read a lot of online financial resources and almost never see this claim

in my mind its not the same    if growth is stock value then this is incorrect because of compound interest in stock price $ 100 stock price after one year would be $ 105 and a dividend would be $ 2 next year the stock would be   $ compound interest and would the dividend really go up in lock step with the stock price well probably not but if it did then maybe you could call it the same even if the dollars are the same the growth rate is more variable than the dividends so its valuable to segregate the two i am open to criticism my answer is based on my personal experience and would love to hear contrary positions on this

no it means that is only the notional value of that underlying asset of that contract generally the contract specification itself is listed on the exchange 's websites and there are really no assumptions you can make about a particular contract where s&p futures have one set of specifications such as what it actually represents how many each contract holds how to price profits and losses a different contract such as ftse 100 stock futures have a completely different set of specifications anyway in this one example the s&p 500 futures contract has an initial margin of $ meaning that is how much it would cost you to establish that contract futures generally require delivery of 1,000 units of the underlying asset so you would take the underlying asset 's price and multiple it by 1,000 what price you use is also mentioned in the contract specification the s&p 500 index   is $ you mentioned so on you would have to delivery $ x 1000 or $ great news you only have to put up 1.2 in principal to control a 1.5 million dollar asset although if even that amount is too great you can look at the e mini s&p futures which require about 1/10th the capital and delivery this answer required that a lot of different subjects be mentioned so feel free to ask a new question about the more specific topics

i am sorry for your troubles   presumably you are feeling better which is the best possible outcome   you project that you are an honest person and desire to seek a fair outcome although you were mistreated   the insurance company should have paid a good portion of this bill because of this situation you will learn a valuable lesson   namely that collectors are scum   they lie and manipulate to do their job   they are trying to generate an emotional reaction out of you so you give in an put this bill on a credit card   do not fear them my advice would be to ignore them   you can educate yourself on collections law in your state   they can not call you at work and they probably can not call you on a cell phone   they will threaten to garnish your wages tax return and take away your birthday   just do n't talk to them when you can save up some money   once you have like $ 1200 attempt to settle in full for that amount   get it in writing ahead of time and do not give them access to your checking account   use a cashiers check or prepaid visa that you then throw away   if they say no do not argue hang up and call back when you have 1300   rinse wash repeat    there is a decent chance that they have already violated some form of collections law   if you have proof you can call the company 's legal department and provide that proof   you can then settle on having your collections waived   in summary this also presumes you have a household income   if you make like 70 k pay the bill   i doubt that is the case though

ex date is a function of the exchange as well as the dividend consider deutsche bank ag db on the nyse on xetra for a given dividend each exchange sets the ex date for trades on that exchange   see for a description of how it works in the us other exchanges countries are similar this ex date is normally based on the dividends record date which is when you must be on the company 's books as a shareholder to receive the dividend and based on when trades for an exchange are settled the ex date is the first date for which trades on that date will not settle until after the record date this means that the ex date can be different for different exchanges if you sell your shares on an exchange before the ex date for that exchange you will not get the dividend if you sell your shares on or after the ex date for the exchange you do not get the dividend so it depends on the time zone of the exchange most stock exchanges trade t+3 but this can still come into play if there are bank holidays in different countries at different times

the main question is how much money you want to make   with every transaction you   should calculate the real price as the price plus costs for example if you but 10 stock of £ 100 each and the transaction cost is £ 20 then the real cost of buying a single share is in fact buying price of stock + broker costs amount bought or £ 104 in this case   now you want to make a profit so calculate your desired profit margin you want to receive a sales price of buying price + profit margin + broker costs amount bought suppose that you 'd like 5 then you 'll need the price per stock of my example to increase to 100 + 5 + £ 40 10 = £ 109   so you it only becomes worth while if you feel confident that 's stock   will rise to that level read the yearly balance of that company to see if they do n't have any debt and are profitable look at their dividend earning history study the stock 's candle graphs of the last ten years or so to find out if there 's no seasonal effects and if the stock performs well overall get to know the company well you should only buy shares after doing your homework   but what about switching to another stock of actually it does n't matter since it 's best to separate transactions sell your 's stock when it has reached the desired profit margin or if it seems it is underperforming cut your losses make the calculations for 's shares without reference to 's and decide like that if it 's worth while to buy

it 's been a short while since i sold on ebay but i had a feedback rating of about 4,500 so i 've done a lot of transactions the trump card is and always will be the buyer 's ability to contact their credit card company and reverse the charges   paypal has no policy to stop this even though they claim to vigorously defend sellers from chargebacks on their website   you will lose this case 100 of the time   i do n't see how that will change if you have your own terminal   the buyer can still reverse the charges   since you know the card number maybe you can contact his credit card company but it 's probably not going to do much i 've found paypal is more seller friendly in terms of paypal claims   for example the customer has a duty to pay postage to return the product and that 's a cost for him   you also have things like online tracking which shows delivery and paypal has an ip log to see where the payments are coming from   that helped me when a buyer claimed that someone else made the payment   because people often break into someone 's house and make paypal payments for them heh you really just need to use paypal   you 'll get more customers and better prices and it will offset the losses from scammers   also about 99 of buyers are honest people   consider the scammers a cost of doing business and keep making money off of the good buyers   if you 're just pissed off that people actually scammed you get over it   do n't cut off your nose to spite your face   it 's just part of doing business on ebay

disclaimer i do n't work in the finance industry and simply took a few classes in corporate finance and management during my undergrad   it depends on what type of investing you 're talking about if you 're talking about building a portfolio of securities then capm is the basis for most valuation models generally capm will have you discount based on your best available risk free rate usually t bills or some other fixed income source with a reliable even after your valuation the basic theory of risk management for an investment portfolio is still to maintain a diverse basket of poorly correlated products   if you 're talking about corporate finance where a firm is considering an investment such as a new project then a determining a wacc and using it as a discount rate for your cash flow is a basic strategy    this is a basic strategy but there are better ones depending on the specifics of the investment this is where evaluating exposures is important to hedge counterparty risk you might discount by the estimated probability of non payment or buy trade insurance to hedge currency risk you might buy forwards options or look into a money market hedge to hedge political risks like repatriation or changes in tax laws or regulation you might buy political risk insurance to hedge exposure to a particular commodity price you can trade futures

if you make $ 10 in salary $ 5 in interest on savings and $ 10 in dividends your income is $ 25 not $ 10 if you have a billion dollars in well invested assets you can take a loan against those assets and the interest payment on the loan will be smaller than the interest you earn on the assets that means your investment will grow faster than your debt and you have a net positive gain it makes no sense to do this if the value of your asset is static in that case you would be better off just to withdraw from the asset and spend it directly since a loan against that static asset will result in you spending your asset plus interest charges if you have a good enough rate of return on your investment you may actually be able to do this in perpetuity taking out loan after loan making the loan payments from the loan proceeds while the value of your original asset pool continues to grow at any given time though a severe downturn in the market could potentially leave you with large debts and insufficient value in your assets to back the debt if that happens you wo n't be getting another loan and the merry go round will stop spinning it 's a bit of a ponzi scheme in a way the u.s. government has done exactly this for a long time and has gotten away with it because the dollar has been the world 's reserve currency you could always get a loan against the value of the u.s. currency in the past those days may be dwindling with more countries choosing alternative currencies to conduct business with and the dollar becoming comparatively weaker into the foreseeable future if you have savings you can spend more than you make which will put you into debt then you can draw down your savings to pay that debt and at the end of the month you will be out of debt but have less in savings you can not do this forever eventually you run out of savings if you have no savings you immediately go into debt and stay there when you spend more than you make this is simple arithmetic if you have no savings but you own assets real estate securities a collection of never opened beatles vinyl records a bicycle then you could spend more than you make and be in debt but have the potential to liquidate assets to pay off all or part of the debt this depends on finding a buyer and negotiating a price that helps you enough to make a real difference if you have a car and you owe $ 10 on it but you can only find a buyer willing to pay $ 8 for the car that does n't help you unless you can refinance the $ 2 and your new payment amount is lower than the old payment amount but then you 're still $ 2 in debt on the car even though you no longer possess it and you 've still increased your debt by spending more than you made if you stay on this path sooner or later you will not have any assets left and you will be in debt plain and simple as a wrinkle in the concrete example let 's say you have stock options with your employer this is a form of a call you could also purchase a call through a broker in the stock market or for a commodity in the futures market that means you pay up front for the right to buy a specific amount of an asset at a fixed price usually with an expiration date you do n't own the stock you just have the right to buy it at the call price regardless of the current market value when you buy it in the case of employee stock options your upfront cost is in the form of a vesting schedule you have to remain employed for a set time before a specific number of stocks become eligible for you to purchase at your option price the stocks vest on a certain date remain employed longer and more stocks may vest depending on your contract if you quit or are terminated before that date you forfeit your options if you stick around through your vesting schedule you pay real money to buy the stock at your option price it only makes sense to do this if the market value of the stock is higher than your option price if the current market value is lower than your option price you 're better off just buying the asset at the current market value or waiting and   hoping that the value increases before your contract expires you could drive yourself into debt by spending more than you make but still have a chance to eliminate your debt by exercising your call option and then re selling the asset if it is worth more than what you pay for it but you may have to wait for a vesting period to before you can exercise your option depending on the nature of your contract during this waiting period you are in debt and if you ca n't service your debt i.e. make payments acceptable to your creditors your things could get repossessed oh do n't forget that you 'll also pay a brokerage fee to sell the asset after you exercise your option further if you have exhausted your savings and nobody will give you a loan to exercise your stock or futures options then in the end you would be even further in debt because you already paid for the call but you are unable to capitalize it and you 'll lose what you already paid if you can get a loan to exercise your option but you 're a bad credit risk chances are good that the lender will draft a contract requiring you to immediately pay back the loan proceeds plus a fee out of the proceeds of re selling the stock or other asset in fact the lender might even draft a contract assigning ownership of your options to them and stipulating that they 'll pay you what 's left after they subtract their fee even if you can get a traditional loan you will pay interest over time the end result is that your debt has still cost you very real money beyond the face value of the debt finally if the asset for which you have a call has decreased in value lower than the current market value you would be better off buying it directly in the market instead of exercising your option but you 'll pay transaction fees to do that and the entire action would be pure speculation or investment but not an immediate means to pay off your debt unless you have reliable insider trading information but then you risk running afoul of the law frankly it might be better to get a loan to pay off your debt than to buy an investment hoping the value will increase unless you could guarantee that the return on your investment would be bigger than the cumulative interest and late fees on your debt or the risk of repossession of your belongings remember that nothing you owe a debt on is actually yours not your house not your car not your bicycle not your smartphone most of the time your best course of action is to make minimum payments on your lowest interest debts and make extra payments on your highest interest debt up to the highest total payment you can tolerate set something aside in a rainy day fund just in case as you pay off the highest interest debt shift the amount you were paying on that debt to make extra payments on your next highest interest debt until that one is paid off and repeat on down the line until you 're out of debt then live within your means so that you do n't find yourself working at mcdonald 's because you do n't have a choice when you 're in your 80 's

is right all shares are owned by someone   depending on the company they can be closely held so that nobody wants to sell at a given time   this can cause the price people are offering to rise until someone sells   that trade will cause an adjustment in the ticker price of that stock   supply and demand at work   berkshire hathaway is an example of this   the number of shares is low the demand for them is high the price per share is high

a stock exchange is a marketplace where people can bring their goods shares to be traded there are certain rules stock exchange does not own any shares of the companies that are trading in   the list of who owns with stock is with the registrar of each company the electronic shares are held by a financial institution securities depository so even if the exchange itself goes down you still hold the same shares as you had before it went down one would now have to find ways to trade these shares possibly via other stock exchange this leaves the question of transactions which again would be recorded and available think of it similar to ebay what happens when ebay goes bankrupt nothing much all the seller still have their goods with them all the buyers who had purchased good before have it when them so the question remains on goods where the buyer has paid the seller and not yet received shipments

is there any way for me to get my money bank it would be a long drawn process you would have to file a fraud complaint they should be able to catch the and or get a freeze on the account you did wire transfer on even courts would be involved in process could take lot of time and money depending on the amount it may or may not be worth it if so should i talk to my bank your bank will not take any liability from their point of view you deposited a check they sent it get cleared and reversed the transaction moment they realized it was fraud the vendor 's bank you could talk to vendor bank however as you have no relationship with them they may or may not co operate if its a large institution they may do their own internal investigations if you act sooner they maybe able to place a hold on the account often this is a parking account and the funds are moved elsewhere they will not be able to refund the funds unless the legal system process is involved bank that the fraudulent check came from depending on how the check was made the bank can easily claim that someone printed something with their bank 's name on it and they are not responsible for it if there are large cases the bank may to contain damage may lodge a complaint with police and put out some advertisement

one way to start with stocks is by playing the fake stock market   investigate what trading fees would be with a broker then invest a certain amount of money note it on paper or in a spreadsheet   follow your stocks make decisions on selling and buying and see where you would be after a year or so   that way you can get an idea even if not exactly precise on what your returns would be if you really invested the money

i was wondering why equity is reflecting ownership of the issuing entity   that is the definition of equity in this regard my understanding is that for a stock equity its issuing entity is a company firm that sells the stock equity while its receiving entity is an investor that buys the stock equity correct equity reflects ownership of the receiving entity i.e. investor incorrect equity reflects ownership by the receiving entity of the issuing entity that is when you buy stock in a company taking an equity stake in the company you buy a piece of the company   it would be rather odd for the company to own a piece of you when you buy their stock

from paul and mike of the 101 years of global investment returns princeton princeton university press 2002 the small firm effect has not proved the road to    great riches since soon after its discovery the us size premium went    into reverse this was repeated in the united kingdom and virtually    all other markets around the world despite their disappointing performance in recent years the very    long run record of small caps remains one of outperformance in both    the united states and the united kingdom furthermore and    small size companies are still an important asset class their    differential performance over long periods of history shows that there    is useful scope for investors to reduce risk by diversifying across    the large and the small capitalization sectors of the market    furthermore given the of the size effect across the    entire size spectrum it is important to all investors since the    size tilt of any portfolio will strongly influence its short- and    long run performance this holds true whether there is a size premium    or a size discount the size effect has certainly proved persistent    and robust what is at issue is whether we should continue to expect a    size premium over the longer haul and accompanying charts     and one chart from blackrock

there is no unique identifier that exists to identify specific shares of a stock just like money in the bank there is no real reason to identify which exact dollar bills belong to me or you so long as there is a record that i own x bills and i can access them when i want of course unlike banks there is still a 1:1 relationship between the amount i should own and the amount they actually hold if i may reach a bit the question that i assume you are asking is how are shared actually tracked transferred and recorded so that i know for certain that i traded you 20 microsoft shares yesterday and they are now officially yours given that it 's all digital while you can technically try and request a physical share certificate it 's very cumbersome to handle and transfer in that form   ownership of shares themselves are tracked for brokerage firms in the case of retail trading which i assume is the context of this question as we 're discussion personal finance your broker has a record of how many shares of x y and z you own when you bought each share and for how much and while you are the beneficial owner of record you get dividends voting rights etc your brokerage is the one who is holding the shares when you buy or sell a stock and you are matched with a counterparty the process of which is beyond the scope of this question then a process of settlement comes into play in the us settlement takes 3 working days to process and technically ownership does not transfer until the 3rd day after the trade is made though things like margin accounts will allow you to effectively act as if you own the shares immediately after a buy sell order is filled settlement in the us is done by a sole source the depository trust clearing corporation this is where retail and institutional trade all go to be sorted checked and confirmed and ultimately returned to the safekeeping of their new owners representatives your brokerage interestingly the is also the central custodian for shares both physical and virtual and that is where the shares of stock ultimately reside

if you do n't use leverage you ca n't lose more than you invested because you play with your own money but even with leverage when you reach a certain limit maintenance margin you will receive a margin call from your broker to add more funds to your account if you do n't comply with this meaning you do n't add funds the broker will liquidate some of the assets in this case the currency and it will restore the balance of the account to meet with his her maintenance margin at least this is valid for assets like stocks and derivatives hope it helps edit i should mention that

the catch is in the premium amount you pay in a pure term insurance there is no survival benefit you get paid only for the event i.e. when you die during the policy term the sum assured is paid to your nominee the money back on the other hand charges a huge premium typically 5x more than the pure term part of it is for the risk cover the balance is then invested in safe instruments and at the end if you survive you would get that money typical calculations would show that if you had yourself invested the difference in premium even in cd 's you would get much more money back the reason this product is available in the market is more of people can not part with money when they do n't get anything back to these vast majority it looks like insurance company is taking all their money and does n't give them back if they survive hence to make it seem better to these vast majority there is money back hence people all over the world buy these policy much more than a pure term policy

if you even qualify for a no down payment usda loan which i 'm not sure you would it would be extremely risky to take on a $ 250 k house loan and have near zero equity in the house for a good while if property values drop at all you are going to be stuck in that house which likely has a pretty high monthly payment insurance taxes hoa fees maintenance costs etc   my rule of thumb is that if you ca n't come up with a down payment then you ca n't afford the house especially with that much debt hanging over your head already if one major thing goes wrong with the house roof a c electrical etc you are going to put yourself in a world of hurt with no clear path out of that financial trap my suggestion keep renting until you have enough money for a downpayment even if this means downsizing your price range for houses you are considering

however if you are employed by a company that exists in a tax haven and your services are provided to an employer by that tax haven company it is the tax haven company that gets paid not you under various schemes that company need not pay you at all for example it may make you a loan which is not taxed ie you do n't pay tax on a loan just as you do n't pay tax on the money lent you by a mortgage company you are bound by the terms of the loan agreement to repay that loan at a rate that the company finds acceptable indeed the company may find eventually that it is simply convenient to write off the loan as unrecoverable if the owners officers of he company write off your loans how much tax will you have paid on the money you have had as    loans the taxman can of course state that this was simply set up to avoid tax which is illegal so you should have a balancing scheme to show that that the loans were taken to supplement income just as one might take a bank loan mortgage not replace it entirely as a tax scam hiring tax counsel to provide this adequate proof to hmrc has a price   frequently this kind of loophole exists because the number of people using it were sufficiently low not to warrant policing if the policing costs more than the tax recovered then it is more efficient to ignore it or because at some stage the scheme has been perfectly legal as in the old trust recommended by the government a few decades ago when gordon brown set out a 75 tax rate for his possibly ideological reasons rather than financially based those who had these accounts he encountered opposition from who were going to be caught up paying high tax bills for what was retrospective taxation so there was a built in loophole to allow the funds to be returned without undue penalty   if you think that is morally wrong consider what the response would be if a future was to declare all the work of the devil and claim that retrospective tax would need to be paid on all isa transactions over the last few tot up all the dividends and capital gains made on an isa in any year and pay 40 tax on all of them even if that took the isa into negative territory because the value today was yet this has been as a way of filling in the hole in the budget on the grounds that anyone with an isa can be represented as rich to a selected party of voters

the percentage of gross income is a quick and easy way to arrive at the rough ballpark figure of the mortgage one can afford the net income is something which one does not know if you want to seriously evaluate then most of the standard mortgage calculators will ask you to enter your gross income your other liabilities like auto loan student loan personal loan card payments any other regular payments like child support etc after factoring all these one arrives at the actual mortgage one can afford as is evident the above requires a good amount of calculation and hence the method becomes on the basis of gross income

the bank does n't have to do anything it is your responsibility to provide the proof of insurance it is the agent 's job which you through your hoa dues paid for to provide that proof to you you should n't be registering with they say so in the first sentence on the registration page unit owners do not register here if you own an existing property    and have received a letter from your lender requiring an annual    renewal updated certificate for an association that has recently    expired please forward that letter to to receive    instructions to place your order if your request is a new loan of any    kind please contact your lender and request that they either contact    us to place this order or register below so you can try that route sending an email to and see if it works it does cost money in the range of $ i used a different similar service at the time and they charged $ 75 for this if it does n't you can try and work with the insurance agent there are some ways to persuade them california has very strong traditions of consumer protections in this case i suggest checking out this site let the insurance agent know that as the hoa member they 're working for you and that in the next hoa meeting you will raise a request to change the insurance agency also remind the agent that the ca insurance commission will knock on their doors to ask why they do n't provide you with the proof you need if the hoa management company does n't help you you can remind them that they too can be fired this can be done and is n't even all that hard there 's a lot of competition in the hoa management market and it would n't be too hard to find a new management company the hoa management company should have provided you the proof of coverage when they renewed the policy

it 's not so much pros and cons as much as it is what are your savings goals while it 's best to start early to save money for retirement you may have numerous short- to medium term savings goals school down payment etc here 's a template you can consider i would suggest that you open up an rrsp mutual fund or brokerage account and invest a certain amount that you feel free locking up for the next few decades and investing it in some sort of growth product perhaps look at portfolios using the couch potato strategy then also open up a tfsa mutual fund or brokerage account and use it to invest for medium term goals i.e. 5 10 years invest in products that will allow for some growth but with low chance of losing principle in that time frame what i would n't do is open up a tfsa savings account and use it for day to day savings the tax you save is negligible and you would need to keep track of deposits and withdrawals to ensure that you do n't for the tax year similarly an rrsp savings account or gic is far too conservative at your age imho think of rrsp and tfsa as investment vehicles rather than accounts per se either type allows for you to invest in a vast array of products including mutual funds equities some derivatives gold bonds gics etc   to conclude my view is to use rrsp to invest for conventional retirement goals and use the tfsa to invest for medium term and early retirement goals

they said the expected returns from the stock market are around 7   emphasis added the key word in your quote is expected   on average the market gains in the 7 9 range more if you reinvest dividends but there 's a great deal of risk too meaning that in any given year the market could be down 20 or be   up 30 your student loan on the other hand is risk free   you are guaranteed to pay lose 4 a year in interest   you ca n't directly compare the expected return of a risk free asset with the expected return of a risky asset   you can compare the risks of two assets with equal expected returns and the expected returns of assets with equal risks but you ca n't directly compare returns of assets with different risks   so in two years you might be better off if you had invested the money versus paying the loan or you might be much worse off   in ten years your chances of coming out ahead are better but still not guaranteed what 's confusing is i 've heard that if you 're investing you should be investing in both stocks and bonds since i 'm young i would n't want to put much in bonds though so how would that factor in   bonds have lower risk uncertainty than stocks but lower expected returns   if you invest in both your overall risk is lower since sometimes not always the gain in stocks are offset by losses in bonds   so there is value in diversifying since you can get better expected returns from a diversified portfolio than from a single asset with a comparable amount of risk   however there it no risk free asset that will have a better return than what you 're paying in student loan interest

to sum up my question came from misunderstanding what cost basis applies to now i get it that it applies to stocks as physical entities consider a chain of buys of 40 stock a with prices $ qty 10 each time then irs wants to know exactly which stock i am selling and when i transfer stocks to different account that cost basis transfers with them cost basis is included in transfers so that removes ambiguity which stock is being sold on the original account in the example above cost basis of 20 stocks moved to a new account would probably be $ 1 x 10 and $ 4 x 10 i.e. fifo also applies to transfers

the decision whether this test is or is not met seems to be highly dependent on the specific situation of the employer and the employee   i think that you wo n't find a lot of general references meeting your needs there is such a thing as a private ruling letter where individuals provide specific information about their situation and request the irs to rule in advance on how the situation falls with respect to the tax law   i do n't know a lot about that process or what you need to do to qualify to get a private ruling   i do know that versions of at least some of the rulings are published   you might look for such rulings that are close to your situation i did a quick search and found two that are somewhat related as regards your situation my non expert understanding is that you will not pass in this case unless either a the employer specifies that you must live on the west coast or you 'll be fired b the employer would refuse to provide space for you if you moved to boston or another company location or c you can show that you could not possibly do your job out of boston   for c that might mean for example you need to make visits to client locations in sf on short notice to meet business requirements   if you are only physically needed in sf occasionally and with reasonable notice i do n't think you could make it under c although if the employer does n't want to pay travel costs then you might still make it under a in this case

if you 're worried about volatility and you 're in mostly long positions you should be looking to diversify your portfolio meaning buying some stocks that will do better in a bear market if it 's not already diverse but you should n't be looking to abandon your positions unless you anticipate a short term need for cash   other than that you may want to hold off on the short term positions for a while if you 're concerned about volatility though many traders see volatility as a great time to make money as there is more movement there 's more opportunity to make money from mispriced stocks in both directions   unless you think the market will be permanently down due to these reasons anyway but i do n't see any reason to believe that yet   even world war two was n't enough to permanently hurt the market after all remember that everyone in the market knows what you do   if there were a sure thing that the market was going to crash it already would have conservative positions tend to involve holding onto a well diversified portfolio rather than simply holding onto cash unless the investor is very conservative in which case the portfolio should be cash anyway the fact that you say this is your rainy day fund does make me a little curious though typically rainy day funds are better in cash and not invested since you might hit that rainy day and need cash quickly in which case you could take significant losses if the time is n't right

one thing that has not been pointed out as a disadvantage of using credit cards   people tend to spend more   you can see this study and this one plus about 500 others   on average people tend to spend about 17 more with credit cards then with cash   this amount any perks one gets by having a credit card    the safest way to use one is to only use them for purchases where you can not make a decision to spend more   one example would be for utility bills that do n't charge a fee or at the gas pump using them at amazon might have you upgrade your purchase or add some extra items   using them at restaurants might encourage you to order an extra drink or two   using them at the coffee shop might have you super size your coffee or add a    of course this extra spending could lead you into a debt cycle exacerbating the financial hit many struggle with   please tread carefully if you decide to use them

this is almost a question in financial engineering first i will note that a discussion of the greeks is well presented at these measures are first second and higher order derivatives or rate of change comparisons for information that is generally instantaneous bear with me for example the most popular delta compares prices of an option or other derived asset to the underlying asset price the reason we are able to do all this cool analysis is because the the value of the underlying and derived assets have a direct instantaneous relationship on each other because beta is calculated over a large period of time and because each time slice covered contributes equally to the aggregate then the difference in beta would really just be showing two pieces of information summarizing those two pieces of information into delta beta would not be useful to me for further discussion please see specifically look at the huge difference in calculation of ge 's beta using end of month returns versus calculation using day before end of month returns

like a lot of businesses they win on the averages which means lucrative customers subsidize the money losers   this is par for the course   it 's the health club model   the people who show up everyday are subsidized by the people who never show but are too guilty to cancel when i sent 2 dvds a day to netflix they lost their shirt on me and made it up on the customers who do n't in those free to play actually 95 99 of the players never pay and are carried by the 1 5 who spend significantly   in business thinking the overall marketing cost of acquiring a new customer is pretty big $ 50 to $ 500 on the other side of the credit card they pay $ 600 bounty for new merchant customers there are salesmen who live on converting 2 3 merchants a month    that 's because as a rule customers tend to lock in   that 's why dot lose millions for years giving you a free service   eventually they figure out a revenue model and you stay with it despite the new ads because changing is inconvenient when you want to do a banking transaction they must provide the means to do that   normal banks have the staggering cost of a huge network of branch offices where you can walk in and hand a check to a teller   the whole point of an atm is to reduce the cost of that   chase has 3 staffed locations in my and 6 atms   schwab has 3 locations in my greater metro which contains over 400 if you 're in a one horse town like french lick or detroit no schwab for miles   so for schwab a $ 3 atm fee is n't expensive it 's cheap compared to the cost of serving you any other way there may also be behind the scenes agreements where the bank that charged you $ 3 refunds some of it to schwab after they refund you   it does n't really cost $ 3 to do a foreign atm transaction   most debit cards have a visa or mastercard logo   many places will let you run it as an atm card with a pin entry   however everyone who takes visa mc must take it as a credit card using a signature in that case the merchant pays 2 10 depending on several factors of this about 1.4 goes to the issuing bank   this is meant to cover the bank 's risk of credit card defaults but drawing from a bank account where they can decline if the money is n't there that risk is low so it 's mostly gravy you may find schwab is doing ok on that alone   also do n't use debit cards at any but the most trusted shops unless you fully understand how in fraud situations credit cards and debit cards compare and are comfortable with the increased risks      there are literally dozens of micro fees depending on their volume swipe vs chip atm vs credit rewards cards fixed vs online vs mobile etc home depot does ok the food vendor at the renaissance faire gets slaughtered this kind of is why small vendor services like square are becoming hugely popular they flat rate everything at around 2.7 yay

it becomes yours when it leaves the trust until that point the trust owns the shares attributable to your account there are some different arrangements out there in the cases of some of the smaller 401(k providers where the assets are held in annuity products or even individual annuities in the case of 403(b plans   to further answer the question the trust and   trustee own and hold the account before you take a distribution in a lot of cases the 401(k recordkeeper has a trust company that they use to serve as the custodian person or entity who retains the assets in some plans you have an individual trustee or a corporate trustee those setups are not good for that person or company because they are ultimately responsible for backing the assets in the plan and as you can imagine leaving that responsibility to one person is not safe for that individual   hope that helps glad to answer any other questions you have

your post has some assumptions that are not or may not be true for one the assumption is that you have to wait 7 years after you settle your debts to buy a home   that is not the case   for some people me included settling an charged off debt was part of my mortgage application process   it was a small debt that a doctor 's office claimed i owed but i did n't   the mortgage company told me settling the debt was the cost of doing business   settling your debts can be looked as favorable option 1 in my opinion is akin to stealing   you borrowed the money and you are seeking to game the system by not paying your debts   would you want someone to do that to you   iirc the debt can be sold to another company and the time period is refreshed and can stay on your credit report for beyond the 7 years   i could be wrong but i feel like there is a way for potential lenders to see accounts well beyond specified time periods   after all the lenders are the credit reporting agencies customers and they seek to provide the most accurate view of a potential lender   with 20 k of cc debt they should point that out to their customers option 2   do you have 20 k   i 'd still seek to settle you do not have to wait 7 years    your home may not appreciate in 2 years   in my own case my home has very little in the 11 years that i have owned it   many people have learned the hard way that homes do not necessarily increase in value    it is very possible that you may have a net loss in equity in two years   repairs or improvements can evaporate the small amount of equity that is achieved over two years with a 30 year mortgage    i would hope that you pause a bit at the fact that you defaulted on 20 k in debt   that is a lot of money   although it is a lot it is a small amount in comparison to the cost and maintenance of a home   are you prepared to handle such a responsibility   what has changed in your personality since the 20 k default   the tone of your posts suggests you are headed for the same sort of calamity this is far more than a numbers game it is behavioral

well yes you 've implicitly made many assumptions such as that the embedded option has longer maturity the important thing to consider is when this option pays out the premium will obviously be adjusted   for a concrete example consider an equity option on an option the outer option has strike 110 the inner option has strike 100 spot = forward = 100 then the inner strike pays out when gt 100 but the outer option has zero value there the overall option only pays out if gt 110 reducing the structure to a call option with strike 110

i was in a very similar place 10 years ago i was in my mid 20 's with 45 k in combined school + personal business related debt and working in it for not very much i already had 10 15 k in debt when my college loans first came due and it was the first time i really had to come to terms with the hole i had dug myself and i spent weeks at a time obsessing over plans that would help me get out of debt it effected my health and my relationships i felt like i was never going to come out from under it my family was very much lower middle class k household income and i was n't going to get or expect any help there so i went to work and made it a point to make sure every personal and professional decision i made was conducive to my long term goals and before i knew it they became short term goals    find out what your basic monthly need is be brutally honest cut back on things like cable tv i still do n't have it reduce your phone plans borrow things when you do n't have to buy them and send that money to your debt pick up some hobbies that do n't cost much these are all minor sacrifices i got back in to playing the piano and spent a lot of time at the beach in the summer and up on books i 'd always meant to read in the winter    i ran a lot of numbers in a spreadsheet but you can play with the numbers with online loan calculators to put some real numbers behind your goals here is one that i just tried out   you 'll probably be surprised how much effect a little bit of extra towards a loan can make in the long term   put your current college loan details in to it and then see what the effect of an extra 150 a month is i know you 've implied that you really do n't have anything extra each month and that is fine figure out an amount that gets you moving towards your goals and then start working on a way to make it figuring out how to make or squeeze an extra n dollars out of your budget every 30 days is much less daunting than thinking about paying off 50k. you said you are working in it i do n't know where you live but in my city there are lots of decent it related jobs your first goal might need to be to find a better one     if possible move around balances until you 've got interest rates you can deal with and now that you have solid numbers to plan with consider the effect of making smaller goals would you feel as bad if you had half as much debt how about if you got rid of 10 k of debt or just your credit cards   i know i felt a huge relief when i cut my overall debt in half it felt like a huge part of my burden had lifted and it had i could start seeing the end of the tunnel     i think that one of the biggest changes in my life since then has been the way i look at and think about money and debt   i did n't really have to sacrifice much i learned to travel cheaply and whenever i met    a goal i 'd reward myself with a small trip today i have a very low mortgage payment and i pay my full credit balances each month so i have no revolving bad debt    i wish you luck and i know exactly where you are standing right now

personally i buy newer luxury cars for two reasons    1 status symbol newer cars have the latest looks performance and features like heated side mirrors and sensors that adjust control speed when in heavy traffic etc    2 older cars have more wear and tear no one has spent any significant amount of time in the car before and therefore you know the history of what the car has been through like buying a new pair of pants   you know that no one has pissed in them after i have pissed in and up my now older luxury car i sell it off and get a new one   cars wear out and as they get older they need parts replaced   my brother 's mazda for example just blew the head after buying the car new and driving 130k miles over a four year period   part of the luxury for owning a new car is the luxury of time not having your car spend any significant amount of time in a garage being worked on unless you buy a land of course

despite having a math degree i basically only use basic algebra probability calculus on a day to day basis as my career has gone a different direction away from the modelling stuff   some fun reading   the sabr model sabr libor sabr libor market model interest rate 's stochastic calculus for finance book stochastic calculus finance binomial textbooks amp book stochastic calculus finance continuous time textbooks   one of the big hard problems is a swap curve w/ what 's known as the basis as a number of true quants have said to me it is a non trivial problem its basically trying to match two curves with different compounding over a number of different points   sabr model listed above is all about and figuring out how the current rate enviroment is behaving is it normal or what is the blend between the two how do you know when you are in a different environment etc can rates go negative

yes that 's true excerpt from the warren buffett way   in november 2000 warren buffett and berkshire hathaway paid about $ 1 billion for benjamin moore amp co. the mercedes of paint companies founded in by the moore brothers in their brooklyn basement benjamin moore today is fifth largest paint manufacturer in the united states and has an unmatched reputation   for   quality it was reported that buffett paid a 25 percent premium over the stock ’s   then   current   price   on   the   surface   that   might   seem to contradict one of buffett ’s iron clad rules that he will act only when the price is low enough to constitute a margin of safety   however   we   also   know   that   buffett   is   not   afraid   to   pay for   quality   even   more   revealing   the   stock   price   jumped   50 percent to $ per share after the deal was announced this tells us that either buffett found yet another company that was undervalued or else that the rest of the investing world was betting   on   buffett ’s   acumen   and   traded   the   price   up   even   or   both

you can do several things after the fact if you believe the stock will go up you can buy more stock now it 's what 's called averaging so you bought 100 at $ 10 now it 's at $ 7 to gain money from your original investment it needs to raise to over $ 10 but if you really think it 'll go up you can buy and average so you buy say 100 more stock at $ 7 now you have 200 shares at $ 8.50 average so you gain money on your investment when the stock goes over $ 8.50 instead of $ 10   of course you risk losing even more money if the stock keeps going down before the fact when you buy stock set triggers in most trading houses you can set automatic triggers to fire on conditions you set when you buy 100 shares at $ 10 you can set a trigger to automatically sell the 100 shares if it drops below $ 9 so you limit your losses to 10 for example

so far the only thing that i can think of that would make me want to go with h&r block is the guarantee that they offer for a fee that says they will help you if you are ever audited for a tax return that you filed through them   but i think that is given for both the software and the in person tax preparation   so i guess if you like to ask lots of questions and get the answers nearly immediately i would go with an in person tax preparation person   if they ca n't answer all your questions then that is something else to think about all together

for a time period as short as a matter of months commercial paper or bonds about to mature are the highest returning investments as defined by benjamin graham   an investment operation is one which upon thorough analysis promises safety of principal and a satisfactory return operations not meeting these requirements are speculative there are no well known methods that can be applied to cryptocurrencies or forex for such short time periods to promise safety of principal the problem is that with $ 1,500 it will be impossible to buy any worthy credit directly and hold to maturity besides the need for liquidity eats up the return risk adjusted   the only alternative is a bond etf which has a high probability of getting crushed as interest rates continue to rise so that fails the above criteria the only alternative for investment now is a short term deposit with a bank for speculation anything goes the best strategy is to take the money and continue to build up a financial structure saving for risk adjusted and time discounted future annual cash flows   after the average unemployment cycle is funded approximately six or so years then long term investments should be accumulated internationally diversified equities

there is no guarantee improvements will raise the appraised value   you also do n't want your property tax appraisal to go up if you can avoid it since you are talking on the order of $ 10k i 'll assume you 're only a few thousand dollars more from getting to 20 that said any schemes you might come up with like refinancing or second line of credit will probably cost more in fees than they are worth unless you can get a much nicer interest rate figure out how long you plan to stay there evaluate your options do nothing principal reduction refinance for 30 15 or even an arm and figure out your bottom line by comparing everything in a spreadsheet one more thing if you do pay a substantial amount of extra principal you can ask the lender to rebalance which will correct the minimum monthly payment to your remaining term this will likely incur a fee but could be helpful in an emergency

on june 30 2015 the value of a key should be exactly the expected revenue from selling the chest contents owing to the fact that the next day the keys become worthless   looking at the steam community market it seems like the value of a key is higher than this but lower than 2.50   if that 's true then since the price of a key is higher than the expected revenue from selling the chest contents as you say then you can see that at some point the value of a key will have to go down   and as you get closer to the cutoff date the price will fall faster   it 's not quite the same but this pattern is usually what you see in the ticket resale market on say   if there 's something about keys that keeps their worth above the expected value of selling chest contents some value to the flexibility that keys offer over other tradable items maybe then in the short run that wo n't change due to this distant deadline just because it 's so far off   people will still want the flexibility keys offer   orthodox economics might suggest sell sooner rather than later but certainly do n't wait too long   different people react differently though   if there are a lot of people who sell their keys after hearing this news it might be a good time to buy   of course it 's a gamble but if you trust in whatever force keeps keys priced above the expected value of the loot they can buy then that force should win out in the medium term and you could turn a profit

if you do n't think you 're necessarily going to stay in this area for five years consider another option renting five years is often quoted as the minimum length of time for buying over renting as the costs of the house purchase and the mortgage are significant and if you 're buying a new house every 5 years you 're putting several thousand dollars of fees up front each time   if you do n't assume that house prices will increase as they wo n't necessarily then you can consider these costs say $ for a $ 500k house an extra 1 or so of interest that first year   if you are there 5 years then you 're paying 0.2 extra more or less that 's reasonable but if you 're there only 2 years you 're adding 0.5 to your rate which is pretty significant you wo n't necessarily come out ahead here versus renting renting for a year or two gives you enough time to find out if you do like the area and if you do you buy then with more knowledge of the area and a chance to make a purchase at the right time for you you pay off your loans or at least a chunk of them now save some of the rest and then rethink in a couple of years   if you then do n't qualify for a doctor 's mortgage anymore you just save up the rest of the 20 before making the purchase

hey i hear ya on this situation i also graduated from a good school finance comp sci with a mediocre gpa and had difficulty securing a full time position in finance my best advice is to network the shit out of alumni you can connect to through linkedin or your schools alumni network homepage people are much more open to talking than you would typically think   like your friends said getting into ibd as an analyst is ideal as it gives you a great line on your resume shows you worked hard and has amazing training now comes the really shitty part of this conversation if you 've already graduated college it 's next to impossible to get into a bulge bracket as an analyst your best bet in this case would be to try to get into a mid cap or boutique ib and work your way from there again though networking means 100x more than anything else   now the good news investment research is very different from investment banking yes equity research is within an investment bank sell side and buy side but it is very different from investment banking see chinese walls it 's easier to make the transition into research without formal recruiting than it is to get into ib directly   couple things to keep in mind know the difference between sell side an buy side i 'm not talking about just one buys stuff the other tries to get you to buy it i 'm talking about conflicts of interest on the sell side personalities types of research what your role entails org structure etc sell side is extremely different than buy side buy side is much less flexible than sell side in recruiting also do you currently own stocks trade track stocks all day long etc if the answer is no to any of those buy side is really really hard they want people who live and breath investing markets news companies because that 's what they do also training is effectively non existent on the buy side due to the size of the shops some can have $ 10b with 10 people including admins    now lets talk sell side this is where i 'd recommend you put your resources if you 're really passionate about it they tend to hire people without experience more often into entry level jobs b c most are larger investment banks that use research to promote underwriting investment business also you need to have a pitch but not as extensive as on the buy side those 1 2 i talked about the best advice i can offer is to hop on a bloomberg tr capiq terminal if you can and just start finding email addresses of sell side analysts they publish them in their reports and start writing the analysts directly expressing your interest in the business and your desire to talk with them be frank about where you are in your career but show a true passion for research and that you are hungry attach your resume and keep the email short a few sentences with maybe some bullets about how you could help that company spend the time to it to that person follow up with a phone call in 1 2 weeks they will appreciate the and   you 'll find them to be very receptive   even if these analysts do n't have a job available right there if they like you they will pass you on to someone who might this is how networking works that guy might not have a job but someone is always hiring and its a tight community   the other option is to work for any finance firm in some role for 3 5 years then go back to get an mba with an mba from a top school you can basically transition into anything    pm me if you ever want to talk over im i 'd be happy to chat

the company says it 's out of their control it is n't all they have to do is to instruct hsbc to send a certain amount of gbp and then hsbc must send gbp   obviously the bank does n't like that because they make money through the conversion that 's not your problem when told to send gbp they must send gbp   depending on what your relationship with that company is you lost money because they did n't send the gbp at the very least they sent you four percent less in euros than they should have sent you so send them a bill for the difference it 's unfortunate that your bank charged for the conversion euro to gbp but fact is that less than the agreed amount arrived at your bank and that 's the responsibility of the sender

from a mathematical point of view the stats do not change depending on past performance just because a fund is lucky one year does n't mean that it will be unlucky the next consider tossing a coin the chance of heads is 50 if you have just thrown 3 heads the chance of heads is still 50 it does n't go down   if you throw 10 heads in a row the chance of a heads is still 50 in fact you many suspect there is something odd about the coin if it was an unfair coin then the chance of a heads would be higher than 50 it could be the fund is better run but there could be other reasons including random chance some funds will randomly do better and some will randomly do worse what you do know is that if they did better than average other funds have done worse at least for last year

i 'd put more money down and avoid financing i personally do n't think car debt is good debt and if you ca n't afford the car you are better off with a cheaper car also you should read up on the 0 offer before deciding to commit    here 's one article that is slightly dated but discusses some pros and cons of 0 financing my main point though is that 0 financing is not free and you need to consider the cost of that financing before making the purchase   aside from the normal loan costs of having a monthly payment possibly buying too much car by looking at monthly cost etc a 0 financing offer usually forces you to give the dealer financing company any rebates that are due to you in essence making the car cost more

fixed rate mortgage is supposed to give you security you are not going to get the best possible rate but it is safe and predictable your argument is the same as complaining that you are paying for home insurance and your home has n't burnt down   switching to a variable rate mortgage right now seems a bad idea because there is some expectations that rates are going up if you can overpay that is probably what you should do unless you can invest with better return after tax than your mortgage interest it does n't just shorten the time of your mortgage every time you overpay £ 500 your mortgage principal is down by £ 500 and you pay interest on £ 500 less   and if the interest rate goes up over the next five years as you seem to hope that just means you will pay higher interest when your mortgage needs renewing   you ca n't hope to always make the optimal decision you made a decision with very low risk as with any decision you do n't know what 's in the future a decision that is low risk if the risk could lead to fatal results is not unwise you could have picked a variable rate mortgage and could be paying twice as much interest today

bitcoin payments involve by far the lowest fees   for pure bitcoin to bitcoin transfers you have the option of not paying any fee at all while if you want to avoid the risk currently very small of miners ignoring your transaction you can pay a small transaction fee   currently no more than btc is ever required $ 0.01 at $ bitcoin also does not support chargebacks which is an advantage for the merchant no risk that paypal will freeze your account as it did in with a burning man nonprofit but more risk for the consumer popular sites for exchanging bitcoins with other currencies charge rates of or less   the primary barrier is that it typically takes a few days to get funds into your account from bank accounts etc   given the volatility of the bitcoin exchange rate you may want to treat bitcoin like cash and only keep a small amount on hand a variety of shopping cart interfaces are supported the obvious downside is that only a small fraction of users would be likely to go through the steps to use this option since bitcoin is new and immature so your investment in adding support may be hard to pay off   on the other hand just advertising that you accept bitcoin payments would give you a bit of free advertising another downside is the risk of government intervention   in npr 's 2011 story a law professor said it was legal for now in the us but that could change i 'd say that given the sizable current fees and other barriers to international commerce and micro payments if bitcoin does n't succeed something else will

the biotechnology sector as a whole is a popular buy recommendation among some analysts these days for a few reasons   some analysts feel that the high costs in r&d even without much profit are a positive sign for growth because it means a company is working towards finding the next blockbuster drug or the next class of such drugs there have n't been many new classes of blockbuster drugs since the development of 's and and many of the new drugs that have been developed have been tweaks to existing classes of drugs some analysts feel that it 's about time for a new class of blockbuster drugs to hit the market a new blockbuster drug means significant profits for the company that develops it a new class of blockbuster drugs means significant profits for the whole industry   since about 2009 the food and drug administration has been more lenient in its approval of new drugs this wave of new approvals has reduced r&d costs for companies because they do n't need to go back to the lab or earlier phases of clinical trials and continually tweak their drugs in order to gain approval this has also made some analysts optimistic genetic engineering is considered an up and coming field with potentially significant applications to the pharmaceutical industry advances in this field may increase profits for the industry but since biotech companies are often the ones producing the engineering equipment research etc such advances could be a major source of revenue for the entire biotech industry   in the us and in the developed world as a whole the elderly population is growing and since people consume more medicine as they grow older this could lead to higher profits for companies involved in the production of pharmaceuticals which includes biotech companies of course in the long run   in the us the passage of the patient protection and affordable care act expanded insurance coverage which gives more people the means to afford pharmaceuticals also in general people consume more healthcare services when they have insurance this is called moral hazard so some analysts expect that the expansion of insurance coverage will only lead to more profits for the pharmaceutical industry and biotechnology firms in general the global food crisis as the climate changes companies like monsanto which use various forms of genetic engineering to produce crop strains that can survive in increasingly hostile environments look more and more appealing to places that need crops designed to grow in such environments any methods that could increase yields look increasingly popular and biotechnology companies often market such methods as a side note i know monsanto is a contentious example and there are a lot of misconceptions about genetically modified food and the genetic engineering methods they do so i wo n't get into a debate about that   in general technology is a popular subject right now i 've read analyst reports from analysts that clearly do n't follow the biotech sector that base their forecasts for the biotech sector on the activities of companies like dell zynga hp linkedin facebook etc clearly it 's problematic when an analyst sees the word technology and automatically assumes that the biotech sector is responsive to the same factors as social media firms hardware manufacturers etc this is n't to say that the biotech sector is completely isolated from this but when i read a report that talks about facebook 's ipo being bad news for companies like gilead sciences without mentioning upcoming fda decisions about gilead 's products or any biotech specific factors i 'm not convinced the analyst has performed due diligence   i keep using the phrase some analysts because i want to stress that the opinions stated above are n't universal although they 're popular not everyone is so optimistic also i do n't want you to see these reasons and think that i 'm making a buy recommendation because i 'm not i 'm not making a recommendation one way or another   i 'm happy to clarify my answer too i follow the biotechnology sector extensively if you want to get a rough feel for the daily movements of the sector as a whole a good place to start is ibb the ishares nasdaq biotechnology index fund the four largest holdings are gilead sciences and which are all big players in the industry obviously these are a little different from the big name pharma companies like pfizer etc but they 're still considered pharma companies it 's also worthwhile to follow the fda press announcements by the time the news is published there it 's probably already leaked or known to people in the industry the biotech sectors are rife with accusations of insider trading so you might not find trading opportunities but it 's important to get familiar with the information the releases contain if you want to know more about the industry volatility trades are always popular trades around fda drug approvals

there are entire books devoted to this topic i 'd suggest focusing on a of income that you can set aside for each child and start doing that instead of looking at a specific dollar target i would look at a 529 plan to get the state tax benefit for growth also be careful to counter the advice given by admissions folks who encourage high school kids to choose the college that will make you happy and expose them to as many pictures of lovely private campuses as possible the lawns at the private school are nice but state colleges offer a great education at a relative bargain try to teach your kids about money so they understand the downsides of the loans that schools throw at you i went to a state school had very supportive parents and worked throughout i came out with $ 750 of debt on a 0 credit card for a laptop replacement i have a friend who went to a similar private school who came from a similar background and who is now in a similar place career wise except he has a $ 500/mo monthly to sallie mae my parents started working on me when i was about 12 and it worked

there are lots of answers here but i 'll add my two cents the best way to win is not to play mlm is not a viable business model do n't go in thinking you 'll beat the system by trying harder than everyone else the only way you 'll make any money is by recruiting lots of people and selling products that can be obtained for cheaper elsewhere at a normal store if your friend already committed to the decision and they 're wise as to what 's going on yet gullible enough to try anyways have them think about the ethics of exploiting the people down the pyramid from them maybe that will change their mind all of the other answers about not investing too much of your own money remain true you do n't want to blow your life savings on a pipe dream

with enough money in the emergency fund to get rid of the car and still have a cushion i would definitely get rid of it as the car is not needed your car is only going down in value which makes the current setup even less desirable in essence you are paying over $ 300 a month for something that every month is worth less and less since you are paying over $ 300 a month and it will take about $ 3000 from your emergency fund to get rid of the car if you start putting that $ 300 + back in the emergency fund in a mere 10 months you will have replenished the emergency fund

i do n't know what angle you 're trying to push or why but are you also saying that of the imf and di of the university of are similarly lacking the understanding of financial concepts when they published a external pubs ft quantifying structural subsidy values for systemically important financial institutions   are you suggesting a similar entire of salt when they the structural subsidy values by exploiting expectations of state support embedded in credit ratings and by using long run average value of rating bonus   should we really be so skeptical when they conclude   iii has provided estimates of the value of the subsidy to in terms of the overall ratings using the range of our estimates we can summarize that a one unit increase in government support for banks in advanced economies has an impact equivalent to 0.55 to 0.9 notches on the overall long term credit rating at the and this effect increased to 0.8 to 1.23 notches by the summary table 8) at the the effect of the government support is almost identical between the group of advanced countries and developing countries before the crisis governments in advanced economies played a smaller role in boosting banks’ long term ratings these results are robust to a number of sample selection tests such as testing for differential effects across developing and advanced countries for both listed and non listed banks and also correcting for bank parental support and alternative estimations of an individual bank ’s strength   i ask because this article is founded on that study linked to by bloomberg which is then linked to in op 's huffpo article   while you can certainly claim that mark shows a basic lack of understanding of whatever why do n't you put some skin in the game and demonstrate how he somehow misses the entire point of that study or better yet really wow us by de that study

look at price book value and there are more than a few stocks that may have a p b under 1 so this does happen there are at least a couple of other factors you are n't considering here current liabilities how much money is the company losing each quarter that may cause it to sell repeatedly if the company is burning through $ 100 million quarter that asset is only going to keep the lights on for another 2.5 years so consider what assumptions you make about the company 's cash flow here the asset itself is the price really fixed or could it be flexible could the asset seen as being worth $ 1 billion today be worth much less in another year or two as an example suppose the asset was a building and then real estate values drop by 40 in that area now what was worth $ 1 billion may now be worth only $ 600 million as something of a final note you do n't state where the $ 100 million went that the company received as if that was burned for operations now the company 's position on the asset is $ 900 million as it only holds a 90 stake though i 'd argue my 2 previous points are really worth noting the following 6 stocks are trading at or below 0.5 x book value sep 2013 has a half dozen examples of how this is possible if the $ 100 million was used to pay off debt then the company does n't have that cash and thus its assets are reduced by the cash that is gone depending on what the plant is producing the value may or may not stay where it is if you want an example to consider how would you price automobile plants these days if the company experiences a reduction in demand the plant may have to be sold off at a reduced price for a cynic 's view here

one thing recessions do is sort out market inefficiencies   often that means re directing people who are in jobs they ca n't   do properly into other career fields     during the dot com boom tons of people with liberal arts degrees and no experience wound up as software engineers   not all of them sucked but many did and the dot com crash sorted that out   as an engineer i saw this first hand and it was n't a bad thing i had a lot of co workers in 2000 who were n't pulling their weight   this is going to sound heartless and maybe it is but if someone has been unemployed 3 years maybe it is time for a career change     your tax credit idea is only going to penalize businesses for operating efficiently penalize the productively and cost the government in revenue   also tax incentives rarely have the impact they 're designed to have and there are always consequences   large businesses exploit them small get abused by them   if we want to see job growth tax codes need to get simpler not more complex

ordinarily a stock split increases all shareholders share counts so that there is no change in anybody 's voting power   for example if you owned 1 of the company before the split after the split you now have twice as many shares but there are now twice as many shares outstanding so you still own 1 of the company   also stock splits are not ordinarily triggered   usually they happen when the board decides that for one reason or another it 's desirable to increase the number of shares in circulation which causes the price of each share to decrease proportionally    i 'm not familiar with the show and in particular i do n't know what the action is that the character being addressed is thinking of taking but it sounds like they are describing something akin to a poison pill   in these arrangements the pill is triggered by some predefined condition say a party acquiring shares in excess of a defined threshold   what typically happens is that shareholders other than the ones who triggered the pill get a chance to buy shares at a substantial discount thereby diluting the shares of the party that triggered it   because the other shareholders have to buy their additional shares albeit at a discount and because it applies only to certain shares it 's not really a split but it 's close enough that the writers of the show may have felt it was worth using the term that is more familiar to the public

the money is not subject to tax because it was deposited you can deposit money as much as you like that 's not what is triggering the tax what is triggering the tax is the sale itself and it has already happened if your friend is taxed for capital gains under the spanish tax law then this money is already taxable and not paying the tax due is tax evasion depositing the money may indeed trigger an investigation that will lead to evasion charges but it would not be the depositing the money that was against the law not depositing the money does n't mean you will avoid investigation it just means that the authorities may learn about it in a different way and charge you with additional crimes while at it money laundering fraud whatever keeping large amounts of cash brings additional complications and dangers the more people knowing about it and they will as you spend it the higher chances are for you to split it with some robber or thief i suggest talking to a licensed tax accountant in spain about whether the sale of the flat is taxable in spain or not if it is pay the taxes due and be done with that

in older days the merchants and their merchant service providers would take funds in their currency say in this case usd when the charge hits the issuer bank the merchant and merchant bank gets there usd and were happy the user would get charged in local currency in this case the rate applied by his bank and card provider visa master also take a cut is the standard shelf rate to individuals    when business growing and banking becoming more sophisticated lots of merchant banks and merchants have created a new business if you offer to all users then you have lots of that you can convert into usd so in this model the merchant makes some more profit from fx spread the merchant bank makes good money in fx your bank and card network loose out you stand to gain because you potentially get a better rate all this theory is good but the rates are moving and its quite difficult to find out if the rates offered directly by ei ai would be better than those offered by your bank i have no experience in this example but i have tried this with large shops buy 2 items one charge in gbp and other in local currency around 2 3 times spread over a year the difference in rate was close to identical at times better or worse in range of .02

at this time there is one advantage of having a 30 year loan right now over a 15 year loan   the down side is you will be paying 1 higher interest rate so the question is can you beat 1 on the money you save every month so lets say instead of going with 15 year mortgage i get a 30 and put the $ 200 monthly difference in lets say the dia fund   will i make more on that money than the interest i am losing   my answer is probably yes   plus lets factor in inflation   if we have any high inflation for a few years in the middle of that 30 not only with the true value of what you owe go down but the interest you can make in the bank could be higher than the 4 you are paying for your 30 year loan    just a risk reward thing i think more people should consider

paying yourself first is a method to ensure you are meeting your financial goals whatever they may be it 's also an easy way to automate the process of sending money where you need it go without needing to think about it your goals could be to buy a bit of a mutual fund every month max your ira or stash a percentage of each paycheck in a wedding savings account maybe you are saving for a house knowing you should save and not doing is guilt generating paying yourself first means regularly putting money to these goals so you can stop worrying any way you figure it you 've still got bills to pay   paying yourself first means taking care of these payments right off the top of your paycheck the money goes where you need it a good move is to automate this with bill pays ach transfers to investments accounts etc once this is done you can spend the money that is left over knowing that you 've taken care of the important things and met all your goals you never have to find yourself wondering if you paid your cell phone bill or if you have enough money to go out tonight savings for the new car you want are as they say in the bank

the only reason i can think of would be if you were convinced that you could n't hold on to your money treasury bonds are often viewed as very safe investments and often used in some situations where cash is n't appropriate also they typically have a somewhat patriotic theme helping your country to grow in addition many people do n't really pay attention to the rate of the bonds but are just investing in them the more people investing in them the lower the yields become but the bottom line is i would invest in a savings account any day over a negative interest rate and it looks like i 'm in good company as well a quick study of reports seems to indicate that these are a very bad investment

if a company is valued correctly then paying dividends should lower the share price and buying back shares should leave the share price unchanged   if the share price is $ 100 and the company pays a $ 10 dividend then either its cash goes down by $ 10 per share it is has to borrow money for the same amount or some mixture either way the value of the company has gone down by $ 10 per share   if the share price is $ 100 and the company buys back 10 percent of its shares then it also has to find the money just as for the dividend and the value of the company goes down by 10 percent however the number of shares also goes down by 10 percent so the amount of value per share is the same and the share price should stay unchanged   now there are psychological effects many people like getting paid dividends so they will want to own shares of a company paying dividends so the share price goes up similar with a share buyback the fact that someone buys huge amounts of shares drives the price up both effects are purely psychological   a buyback has another effect if the shares are not valued correctly if the company is worth $ 100 per share but for some reason the is down to $ 50 then after the buyback the value per share has even gone up basically the company buys from stupid investors which increases the value for clever investors holding on to their shares if the were $ 200 then buying back shares would be a stupid move for the company

start with the list of mortgage companies approved to work in your area there are 80 within 10 miles of my house and more than 100 in my county pick ones you know because they are established businesses in your area region or even nationally    a good place to start might be with your current lender the risk you seem to be worried about is a scam or a trick in the recent past the scams were ones where the home owner did n't understand teaser rates and the risk of interest only and pick your payment loans the simpler the bells and the less likely you are to be on a risky transaction it ca n't hurt to ask an organization like the bbb or neighbors but realize that many people loved their exotic mortgage until the moment it blew up in their face so for 5 years your neighbor would have about their new mortgage until they discovered how underwater they were   regarding how the transaction is accomplished is hard to predict there is great variation in the quality of the loan officers so a great company can have employees unless you can get a recommendation for a specific employee it is hard know if your loan officer is going to give great service    when getting a mortgage for a purchase the biggest risk is getting a mortgage that results in a payment you ca n't afford this is less of a risk with a refinance because you already have a mortgage and monthly payment but keep in mind some of the monthly savings is due to stretching out the payments for another 30 years know what you are trying to do with the refinance because the streamlined ones ca nt be used for cash out

i do n't have a reference but i think it depends on when you entered the workforce if you finished school at age 24 your primary goals are to pay down expensive debt and to save up enough for a down payment   so essentially not much   maybe $ 5k to $ 10k at the most on the other hand if you entered the workforce at age 20 with no debts and no significant expenses it should have been easy to sock away 20 of your income for 6 years so $ 40k to $ 50k would be reasonable the difference is that the first person 's income earning potential should be higher so eventually they 'd be able to make up the difference and pass them

good grief   ask a republican to define their terminology to avoid conflict and confusion and you get labeled a liberal   honestly the stupid labeling thing is one of the most and idiotic parts of our political discourse these day   the idea here is to remove obfuscation so we can get to the point   clarify yourself   you have declared paying government employees better than others is waste   you ’ve also declared the current government delivery system is waste   but the whole system is not waste   parse it out     you do n’t want people paid more than a business can afford right   so there is no financial loss   you do n’t want a system in place that ca n’t afford to pay for itself now or in the foreseeable future after all everyone should have a chance to recover right   but when you say there is waste in the government i have to be sure you are discussing complete value including social educational technological national military and not just budget   this is important because my arguments hinge on the non budget side whereas yours seem to focus on the financial aspects    not that these are the whole of either of our views   they are simply the focuses we have used in this discussion   so stop with the cheap and we ’ll continue   there are many wasteful aspects of the government   i agree with that    it there are many things the go does that private industry either ca n’t or wo n’t do   biggest of these is corporations will not go out of their way to protect their citizens   they will do what they are paid to do and nothing else   the postal service will probably never be closed or privatized if it were however i would love too see how the cost of delivery and the pay for delivery employees are affected   i agree the question of why government waste exists is the most important   but in order to see it clearly we must get a lay of the land   we need to review two edge cases   1 where is the most waste   why is it so extreme here   2 where is the least waste   why is this part of the government more efficient   then we can inspect the different influences in each system and explore why efficiency is n’t enforced or encouraged in so many government areas and what can be done to improve efficiency or if it is an area that the nation would do better with privatization instead

in my experience working at a currency exchange money service business in the us flat fees are the because we can fee on average these can be waived on certain dollar values at some banks or and sometimes can even be   if you google eurusd as an example you also get something like $ 1.19 at 4 pm if you look at the actual conversion that you got you may find your bank hit you with $ 1.30 or something close to convert from usd to euro in other words you payed 10 more usd per euro and if you sell your euro directly back you might find you only make $ 1.07 this spread is the real fee and covers a number of things including risk or liquidity you 'll see that currencies with more volatility or less liquidity have a much wider spread some businesses even go as far as to artificially widen the spread for speculators see inr etc typically if you see a 3 surcharge on international atm or pos transactions that 's the carrier such as visa or mastercard taking their cut for processing interestingly enough you also typically get the carrier set exchange rate overseas when using your card in other words your bank has a cash eurusd of $ 1.30 but the conversion you get at the atm is visa 's rate hence the visa fee but it 's typically a nicer spread or it 's sometimes the international spot rate depending on the circumstances due to the overhead of electronic transactions you also have to consider the atm charging you a separate fee for it 's own operation in essence the fees exist to pad every player involved except you some cards do you a solid by advertising $ 0 foreign exchange fees unfortunately these cards only insulate you from the processing flat fees and you may still fall prey to the fee hidden in the spread in the scheme of things currency exchange is a retail operation they try to make money on every step that requires them to expend a resource if you pay 10 on a money transaction this differs actually very little from the mark up you pay on your groceries which varies from 3 5 on dry food to 20 on alcohol such as wine

this is a pretty shit article i did n't know people got business advice from 's business blog jesus   everyone in the industry knows that amc is sour about this because they are trying to do their own thing they tried it before with and probably were n't happy with the split and now they 're not happy because this is undercutting what they were they do n't actually have a real reason to be upset about this and are going to have a tough time getting out of it   the article also does n't mention and which are both excited about moviepass and i have heard have expressed willingness to potentially share incremental concession revenue these guys make 90 cents on the dollar on concessions so i do n't think they give a shit who is lining their customers up as long as they 're there   also if you do n't see the obvious acquisition strategy here then you should probably stick to whatever it is that regularly covers looks like today 's headline is who won the eclipse on the internet

they immediately make money by charging you the initial fee   in the long term they make money because a surprisingly large number of customers do n't pay the balance off or otherwise violate the terms of the offer so that the rate applies    and sometimes depending on card policies they make money when the consumer makes new purchases on the card which accrue interest immediately at the rate while payments only go to paying down the 0 rate balance

there are a few other items that you should be aware of when getting options the strike price is usually determined by an independent valuation of the common shares called a valuation this should give you a sense on what the options are worth obviously you are hoping that the value becomes many multiple of that there are two kinds in the us non and incentive stock options isos   the big difference is that when you exercise non you have to pay the tax on the difference between the fair market value on the shares and what you paid for them the strike price   this is important because if the company is private you likely can not sell any shares until it is public with isos you do n't pay any tax except amt tax on the gain until you actually sell the shares   you should know what kind your getting some plans allow for early exercise essentially allowing you to buy the shares early and given back if you leave before they vest which helps you establish capital gains treatment earlier as well as avoid amt if you have isos this is really complicated direction and you would want to talk to a tax professional   and always a good idea to know how many total shares outstanding in the company very few people ask this question but it is helpful for you to understand the overall value of the options

anytime the government gets into subsidizing something it becomes more expensive   this happened with housing in the when they deemed all americans need to own a house medicine when they started medicare medicaid in the 1960s and education which iirc they started with the gi bill at the tail end of ww2 and student loans shortly thereafter   credit allows people to spend money they do n't have now causing what prices these systems can charge to rise and encourages servicing the loan later in life   add to that the accreditation system and education becomes the expensive to many jobs that worked on an apprenticeship system before pay you a token wage learning the trade and maybe room and board in some cases   the middle classes have been getting the last decades and it shows from the country going from 1 households with luxury time to 2 households with unpaid overtime in many cases to afford the same or lower standard of living

the expense fees are high and unfortunate i would stop short of calling it criminal however   what you are paying for with your expenses is the management of the holdings in the fund the managers of the fund are actively continuously watching the performance of the holdings buying and selling inside the fund in an attempt to beat the stock market indexes whether or not this is worth the expenses is debatable but it is indeed possible for a managed fund to beat an index   despite the relatively high expenses of these funds the 401 k is still likely your best investment vehicle for retirement the money you put in is tax deductible immediately your account grows tax deferred and anything that your employer kicks in is free money   since in the short term you have little choice do n't lose a lot of sleep over it   just pick the best option you have and occasionally suggest to your employer that you would appreciate different options in the future if things do n't change and you have the option in the future to rollover into a cheaper ira feel free to take it

i would put about a month 's worth of expenses in the highest paying savings account that you find convenient to access for the rest i recommend ally 's high yield cds specifically the 5-year option normally 5 years would be way too long to commit short term savings to a cd however the ally cds allow you to break them for a penalty of only two months worth of interest if you look at the graph below from when the rates were apy you can see the effective interest rate at every possible time you break the cd early doing the math if you can keep your savings in the account for at least four months it will outperform any other current fdic backed investment that i am aware of for the length of time the money was invested   credit

the gift issue as explained to me by the mortgage officer at our credit union is that they look at the average balance of your checking savings accounts of the 3 6 months prior to mortgage issuance date they look at the average balance to make sure you are financially stable beyond what your income and credit score indicate with an average balance of $ 2500 the bank will reasonably presume you cannot make a $ 10k down payment by not using the $ 10k gift from dad you 're showing the bank that you 're more financially stable than if it came in and went right back out that looks like you 're a free spender and it will cast doubt on your willingness ability to repay the loan presuming your average balances are already ok the best way to utilize the gift from dad is in one of the following manners in my opinion

you apparently assume that pouring money into a landlord 's pocket is a bad thing not necessarily whether it makes sense to purchase your own home or to live in a rental property varies based on the market prices and rents of properties in the long term real estate prices closely follow inflation however in some areas it may be possible that real estate prices have increased by more than inflation in the past say 10 years this may mean that some stupid people assume that real estate prices continue to appreciate at this rate in the future the price of real estates when compared to rents may become unrealistically high so that the rental yield becomes low and the only reasonable way of obtaining money from real estate investments is price appreciation continuing no it will not continue forever furthermore an individual real estate is a very poorly diversified investment and a very risky investment too a mold problem can destroy the entire value of your investment if you invest in only one property real estates are commonly said to be less risky than stocks but this applies only to large real estate portfolios when compared with large stock portfolios it is easier to build a large stock portfolio with a small amount of money to invest when compared to building a large real estate portfolio thus i would consider this how much return are you going to get by not needing to pay rent but needing to pay some minor maintenance costs when purchasing your own home how much does the home cost what is the annual return on the investment is it larger than smaller when compared to investing the same amount of money in the stock market as i said an individual house is a more risky investment than a well diversified stock portfolio thus if a well diversified stock portfolio yields 8 annually i would demand 10 return from an individual house before considering to move my money from stocks to a house

the answer is simple your new job pays more than your old one   as such you 're in a higher tax withholding bracket even with the same number of deductions as before your withholding is computed based on how much you make each pay period and the number of pay periods in the year   so if you were being paid weekly before then it was based on the assumption you made the same amount for every pay period in the calendar year   this is why tax varies from week to week for hourly employees and people being paid overtime   in your new job you 're being paid semi monthly which makes for 24 pay periods rather than the 52 pay periods when you were paid weekly so the amount of withholding in dollar terms is going to be much greater than when you were being paid weekly   add in the fact you 're making $ 2,000 more a month i presume so that 's $ 24,000 a year more   it 's definitely going to bump you into a different earning bracket for taxes so even with the same number of deductions you 're going to pay more now this is n't to say you wo n't be able to recoup some of that at the end of the year when you file your taxes since your current withholding rate may have you over paying   as such you 'll see a nice refund one final note you always have the option of changing your withholding if you like   many people will do that claiming minimal deductions for the first few months of the year to let the maximum withholding take place then they 'll adjust their withholding deductions in the second half of the year to capture more in each paycheck   if done right it makes no difference in the total amount withheld but it does allow the checks at the latter part of the year to be bigger than if withholding deductions were kept the same throughout

there is no objective should   you need to be clear why you 're tracking these numbers and the right answer will come out of that i think the main reason an individual would add up their assets and net worth is to get a sense of whether they are making progress or whether they are saving enough money or perhaps whether they are getting close to the net worth at which they can make some life change   obviously shares or other investment property ought to be counted in that    buying small medium consumer goods like furniture or electronics may improve your life but it 's not especially improving your financial position   accounting for them with little $ 20 or $ 200 changes every month or year is not necessarily useful things like cars are an intermediate case because firstly they 're fairly large chunks of money and secondly they commonly are things people sell on for amounts of money and you can reasonably estimate the value if for instance i take $ 30k out of my bank account and buy a new car how has my net worth changed   it would be too pessimistic to say i 'm $ 30k worse off   if i really needed the money back i could go and sell the car but not for $ 30k   so a good way to represent this is an immediate 10 20 cost for off the lot depreciation of the car and then another 12 every year or 1 every month if you 're tracking lifestyle assets that you want to accumulate i think monetary worth is not the best scale because it 's only correlated with the value you get out of them    case in point you probably would n't buy a second hand mattress and they have pretty limited resale value   financially the value of the mattress collapses as soon as you get it home but the lifestyle benefit of it holds up just fine for eight years or so so if there are some major purchases say > $ 1000 that you want to make and you want to track it what i would do is make a list of things you want to buy in the future and then tick them off when you either do buy them or cross them out when you decide you actually do n't want them   then you have something to motivate saving and you have a chance to think it over before you make the purchase   you can also look back on what seemed to be important to you in the past and either feel satisfied you achieved what you wanted or you can discover more about yourself by seeing how your desires change   you probably do n't want to so much spend $ 50k as you want to buy a tv a dishwasher a trip to

but what about the following scenario which is my paraphrasing of a nanex article i 'm hoping you can help clarify this for me   1 i observe a 1,000 lot advertised for sell on a lit exchange   2 i try to lift the 1,000 by placing a limit order   3 my order goes through some kind of order routing process first 3 orders get executed on a dark pool let 's say i got a 50 lot filled so available offer reduces to 950   4 my order hits a lit exchange i get a partial fill for 100 offer shrinks to 850 but the offered size shrinks instead to 500 or 0   5 now in order to execute my trade i will have to take a higher price than the original advertised liquidity   my question maybe you can answer this is why did my original order size of 1,000 appear in smaller blocks is this because the order routing algorithm breaks up the size   or is it that market makers only post offers in small block sizes e.g. 100 so even if the order book looked like   100 10   100 10   100 10   100 10   100 10   100 10   all the way to 1,000 total as soon as the first 100 shares were lifted the mm can immediately cancel the remainder of the advertised liquidity in practical terms making it impossible to execute large orders at an advertised price

the real idea is to get inflation even higher than it currently is to try and get more bullets in the future for the next recession we 'd like nominal rates to be much higher than before so that we can have even larger real negative rates when needed this takes time and and i 'd say yellen is doing a fine job every mark she is reaching for in the dual mandate is exactly where it needs to be for a perfect storm    almost all people borrow money to get houses that does n't make them likely to default what made defaults skyrocket in 08 was predatory lending and ninja loans as well as a group of men who actively did everything they could to make the system fail because of credit default swaps whose payout was significantly higher than the loss

there is a lot misinformation in this thread that i 'd like to clear up in fact you 're more than welcomed to pm me if you wish to see any backup to the statements i 'm about to make    first i 'd like to say that as an uber lyft driver the experience has been nothing short of i normally work in the l.a. and areas of so cal and the amount of interesting super successful and wonderful people i meet on a daily basis is off the charts it 's as if i 'm some sort of talk show host on wheels    initially i applied for lyft as the social and community angle of its service intrigued the hell out of me i 'm an outgoing guy and i 'm also an artist of some type who receives a royalty check only once a month instead of doing and begging for money i thought doing lyft would be a great idea instead so far my customers have been nothing short of an inspiration anyway after passing a background check a driving test with my mentor a driving record check alongside submitting all my documentation license registration insurance and a quick vehicle inspection my car is rather new and in great condition i was hired quickly    that same day i decided to get to work quickly see how the whole system works as soon as i got to the destination i wanted to get to i got my first call on my phone within 5 minutes i use my gps and rush to pick my customer up while obeying all traffic laws of course after a couple of minutes of chit chat i come to find out my first lyft customer ever is an uber recruiter she likes my car and my approach so she hands me a uber black bag with an iphone a car charger and a mount i asked her if this means i have to work exclusively for uber she says nope   my eyes then light up like some medieval lights in the sky chicken little for the ancient aliens approved phenomena when i realize i 'll have access to both customer bases just one week removed from not being able to pay my phone bill    after submitting a background check a driving record check and pretty much all the stuff lyft asked for i was driving for both uber and lyft a week after i was hired for lyft    the good news for you the consumer is that both companies are being cut throat because they want your money there 's never been a better time to hitch a ride on the cheap both companies have thrown millions of dollars over the past couple of months through social media   driver bonuses and other venues so you 're able to get a free ride or a deep discount off a long ride   if you have n't tried both services now 's the time do n't want to risk getting a dui just for driving down a couple of blocks to your favorite bar this weekend you 'll probably be able to get a free ride there if you gently for specials and pay between $ 7 13 for the trip back better than getting your car losing your license and paying $ 10,000 + in penalties and court fees eh you have no idea how many poor i take to and from work who ca n't drive because they just got a and who are now $ 25 35 per ride just to get to where they got ta go      insurance   as for insurance both companies have given me supplemental insurance i have full coverage on my car for when i 'm off the clock which was required at time of hiring btw so here 's how the insurance for lyft and uber works    for    when app is turned on on the way to pick up client contingent liability    1 up to $ 50k person bodily injury   1 up to $ 100k accident bodily injury   1 up to $ 25k accident property damage    when you pick up in the car and you 're on your way to the destination    excessive liability amp um   1 up to $   contingent collision amp comprehensive    1 up to $   $ 2500 deductible    for    when app is turned on on the way to pick up client contingent liability   1 up to $ 50k person bodily injury 1 up to $ 100k accident bodily injury 1 up to $ 25k accident property damage    when you pick up in the car and you 're on your way to the destination   excessive liability amp um   up to $   contingent collision amp comprehensive   up to $ $ 1000 deductible   other than the deductible as you can see both plans are pretty much the same which in my opinion should be more than enough    services amp expectations   both apps are easy to use and within 5 10 minutes sometimes much sooner there 've been many times where i get a call and the customer is on the sidewalk a few feet from where i was parked waiting for my next call both passengers and drivers adhere to a rating system as of today if either driver or passenger fail to maintain a rating of 4.6 and above they risk being booted from using the app so it 's important that drivers know what the hell they are doing like being courteous respectful professional clean and know how to use a gps while driving accurately and safely and/or knowing their routes and passengers should also be polite respectful very important since drivers are n't also do n't be so drunk that you either pass out or throw up in the back and make sure that if your bring your friends along for the ride that they adhere to the code of conduct expected of passengers i 've run into numerous instances where an otherwise perfect passenger gets dinged for their drunk and/or rude friends     also as a driver for your insurance to work do n't ever end a drive early because you made a wrong turn or were late for a pick up you 're risking an insurance hiccup in the event of an incident and passengers should also make sure that their driver has their app online throughout the entire trip as well as making sure the driver 's pic of him her and his her car match the profile you see on the app    as for safety i 've yet to hear from a passenger they felt they were ever in immediate danger did they get a creepy vibe from one of their drivers sure not everyone is a social butterfly and there has been an of ex cab drivers going over to uber which is good cause the service is getting pro drivers with experience but could prove detrimental since they 're gon na have a hard time competing with lyft on the charisma side of things    however i 've already numerous accounts from young women in hollywood who are now refusing to call for a yellow cab or taxis on hollywood blvd and sunset and the surrounding areas due to unwelcome sexual advances by drivers looking to take advantage of their sometimes solitary and drive home it 's and great to hear whenever you drop one of these young women off at their places and they thank you for being both professional courteous welcoming and above all else trustworthy all while paying a fraction of the cost of what a cab would normally run at that time of night    my personal experience in summary   i 'm literally having the time of my life my other job requires me to interact with humanity pick its brain and then express those experiences to everyone else in an positive and inspirational manner what better way to do it while earning some decent money than driving around for uber and lyft    these services are without a doubt revolutionary and are being used and employed by both young and old men and women struggling students and strategically utilized by incredibly wealthy and successful hollywood types and investment bankers it 's cheap reliable and very fun too it 's also bringing back the long lost art of human interaction and conversation back into our daily lives    so far so good and it breaks my heart whenever i hear misinformation and astroturfing about these services throughout the internet and i 'm supremely as to how certain municipalities are colluding with taxi cab lobbies to prevent uber and lyft and other ride share services from competing fairly at a time where cities are desperate to ease reduce dui 's and make sure their citizens are happy and are left with more money in their

something to consider is how do you want to handle fractional shares most open end funds can easily go to fractional shares to that if you want to invest $ 500 in a fund each month it is a relatively easy transaction where some shares will be fractional and handled easily an etf may not always work that way unless you go through something like sharebuilder that would allow the fractional shares as if the etf is trading at $ you could buy 3 shares but still have $ 50 that you want to invest but ca n't as stocks trade in whole share numbers usually this is without adding brokerage commissions depending on the broker re investing dividends may or may not be that simple as fractional shares could be a problem since those 3 shares are n't likely to have enough of a dividend to equal another share being bought with the proceeds if you want the flexibility of stop and limit orders then the etf may make more sense while the open end fund is simply to invest whole dollar amounts that then lead to fractional shares do n't forget to factor in minimums and other stuff as vfiax may have a bit of a minimum to it as well as possible fees that could be annoying as i remember vfinx having some account maintenance fees that were a bit back in the day that may still be around in some cases so be sure to read the fine print on things

there is a measure of protection for investors it is not the level of protection provided by fdic or ncua but it does exist securities investor protection corporation what sipc protects sipc protects against the loss of cash and securities such as stocks    and bonds held by a customer at a financially troubled sipc member    brokerage firm the limit of sipc protection is $ 500,000 which    includes a $ 250,000 limit for cash most customers of failed brokerage    firms when assets are missing from customer accounts are protected    there is no requirement that a customer reside in or be a citizen of    the united states a non u.s. citizen with an account at a brokerage    firm that is a member of sipc is treated the same as a resident or    citizen of the united states with an account at a brokerage firm that    is a member of sipc sipc protection is limited sipc only protects the custody function of    the broker dealer which means that sipc works to restore to customers    their securities and cash that are in their accounts when the    brokerage firm liquidation begins sipc does not protect against the decline in value of your securities    sipc does not protect individuals who are sold worthless stocks and    other securities sipc does not protect claims against a broker for    bad investment advice or for recommending inappropriate investments it is important to recognize that sipc protection is not the same as    protection for your cash at a federal deposit insurance corporation    fdic insured banking institution because sipc does not protect the    value of any security investments in the stock market are subject to fluctuations in market    value sipc was not created to protect these risks that is why sipc    does not bail out investors when the value of their stocks bonds and    other investment falls for any reason instead in a liquidation sipc    replaces the missing stocks and other securities when it is possible    to do so

the irr is the discount rate r that makes net present value what this boils down to is two ways of making the same kind of profitability calculation   you can choose a project with or you can choose based on and the idea is you get to the same set of projects   that 's if everything is well behaved mathematically but that 's not the end of this story of finance math and alphabet soup for investments that have multiple positive and negative cash flows finding that r becomes solving for the roots of a polynomial in r so that there can be multiple roots   usually people use the lowest positive root but really it only makes sense for projects where for r < r and for r >    to try to help with your understanding you can evaluate a real estate project with find the sum future discounted cash flows which is the npv and do the project if    or you can take the future cash flows of a project find the npv as a function of the rate r and find r where that r is the irr   if irr = and the npv function is well behaved as above you can also do the project when we do n't have to worry about multiple roots the preceding two paragraphs will select the same identical sets of projects as meeting the 10 return requirement

so you 've already considered relocation here are a few additional things to consider with respect to negotiating a signing bonus if any would you be leaving a position where you are eligible for an upcoming bonus profit share or other special incentive payout such as a stock option or rsu vesting date   a signing bonus can help offset the opportunity cost of leaving a previous job when an incentive payout date is near at the new company would you be required to wait some pre defined period to be eligible to participate in the pension or retirement savings plan with employer basic or matching contributions if you were receiving ongoing employer contributions in your previous company 's plan and would need to wait say six months before participating in the new company 's plan a signing bonus can offset lost employer contributions in the interim consider funding your own ira in that time would you be required to give up something else of value to you that your previous employer was providing such as an expensive laptop that is not expected to otherwise be replaced by the new company whether they offer a signing bonus and how much you can expect to negotiate is based on a lot of factors and you 'll need to play it by ear   remember what bonus means a payment or gift added to what is usual or expected in particular remember also that a signing bonus is a one time thing   in general it 's more important to consider the overall ongoing compensation package salary and incentive plans vacation retirement benefits health benefits etc and whether those meet your long term needs

both models understand that the value of a company is the sum total of all cashflows in the future discounted back to the present they vary in their definition of cash the gordon growth model uses dividends as a proxy for cashflow under the assumption that this is the only true cash received by shareholders in theory counting cash is meaningless if there 's no eventual end game where the accumulated cash is up amongst the owners the gordon model is best used to value companies that have an established reliable dividend the company should be stable and the payout ratio high will underestimate the value of firms that consistently maintain a low payout ratio and instead accumulate cash there are multiple dcf models a firm valuation measures all cash available to both equity and debt holders a traditional equity valuation measures all cash that can be claimed by shareholders while the latter seems most intuitive and pertinent to a shareholder the former is very good at showing what a company can do regardless of their choice of capital structure a small add on to a firm valuation is the concept of eva or economic value add where the return on capital all capital both debt and equity is compared to the blended cost of capital the dcf model is more flexible optimistic than the gordon in its approach to cash the approach can be applied to many types of companies at every stage in their maturity even if they do n't pay a dividend a simplistic or single stage dcf is similar to the gordon the assumption is that the company is fully mature growing at a rate perhaps just slightly above inflation forever for younger companies a multi stage dcf can be employed where you forecast fairly confident numbers for the next 3 5 years then 3 5 years beyond that the forecast is less certain but assumed to be slowing growth and a generally maturing stabilizing company and then the steady state stage is tacked on to the end you 'll want to check out professor damodaran 's website he addresses all this and so much more and has a big pile of spreadsheets freely downloadable to get you started i also highly recommend his book investment valuation it 's the bible on the topic

overall i think it sounds like it 's worth it it 's hard to find that high of a rate on a checking account these days   it looks like you 're looking at this bank and i can see they have a few more requirements that seem a little tedious if you do n't do these things every month then you lose the great interest rate if you can think of an easy way to jump through these hoops and not forget then it 's probably worth it for example if you routinely eat out for lunch or buy a morning coffee you can use that card to pay for it set yourself a recurring reminder in your calendar or smartphone to remind you to login to the online banking site ultimately since this is an emergency fund it 's a good idea to keep it nice and liquid in a checking account you 're not likely going to find many other options that will give you a better and safe return and still keep your funds available for when you need them in summary it sounds like a good idea to me so long as you think you can reliably jump through their hoops

in the united states many banks aim to receive $ 100 per year per account in fees and interest markup   there are several ways that they can do this on a checking account   these examples assume that there is a 3 difference between low interest rate deposit accounts and low interest rate loans or some combination of these markups that adds up to $ 100 year   for example   a two dollar monthly fee = $ 24 year plus a $ 2,000 average balance at 0.05 = $ 29 year plus $ 250 month in rewards debit card usage = $ 24 year plus $ 2 month in atm fees = $ 24 year before it was taken over by chase manhattan in 2008 washington mutual had a business strategy of offering free checking with no monthly fees no annual fees and no charges by washington mutual for using atms   the catch was that the overdraft fees were not free   if the customers averaged 3 overdraft fees per year at $ 34 each washington mutual reached its markup target for the accounts

is there a solution here that would allow me to provide him with a    debit card in his name that i could fund that would n't have foreign    transaction fees associated with it i 'd probably be okay with a small    fixed atm fee   there are separate issues here   there is no law limiting bank accounts to u.s. citizens but most banks will not open an account for a non citizen outside their declared service area   there are substantial legal liabilities to the bank in allowing it whether a citizen or non citizen    the difficulty will be compliance with the patriot act   this is an extension of the older know your customer doctrine   it is improbable that the bank could comply with the act without the potential customer being physically present   you would have to check with your bank in advance as to their policies   banks are not required to accept a customer outside their policies as to waiving the foreign transaction fee that is very improbable   although a handful of institutions do this in specific cases it is uncommon because the bank is n't actually charging the fee they are passing it along   with a credit card they collect interest and waiving the fee can be thought of as a reduction in interest income that is n't possible on a debit card you would want to make sure you have a honest nephew   you could be held criminally liable for any actions he takes at both the state and the federal level   u.s. law is global   a citizen who commits a crime in any country of the world can be charged for it in the united states   by being on the account you can acquire any liabilities that are created as an   this is a bigger issue at the federal level because 4,000 federal laws do not require criminal intent   some do not require you to even know the action happened   unlike state law which generally requires you intended to commit a crime and had to be aware of it federal law often does not   it is also not adequate that the action is legal in russia if it would be illegal in the united states if i get a card in my name and give it to him to use to withdraw money from atms is that legal what problems might that cause it is legal but you are now strictly liable for its use   see the above answer   it would probably get shut down anyway when they phone you and asked are you in russia right now   the bank is still liable for you giving away the card   the bank may close out all your accounts and submit a currency transaction report on you to the treasury for possible money laundering wire the money   plan out how much and when but just wire it

normally i 'd say that because of the magic of compound interest balances of high rate cards shoot up rapidly so pay off the high rate cards one by one until they 're all zero in this case though 23 20 19 are close enough that i 'd pay off the card with the highest balance then 2nd highest then 3rd and leave the card for last note that sooner than you think other card companies will send you low rate balance transfer   take one asap and pay it down as much as possible so that when the low introductory rate is over the balance on your now high rate card is low bottom line balances on high interest rate card accumulate incredibly quickly so kill them first one at a time

the level 2 data is simply showing the depth of the market if i am trading shares with my broker i have the option of viewing only the top 10 bid ask prices in the depth or all of the data which sometimes can be a very long list with another broker i get the top ten bid and ask prices and how many orders are available for each price level or i have the option of listing each order separately for each price level in order of when the order was placed i get the same kind of data if trading options i do not know about futures because i do n't trade them simply this data may be important to a trader because it may give an indication of whether there are more buyers or sellers in the market which in turn may but not always give an indication of which way the market may be moving as an example the price depth below shows before market open with sellers the buyers in both numbers and volume   this gives an indication that prices may drop when the market opens of course there could be some good news coming out prior to market open or just after causing a flood of buyers into the market and sellers to cancel their orders this would change everything around with more buyers than sellers and indicate that prices may now be going up the market depth is an important aspect to look at before putting an order in as it can give an indication of which way the market is moving especially in a very liquid security or market

i do nt think the author really understands why or how credit bureaus work why they exist and therefore where the blame exists for incorrect data no credit bureau wants incorrect data for obvious reasons but it happens that 's one reason why they let you get access to your credit score to check it the data is correct and make the product data about you better the source of the data is always to blame for something being incorrect though   that 's banks utilities companies etc   a credit bureau ca n't check any more than they do already but they can improve how they deal with mistakes or badly matched data not sure about how that works in the us but here in eu there are strict rules about how mistakes are corrected and how long it takes   as for storing it in block chain that would n't really solve ops problem with credit bureaus someone still needs to collect and match data and that 's arguably harder than securing the data in the first place

banks are not your friends they are not performing services for you because they like you they are a business and they make money by borrowing money from you at low interest and loaning it out at higher interest they are trying to persuade you to deposit more money however briefly in their bank so they can loan out more money they are probably also counting on the fact that most folks wo n't go to the trouble of setting up accounts at multiple banks with the automatic transfers in order to meet the required deposit threshold that lets them save on the interest payments to consumers that are individually tiny but significant in the aggregate

one difference is in the ability to split the pre tax and after tax portions of the traditional account note that earnings in a traditional ira or traditional 401(k are always pre tax even if it was earned from after tax money so if you left the money for some amount of time after an after tax contribution chances are it 's a mix of pre tax and after tax money when you take money out of a traditional ira including for conversion to a roth ira you are generally subject to the pro rata rule which means that your withdrawal will consist of pre tax and after tax amounts in the same proportion as in your whole traditional ira this means that a conversion of a traditional ira with any mix of pre tax and after tax amounts will always be taxed on a portion of the withdrawal the pre tax portion and it will leave some after tax amounts in the traditional ira unless you take everything out the only way to separate the pre tax and after tax amounts is to roll over to a traditional 401(k if you have a 401(k plan that allows this rules say that only pre tax amounts can be rolled over into a 401(k so only pre tax amounts are rolled over and if you roll over all the pre tax amounts only after tax amounts will remain on the other hand when you rollover your entire traditional 401(k to iras you can choose to have the pre tax portion rolled over to a traditional ira and the after tax portion rolled over to a roth ira separating them due to irs notice 2014 54

i recently paid off a line of credit on an investment property that i own   i had some surplus cash and decided to pay off the line of credit rather than to make a principal payment on the primary mortgage with a higher interest rate   the interest rate on the line of credit was tiny and the balance was also pretty low my reasoning was that by paying off the line of credit i would be done with that account and would have one less bill to pay each month one less risk of something going wrong and a late payment hurting my credit one less statement to reconcile each month and one less bookkeeping core to manage   i could have grown my net worth by few couple of dollars each month had i kept the line of credit and made a principal payment on the primary loan i judged that it was n't worth the hassle and risks

i 've found that the most effective way to get things done is to communicate directly in person or over the phone if the former is not possible then to follow up with an immediate email per our conversation etc   this allows the natural conversations to occur connecting you with you team members and direct reports while also holding everyone accountable in writing   accountability is n't about being able to say i told you so nor is it about waiting for an opportunity to make someone look bad accountability is about ensuring that no one falls behind or lets the team down in the first place through preventative measures   this comes back full circle to my point on communication the most effective method of management in my experience is simply leading by example when you lead by example you never need to threaten employees with discipline or accountability you simply do what you do and if people respect you for the way you work they will look up to you as a role model your team members will do everything they can to support the team 's objectives on their own accord   source i learned this through a former manager he motivated me to be more committed to the team 's objectives and now i get to pay that forward to my direct reports   edit typos on mobile

well futures do n't have a strike like an option the price represents how much you 're obligated to buy sell the index for at a specified date in the future   you are correct that there 's no cost to enter a contract though there may be broker fees and margin payments   any difference between the contract price and the price of the index at settlement is what is exchanged at settlement    it 's analogous to the bid ask on a stock the bid price represents the price at which someone is willing to buy a futures contract meaning enter into a long position and the ask is how much someone is willing to sell a contract so if you want to take a long position on s&p500 mini futures you 'd have to enter in at the ask price   if the index is above your contract price on the future expiry date you 'll make a profit if it is below the contract price you 'll take a loss

the common opinion is an oversimplification at best the problem with buying a house using cash is that it may leave you cash poor forcing you to take out a home equity loan at some point which may be at a higher rate than the mortgage would have been on the other hand knowing that you have no obligation to a lender is quite nice and many folks prefer eliminating that source of stress if you can get a mortgage at a sufficiently low rate using it to leverage an investment is not a bad strategy average historical return on the stock market is around 8 so any mortgage rate lower than that is a relatively good bet and a rate much lower as now is that much better a bet there is of course some risk involved and the obligation to make mortgage payments and your actual return is reduced by what you 're paying on the mortage but it 's still a pretty good deal as far as investment vehicles the same answers apply as always you want a rate of return higher than what you 're paying on the mortgage preferably market rate of return or better cds wo n't do it as you 've found you 're going to have to increase the risk to increase the return that does mean picking and maintaining a diversified balance of investments and investment types working with index funds makes diversifying within a type easy but you 're probably going to want both stocks and bonds rebalancing between them when they drift too far from your desired mix   my own investments are a specific mix with one each of bond fund large cap fund small cap fund reit and international fund bonds are the biggest part of that since they 're lowest risk but the others play a greater part in producing returns on the investments the exact mix that would be optimal for you depends on your risk tolerance i 'm classified as a moderately aggressive investor the time horizon you 're looking at before you may be forced to pull money back out of the investments and some matters of personal taste i 've been averaging about 10 but i had the luxury of being able to ride out the depression and indeed invest during it against that my mortgage is under 4 interest rate and is for less than 80 of the purchase price so i did n't need to pay the surcharge for mortgage insurance in fact i borrowed only half the cost of the house and paid the rest in cash specifically because leveraging does involve some risk and this was the level of risk i was comfortable with i also set the duration of the loan so it will be paid off at about the same time i expect to retire again that 's very much a personal judgement if you need specific advice it 's worth finding a financial counselor and having them help you run the numbers do not go with someone associated with an investment house they 're going to be biased toward whatever produces the most income for them select someone who is strictly an advisor they may cost you a bit more but they 're more likely to give you useful advice do n't take my word for any of this i know enough to know how little i know but hopefully i 've given you some insight into what the issues are and what questions you need to ask and answer before making your decisions

you can look at it from a fundamental perspective to see who benefits from rising oil prices that 's a high level analysis and the devil is in the details higher oil prices may favour electric car producers for example or discount clothes retailers vs. branded clothes manufacturers another approach it to use a statistical analysis i have run a quick and dirty correlation of the various s&p sector indices against the oil prices crude based on the the results below you would conclude that materials and energy stocks should perform well with rising oil prices there again it is a behaviour you would expect at the group level but it may not translate to each individual company within those groups in particular in the materials sector where some would benefit and some would be affected you could get exposure to those sectors using etfs such as and in the us or you could run the same analysis for each stock within the s&p 500 or whatever index you are looking at and create a portfolio with the stocks that are the most correlated with oil prices this is calculated over 10 years of monthly returns after removing the market component from the individual sectors the two important columns are

without knowing actual numbers it 's tough to say   personally i would pay off the car then going forward use the money that would have been paid on your car note toward your mortgage   i always think of things in the worst possible scenario   it 's easier and faster to repossess a car than to foreclose on real estate   also in an emergency situation depleting your fund for your car loan and your mortgage would be significantly more detrimental than only paying a mortgage with a car owned outright   fewer obligations means fewer things to draw down your funds in an emergency whether the tax deductability of the mortgage interest outweighs the lower rate on your car loan will depend on a lot of factors that have n't been shared   i think it 's safe to assume with only 1 of separation the real difference is n't significant   i think when determining which credit cards to pay off choosing the one with the highest rate is smart   but that 's not the situation you 're in if you do n't have foreclosure concerns i 'd still pay off the car then start investing

this is a very common misconception i 've been studying equities and credits for a while now and the simplest way to explain the difference is this   credit is about stable cash flows your investment in a bond has almost read almost nothing to do with growth rate it has everything to do with how stable the cash flows are and interest coverage   equity is about growth no wonder companies with highly irregular cash flows e.g. every single young tech company in the history of tech companies can have the most in demand equity while few bond investors would touch them with a ten foot pole

the response to this question will be different depending which of the investment you are using   value investors look at the situation the company is in and try to determine what the company is worth and what it will be worth in the future then they look at the current stock price and decide whether or not the stock is priced at a good deal or not if the stock price is priced lower than they believe the company is worth they would want to buy stock and if the price rises above what they believe to be the true value they would sell these types of investors are not looking at the history or trend of what the price has done in the past only what the current price is and where they believe the price should be in the future   technical analysis investors do something different it is their belief that as stock prices go up and down they generally follow patterns by looking at a chart of what a stock price has been in the past they try to predict where it is headed and buy or sell based on that prediction   in general value investors are longer term investors and technical analysis investors are short term investors   the advice you are considering makes a lot of sense if you are using technical analysis if you have a stock that is trending down your strategy probably tells you to sell buying more in the hopes of turning things around would be seen as a mistake it is like the gambler in vegas who keeps playing a game he is losing hoping that his luck changes   however for the value investor the historical price of a stock and even the amount you currently have gained or lost in the stock are essentially ignored all that matters is whether or not the stock price is above or below the true value determined by the investor for him if the stock price falls and he believes the company still has a high value it could be a signal to buy more the above advice does n't really apply for them   many investors do n't follow either of these strategies they believe that it is too difficult and risky to try to predict the future price of an individual stock instead they invest in many companies all at once using index mutual funds believing that the stock market as a whole always heads up over a long time frame those investors do n't care at all if the prices of stock are going up or down they simply keep investing each month and hold until they have another use for the money the above advice is n't useful for them at all   no matter which kind of investing you are doing the most important thing is to pick a strategy you believe in and follow the plan without emotion emotions can cause investors to make mistakes and start buying when their strategy tells them to sell   instead of trying to follow fortune cookie advice like do n't throw good money after bad choose an investment strategy make a plan test it and follow it cautiously after all it may be a bad plan for what it is worth i am the third type of investor listed above i do n't buy individual stocks and i do n't look at the stock prices when investing more each month your description of your own strategy as buy and hold suggests you might prefer the same approach

you put in a market order when you want to sell to whomever raises their hand first   it results in the fastest possible liquidation of your stock it 's appropriate when you need to sell now regardless of price an example of when to use it it 's pm the market 's going to close in 5 minutes and you need to sell some stocks to make some kind of urgent payment elsewhere   if instead you have a limit order in place you might not reach the limit price before the market closes and you 'll still own the stock which might not be what you want

the second part of your question is the easiest to answer how much manual work is involved in settlement processes payment systems which handle low value i.e. high volume transactions work on the basis of net settlement each of the individual payments are netted across all of the participant banks so that only one real payment is made by each bank some days banks will receive money others they will pay money this is arbitrary and depends on whether their outbound payments exceed their inbound payments for that day    the payment system will notify each bank how much it owes will receive for the day the money is then transferred between all of the banks simultaneously by the payment system to remove the risk that some pay and others do n't if you 're going to make or receive a very large payment you 're going to want to make certain that its correct this means that if there 's a discrepancy you need operations people available to find out why its wrong    when dealing with this many payments answering that question can be hard did we miss a payment is there a duplicate etc   the vast majority of payments will process without any human involvement but to make the process work you always need human brains there to fix problems that occur this brings me to your first question on every day that settlement happens a bank will receive or pay a very large sum of money as a settlement bank you must settle that money the guarantee that every bank will pay is one of the main reasons these systems exist for settlement to happen every bank has to agree to participate and be ready to verify the data on their side and deliver the funds from their account so there is no particular reason that this does n't happen on weekends and holidays other than history but for any payment system to change it would require the support of at least a majority of participants to pay staff to manage the settlement process on weekends this would increase costs for banks but the benefits would only really be for you and me if at all that means it 's unlikely to happen unless a government forces the issue

this is really the best thing you can do for any salary job in the interview process it makes negotiating salaries so much easier and you have a baseline to tell if they 're trying to short you or what they thought of your interview   granted you should be adjusting for experience on a case by case basis but i 've pointed to this in interviews when salary came up and politely said the average i have a lot of experience in the field so i think is an appropriately adjusted amount none of my counter offers have been lower than the average

i was wondering how future cash flows of the asset are predicted are they also predicted using fundamental and/or technical analysis there are a many ways to forecast the future cash flows of assets for example for companies it seems like calculating expected required rate using capm does not belong to either fundamental or technical analysis does it i would qualify the capm as quantitative analysis because it 's mathematics and statistics it 's not really fundamental since its does not relies on economical data except the prices and as for technical analysis the term is often used as a synonym for graphical analysis or but quantitative analysis can also be referred as technical analysis the present value of future cash flows called intrinsic price value if i am correct yes you are correct i wonder when deciding whether an asset is over fair under valued what kind of price is compared to what other kind of price if it 's only to compare with the price usually the net asset value which is the book value the discount cash flows the intrinsic value and the price of comparable companies and the capm are used in comparison to current market price of the asset that you are studying why is it in the quote to compare the first two kinds of prices instead of comparing the current real price on the markets to any of the other three kinds actually the last line of the quote says that the comparison is done on the observed price which is the market price the other prices ca n't really be observed but think that the part an asset is correctly priced when its estimated price is the same as the present value of future cash flows of the asset means that since the capm gives you an expected rate of return by using this rate to compute the present value of future cash flows of the asset you should have the same predicted price i wrote this post explaining some valuation strategies maybe you can find some more information by reading it

your quote from the cbo is talking about a actual subsidy as stated there was a cash value difference between what the treasury purchased troubled assets from banks at and what the market value of those securities were    this the point mentioned in the article is not an actual subsidy   as a counter argument to your first paragraph look at lehman brothers and bear stearns

pro sports prices are too high anyway   going by yourself it 's easy to drop $ 100 or more for the ticket parking food and maybe one beer   ridiculous   you can get a high end meal far better than a hot dog then go watch the game at a bar for half the price   you can get a better experience for much less money   no wonder ticket sales are declining   the reason baseball became america 's pastime was that it was accessible to everyone   common working people could afford to attend games regularly   if you want to attend regularly today you better be earning over six figures

this is n't exactly the answer you were looking for but it is something else to consider rather than just running money through the card to get the bonus have you considered spending that $ 5,000 in the form of good debt in other words can you purchase some asset that will create more cashflow than you would be paying on the card with the $ 5,000 balance the idea is instead of running up the balance and paying it back off to get the bonus maybe you could buy an asset for $ 5,000 create positive cashflow with the opportunity for long term capital gains and get the credit card bonus you could even turn around and use the bonus to pay back part of the credit card balance thus reducing the payments and widening the profit margin on the asset

in the short term the market is a popularity contest in the short run which in value investing time can extend even to many years an equity is subject to the of the whims by every scale of panic and this can be seen by examining the daily chart of any large cap equity in the us   even such large holdings can be affected by any set of fear and greed in the market and in the subset of traders trading the equity quantitatively this statement means that equities experience high variance in the short in the long term the stock market is a weighing machine in the long run which in value investing time can extend to even multiple decades an equity is more or less subject only to the variance of the underlying value this can be seen by examining the annual chart of even the smallest cap equities over decades   an equity over such time periods is almost exclusively affected by its changes in value quantitatively this statement means that equities experience low variance in the long run
