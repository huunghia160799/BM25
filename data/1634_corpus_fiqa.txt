let me first start off by saying that you need to be careful with an s corp and defined contribution plans   you might want to consider an llc or some other entity form depending on your state and other factors you should read this entire page on the irs site   s corp retirement plan faq but here is a small clip contributions to a self employed plan you ca n’t make contributions to a self employed retirement plan from your s corporation    distributions although as an s corporation shareholder you receive    distributions similar to distributions that a partner receives from a    partnership your shareholder distributions are n’t earned income for    retirement plan purposes see irc section therefore you    also ca n’t establish a self employed retirement plan for yourself    solely based on being an s corporation shareholder there are also some issues and cases about reasonable compensation in s corp   i recommend you read the irs site 's s corporation compensation and medical insurance issues page answers as i see them but i recommend hiring cpa you should be able to do option b.   the limitations are in place for the two different types of contributions   elective deferrals and employer nonelective contributions   i am going to make a leap and say your talking about a sep here therefore you ca n't setup one were the employee could contribute post 1997 if your doing self employee 401k be careful to not make the contributions yourself if your wife is employed the by company here calculation is separate and the company could make a separate contribution for her the limitation for sep in 2015 are 25 of employee 's compensation or $ 53,000   since you will be self employed you need to calculate your net earnings from self employment which takes into account the part of your self employment tax and contributions business makes to sep   good read on at irs site and take a look at chapter 2 of publication 560 i hope that helps and i recommend hiring a cpa in your area to help

http://www             how to break 90 golf is a lifelong pursuit that will always challenge may entertain and will almost certainly at times   for most players golf scores similar to those consistently seen from our favorite pros may be unattainable   a more reasonable goal for most is to find a way first to routinely break 90 but how do you get there   a few regular adjustments will provide the best opportunities to do so pre shot routine every needs a pre shot routine that happens every time you approach the ball for example during practice always visualize a target plan your shot and try to see the outcome take one or two practice swings to get a feel for the stroke before you step to the ball the key to this is consistency if it happens every time you can begin to take the guesswork out of your game golf    practice more than you play do n’t try to fix your mistakes on the back nine when you are on the course you should n’t be thinking about how to correct your stroke grip stance etc in fact if you ’ve done the work off the course you should n’t have to think about much at all trust your muscle memory to do what you have practiced   practice the minimum to perfect any physical skill it is important to focus on the smallest amount of information possible at one time you can not simultaneously pay attention to the plane of your stroke while thinking about the weight on your left foot and refining your grip try to pick one small thing to focus on at one time and work it into your muscle memory practicing the minimum will allow you to stop thinking about each factor of the game while on the course again the goal of this process is to make your motions automatic and fluid   care less   it may seem counterintuitive but when you step onto the golf course the more invested you are in each shot the less you can rely on the hard work you have put into your game during practice do the work on the driving range so that you do n’t need to worry about it when you need it   http://www

mhoran_psprep has answered the question well about shorting e.g. making a profit if the stock price goes down however a ceo can take out insurance called hedging against the stock price going down in relation to stocks they already own in some cases     but is must be disclosed in public filings etc this may be done for example if most of the ceo ’s money is in the stock of the company and they ca n’t sell for tax reasons     normally it would only be done for part of the ceo ’s holding

here 's another way that i look at it   say you and me were 50 50 partners in a small business suppose we wanted to expand our business but that needed money someone let 's call him warren has the money we need hence in return for the money we offer warren an equal stake in the business   i.e. all three of us own 33 stake now for both you and me our stake reduced from   50 that it was before warren 's entry to only 33 now   while that reduction in our share may seem at first sight a bad deal for us we both agreed to give warren his share consciously not out of altruism but because it made business sense to helps us expand   ergo what matters is not just your share of the pie but the size of the pie itself and hence dilution of stake can make sense under certain circumstances   two small points a this does n't   in any way show the dilution must make sense only that it can sometimes make sense b of course in the case of a large corporation they do not need your personal approval for the dilution but hey neither do they ask you when they buy a new plant or start a new product

you have no recourse on the spot to do anything to the vendor other than pay the fee pay cash or walk away   if you 're on a mission with longer term horizon than immediate satisfaction your options will vary by state   if you 're in a state where the fees are legal and the owner is potentially violating an agreement with the card company you can report the vendor to the card company   they may or may not really care   if you 're in a state where the fee is actually illegal you 'd need to see what options you have with the local authorities you should keep in mind that if the vendor is violating an agreement that 's between the vendor and the card company only you have absolutely no rights to enforce that agreement   you only have legal rights if you 're a party to the agreement in question or if the law gives you some special rights specific to given circumstances the lawyers call this having standing   likewise if the vendor is doing something that 's not consistent with the agreement between you and the card company you also have no claim against the vendor because the vendor is not party to your agreement with the card company although you might have a claim against the card company

banks have a financial and duty called know your customer established to avoid a number of historical problems occurring again such as money laundering terrorism financing fraud etc thanks to the scale and scope of the problem millions of customers billions of transactions a day the way they 're handling this usually involves fuzzy matching looking for irregular patterns problem escalation and other warning signs when exceeding some pre set limit these signal clues are then filtered and passed on for human inspection needless to say these algorithms are not perfect although thanks to financial pressure they are improving in order to understand why your trading account has been suspended it 's useful to look at the incentives false positives your trade and assuming you guilty until proven could cost them merely your ltv lifetime value of customer much your business brings in as profit while false negatives catching you while engaging in activities listed might cost them multi month investigations penalties and court   ultimately this is n't against you i 've been with the bank for 15 years and the money in the accounts has been very slowly accumulated via direct deposit paychecks over that time from this i gather the most likely explanation is that you 've hit of account threshold that the average credit happy customers usually do not exceed which triggered a routine checkup how do you deal with it practice there is only one way to survive angry customers emotionally you have to realize that they ’re not angry at you they ’re angry at your business and you just happen to be a convenient representative of that business and since they ’re treating you like a puppet an iconic stand in for the real business you need to treat yourself as a puppet too pretend you ’re a the customer is yelling at the puppet they ’re not yelling at you they ’re angry with the puppet your job is to figure out gosh what can i make the puppet say that will make this person a happy customer   in an investigation case go with boredom the puppet does n't care have no feelings and is patient figure out what are the most likely words that will have the matter mentally resolved from the investigator 's point of view tell them what they have to hear and you 'll have case closed in no time hope this helps

i do n't know what you mean by claim for taxes i think you mean pay taxes    i 'm not sure how corps function in canada but in the us single owner limited liability entities typically pass the net income through to the owner to be included in their personal tax return    so it seems all of this is more or less moot because really you should probably already be including your income sourced from this project on your personal taxes and that 's not really likely to change if you formed something more formal   the formal business arrangements really exist to limit the liability of the business spilling over in to the owner 's assets   or trouble in the owner 's life spilling over to the business operation   i do n't know what kind of business this is but it may make sense to set up one of the limited liability arrangements to ensure that business liability does n't automatically mean personal liability a sole proprietorship or in the us we have dba doing business as paperwork will get you a separate tax i d number which may be beneficial if you ever have to provide a tax id and do n't want to use your individual id but this wo n't limit your liability the way incorporating does

well for starters you want to rent it for more than the apartment costs you   aside from mortgage you have insurance and maintenance costs   if you are going to have a long term rental property you need to make a profit or at a bare minimum break even   personally i would not like the break even option because there are unexpected costs that turn break even into a severe loss basically the way i would calculate the minimum rent for an apartment i owned would be payment + + other costs you provide + expected annual maintenance costs 100 + of profit i want to make this is a business arrangement   unless you are some of your losses in another manner then it is bad business to maintain a business relationship that is costing you money   the only thing that may be worth considering is what comparable rentals go for in your area   you may be forced to take a loss if the rental market in your area is depressed   but i suspect that right now your condo is renting at a steal of a rate   i would also suspect that the number you get from the above formula falls pretty close to what the going rate in your area is

does your job give you access to confidential information such that you can only buy or sell shares in the company during certain windows   employees with access to company financial data resource planning databases or customer databases are often only allowed to trade in company securities or derivatives thereof during certain windows a few days after the company releases its quarterly earnings reports   even those windows can be cancelled if a major event is about to be announced   these windows are designed to prevent the appearance of insider trading which is a serious crime in the united states is there a minimum time that you would need to hold the stock before you are allowed to sell it   do you have confidence that the stock would retain most of its value long enough that your profits are long term capital gains instead of short term capital gains what happens to your stock if you lose your job retire or go to another company does your company 's stock price seem to be inflated by any of these factors if any of these nine warning flags are the case i would think carefully before investing if i had a basic emergency fund set aside and none of the nine warning flags are present or if i had a solid emergency fund and the company seemed likely to continue to justify its stock price for several years i would seriously consider taking full advantage of the stock purchase plan   i would not invest more money than i could afford to lose at first i would cash out my profits quickly either as quickly as allowed or as quickly as lets me minimize my capital gains taxes   i would reinvest in more shares until i could afford to buy as many shares as the company would allow me to buy at the discount in the long run i would avoid having more than one third of my net worth in any single investment   e.g. company stock home equity bonds in general et cetera

the process of borrowing shares and selling them is called shorting a stock or going short   when you use money to buy shares it is called going long in general your strategy of going long and short in the same stock in the same amounts does not gain you anything   let 's look at your two scenarios to see why when you start loot is trading at $ 20 per share   you purchased 100 shares for $ 2000 and you borrowed and sold 100 shares for $ 2000   you are both long and short in the stock for $ 2000   at this point you have invested $ 2000 and you got your $ 2000 back from the short proceeds   you own and owe 100 shares under scenario a the price goes up to $ 30 per share   your long shares have gone up in value by $ 1000   however you have lost $ 1000 on your short shares   your short is called and you return your 100 shares and have to pay interest   under this scenario after it is all done you have lost whatever the interest charges are under scenario b the prices goes down to $ 10 per share   your long shares have lost $ 1000 in value   however your short has gained $ 1000 in value because you can buy the 100 shares for only $ 1000 and return them and you are left with the $ 1000 out of the $ 2000 you got when you first sold the shorted shares   however because your long shares have lost $ 1000 you still have n't gained anything   here again you have lost whatever the interest charges are as explained in the traders exclusive article that posted in the comments there are investors that go long and short on the same stock at the same time   however this might be done if the investor believes that the stock will go down in a short term time frame but up in the long term time frame   the investor might buy and hold for the long term but go short for a brief time while holding the long position however that is not what you are suggesting   your proposal makes no prediction on what the stock might do in different periods of time   you are only attempting to hedge your bets   and it does n't work   a long position and a short position are opposites to each other and no matter which way the stock moves you 'll lose the same amount with one position that you have gained in the other position   and you 'll be out the interest charges from the borrowed shares every time with your comment you have stated that your scenario is that you believe that the stock will go up long term but you also believe that the stock is at a short term peak and will drop in the near future   this however does n't really change things much   let 's look again at your possible scenarios you believe that the stock is a long term buy but for some reason you are guessing that the stock will drop in the short term   under scenario a you were incorrect about your short term guess   and although you might have been correct about the long term prospects you have missed this gain   you are out the interest charges and if you still think the stock is headed up over the long term you 'll need to buy back in at a higher price under scenario b it turns out that you were correct about the short term drop   you pocket some cash but there is no guarantee that the stock will rise anytime soon   your investment has lost value and the gain that you made with your short is still tied up in stocks that are currently down your strategy does prevent the possibility of the unlimited loss inherent in the short   however it also prevents the possibility of the unlimited gain inherent in the long position     and this is a shame since you fundamentally believe that the stock is undervalued and is headed up   you are your long term gains for a chance at a small short term gain

whatever you choose for a remedy my first impulse is to suggest bankruptcy you should protect your retirement plans   these are immune from most collection actions the exception being govt debts e.g. taxes and student loans   the sad part is that the student loans wo n't go away except by paying them off   miss one payment and it will you for 10 years   bankruptcy will stop you from getting a home loan for only two years   unless you have the discipline to live like a monk for a decade it sounds like you 're headed for a train wreck   the kids will have to cut back to junior college or some other method of reducing costs and as hard as it sounds do n't cosign for any more student loans kids are more resilient than you think and they 'll probably come up with their own solutions like scholarships work study and off campus jobs   i hate to keep beating the bankruptcy horse but at least that way you could still keep your house and car   otherwise you risk losing either or both from missed payments   i actually hope that you can avoid bankruptcy so i suggest first you talk to a financial adviser or bankruptcy attorney to see if this is in fact right for you but if it 's just the shame of the letter b then consider that pride does n't keep a roof over your head or food in your belly

here 's how i think about money there are only 3 categories contexts buckets that my earned money falls into savings is my emergency fund i keep 6 months of total expenses expenses are anything in the consumption bucket you can be as detailed as you want with this area but i tend to leave a fudge factor in other words if i estimate that i spend approximately $ 3,000 a month in consumption dollars then i 'll save $ 3,500 times 6 in the bank this money needs to be liquid some people use a heloc other people use their roth contributions in any case you need to put this money some place you can get access to it in case you go from accumulation income exceed expenses to mode expenses exceed income this money is distinct from consumption which i will cover in paragraph three investments are stocks bonds income producing real estate small businesses etc these dollars require a strategy the strategy can include some form of asset allocation but more importantly a timeline these are the dollars that are working for you each dollar placed here will multiply over time once you put a dollar here it should n't be taken out unless there is some sort of catastrophe that your savings ca n't handle or your timeline has been achieved notice that rental real estate is included so liquidating stocks to purchase rental real estate is not considered removing investment dollars just reallocating based on your asset allocation this bucket includes 401k 's iras all tax sheltered accounts non sheltered brokerage accounts and rental real estate in general your primary residence is not included in this bucket some people include the equity of their primary residence in the investment column but it can complicate the equation and i prefer to leave it out the consumption bucket is the most important bucket and the one you spend the most time with it requires a budget this includes your $ 5 magazine and your $ 200 bottle of wine anything in this bucket is gone you can recover a portion of it by selling it on ebay for $ 3 these are earned dollars but the original $ 5 is still considered spent the reason your thought process in this area is distinct from the other two the decisions made in this area will have the biggest impact on your personal finances warren buffett was famous for on haircuts because they are worth thousands of dollars down the road if they are invested instead remember this is a zero sum game so every $ 1 not consumed is placed in one of the other buckets once your savings bucket is full every dollar not consumed is sent to investments remember to include everything that does not fit in the other two buckets most people forget their car insurance life insurance tax bill at the end of the year accountant bill etc in conclusion there are three buckets savings which serve as your emergency bucket this money should not be touched unless you switch from accumulation to investments which are your dollars that are working for you over time they require a strategy and a timeline consumption which are your monthly expenses these dollars keep you alive and contribute to your enjoyment this is a short explanation of my use of money it can get as complicated and detailed as you want it to be but as long as you tag your dollars correctly you 'll be okay imho hth

not so much a scam if you fill the required paperwork and actually take time to mail it in assuming it 's done correctly you will get your money that being said having a mail in rebate program is usually a win win for the seller while they may have to pay a small fee to a third party who handles the rebate almost always this influences a potential buyer to choose a specific product over the alternative the seller knows very well that very few people will actually go through with it and yes they do often make the process needlessly complicated and long as a deterrent   plus let 's be real no one likes sending out physical letters anymore from a marketing standpoint the mail in rebate is a brilliant idea however it 's usually more of an annoyance for the consumer

i understand economics quite well this whole idea that the market will correct itself is bullshit the government did n't come up with rules like you ca n't discriminate against people for the fun of it but under some free market theory you would expect that one to solve itself well it did n't   have you ever answered the phones for cab company on new year 's eve no well i have five years in a row i can take 80 phone calls in an hour i 've told people it 'll be four hours for a cab because that 's how long it would take and they say send it it 's shitty because i ca n't refuse the call legally and there 's no way in hell they 're going to be there when the cab finally gets driver 's on the street constantly contend with waiting for someone to come out and a bidding war starting to hire them i 've heard $ 80 offered as a tip to take a group before although $ 20 seems to be more the standard bribe   there 's no economic behavior to serve shitty neighborhoods the riders do n't tip and the driver is at an increased risk of being robbed and violently attacked why do cab companies serve them because the city legally requires it and in reality there are at least some decent people whose only option is to take a cab   so congratulations you took the same microeconomics class that i did and all the theory dictates that this should all work itself out you get to throw around like ceteris but things are never all things being equal the difference is i also spent a number of years going to the school of hard knocks and learned from reality how things actually work

there are cases in which some lease agreements will allow you to exit them without charge but you can not simply a location without paying cases that would allow you to leave the lease if they are stated within the lease are usually for reasons like if you can prove that you have a job that is over a certain distance from the place you are currently residing in there may be a clause that would allow you to break you lease or simply the landlord may be more willing to allow you to go if situations have changed and conditions are now such that you can not safely live in the place you may be able to break the lease   if you have a copy of your lease look for these clauses or others near the end that 's where they appear in mine   there are also other situations where if you give sufficient notice and have been a long time tenant breaking a lease may be only a small fee certainly worth looking into rather than facing any legal recourse

another possibility is that a lot of it is bought using borrowed money especially if much of your own money is in the stock market it may be beneficial to take out a loan to buy something compared to selling other assets to raise the same amount of cash even going by the likely relatively conservative £ 200k year before taxes you are looking at a very nice house going for perhaps around 3 5 years worth of pre tax income let 's say you have good contacts at the bank and can secure a loan for £ 500 k at 3.5 interest not at all unreasonable if you make half that before taxes in a single year and purchase something that can be used as collateral for the money borrowed with a bit of negotiating i would n't be surprised if one could push the interest rate even lower and stock in a publicly traded company can also trivially be used as collateral that 's less than £ 1500/month in interest before any applicable tax effects less than 10 of the before tax income and like @victor wrote i think it 's reasonable to say that especially if the company is publicly traded the ceo makes more than £ 200k year given an income of £ 200k year and assuming 30 taxes on that amount the marginal tax would likely be higher and this includes e.g. interest expense deductions the money left over after taxes and interest payments on a £ 500 k 3.5 debt is still about £ 10k month even with a pretty rapid amortization schedule and even if the actual tax rate is higher that leaves quite a bit of money to be away in savings and other investments

but what if i am getting paid salary from a source in india in other words it may be that in india a research assistant at a college on average earns a third of what a research assistant like me earns here in us in that case even if my cost of living there is much less so is my salary there are sites that provide a good guidance for what the average salary for an profession with x years of experience would be of course some would get paid more than average so you can try and make a logic if in us say you are being paid more than average you would be paid more than average elsewhere plus if moving from developed to developing country one has the advantage of positive pedigree bias   there are also websites that would give the purchasing power parity for quite a few currency pairs the real difficulty to find is whether the lifestyle you have in a specific country would be similar in other country if you compare like for like it becomes slightly skewed if you compare equivalence then can you adjust   a relevant example my friend in us had a independent bungalow in us it was with basement and attic 2 levels of living space with 4 bedroom he shifted to india and got a great salary compared to normal indian salary however this kind of house in india in bangalore would be affordable only to ceo 's of top companies so is living in a 3 room apartment fine there are multiple such aspects drinking a starbucks coffee couple of times a day is routine for quite a few in us in india this would be considered luxury a like for equivalent comparison is one drinks 3 4 mugs of coffee in us and average indian drinks tea coffee 3 4 mugs in india the local tea coffee would be rs 10 rs 20 a starbucks would come with starting price of rs 150 the same applies to food a in india would be around rs 100 the indian equivalent is for rs 10 a sub way would be rs 150 a equivalent mumbai sandwich around rs 25 i personally am picky about food so it does n't matter where i go i can only eat specific things which means i spend a huge amount of money if i am outside of india when i was in us i could n't afford a maid driver or any help in india i have 2 maids a cooking maid and a driver plus i get plumber electrician window cleaner and all the help without costing me much things that i absolutely ca n't dream in us my colleague in uk preferred to stay in a specific locality as it has a very good church so if its important one may find few good ones in india if one is roman catholic if one follows greek orthodox tough luck   citizenship does it matter a foreign national may never get an indian citizenship children do n't qualify either unless both parents are indian health care again is quite different one may feel health care in us is not good or very expensive but there are multiple aspects of this so in essence its very broad there is traffic cleanliness climate culture etc ps a research assistant in india is poorly paid because colleges do n't have funds research in fundamental science is quite low industry to university are primitive and now where close to what we have in us

do i make money in the stock market from other people losing money not normally the stock market as a whole on average increases in value over time so if we make the claim that the market is a zero sum game and you only make money if other people lose money that idea is not sustainable there are n't that many people that would keep investing in something only to continue to lose money to the winners the stock market and the companies inside it grow in value as the economy grows and the economy grows as workers add value with their work   here 's an analogy i can buy a tree seed for very little and plant it in the ground if i do nothing more it probably wo n't grow and it will be worth nothing however by taking the time to water it it weed it it and harvest it i can sell the produce for much more than i purchased that seed for no one lost money when i sell it i increased the value by adding my effort   if i sell that tree to a they can cut the tree into usable lumber and sell that lumber at a profit they added their efforts and increased the value   a carpenter can increase the value even further by making something useful a door for example a retail store can make that door more useful by transporting it to a location with a buyer and a builder can make it even more useful by installing it on a house   no one lost any money in any of these transactions they bought something valuable and made it more valuable by adding their effort   companies in the stock market grow in value the same way a company will grow in value as its employees produce things an investor provides capital that the company uses to be able to produce things and as the company grows it increases in value as the population increases and more workers and customers are born and as more useful things are invented the economy will continue to grow as a whole   certainly it is possible even common to profit from someone else 's loss   people lose money in the stock market all the time   but it does n't have to be this way   the stock market goes up on average over the long term and so long term investors can continue to make money in the market even without profiting from others failures an investor that purchases a share from another investor does not directly provide capital to the company   however this second investor is rewarding the first investor who did provide capital to the company   this is the reason that the first investor purchased in the first place without the second investor the first would have had no reason to invest and provide the capital   relating it to our tree analogy did the builder who installed the door help out the tree farmer   after all the tree farmer already sold the tree to the and does n't care what happens to it after that   however if the builder had not needed a door the would have had no reason to buy the tree

has a couple of articles on this topic how investing taxes work part 1 and part 2 the following is a summary of that article capital gains and dividends are taxed at a preferred rate while interest tax is taxed at your regular rate interest is taxed at your marginal rate but capital gains are taxed at only 50 of your marginal rate that means that it makes sense to place the interest bearing account inside the rrsp but keep stocks outside additionally you can claim your losses on your capital appreciating stocks against your gains if they are outside of your rrsp hopefully your stocks will never go down but that 's not very realistic dividends from canadian companies are eligible for a dividend tax credit but not dividends from foreign companies i actually understood that dividends from u.s. companies are treated as a special case it 's not clear to me from reading the article how much of this applies to mutual funds the summary is as follows

context my parents overseas japan sent me a little over $ 100,000 to    cover an expensive tuition payment and moderate living expenses in    2014 they are not us residents green card holders or citizens they did not remit the tuition payment directly to the school i am a    resident for tax this is enough to answer yes that 's basically the set of requirements for filing you received > $ 100 k from a non us person and you yourself are a us person you have to report it and unless it is taxable income it is a gift taxable income is reported on the form 1040 gifts are reported on the form 3520 the fact that in japan it is not considered a gift is irrelevant gift tax laws vary between countries some many do n't have gift taxes at all but the reporting requirement is based on the us law and the us definition of gift as i said above if it is not a gift per the us law then it is taxable income and then you report all of it regardless of the amount and pay taxes had they paid directly to the institution you would n't need to count it as income gift to you because you did n't actually receive the money so no income and it went directly to cover your qualified education expenses so no gift but this is not the case in your situation whether or not this will be reported by the irs back to japan i do n't know but it was probably already reported to the authorities in japan by the banks through which the transfers went through as to whether it will trigger an audit does n't really matter it was most likely reported to the irs already by the receiving banks in the us so not reporting it on your tax return either as income or on form 3520 may indeed raise some flags

yes this will reduce your total interest but not by much scenario 1 you run up bills for the month totaling $ 750 and then at the end of the month you get paid and pay $ 750 scenario 2 you pay $ 750 at the beginning of the month then over the course of the month you run up bills totaling $ 750 assume you have carryover debt of over $ 750 so you do n't have a credit balance at any point either way the net change in your balance for the month is zero assuming you spent about the same amount of money each day the difference in your average daily balance will be $ 750 if you 're paying 18 i think that 's a fairly typical credit card rate that 's 1 1/2 per month so the difference in interest will be about $ 10 note this is the most extreme case the difference between paying on the first day of the billing period and paying on the last day of the billing period and assuming that you pay all your bills by credit card so in real life the difference in the interest will probably be less you 're talking about a technique to save maybe five bucks a month i suppose every dollar helps but the real solution is to get your credit cards paid off so you 're not paying any interest

i have read from lot of places that transferring funds from nro to nre is possible given correct documents are provided yes this is correct the key document 15cb establishes that you have paid taxes that were due before money is transferred from the nro account to the nre account and/or are repatriated here is what i am simply steps 3 4 more so the step 4 can be seen as new income so the source of the funds is originally from nre account however the ca feels that since my withdrawal and deposit mechanism in nro is cash i might be subject to questioning    is there any issues in doing the above the ca is right the cash withdrawal and cash deposit has broken the link between the money withdrawn and the money deposited it could easily be the case that the cash withdrawals were spent on expenses and the cash deposit is new taxable income to you this new income needs to be declared and the taxes paid if you uncle is a close relative the exact relationships that are called close relatives are defined by law the return of the money can be declared to be a gift from your uncle to you and no taxes are due from you on the money if the funds are large it is advised to have a gift deed it is not a simple matter of creating a gift deed stating that your uncle has given you a gift your uncle has to show how he acquired so many assets that he gave you some money as a gift and whether appropriate taxes were paid by him   if your uncle is not a close relative he can still gift you up to rs 50,000 per year without you having to pay any income tax on the money received but again a gift deed would be needed to account for the cash deposits in short keep speaking to your ca he will advise you on the best course of action related question transfering money from nre account in india to family member

the article seems to focus more on individual external factors and seems to ignore social and cultural issues cultural behaviour at any age is almost all driven by peer groups and the messages and ideologies that peer groups share and believe   it appears that teens to early 20s these days are far more socially conservative along the lines of 1950s leave it to due to a lot of disasters their generations are experiencing most campuses and high schools have been putting in place policies that all drunk sex is rape for example and a very large number of boys have been kicked out of schools for having drunk sex with drunk girls and the girls complain months to years later based on rejection regret or being convinced by new friends to file the complaint heck our university has a new policy stating exactly that sex impaired by alcohol or drugs is considered sexual violence and being impaired by alcohol or drugs is no excuse for not being aware of the impairment of your partner it 's literally a race to the admin office whoever files first is the victim and the other is the rapist and filing even 5 minutes later is retaliation and makes the punishment worse for comparison the legal standard here is meaning unable to actively participate in the sexual activity or understand what you are doing not impairment which is vague and could be everything from a drink to a slight buzz to blackout drunk   we 're seeing yes means yes policies we 're seeing sex contracts pop up in response which of course takes all of the and out of it and so many people will not have sex that otherwise would have it 's really forcing sex into committed relationships by making casual sex too risky   then there 's cameras everywhere women getting without knowing especially by partners they do n't know and getting on porn sites again and risky   similar with if you are under 18 having a naked picture of yourself on your own phone can be illegal and child and sending it to somebody else can be very serious   then there 's drunk social media how much trouble have people gotten into from posting their activities on facebook twitter instagram how many jobs lost with that phone in your pocket and getting drunk what sorts of stupid things have people done that previous generations would have experienced and moved on but now kids can never live it down or forget   then there are ideology battles of the young like has n't been seen in a long time 3rd wave radical formerly known as man hating vs and and very public battles in this space all over social media   i think sex dating and drinking all fall into those social phenomena that the current young generation experience the driving part seems a little different perhaps costs perhaps has reduced the need for driving perhaps the convenience of uber and lyft perhaps better mass transportation infrastructure perhaps the movement to working from home perhaps even climate change or combinations thereof

equation m x 12 + = worst case scenario cost where m equals the monthly cost and is the maximum out of pocket amount   so if a plan costs $ 500 a month and the maximum out of pocket amount is $ 12,000 which in a worst case scenario you would pay it 's almost always over the deductible $ 500 x 12 + 12,000 = $ 18,000 most people look at the deductible but be aware this is incorrect in a worst case   the last one maximum out of pocket really hurts most people because they overlook it deductible vs. out of pocket maximum the difference between your deductible and an out of pocket maximum is    subtle but important the out of pocket maximum is typically higher    than your deductible to account for things like co pays and    co insurance for example if you hit your deductible of $ 2,500 but    continue to go for office visits with a $ 25 co pay you ’ll still have    to pay that co pay until you ’ve spent your out of pocket maximum at    which time your insurance would take over and cover everything new in    2016 embedded out of pocket maximums one change in 2016 is that even    with an aggregate deductible one person can not pay more than the    individual out of pocket maximum within a family plan even if the    aggregate deductible is more than the individual out of pocket    maximum which is $ for 2016 for instance even if the overall    aggregate deductible was $ 10,000 a single person in that family plan    could not incur more than $ in out of pocket expenses in 2017    the out of pocket maximum will increase to $ after they hit    that number insurance covers everything for that person even as the    rest of the family is still subject to the deductible from your question thanks not sure i totally follow you my question is essentially    say a typical large employer x gives you healthcare as a benefit on    top of your salary in fact how much does that cost corporation x    each year ie meaning in the us about how much does that typically    cost a corporation x each year that 's a good question because they may qualify for tax advantages by offering to a number of employees and there may be other benefits if they encourage certain tests like blood work and they waive the monthly fee   more than likely using the above equation may be the maximum that they 'll pay each year per employee and it might be less depending on the tax qualifications   you can read this answer of the question and it appears they are paying within the range of these premiums listed above this

it 's very simple the whole purpose of a credit card for the credit card company is that you borrow money and then pay them interest for the rest of your life the way you describe yourself you are the perfect victim so the obvious thing for you to do is to not touch credit cards with a pole   if you decide to use a credit card then what you should really really do is to pay back the maximum amount possible all the time best is to pay off the credit card in full if at all possible   consider this if you owe them money the interest rate is so high that with the minimum payment your debt will be growing all the time spend $ 1,000 pay $ 10 a month and next year you owe $ 1,100 without having used the credit card at all if you pay $ 32 a month as you mentioned your $ 1,000 purchase is actually a multi year loan if you need a multi year loan for a $ 1,000 purchase an ordinary loan from your bank will be much much cheaper

take a look at this graph here it shows how much it costs to borrow $ 40k for 30 years you did not post your mortgage rate or loan term so i used 4 over 30 years you can easily update this with your actual details while this does not show the costs of your total mortgage it does help you get an idea of just how much the in question is costing you in interest if you hover over the month one year from now you will see that you will have paid around $ in interest over the course of the year if you were to put the full toward your mortgage right now you would avoid having to pay this interest over the next year   the next question i think you would have to ask yourself is if there is anything else you could do with that money that is worth more than the $ to you   is it worth $ to keep those funds liquid available in case you need to use them for something else could you find other investments you feel comfortable with that could earn you more than $   is it worth the hassle risk of investing the funds somewhere else with a better return if you ca n't come up with anything better to do with the money then yes you should probably use the funds or at least part of them towards the mortgage

three important things worth remembering about kelly when applied to real world edges 1 full kelly is gut volatile while it the growth of the bankroll it does so in a way that still leaves you very likely to experience massive 50%+ reductions in capital most long terms users of kelly tend to stick in the 1/4 to 1/2 kelly unit range to try and stay sane and retain a margin of error see below for how large the typical swings can be with full kelly   2 garbage in garbage out if you are making errors in pricing your actual edge kelly becomes very wrong very fast easily leading you to a high chance of ruin if you are over estimating your true edge as most people do massively over estimate their edges kelly simply pushes them far into territory where risk of ruin is high 3 a kelly user prefers to back likely outcomes over non likely ones even to the point where they prefer a smaller edge if the chances of winning are better compare the below comparison of growth between two betting scenarios decimal odds so for the chances do   in this case despite the percentage edge on the red bet being higher than that of the green in terms of bankroll growth it ends up only being roughly as good to a kelly gambler as the smaller edge on the more likely event this has an obvious effect on the types of edges you should be seeking out if given choices between

this is similar to your tfsa question while the s in rrsp or tfsa stands for savings it does not stipulate exactly what instruments you use to build up those savings with few exceptions you can hold any type of investment in either an rrsp or tfsa thus do not think of them as savings accounts per se but more like umbrella accounts or plans it 's actually the financial industry that creates these of so called rrsps which are usually gics or balanced mutual funds held inside an rrsp plan or tfsas which are literally savings accounts held inside a tfsa plan the most versatile accounts are the self directed rrsp or tfsa accounts usually through a discount broker where you can purchase many different types of investments inside your registered accounts including stocks bonds mutual funds gics gold etc thus a share purchase plan held inside an rrsp is completely eligible and may be a sensible investment for retirement savings

this is a very interesting question   unfortunately in the way you wrote the question the answer is no   essentially you would be asking someone to give you a ~20 return for your cash on something that is almost guaranteed when holding your cash only gets them a < 1 return   would anyone take the other side of that deal interestingly though you can to some extent hedge surprises in health care costs   for instance investing in the healthcare industry as david rice suggests is a partial hedge   the prices of those industry stocks already has future expected cost increases included however if costs were to jump even higher than expected you would gain some of the added cost you would pay in healthcare back not that i recommend this strategy as you lose diversification but this is a valid and reasonable reason to slightly overweight american healthcare companies for someone in your situation    note that the wiki article you mention talks about hedging surprises as well   if at planting time the farmer sells a number of wheat futures contracts equivalent to his anticipated crop size he effectively locks in the price of wheat at that time   thinking that way you may actually be able to buy health insurance now for two or three years in the future essentially locking in expected price increases today   probably not the answer you were looking for but the best analogy for what financial hedging truly does

there is considerable truth to what your realtor said about the jersey city nj housing market these days it is a hot area with lots of expensive condos being bought up by people working on wall street in nyc very easy commute by train etc and in many cases the offers to purchase can exceed the asking price significantly be that as is may the issue with accepting a higher offer but smaller downpayment is that when the buyer 's lender appraises the property the valuation might come in lower and the buyer may have to come up with the difference or be required to accept a higher interest rate or be refused the loan altogether if the lender estimates that the buyer is likely to default on the loan because his credit worthiness is inadequate to support the monthly payments so the sale might fall through suppose that the property is offered for sale at $ 500 k and consider two bids one for $ 480 k with 30 downpayment $ 144 k and another for $ 500 k with 20 downpayment $ 100 k   if the property appraises for $ 450 k say and the lender is not willing to lend more than 80 of that $ 360 k then buyer 1 is ok it is only necessary to borrow   $ 480 k $ 144 k = $ 336 k while buyer 2 needs to come up with another $ 40 k of downpayment to be able to get the loan or might be asked to pay a higher interest rate since the lender will be lending more than 80 of the appraised value etc of course buyer 2 's lender might be using a different appraiser whose valuation might be higher etc but appraisals usually are within the same ballpark   furthermore good seller 's agents can make good estimates of what the appraisal is likely to be and if the asking price is larger than the agent 's estimate of appraised value then it might be to the advantage of the selling agent to recommend accepting the lower offer with higher downpayment over the   higher offer with smaller downpayment the sale is more likely to go through and an almost sure 6 of $ 480 k 3 if there is a buyer 's agent involved in hand in 30 days time is worth more than a good chance of nothing at the end of 15 days when the mortgage is declined during which the house has been off the market on the grounds that the sale is pending if you really like a house you need to decide what you are willing to pay for it and tailor your offer accordingly keeping in mind what your buyer 's agent is recommending as the offer amount the higher the price the more the agent 's commission how much money you can afford to put down as a downpayment do n't forget closing costs including points that might be need to be paid and what your pre approval letter says about how much mortgage you can afford   if you are buyer 1 have a pre approval letter for $ 360 k   and have enough savings for a downpayment of up to $ 150 k and if you or your spouse   really really like the place and can not imagine living in any other place then you could offer $ 500 k with 30 down and blow the other offer out of the water you could even offer more than $ 500 k if you want but this is a personal decision   what your realtor said is perfectly true in the sense that for y > z an offer at $ x with $ y down is better than an offer at $ x with $ z down it is to a certain extent true that for w > x a seller would find an offer at $ x with $ y down to be more attractive that an offer at $ w with $ down but that depends on what the appraisal is likely to be and the seller 's agent 's recommendations

it is likely a scam   in fact the whole mystery shopping job may be a scam   there is a page about cashier 's check scams as well as a us government page which specifically mentions mystery shopping as a scam angle as for how the scam works from the site i just linked however cashier ’s checks lately have become an attractive vehicle for fraud when used for payments to consumers although the amount of a cashier ’s check quickly becomes available for withdrawal by the consumer after the consumer deposits the check these funds do not belong to the consumer if the check proves to be fraudulent it may take weeks to discover that a cashier ’s check is fraudulent in the meantime the consumer may have irrevocably wired the funds to a scam artist or otherwise used the funds only to find out later when the fraud is detected that the consumer owes the bank the full amount of the cashier ’s check that had been deposited it is somewhat unusual in that from what you say there has been no attempt thus far to get money back   however your sister in law may have received that info separately or received it as part of her mystery shopping job but did n't mention it to you with regard to this check   typically the scam involves telling the recipient to transfer money to a third party e.g. by buying goods as a mystery shopper or via wire transfer to reimburse someone associated with a sham operation   by the time the cashier 's check is revealed as fraudulent the victim has already transferred away his her own real money it 's probably worth taking the check to your or her bank and asking them about it   they may have more info   also banks usually want to know about scams like this because in the long run they accumulate data on them and share that with law enforcement and can eventually catch some of the scammers edit just to help anyone who may be reading this later   the letter you added confirms it is absolutely a scam   my boss was once contacted via a scam operation very similar to this   the huge red flag in addition to others already mentioned is that you are being given a check for over $ 2000 of which only $ 25 is purportedly for actual mystery shopping and $ is payment for you the mystery shopper   the whole rest of the $ 2000 + amount is for you to wire to another mystery secret shopper in order for them to complete their assignment   they are giving you $ 2000 to give to someone else who is supposedly another one of their own employees contractors   ask yourself what sane business would conduct their operations in this way   if you work at a law office or a hamburger stand or a school or anything you like does your boss ever say here is your paycheck for $ 5000   i know you only earned $ 1000 but i 'm just going to give you the whole $ 5000 and you 're supposed to use $ 4000 of it to pay your coworker joe his wages   no   there is no reason to do that except that the other mystery shopper is actually the scammer

as chris pointed out if your expenses are covered by the income exactly as you have said to assume then you are basically starting with a $ 40 k asset your starting equity and ending with a $ 200 k asset a paid for home at the same value since you have said to ignore any appreciation so to determine what you have earned on the $ 40 k you leveraged 5x would n't it be a matter of computing a cagr that gets you from $ 40 k to $ 200 k in 30 years the result would be a nominal return not a real return so if i set up the problem correctly it should be $ 40,000 1 + = $ 200,000 then solve for return it works out to be about or so

in market cap weighted index there is fairly heavy concentration in the largest stocks the top 10 stocks typically account for about 20 of the s&p 500 index   in equal weight this bias towards large caps is removed the market cap method would be good when large stocks drive the markets however if the markets are getting driven by mid caps and small caps the equal weight wins historically most big companies start out small and grow big fast in a short span of time thus if we were to do market cap one would have purchased smaller number of shares of the said company as its cap weight would have been small and when it becomes big we would have purchased the shares at a higher price however if we were to do equal weight then as the company grows big one would have more share at a cheaper price and would result in better returns there is a nice article on this also gives the of the returns over a period of 10 years where equal weight index has done good it does not mean that it would continue

if you want an account statement from the irs listing the taxes due and paid and confirming a zero balance remaining you want what they call a tax account transcript it sounds like you tried to submit this online but yes it would require the actual taxpayer to submit it the other option would be to fill out form requesting the form 1040 tax account transcript have the taxpayer sign it and mail it in presumably whatever method you used to have her sign the form 1040 you prepared for her you could also use to have her sign the another option could be to try to request the transcript over the phone i do n't know what authentication they require or if you would need to have been listed on the 1040 as an authorized third party according to the irs transcript faq page what if i ’m unable to use get transcript by mail if you are unable to use get transcript by mail you may try our automated phone transcript service at 800 and also receive your transcript by mail please allow 5 to 10 calendar days for delivery but unless there 's a reason to think that the tax account was n't credited properly or the irs is sending another bill or the like i do n't think there 's a lot of point in doing so in general the fact that the check cleared the bank should be sufficient documentation that the amount was paid

first you need to figure out what your objectives for the money are   mostly this boils down to how soon you are going to need the money   if you are as you say very busy and you do n't need the money until retirement i 'd suggest putting your money in a single target date fund such as the blackrock fund   you figure out when you are going to retire and put your money in that fund   the fund will then pick a mix of stocks bonds and other investments adjusting the risk for your time horizon maybe your objectives are different and you want to become an trader   you value being able to say at a bbq oh i bought aapl at $ 20 or i think small caps are over valued   i 'd suggest you take your $ 50,000 and structure it so you invest $ 5,000 a year over 10 years   nothing teaches you about investing like making or losing a bit of money in the market   if you put it all in at once you risk losing it all well before you 've learned many valuable lessons which only the market can teach you i 'd suggest you study the efficient market hypothesis before studying specific markets or strategies

what you are describing is a chart of accounts   it 's a structure used by accountants to accounts into sub categories below the standard asset liability income expense structure the actual categories used will vary widely between different people and different companies   every person and company is different whilst you may be happy to have a single expense account called lunch i may want lots of expense accounts to distinguish between all the different restaurants i eat at regularly   companies will often change their chart of accounts over time as they decide they want to capture more or less detail on where a particular type of expense is really being spent all of this makes any attempt to create a standard in the strict sense rather futile   i have worked at a few places where discussions about how to structure the chart of accounts and what referencing scheme to use can be surprisingly heated   you 'll have to come up with your own system but i can provide a few common recommendations if you 're looking for some simple examples to get started with most personal finance software e.g. gnucash will offer to create an example chart of accounts when you first start a session

the accountant must provide you a signed copy of your return and the e file authorization form for you to sign which should show the amount you 're supposed to get refunded once you sign the authorization the accountant must e file your return and provide you the receipt of filing usually an email from the accountant 's software provider if any of these steps did n't happen your accountant is lying to you and is likely to have misused your information if your return was supposed to be filed on paper then it was you who was supposed to mail it via usps certified mail usually if a professional prepares a return it would be e filed unless there 's a specific reason not to or you explicitly requested paper filing any of that would also be documented on a specific irs form which you would sign if your accountant is lying to you then you should use form to complain about him to the irs read carefully the letter you 've got from the irs they 're probably asking about the aca insurance coverage information it should have been reported on your tax return see here for more details about what reporting you were supposed to do depending on your situation i suggest you go to a different tax preparer make sure he is in fact licensed i.e. has ea or cpa credentials and ask him to sort it out if indeed the original preparer did n't file your return you can also in addition to the form file a complaint with your state regulatory agency that oversees tax preparers if there 's such if the original preparer made a mistake it is your right to sue for damages including the costs of sorting it out and penalties that you might have incurred due to that mistake

money and wealth are two different things   money is an item that can be used as a store of wealth and as a convenient medium of exchange but it 's not the same thing as wealth   if you have a lot of money then you have a lot of wealth   but you can have a lot of wealth in the form of for example real estate company ownership financial assets and loans and physical capital and not have a lot of money there is a very very large amount of money in the world so bitcoin would have to appreciate in an extreme way in order to replace the other forms of money   in that case someone owning a lot of bitcoin will be pretty rich   but having half the world 's money is a much smaller thing than having half the world 's wealth your inflation question is n't real clear to me   because bitcoin is not kept in banks and lent out a bitcoin user in your proposed world creates inflation when they spend their bitcoins increasing demand for goods and services   this increased demand drives up the price of those goods and services   prices react pretty quickly so it seems like the effect of an increase in the effective money supply the bitcoins actually being used rather than hoarded would have a similar effect when spent quickly as slowly   think of it this way if you are buying the first few thousand could be had cheaply at walmart and amazon   then you would have to go to more and more expensive sources to get them   eventually you would run out of sources and have to have them special made at yet higher expense   it 's not the time that raised the prices but the actual purchasing behavior   same thing is true of houses yachts islands or whatever else a very rich hypothetical person might buy

this entirely depends on two factors now let 's look at what applecare gives you what it covers is any manufacturing defect it also covers you for phone support as otherwise it 's a $ incident charge even for simple issues it also covers any software issues that you may come across as long as the issues pertain to apple software or the operating system itself what it does n't cover is any damage caused by the user if you snap the corner of the screen drop it spill liquid on it modify it etc then you 're responsible for paying the repair costs if you 're outside of phone support then you 're going to have to pay someone to fix any problems you come across now if we 're to trust this handy study done in 2009 then we can say that the 3-year failure rate for and macbook pros is we could go ahead and say that $ 350 $ 2000 = 17.5 so the chances match up but what 's the likelihood that apple is going to cover the full $ 2000 only under extreme cases are you losing the full $ 2000 theft shock damage etc and those are all cases that apple wo n't cover anyways instead we 're looking at cases such as please keep in mind it has been several years since i worked for apple so these figures may be off so this reduces our possible savings significantly let 's then also look at what the warranty becomes after they fixed a part a replacement part or apple product including a user part that has been installed in accordance with instructions provided by apple assumes the remaining term of the warranty or 90 days from the date of replacement or repair whichever provides longer coverage for you which means in this case that you have a 90-day warranty after they 've fixed an issue this significantly reduces the likelihood of a same part going bad multiple times in a row therefore the chances of that $ 350 being worthwhile are very much against you even if the system does fail in some way it is likely that the repair would be cheaper than the applecare the chances of running into a repair or series of repairs that pays for the applecare and then some are astonishingly low i would still get it if you were giving it to someone who was significantly lacking in any technology concepts such as a parent or grandparent as they are more likely to utilize the extended phone support especially for smaller things that they might you about

meanwhile who no longer drives because of poor health and uses a broker to hire a driver said he is facing threats from the lender credit union to foreclose on not just his medallion but also his house   this really bothers me it shows how medallions have prevented even other from competing   i doubt if see how he really is n't any different from uber and lyft now   he 's a middle man   but unlike uber and lyft that provide infrastructure for finding clients provides nothing other than his government sanction medallion

it is even when we were bidding major projects we could pretty much guess who was going to get the contract before hand we only put bids in on the ones we might not win because often times the major project would get broken up into several smaller ones because one manufacturer could n't produce fast enough or did n't have   enough stock for the client 's entire job   our major projects guys had difficult jobs one month they would be in the office until midnight the next month they would be playing golf at 2 pm on a wednesday

that economist quote only offers a very weak argument   it does n't argue from anything it just says they think corporations borrow too much and the tax code should remove this to borrow   that 's an arguement based on a feeling and weak    there 's absolutely a logical consistency to allow a deduction for interest at the corporate level and not dividends   as mentioned interest is an expense to a financier dividends are distributed residual income

so what is the implication of creating 12 loddars like that   if enough loddars are created in such a way basically as ious for ious if i 'm interpreting this correctly will we have inflation   what keeps this in check   is it credibility of whoever issues the promise for loddars   and when those loddars are destroyed because of the wildfire or whatever is the individual that is owed them just screwed   what is an example of this happening in the real world   would be if a company makes a promise of some payment and it turns out that it ca n't be fulfilled   that company would still owe that money to someone right   sorry for the string of questions tacked on to your great post but i feel as though you made a very point and then just stopped   thanks for taking the time to explain all of this

my realtor told me that even though they 're only asking for 1/2     the money and have excellent credit that the mortgage company may    not lend it to them if i 'm over priced is this true i 've never heard of it before it is a chance but it is a red herring to the discussion having excellent credit has nothing to do with being eligible for a debt object of a specific size just because you have excellent credit would you get approved for a property of $ 10,000,000 if you only made $ 35,000 a year and had no other net worth but regarding your potential buyers a chance vs a good chance is different your realtor just told you some basic always true lending fact that has nothing to do with your situation

i appreciate the detailed responses truthfully however i feel like at least half of your points are either just for its sake alone display a deep lack of understanding of unions collective bargaining and the histories of both or ignore and cling to an and ultimately self defeating ideology   gt collective bargaining is an ambiguous term that could refer to many concepts there is voluntarily agreed to collective bargaining which has nothing wrong with it and then there are laws that force the employer to collectively bargain with a union if a union requests it which is a mandate and violates the employer 's contract liberty   the law forces the two parties to sit at a table the law forces the two parties to discuss a few core things like wages the law does n't force anyone to agree to anything and very often they do n't i do n't see how this is a violation of anyone 's contract liberty a term i 've actually never heard before the idea is since these worker employer disputes exist naturally making them at least sit at a table together and talking is helpful in avoiding ego and fueled disruptions where no one benefits if this you see this as a violation of one 's liberty i really do n't know what to say to that    gt the prevalence of child labor was decreasing long before any law was created prohibiting it child labor is necessary in poor countries because people are far less productive per hour worked    i 'm not saying i do n't believe you but citation needed   gt as productivity increases parents can afford to send their children off to school instead of working since their own work is enough to support the family   would n't educating children first lead to an increase in productivity also what if the owners of the means of production only a few in an given area have incomes 100x greater than the workers they seem to be producing enough wealth to support themselves only they 're not the beneficiaries what 's the solution here   i understand that in a poor country child labor is seen as a necessity however i think there is a moral issue when someone from a developed nation opens a factory in a third world country with conditions that they would not want someone in their own family subjected to maybe these conditions are standard in the third world country but just because they 're standard that does n't mean the people there are happy with them   gt in other words no government mandate created due to union pressure can possibly lead to beneficial change since laws that limit people 's economic rights under the assumption that 51 knows what 's better for the minority than they themselves do generally do much more harm than good      this is quite a leap problem is you always assume that a company is always paying workers as much as it can instead of having a net income that can absorb an uptick in overhead    gt as history over the last century has shown it 's no hyperbole labor unions backed regulations soft socialism has succeeded in spite of the resistance of employers   and you owe this to violence or the threat of violence citation needed   gt because unions have destroyed nearly every major industry where they had a natural tendency to form large scale capital intensive manufacturing operations where large numbers of workers were concentrated in one place   this is typical anti union propaganda and it 's funny you pull it out since it ignores your own ideology what interest would a union have in destroying the very industry it needs to exist answer none this is just a way for a business to deflect criticism when they want to outsource killing us jobs just to increase their net income unions make concessions when they have to   gt the force of government prevents companies from refusing to collectively bargain with a labor union threat of violence violent strikes this is a straw man if i 've ever seen one who is threatening violence here this existed before government laws were created that made legal threats on behalf of employees that want to keep unionized employees employed and force companies to collectively bargain with a union now of course the themselves are not directly threatening violence since they are backed by the force of government   this is just showing a tremendous amount of ignorance regarding the way   things actually happen   gt collectively bargaining does n't benefit workers in general it benefits in the short term those workers who are employed and unionized at the expense of long term wage growth and employment opportunities for the unemployed and non unionized employees   i have no idea how one could come to this conclusion i can only assume it   stems from the same old idea that employers are always paying out the most that they can afford    i happen to have first hand knowledge that it 's false however when my workplace unionized recently one of around a dozen locations nationally and the only one to organize the company responded by increasing wages and benefits to all locations have any locations closed no has anyone been laid off no is the company still mad profitable yes

you most definitely can appeal the county 's appraisal of your property   how to do so and your odds of success will vary widely by your location but i have successfully appealed the valuation on one of my rental properties i asked my realtor to provide me with recent sales of comparable homes in the neighborhood provided them along with my appeal as evidence of what i felt a reasonable valuation should be   one of three things will happen 1 your appeal will be accepted 2 it will be denied or 3 you will be asked to come in plea your case in front of the county assessor in my case the county accepted my appeal without needing to testify look around your county assessor 's website you will probably be able to find the form necessary for filing an appeal   if not give them a call they 'll tell you the procedure the county generally uses a simplistic statistical model to do their valuations little to no human time is spent reviewing your home 's value so it 's quite possible for their valuation to be unreasonable    an appeal can take a bit of time paperwork but can definitely be worth the effort if the county 's valuation is way off hope this helps your point is well taken that in practice the relationship between sales prices tax assessments is a bit more tenuous the waters get muddy when property values have a large swing like the past 5 years when tax assessor 's started seeing large drops in property values during the recession and drops in their budgets i 'm sure there was considerable pressure to prevent wholesale decreases in tax valuations it 's politically easier to prop up falling valuations than to raise tax rates   however the fact remains that the models that assessors use in determining property values are based on sales history thus i believe and have found that recent sales can be a persuasive piece of evidence in a property tax assessment appeal

yes and   how that prevents negates or in any way opposes what i 've claimed markets are dynamic systems they are after all multi player non cooperative non zero sum games and as such they can have stable closed loops toward which the trajectory of the state of the system and if enters into formally ca n't escape since they are closed loops thus intervention is usually needed to maintain competition which is called regulation   regulatory capture abuse of regulations abuse of regulatory power and so on are problems in the greater model in politics where constant input sort of guarantees that it has no stable because as long people exist at least some of them will have a habit of   the question is is there a more efficient way to ensure existence of markets and ensure competition on them and maybe some sort of anarchism is the answer but sadly we 're not doing enough experiments and research into that

the original option writer seller can close his short position in the contracts he wrote by purchasing back matching contracts i.e. contracts with the same terms underlying option type strike price expiration date from any others who hold long positions or else who write new matching contract instances rather than buyer and seller settling directly options are settled through a central options clearing house being the options clearing corporation for exchange listed options in the u.s. see also wikipedia clearing house finance so the original buyer of the put maintains his position insurance and the clearing process ensures he is matched up with somebody else holding a matching obligation if he chooses to exercise his put i also answered a similar question but in more detail here

i do n't buy the house prices will always increase due to the increased cost of raw materials argument in a lot of countries you will find that the cost of a property is substantially lower than its perceived sale value if it was n't there would be no incentive for developers to take the risk of buying the land and building houses on it say the cost of building the house is 50 of the sale price which might already be generous materials probably account for half of the building cost so you 've got 25 tail 75 dog i 'd start to worry if people buy property as a get rich quick scheme which seems to be what you 're describing

i read up on it and saw that the irs can charge the loan provider on    interest even if the loan provider does n't charge interest but this    is normally mitigated by the 0 interest being considered a gift and    as long as it 's below x amount your fine yes this sums it up x is the amount of the gift exemption the $ however you must differ between loan with no interest and loan with no paying back with loan with no interest you 're still giving a statutory gift of the irs mandated minimum interest however the principal is expected to be repaid to you and you must show that this expectation is reasonably fulfilled if you can not i.e. you gave a loan with no intention of it being paid back then the irs will recharacterize the whole amount as the gift and you 'll be on the hook for gift tax for the amounts above the exemption what defines a loan vs a gift in terms of the irs is it simply that    the loan will be paid back or is it only considered a loan if a    note is made as i said you must be able to show that the loan is indeed a loan even if it is with no interest i.e. it is being repaid it is treated as a loan by all parties and is not an attempt to evade gift tax promissory note is not a must but will definitely be helpful in showing that but without the de facto repayment of the loan it will be hard to argue that it is not a gift even if you have a promissory note that means you should make a loan in such a way that the borrower will begin repaying it reasonably soon so that you can show payment schedule being followed and money moving back to you reasonably soon is not of course defined in a statute so do consult with a ea cpa licensed in your state on how to structure the loan so that it will not appear as an attempt to evade the gift tax are there any limits on how big a loan can be no but keep in mind that even with statutory interest charges published by the irs monthly see the link with large enough loan you can exceed the gift tax exemption also keep in mind that interest is taxable income to you even if you gift it back i.e. the statutory interest

the company released its 2nd quarter revenue of $ a couple days ago however the stock did not move up in any way why if the company is making money should n't the stock go up during the time between earnings announcements analysts occasionally publish their assessment of a company including their estimate of the company 's value and future earnings and as part of an earnings report companies often include guidance their prediction for the upcoming quarter this will frequently be a conservative estimate so they 're more likely to achieve it investors make their purchase and sale decisions based on this information when the earnings report comes out investors compare these actual returns to analysts predictions and the company 's guidance if their results are in line with these predictions the stock price is unlikely to move much as those results are already incorporated into the stock price if the company is doing better than predicted it 's usually a good sign and the price often rises conversely if it 's doing worse the price will likely fall but it 's not as simple as this as others have explained for long term investors stock prices are based on expectations of future activity if the results of that quarter include some one time actions that are unlikely to repeat investors will often discount that portion

if your net profit is $ 0 then no you will not owe income tax as a result of providing this service but there 's a lot more to consider than just that before you begin you 'll need to decide if this is a business or a hobby based on the fact that you do n't intend to make a profit you are probably going to be calling it a hobby for tax purposes regardless of whether it is a business or a hobby since you will be accepting payments from people you will need to report the income on your tax return as both a business and a hobby you can deduct all of your expenses to bring your profit down to $ 0 assuming all the expenses are legitimate business hobby expenses the main differences between business and hobby are if you choose to run as a business you 'll likely save quite a bit of money by avoiding the 2 rule and also by being able to deduct any non specific customer expenses and take a loss be careful though that you do n't go too many years with a business loss or the irs may re classify it as a hobby which may include an audit if you decide to run as a business you may need to charge a little more than just expenses to attempt to turn a profit or at least break even

most of the investors who have large holdings in a particular stock have pretty good exit strategies for those positions to ensure they are getting the best price they can by selling gradually into the volume over time putting a single large block of stock up for sale is problematic for one simple reason let 's say you have 100,000 shares of a stock and for some reason you decide today is the day to sell them take your profits and ride off into the sunset   so you call your broker or log into your brokerage account and put them up for sale   he puts in an order somewhere the stock is sold and your account is credited seems simple right   well not so fast professionals i 'm keeping this simple so please do n't beat me up for it the way stocks are bought and sold is through companies known as market makers   these are entities which sit between the markets and you and your broker and when you want to buy or sell a stock most of the time the order is ultimately handled somewhere along the line by a market maker   if you work with a large brokerage firm sometimes they 'll buy or sell your shares out of their own accounts but that 's another story it is normal for there to be many sometimes hundreds of market makers who are all trading in the same equity   the bigger the stock the more market makers it attracts   they all compete with each other for business and they make their money on the spread between what they buy stock from people selling for and what they can get for it selling it to people who want it given that there could be hundreds of market makers on a particular stock google apple and microsoft are good examples of having hundreds of market makers trading in their stocks it is very competitive   the way the makers compete is on price   it might surprise you to know that it is the market makers not the markets that decide what a stock will buy or sell for each market maker sets their own prices for what they 'll pay to buy from sellers for and what they 'll sell it to buyers for   this is called respectively the bid and the ask prices   so if there are hundreds of market makers then there could be hundreds of different bid and ask prices on the same stock   the prices you see for stocks are what are called the best bid and best ask prices   what that means is you are being shown the highest bid price what you can sell your shares for and the best ask price what you can buy those shares for because that 's what is required   that being said there are many other market makers on the same stock whose bid prices are lower and ask prices are higher   many times there will be a big of market makers all at the same bid ask or within fractions of a cent of each other all competing for business   trading computers are taught to seek out the best prices and the fastest trade fills they can the point to this very simplistic lesson is that the market makers set the prices that shares trade at   they adjust those prices based among other factors on how much buying and selling volume they 're seeing   if they see a wave of sell orders coming into the system then they 'll start marking down their bid prices   this keeps them from paying too much for shares they 're going to have to find a buyer for eventually and it can sometimes slow down the pace of selling as investors and automated systems notice the price decline and decide to wait to sell   conversely if market makers see a wave of buy orders coming into the system they 'll start marking their ask prices up to maximize their gains since they 're selling you shares they bought from someone else presumably at a lower price   but they typically adjust their prices up or down before they actually fill trades   sneaky eh depending on how much volume there is on the shares of the company you 're selling and depending on whether there are more buyers than sellers at the moment your share sell order may be filled at market by a market maker with no real consequence to the share 's price if the block is large enough then it 's possible it will not all sell to one market maker or it might not all happen in one transaction or even all at the same price this is a pretty complex subject as you can see and i 've cut a lot of corners and oversimplified much to keep it   but the short answer to your question is it depends hope this helps good luck

stocks are regarded as an inflation hedge because when your money is worth less everything else is worth more i.e. stocks are more expensive go up simply because your money is worth less but not because of better earnings across individual companies so that general idea can effect sentiment whereby if everyone believes it then more people buy stocks if they think there will be a lot of inflation but it does n't explain actual behavior whether more people buy hold or sell it 's worth noting that individual companies and stocks also may be adversely affected by inflation since their own assets or accounting may already be outside of the currency and/or they may already be engaging in their own hedging

the profit maximising level of employment now we consider how many people a business might decide to employ the profit maximising level of employment occurs when a firm hires workers up to the point where the marginal cost of employing an extra worker equals the marginal revenue product of labour i.e. =   this is shown in the labour demand diagram shown below     so the cost of each additional unit of labor is 8 = 8) as the wage is and q = in the short run find the right quantity produced by taking dp of your original inverse demand curve which will give you the marginal revenue of each product set it equal to 8 and solve for q.

since your question is very particular on the details i 'm assuming you did your research unfortunately you wo n't get a better answer here than what you 've found on the internet already this is not a clear cut situation as the situation you 're describing has been a source to some confusion mainly the question is whether the us bank account is a tangible asset or not to the best of my knowledge this has not yet been settled so i suggest going to a professional tax adviser ea cpa licensed in the us who 'd advise you the best course of action i think it would be safer to transfer the money directly from the foreign account to the us beneficiary although even then if the irs decides to start digging it may claim that you 're essentially a transfer from a us account so i suggest talking to a professional before doing anything in any case the us recipient will need to report the gift if it is $ 100 k or more using the form 3520 with his her tax return

i think you may be drawing the wrong conclusion about why you put what type of investment in a taxable vs. tax advantaged account it is not so much about risk but type of return if you 're investing both tax advantaged and taxable accounts you can benefit by putting more tax inefficient investments inside your tax advantaged accounts some aggressive asset types like real estate can throw off a lot of taxable income if your asset allocation calls for investing in real estate holding it in a 401k or ira can allow more of your money to remain invested rather than having to use it to pay for taxes and if you 're holding in a roth ira you get that tax free but bonds a decidedly non aggressive asset also throw off a lot of taxable income you 're able to hold them in a tax advantaged account and not pay taxes on the income until you withdraw it from the account or tax free in the case of a roth account an aggressive stock fund that is primarily expected to provide returns via price appreciation would do well in a taxable account because there 's likely little tax consequence to you until it is sold

it took me a very longtime to learn that i no longer need to live like a starving student and even now i live like a well off student and that 's ok my needs and tastes are mostly simple there 's no reason to spend just for the sake of spending but if you want something and really can afford it after setting aside savings for retirement and emergency funds and basic operating capital go for it it may help to pick out a specific thing you want or want to replace my rules used to say that i was always allowed to spend money on books music and needed tools then i convinced myself that shelves are tools for storing other things and that furniture is shelving for people and that art if it really speaks to me is akin   to books and that a decent instrument is a tool and that my time has value so sometimes it 's less expensive in real term to throw money at a problem rather than scheduling my life around it one step at a time with all the steps making sense i will still spend entirely too long over minor purchases at times but that 's about convincing myself that i like the choice i 'm making not about the price   per se meanwhile saving means you can buy things later without having to borrow the semi student routine and waiting until i was ready to buy is why i had the value of a house in my investments when i was ready to buy one and is why i 'm almost at my target number for retirement well before my planned retirement date one other thought if you 're comfortable buying gifts for others but do n't tend to spend on yourself you are n't a miser just frugal

short answer is to put the max 15 contribution into your espp long answer is that since you want to be saving as much as you can anyway this is a great way to force you to do it and pick up at least a 15 return every six months or however often your plan makes a purchase i say at least because sometimes an espp will give you the lower of the beginning or end period stock price and then a 15 discount off of that but check the details of your plan if you feel like your company 's stock is a good long term investment then hold onto the shares when purchased otherwise sell as soon as you get them and bank that 15 return

i used to own a few investment properties so i 'm pretty familiar with this   as mrchrister mentions lenders see investment mortgages as higher risk people who fall into financial trouble are much more likely to let their investment properties go than their personal residence   consequently the interest rates and downpayment requirements are generally higher typically a mortgage for an investment property will require 20 down vs. as low as 3 5 down for a personal residence   with excellent credit and some shopping around you could probably do 10 down   interest rates are typically about a half percent higher as well you 'll also find that the more investment properties you have the harder it becomes to finance new ones   banks look at debt to income ratios to determine if you are over extended   typically banks like to see that your housing payments are less than 20 or so of your income   however with rental properties housing payments generally account for far more than 20 of your rental income   other income you have can offset that but after buying 2 3 houses or so your dti generally into the range where lenders are uncomfortable lending to you anymore   this is why you 'll find that many rental properties are bought on land contracts with owner financing rather than with mortgages

the short answer is that you can use student loans for living expenses   joe provides a nice of loans   i would just add that some loans are not only guaranteed but also subsidized   essentially the government buys down the rate of the loan the mechanics are that a financial aid package might consist of grants work study job subsidized and guaranteed loans   one can turn down one or more of the elements of the package   all will be limited in some form the work study will have a maximum number of hours and generally has low pay   many find better deals working in the businesses surrounding the college or starting their own services type business   the grants rarely cover the full cost of tuition and books   the loans will both be limited in amount   it mainly depends on what you qualify for and generally speaking the lower the income the more aid one qualifies for now some students use all their grant all their loan money and buy things that are not necessary   for example are you going to live in the $ dorm or the new fancy apartments that are running $ 800/month   are you going to use the student loan money to buy a car   will it be a new bmw or a 8 year old i see this first hand as i live near a large university   the pubs are filled with college students not working but drinking and eating every night   many of them drive very fancy cars the most onerous example of this is students at the military   attendees have their books and tuition completely paid for   they also receive a stipend and more money can be earned over the summer   they also all qualify for a 35 k student loan in their junior year   just about every kid takes this loan   most of those use the money to buy a car   i know a young lady who did exactly that and so did many of her friends so kids with a starting pay of 45 k also start life with a   buying a nice car in the military is especially silly as they can not drive it while deployed and they are very likely to be deployed   at least however they are guaranteed a starting job with a nice starting pay and upward potential college kids who behave similarly might not have it as good   will they even find work   will the job have the ability to move up   how much security is in the job   one might say that this does not apply to engineers and such but i am working with a fellow with a computer science degree who can not find a job and has not worked in the past 6 months   this even though the market is super hot right now for computer engineers so in a word be very careful what you borrow

you make several good points   i 'll start with black scholes the arbitrage argument in black scholes is between the option and a hypothetical and portfolio with identical cash flows the replicating portfolio   we then value the replicating portfolio via an equilibrium model   when you use bs there is n't necessarily any observed security whose is guaranteed not imply some arbitrage opportunity because bs makes no reference to observed prices   a no arbitrage modification might look like this i observe the prices and implied volatilities of some options and use the implied volatilities to price another option maybe with a different strike   doing so ensures that there is no arbitrage between my price and the market prices implied by my model   realistically the problem arbitrage free models are addressing is that our models and assumptions are wrong even though they 're reasonable a lot of the time   a no arbitrage model removes some set of obvious deficiencies but at the cost of not being able to explain why things are priced as they are   so for instance wo n't reproduce the observed term structure and hull white fixes this but hull white does n't explain where the term structure comes from i.e. what the term structure should be

you are comparing two things that are not comparable   the market size would be the total annual revenue in one market in this year   the market caps of a company is the number of shares multiplied by the share price this should be equal to the total profit that the company is going to make through its life time taking into account that you would get interest on an investment so future profits have to be counted less accordingly   so if the market size is ten million dollars and a company has four million revenue in that market with one million profit and everyone thinks that company will continue making that profit for the next fifty years then surely one million a year for the next 50 years is worth more than ten million   that 's if the market stands still if the market size is ten million and we expect that market size to double for the next three years then the market size is still ten million but a company having a 40 share of a market growing at that speed is going to be worth a lot more

buying or selling a futures contract means that you are entering into a contractual agreement to buy or sell the contracted commodity or financial instrument in the contracted amount the contract size at the price you have bought or sold the contract on the contract expire date maturity date   it is important to understand that futures contracts are tradeable instruments meaning that you are free to sell or buy back your contract at any time before the expiry date for example if you buy 1 lot 1 contract of a gold future on the comex exchange for the contract month of december 2016 then you entering into a contract to buy 100 ounces the contract size of gold at the price at which you buy the contract not the spot price on the day of expiry when the contract comes to maturity   the december 2016 gold futures contract has an expiry date of 28 december   you are free to trade this contract at any time before its expiry by selling it back to another market participant   if you sell the contract at a price higher than you have purchased it then you will realise a profit of 100 times the difference between the price you bought the contract and the price you sold the contract where 100 is the contract size of the gold contract   similarly if you sell the contract at a price lower than the price you have purchased it then you will realise a loss commissions paid will also effect your net profit or loss if you hold your contract until the expiry date and exercise your contract by taking or making delivery then you are obliged to buy or sell 100 ounces of gold at the price at which you bought or sold the contract not the current spot price so long as your contract is open i.e. prior to the expiry date and so long as you own the contract you are required to make a good faith deposit to show that you intend to honour your contractual obligations   this deposit is usually called initial margin   typically the initial margin amount will be about 2 of the total contract value for the gold contract   so if you buy or sell one contract for 100 ounces of gold at say $ an ounce then the total contract value will be $ and your deposit requirement would be about $ 2,500   the initial margin is returned to you when you sell or buy back your futures contract or when you exercise your contract on expiry in addition to initial margin you will be required to maintain a second type of margin called variation margin   the variation margin is the running profit or loss you are showing on your open contract for the sake of simplicity lets look only at the case where you have purchased a futures contract   if the futures price is higher than your contract buy price then you are showing a profit on your current position and this profit the variation margin will be used to offset your initial margin requirement conversely if the futures price has dropped below your contracted buy price then you will be showing a loss on your open position and this loss the variation margin will be added to your initial margin and you will be called to put up more money in order to show good faith that you intend to honour your obligations   note that neither the initial margin nor the variation margin are accounting items   in other words these are not postings that are debited or credited to the ledger in your trading account   so in some sense you do n't have to pay anything upfront but you do need to put up a refundable deposit to show good faith

given that we live in a world rife with geopolitical risks such as brexit and potential eu breakup would you say it 's advisable to keep some of cash savings in a foreign currency probably not   primarily because you do n't know what will happen in the fallout of these sorts of political shifts   you do n't know what will happen to banking treaties between the various countries involved if you can manage to place funds on deposit in a foreign bank country in a currency other than your home currency and maintain the deposit insurance in that country and not spend too much exchanging your currency then there probably is n't a downside other than liquidity loss if you 're thinking i 'll just wire some whatever currency to some bank in some foreign country in which you have no residency or citizenship consideration without considering deposit insurance just so you might protect some of your money from a possible future event i think you should stay away

dividends indicate that a business is making more profit than it can effectively invest into expansion or needs to regulate cash flow this generally indicates that the business is well established and has stabilized in a dominant market position this can be contrasted against businesses that dividends are also given preferential tax treatment specifically if i buy a stock and sell it 30 days later i will be taxed on the capital gains at the regular income rate typically 25 33 but the dividends would be taxed at the lower long term capital gains rate typically 15

first let me say that $ 1000 is not that much of amount to invest in stocks you need to remember that each transaction buy sell has fees which vary between $ depending on the broker you mentioned scottrade they charge $ 7 per transaction for stocks and about twice as much for some mutual funds consider this you invest $ 1000 you gain $ 100 you 'll pay $ 15 in fees just to buy sell that 's 1.5 expense ratio if you invest in more than 1 stock multiply your fees to avoid that you can look into mutual funds different brokers offer different funds for free and almost all of them carry many of the rest for a fee when looking into funds you can find their expense ratio and compare remember that a fund with 1 expense ratio diversifies and invests in many stocks while for you 1.5 expense ratio is for investing in a single stock is it a good idea to invest only in us or diversify worldwide you can invest in the us but in funds that diversify worldwide or across industries generally it is a good idea to diversify i am 28 should i be a conservative investor or take some risks depends on how bad of a shape will you be if you lose all your principle what online brokerage service is the best i have heard a lot about    but want to be sure before i start it seems to be the    least expensive and most user friendly to me best is a problematic term scottrade is ok e*trade is ok you can try sharebuilder ameritrade there are several discount online brokers and plenty of on line reviews and comparisons amongst them what is a margin account and how would it affect my investing from    what i understand it comes into play when an investor borrows money    from the broker do i need to use it at all as i wo n't be investing on a big scale yet you understand right there are rules to use margin accounts and with the amount you have i 'd advise against them even if you get approved read through the brokers faq 's on their requirement should i keep adding money on a monthly basis to my brokerage account    to give me more money to invest or keep it at a certain amount for an    extended period of time sharebuilder has a mechanism to purchase monthly at discounted prices but be careful they give you discounted prices to buy but not to sell you may end up with a lot of positions and the discounts you 've gotten to buy will cause you spend much more on selling generally averaging investing monthly is a good way to save and mitigate some risks but the risks are still there this is good only for long term savings how should my breakdown my investments in terms of bonds vs stocks depends on your vulnerability and risk thresholds

how often do investors really lose money all the time and it 's almost always reason number 1 let 's start with the beginner investor the person most likely to make some real losses and feel they 've learned that investing is no better than vegas this person typically gets into it because they 've been given a hot stock tip or because they 've received a windfall decided to give this investing a try and bought stock in half a dozen companies whose names they know from their everyday lives i own a bit of google how cool is that these are people who do n't understand the cyclic nature of the market bear gives way to bull gives way to bear and on and on and so when they suddenly see that what was $ 1000 is now $ 900 they panic and sell everything especially as all the pundits are declaring the end of the world they always do until the moment they sold they only had paper losses but they those losses made them real and ended at a loss then there 's the trend follower these are people who do n't necessarily hit a bear market or even a downturn in their early days but never really try to learn how the market works in any real sense they jump into every hot stock then panic and sell out of anything that starts to go the wrong way both of these reactive behaviours seem reasonable in the moment it 's gone up 15 in the past week buy buy buy and i 've lost 10 this month on that thing get rid of it before i lose any more but they work out over time to lots of buying high and selling low the very opposite of what you want to do then there 's the day trader these are people who sit in their home office buying and selling all day to try and make lots of little gains that add up to a lot the reason these people do n't do well in the long run is slightly different to the other examples first fees yes most platforms offer a discount for frequent traders but it still ai n't free second they 're playing in the big leagues of course there are exceptions who make out like bandits but day traders are playing a different game than the people i 'd call investors that game unlike buy and hold investing is much more like gambling and day traders are the enthusiastic amateurs sitting down at a table with professional poker players institutional investors and the computers and research departments that work for them even buy and hold investors even the more sophisticated ones can easily realise losses on a given stock you say you should just hold on to a stock until it goes back up but if it goes low enough it could take a decade or more to even just break even again more savvy stock pickers will have a system worked out something like ok if it gets down to 90 of what i bought it for i cut my losses and sell this is actually a sensible precaution because defining hard rules like that you eliminate emotion from your investing which is incredibly important if you want to avoid becoming the trend follower above it 's still a loss but it 's a calculated one and hopefully over time the exception rather than the rule there are probably as many other ways to lose money as there are people investing but i think i 've given you a taste the key to avoiding such things is understanding the psychology of investing and defining the rules that you 'll follow no matter what as in that last example or just go learn about index investing that 's what i did

what most respondents are forgetting is when a company allows its employees to purchase its shares at a discount with their salary the employee is usually required to hold the stock for a number of years before they can sell them the reason the company is allowing or promoting its employees to purchase its shares at a discount is to give the employees a sense of ownership of the company being a part owner in the company the employee will want the company to succeed and will tend to be more productive if employees were allowed to purchase the shares at a discount and sell them straight away it would defeat this purpose your best option to decide whether or not to buy the shares is to work out if the investment is a good one as per any other investment you would undertake i.e. determine how the company is currently performing and what its future prospects are likely to be regarding what percentage of pay to purchase the shares with if you do decide to buy them you need to work that out based on your current and future budgetary needs and your savings plan for the future

thing is it 's already explained in the letter in the end of the first paragraph tesla ’s annualized delivery rate should exceed 100,000 units by the end of next year emphasis mine   when i first saw the number i got excited but then i read the actual sentence realized what they meant and it 's still impressive but it 's not 3x increase in production yoy which would be absurd to expect esp when tesla 's trajectory has been just increases per year so far and into the mid term foreseeable future   then they explained it again on the cc elon said something like we 'll exit next year at a 100k rate but it 's hard to tell how steep the curve will be but we 'll probably have over 60k deliveries i think yeah probably   i emailed the author of this article and he still believes that tesla has unequivocally stated that they will produce and deliver 100k cars in 2015 but that 's simply not correct   i have some people who know press contacts within tesla working on it out though their efficacy at press communications has not been ideal at times in the past   if tesla did unequivocally state that they would deliver 100k cars next year after delivering just over 35k this year and 22k last year that would be enormous news and should have sent the stock to $ 300 today up 30 50%+ instead of the 4 it did go up   but it did n't send it that high because that 's just not what 's happening   i 'm extraordinarily bullish on tesla but 100k in 2015 is just not what 's going to happen   100k+ in 2016 though sounds about right   and is in line with every other estimate everyone has done for the past several years including tesla themselves   so yeah this number is n't really news but it 's nice to see them reiterate it

gt;no it has the intellectual rigor of saying that if you want to claim something then you have to prove it not parrot some propaganda that has been repeated endlessly without any proof   where 's my proof where 's my proof    you 're the one arguing for a change away from the status quo here to something that not only is entirely untested but requires everyone to do it at once and everyone to think just like you do for it to work properly it 's nothing but hypotheticals yet you 're saying the burden of proof is on me to prove that your hypothetical scenarios wo n't work    that 's not a thing you can do you ca n't prove a negative all i can do is say look around at all the free markets and populations we have now living in perfect harmony with each other and the environment oh wait they do n't exist because they do n't work in the real world    any advantage is going to be used to the competition with until you have a monopoly quasi state and it relies on the population being informed in and believing in the system enough to make a conscious effort to not buy the cheaper goods at the store with the bad business practices or potentially drive further to a different store if it 's the store doing the bad practice    charter free market you can only have one    so you 're saying there can never be a truly free market then because it strikes me that companies trading without regulatory oversight as the british dutch portuguese spanish etc did is pretty much as close as we can get they made huge huge profits of course but at the cost of a lot of human misery in fact you can look at a lot of what the british did in the 19th century as semi case studies for this as they had a proper hard on for the free market no government bailout for the famine in ireland because they did n't want to foster dependency on the state let private charities do it instead look it up people donated but not anywhere near enough to alleviate the human misery it also got all caught up in religious bullshit which did n't help matters you had little kids getting their arms ripped off by textile looms for fucks sake people working 14 hour days but it made more money than working in the fields so worth right    gt;in what way people do n't suddenly cease to have resources to deal with these things just because their resources are not forcibly centralized that does n't follow   because the pooling of vast resources for disaster relief is something that states do because there are efficiencies of scale to be had with the military the us military was a huge player in the disaster response to disasters like the boxing day tsunami and hurricane you have like and the red cross doing great and very quickly but they just ca n't provide the same resources a modern navy can in the same time wiki it turns out you face a lot of the same problems in a modern as you do in a humanitarian crisis again charities just do n't get the funding to do this sort of thing on the same scale there was a huge amount of funding dropped on the 2004 tsunami from many countries but you ca n't build a hospital ship in two weeks or a nuclear reactor to provide monumental amounts of fresh water or the helicopters and operational procedures to tie everything together many thousands more would have died without their presence    gt;what evidence or reason you have to believe that hundreds of millions of people would have died in a century without governments   this is my point neither you nor i have any evidence to base this off rather than a tendency for people to be utter bastards to each other looking at history you 're that if all governments in a puff of smoke there would n't be huge conflict in the resulting power vacuum    did not try to carry out genocide   yeah good one there were n't any anarchists in a position to do any of that great straw man    and that statement by is just that a statement why is the burden of proof on the statists it 's the anarchists who are arguing for the change in the status quo you 're the one making the claim that it would be a better system here with nothing to back it up but well people probably would n't start murdering each other pretty low bar there tbh   but if you want reasoning see my previous point if it 's such a better system if people wo n't exploit every advantage they can get and distort the free market if people would n't try and the system for their own personal gain why do we have states right now would any anarchist state region not have simply outperformed neighbours if it 's so much more efficient

do developing country equities have a higher return and/or lower risk    than emerging market equities   generally in finance you get payed more for taking risk   riskier stocks over the long run return more than less risky bonds for instance   developing market equity is expected to give less return over the long run as it is generally less risky than emerging market equity   one way to see that is the amount you pay for one rupee lira dollar euro worth of company earnings is fewer rupees lira and more dollars euros when measured in the emerging market 's currency   this makes this question interesting   risky emerging currencies like the rupee tend to devalue over time against less risky currencies euro dollars yen like where most international investment ends up but the results are rather wild   think how badly brazil has done recently and how relatively well the rupee has been doing    this adds to the returns roughly based on interest rates of foreign stocks from the point of view of a emerging market investor on average but has really wild variations do you have data for this over a long timeframe decades ideally for multiple countries not really unfortunately   good data for emerging markets is a fairly new phenomenon and even where it does exist decades ago it would have been very hard to invest like we can now so it likely is not comparable does foreign equity pay more or less when measured in rupees or other    emerging market currency probably less on average theoretically and empirically all things included though the evidence is not strong but there is a massive amount of risk in a portfolio that is 85 in a single emerging market currency   think about if you were a brazilian and needed to retire now and 85 of your portfolio was in the real   international goods like gas would be really expensive and your local currency portfolio would seem paltry right now   if you want to bet on emerging markets in the long run i would suggest that you at least spread the risk over many emerging markets and add a good chunk developed to the mix as for investing goals it 's just to maximize my return in inr or maximize my risk adjusted return that is up to you but the goal i generally recommend is making sure you are comfortable in retirement   this usually involves looking for returns are high in the long run but not having a ton of risk in a single currency or a single market   there are reasons to believe a little bias toward your homeland is good as fees tend to be lower on local investments and local investments tend to track closer to your retirement costs but too much can be very dangerous even for countries with stronger currencies say greece

yes you should be saving for retirement there are a million ideas out there on how much is a reasonable amount but i think most advisor would say at least 6 to 10 of your income which in your case is around $ 15,000 per year you give amounts in dollars are you in the u.s. if so there are at least two very good reasons to put money into a 401k or ira rather than ordinary savings or investments a often your employer will make matching contributions 50 up to 6 of your salary is pretty common i.e. if you put in 6 they put in 3 if either of your employers has such a plan that 's an instant 50 profit on your investment b any profits on money invested in an ira or 401k are tax free effectively the mechanics differ depending on the type of account so if you put $ 100,000 into an ira today and left it there until you retire 30 years later it would likely earn something like   $ 600,000 over that time assuming 7 per year growth so you 'd pay takes on your initial $ 100,000 but none on the $ 600,000 with your income you are likely in a high tax bracket that would make a huge difference if you 're saying that you just ca n't find a way to put money away for retirement may i suggest that you cut back on your spending i understand that the average american family makes about $ 45,000 per year and somehow manages to live on that if you were to put 10 of your income toward retirement then you would be living on the remaining $ which is still almost 4 times what the average family has yeah i make more than $ 45,000 a year too and there are times when i think how could anyone possibly live on that but then i think about what i spend my money on did i really need to buy two new computer printers the last couple of months i certainly could do my own cleaning rather than hiring a cleaning lady to come in twice a month etc a tough decision to make can be paying off debt versus putting money into an investment account if the likely return on investment is less than the interest rate on the loan you should certainly concentrate on paying off the loan but if the reverse is true then you need to decide between likely returns and risk

mutual funds generally make distributions once a year in december with the exact date and the estimated amount usually being made public in late october or november generally the estimated amounts can get updated as time goes on but the date does not change some funds money market bond funds funds etc distribute dividends on the last business day of each month and the amounts are rarely made available beforehand capital gains are usually distributed once a year as per the general statement above some funds e.g. s&p 500 index funds distribute dividends towards the end of each quarter or on the last business day of the quarter and capital gains once a year as per the general statement above some funds make semi annual distributions but not necessarily at six month intervals vanguard 's health care fund has distributed dividends and capital gains in march and december for as long as i have held it claims to make semi annual distributions but made distributions three times in 2014 march june december and has made will make two distributions this year already march is done june is pending the fund has gone ex dividend with   re investment today and payment on 22nd you can as chris rea suggests call the fund company directly but in my experience they are reluctant to divulge the date of the distribution the fund manager has not made the date public as yet let alone an estimated amount even getting a yes the fund intends to make a distribution later this month was difficult to get from my personal representative in early march and he had to put me on hold to talk to someone at the fund before he was willing to say so

with 1 it 's rather confusing as to where interest refers to what you 're paying and where it refers to what you 're being paid and it 's confusing what you expect the numbers to work out to be if you have to pay normal interest on top of sharing the interest you receive then you 're losing money if the lending bank is receiving less interest than the going market rate then they 're losing money if the bank you 've deposited the money with is paying more than the going market rate they 're losing money i do n't see how you imagine a scenario where someone is n't losing money for 2 and 3 you 're buying stocks on margin which certainly is something that happens but you 'll have to get an account that is specifically for margin trading it 's a specific type of credit with specific rules and you if you want to engage in this sort of trading you should go through established channels rather than trying to convert a regular loan into margin trading if you get a personal loan that is n't specifically for margin trading and buy stocks with the money and the stocks tank you can be in serious trouble if you do it through margin trading it 's still very risky but not nearly as risky as trying to game the system in some cases doing this makes you not only but criminally liable the lending bank absolutely can lose if your stocks tank since then there will be nothing backing up the loan

i thought the other answers had some good aspect but also some things that might not be completely correct so i 'll take a shot as noted by others there are three different types of entities in your question   the etf spy the index spx and options contracts first let 's deal with the options contracts   you can buy options on the etf spy or marked to the index spx   either way options are about the price of the etf index at some future date so the local min and max of the underlying symbol generally will not coincide with the min and max of the options   of course the closer the expiration date on the option the more closely the option price tracks its underlying directly   beyond the difference in how they are priced the options market has different liquidity and so it may not be able to track quick moves in the underlying although there 's a reasonably robust market for option on spy and spx specifically second let 's ask what forces really make spy and spx move together as much as they do   it 's one thing to say spy is tied to spx but how   there are several answers to this but i 'll argue that the most important factor is that there 's a notion of authorized participants who are players in the market who can create shares of spy at will   they do this by accumulating stock in the constituent companies and turning them into the market maker   there 's also the corresponding notion of redemption by which an authorized participant will turn in a share of spy to get stock in the constituent companies see and meanwhile spx is just computed from the prices of the constituent companies so it 's got no market forces directly on it   it just reflects what the prices of the companies in the index are doing of course those companies are subject to market forces key point creation redemption is the real driver for keeping the price aligned   if it gets too far out of line then it creates an arbitrage opportunity for an authorized participant   if the price of spy gets too high compared to spx and therefore the constituent stocks an authorized participant can simultaneously sell short spy shares and buy the constituent companies stocks   they can then use the redemption process to close their position at no risk   and vice versa if spy gets too low now that we understand why they move together why do n't they move together perfectly   to some extent information about fees slight differences in composition between spy and spx over time etc do play   the bigger reasons are probably that a there are not a lot of authorized participants b there are a relatively large number of companies represented in spy so there 's some actual cost and risk involved in trying to quickly buy sell the full set to capture the theoretical arbitrage that i described and c redemption creation units only come in pretty big blocks which complicates the issues under point b. you asked about dividends so let me comment briefly on that too   the dividend on spy is more or less passing on the dividends from the constituent companies i think not completely sure that the market maker deducts its fees from this cash so it 's not a direct pass through   but each company pays on its own schedule and spy does not make a payment every time so it 's holding a corresponding amount of cash between its dividend payments   this is factored into the price through the creation redemption process   i do n't know how big of a factor it is though

a few thoughts you said   to me it makes sense that if he accidentally put his own money in when he was n't supposed to he could just take it out and pay the tax on it and be fine in this case he would be putting his own after tax money in and would n't be able to deduct it so the act of putting it in and taking it back out in the same tax year would be as if the transaction never occurred at all he would not have to pay the tax on it as for this question is there any penalty to his employer if they contribute to an hsa on his behalf knowing that he is not eligible and that the money will be an excess contribution it 's good that your son is prepared to treat it as regular income and pay the appropriate taxes however the employer should be the one doing that they should be treating it as regular income and taking out fica and paying their end of fica too if they are n't doing that technically they are breaking the law the employer really should n't be making the contributions at all and if they ever bothered to correct this this article suggests that the employer may be legally allowed to drain the hsa account and take their money back out of it but only for the same tax year apparently they can do this without your son 's consent if that 's true it may make sense to withdraw all money from that account immediately as soon as the money arrives since they can not take the money back if it is no longer there once the money leaves the hsa account the employer has no choice but to change it to income and if they do n't your son must declare it as such which it sounds like he is prepared to do this does n't really answer your question of whether or not the employer can be i would assume yes but not too badly the worst case scenario for them would probably be just having to pay all the back fica on those funds if they are n't doing so already maybe an interest penalty as well all that being said i 'd recommend talking to an accountant the most important thing you want to be sure of is that your son can not possibly be liable for any wrongdoing particularly i would get confirmation on pulling money out of the hsa that you know should n't be there in the first place just to make sure there is no possible way to get dinged for that

it 's likely impossible to determine why premiums are increasing in a meaningful way not only is the between the various data points very complex but some of the increases are likely due to decisions by people who do not and will not publicly post what they decided and why however it is possible to compare health insurance premium increases over time to see if the increases in employer sponsored health insurance premiums are comparable or not to the pre aca timeframe since the aca phased in over a few years we can compare the period 2008 2010 pre aca and 2013 2015 post aca ignoring 2011 2012 as being affected by the aca phase in   for this i will look at single coverage premiums only for the purpose of simplifying the analysis i found a good table of 2008 2010 premiums from the they list the following kaiser had a good list for 2013 2015 here from 2008 2010 the average growth was around 6 per year   from 2013 2015 the growth averaged about 3   in both of these cases we are comparing total premiums sum of employer and employee contributions so from a data driven look it seems that the premium growth is lower post aca than pre aca so it 's unlikely that the aca could be accused of causing increased premium growth   of course this is us wide average and on a state by state basis there may well be significant differences that may or may not be related to the aca one thing that is covered on the page linked above that is interesting while the premium growth has slowed significantly about 50 of the growth pre aca health insurance premiums are a higher proportion of employee 's wages and that growth is continuing because wage growth has not kept pace with inflation recession   employee contributions also may be higher post recession many companies reduced their contribution percentage as my then employer did for example    finally increases in the aca plans are also commonly overstated   they largely are in line with employer plans or even less    in 2015 premiums were basically flat decreasing slightly in fact see the analysis here   2016 saw a 3.6 by this methodology see the 2016 analysis    it 's very easy to examples that are favorable to any interpretation from the data though there are such big swings as a result of the different conditions in the marketplaces that it 's easy to pick a few that have high swings and claim the aca has massive premium increases or pick a few that have low swings and claim it 's reducing costs

as a start up the initial shares can be given at various price points so essentially they can give someone a larger percentage based on the same amount earlier and lesser percentage to someone else for the same amount as its a start up the valuations can be very and what matters is that whether you believe the percentage you got for the amount is right or not    it is very important to note that when you have been given an ownership in the company how that is designated is it in absolute number of shares or is it in terms of percentage based on the existing shares for example you maybe given 100 shares without any qualification or you maybe given a 5 stake in the paid up capital that translates to 100 shares it is always better to hold the shares in of the total shares also read the contract any dilution should require your approval normally start ups once the valuation starts to go up start creating more shares and sell these to private equity or create more shares and give it as a bonus to promoters hence in both cases your holding will keep getting diluted there is a related if a startup can always issue new shares what value is there to stocks options

let me see if i can restate your question are speculative investments more volatile subject to greater spikes and drops in pricing than are more long term investments which are defined by the predictability of their dividend returns the short answer is yes   however where it gets complicated is in deciding whether something is a speculative investment take your example of housing   people who buy a house as an investment either choose to rent it out so receive rent as dividend or live in it foregoing dividends   either way the scale of the investment is large and this is often the only direct investment that people manage themselves   for this reason houses are bound up in the sentimental value people attach to a home the difficulty of and moving elsewhere in search of cheaper housing or better employment or the sunk cost of debt that ca n't be recovered by a fire sale   such inertia can lead to sudden sell offs as critical inflection points are reached such as hoped for economic improvements fail to and cash needs become critical at different levels that is true of just about every investment driving price volatility is the ease of sale and the trade offs involved   a share that offers regular and dependable dividends even if its absolute value falls is going to be hung on to more frequently than those shares that suffer a similar decline but only offer a capital gain   for the latter the race is on to sell before the drop any remaining capital gain the investor may have experienced a house with a good tenant or a share with stable dividends will be kept in preference for the quick cash return of selling an asset that offers no such ongoing returns this would result visually in more curves for speculative shares while more stable shares are by periods of stability with moments of mania but i have to take your query further since you provide graphical evidence to support your thesis   your charts combine varying time scales different sample rates and different scales one of which is even a log scale   it becomes impossible to draw any sort of meaningful micro comparison unless they 're all presented using exactly the same criteria

the contract is not very clear as much as i can understand it will still help if you make part prepayments in an rule 78 or actuarial method the schedule is drawn up front and the break up of interest and principal for each month is calculated ahead at the beginning both the reducing balance method as well as actuarial method will give the same schedule   however in actuarial method if you make part prepayments they get applied to the future principals the interest are ignored however the future interests are not reduced example say your schedule looks something like this monthly payments say 100 month | principal | interest 1 | 10 | 90 2 | 20 | 80 3 | 30 | 70 4 | 40 | 60 5 | 50 | 50 6 | 60 | 40 7 | 70 | 30 8 | 80 | 20 9 | 90 | 10 so lets say you have made 3 payments of 100 in the 4th month if you make 150 in addition to 100 it would get applied to the principal of 4th 5th and 6th month so essentially you would save interest of 4th 5th and 5th month it would also reduce the total payments to 6 i.e. you will only have 7th 8th 9th due the next payment you make of 100 will get applied to row 7 the disadvantage of this method over reducing balance is that the interest calculated for rows do n't change compared to reducing balance however if you prepay in full the unearned interest is calculated and returned as per the actuarial tables

what you are describing is called following or going over a budget there is no debt or loans in the scenario you are describing simply put a budget is when you allocate a certain amount of your income for expenses in various categories and a certain amount for savings   so lets say you earn $ 100 a month if you budget $ 50 in expenses every month then that means you try not to spend more then $ 50 a month and the rest you save in any given month you may go over your self imposed budgeted amount for expenses that simply means you are over the amount for that month but that does not make you in debt it just means you did n't meet your goal for that month or whatever time period you created however if you do this then you clearly do n't have a realistic budget because the idea behind a budget is a plan that you can realistically meet on a consistent basis sometimes you may have to break it but it should be made in such a way that if you work at it it is consistently achievable if not then you need to rethink your budget instead of thinking in terms of taking loans from yourself i would encourage you to think in terms of saving up for goals and only spending money from those goal funds in this way you are not arbitrarily spending money that would instead go into savings but rather explicitly setting money aside for those goals this will also help you to see where exactly your money is going and also help you to prioritize your financial goals

the carry forward refers to the annual allowance which is a limit on the total pension contributions you can make and still get any tax relief at all   however the tax relief itself only applies to the year you make the contribution and you ca n't carry the contribution itself back or forward to get relief at a higher marginal rate so in scenario 1 you get £ 2 k relief and your provider gets £ 2 k relief but the actual contribution you should make to your provider is £ they 'll add in the £ 2 k to make a £ 10 k gross contribution and then you 'll claim back the £ 2 k leaving you having contributed £ 6 k net for the £ 10 k gross contribution the mechanism whereby the pension provider claims back the £ 2 k is called relief at source for scenario 2 you 'll only get basic rate tax relief on the second £ 10 k because you 'll have already reduced your gross income for the year below the higher rate threshold with the first £ 10k. if you managed to make pension contributions in excess of the annual allowance even considering carry forward then you 'd get no tax relief at all on those contributions given that the pension would also get taxed when paid this is not a good deal and people generally avoid exceeding that limit for 3 i 'm not entirely certain but i think you can carry forward in the circumstances you describe i think the principle is simply that you could have paid into a pension scheme in practice i also do n't think hmrc will be worrying too much about this precise detail even if they have the opposite interpretation it 'd be a lot of work to check for not much gain

sounds like a bad idea the ira is built on the power of compounding removing contributions will hurt your retirement savings and you will never be able to make that up instead consider tax free investments state bonds federal bonds municipal bonds etc for example i invest in california muni bonds fund which gives me ~3 4 annual dividend income completely tax free in addition there 's capital appreciation of your fund holdings there are risks of course for example rate changes will affect yields and capital appreciation so consult with someone knowledgeable in this area or ask another question here for the basics this will give you the same result as you 're expecting from your roth ira trick without damaging your retirement savings potential

i think a simplified version of what you are asking is how much benefit you will receive from lower mortgage payments on your future $ 400k roughly home loan by having a higher credit score than now and whether taking a car loan now will increase that benefit more than the value of the car loan since you already know the cost to you of the car loan the other two thing you need to know in order to answer that question are 1- the amount of increase a car loan gives your credit score and 2- how much lower your mortgage interest rate will be with a higher credit score answering 1 seems like fuzzy credit magic to me that someone else may be able to answer but 2 should be easy to determine by talking to a mortgage broker to see what rate you can get with your current credit score and finding out how much higher it needs to be in order to get a better rate then you can take the difference in mortgage payments between the two rates and compare that to your car loan value

the most depressing here in the uk is that several different think tanks have come out and categorically said that the by far the most effective tax policy is a very simple flat tax rate and high personal allowance i.e. the threshold before you get taxed    getting rid of all the tax allowances and other complication would massively streamline the system and there would be huge savings the system would be fairer and would generate more cash however this will never happen because it will perceived as tax break on the rich when in reality it would be a tax increase because of the lack of tax breaks

you can also roll money from prior 401ks into current 401ks call the administrator of the 401k you prefer i.e. fidelity schwab whoever the financial institution is explain you do n't work there anymore and ask if you can roll money into it some plans allow this and some do n't so either 1 you   can roll all your prior 401ks into your current 401k 2 you might be able to roll all prior 401ks into the prior 401k of your choice if they will accept contributions after you 've left you ca n't move the amount in your current employer 's 401k until you separate or hit a certain age 3 like mentioned above you can roll all prior 401ks into an ira at any financial institution that will let you set up an ira process the financial institutions you want to move the money from tell them you want a direct rollover have them write the check to the financial institution you are rolling into with your name mentioned but not the beneficiary i.e. check written to schwab john doe account tax implications you are rolling from a pre tax 401k to a pre tax 401k or ira and the money goes directly from institution to institution you are not liable for taxes you can also roll from a roth type already taxed account into another roth type account with no tax implications if they write a check to you and you do n't put the money in an ira or 401k within 60 days you will pay ~20 tax and a 10 early withdrawal penalty that 's why it 's best to transfer from institution to institution 401k vs ira is a personal decision you could move all your prior 401ks into an ira you set up for yourself generally the limitations of a 401k are the lack of funds to invest in that fit your retirement strategy or high expense ratios be sure to investigate the fees you would pay for trades in an ira 401k are almost always free and the expense ratio for funds in your 401k vs funds you might invest in at a broker for your ira best of both can roll all your 401ks into a single 401k and still set up an ira or roth ira if your income qualifies that you can contribute to separately this could give you flexibility in fund choices if your 401k fees tend to be cheaper while keeping the bulk of your nest egg in low cost mutual funds through an employer account last advice even if you do n't like the options in your current 401k make sure you are contributing at least enough to get any employer match

excellent observation the short answer is that you do n't own the firm you own the right to your share of the profits or losses for the period that you worked there   technically you also have the right to vote to sell or the company known as    the workers at equal exchange voted in a clause to our bylaws to prevent this basically a poison pill it says that if we ever sold the company we have to pay off any debts return any investments at the price paid and give away any remaining assets to another company dedicated to fair trade the effect is that there is no incentive for us to sell the company so we do n't worry about all the kinds of things you would if you were focused on an exit strategy but in this sense ownership is even more compromised right    back to your question i think the answer is it depends on what you mean by ownership it is certainly not ownership in the conventional sense i think of it more like a we are of the enterprise while we have the benefits given to active workers but we have a responsibility not just to maximize our own well being but that of the other stakeholders our suppliers consumers investors our communities the environment etc including the people who worked there before and left part of the profits in the company as retained earnings and those that will come after us

you almost never want to repay a student loan early as you 've realised you can put the money in an isa instead and earn more interest than you 're paying on the loan if you withdrew money from the isa each month to replace the repayments being taken from your salary there 'd be money left in the isa when you finished repaying the loan this is also the cheapest debt you 'll ever have so if you repay it now and then end up borrowing money elsewhere in the future you 'll probably be worse off in particular if you expect to have a mortgage at some point you 'll probably be better off keeping the money to add to a deposit rather than repaying it now and then borrowing more on the mortgage you should also consider how long it 'll take you to repay the loan normally if you do n't expect to finish repaying within 25 years you 'd be throwing money away by repaying early this is more of an issue for the larger loans

the prices we pay for goods and services are n't set by our levels of income why should the compensation we owe the community in taxes   lvt and with their capitalisation into selling prices are economically one and the same thing the only difference is who collects   if lvt is an income tax then so is rent or mortgage repayments in fact paying for anything is an income tax   the lvt is merely the way by which we equally share the value derived from scarce natural resources if we do n't do that then inequality and dysfunction are baked into our economies and societies   lvt does n't tax the wealth people create from land but taxes the wealth creating potential of land it is the of taxing incomes capital and transactions that causes losses whereas the lvt has none     this is because it is set by market not levels of income as the amount an individual or firm is prepared to pay for exclusive use of that location so if you can not pay the lvt then someone else will   that is not only fair but the optimally efficient way of allocating resources   this is how a capitalist free market based economy is supposed to work those that opposed the lvt are nothing but blue socialists

aiui this is not terribly abnormal there are sometimes to as pending charges or holds and actual charges an authorisation reserves money but does n't actually take it normally what happens when you pay by card is that the merchant gets an authorisation immediately then some time later the authorisation is converted into an actual charge when the merchant takes the money sometimes merchants are slow in taking the actual charge either deliberately some merchants wo n't charge your card until they actually supply the goods to reduce the chance of having to process a refund or because of administrative somewhere when this happens the authorisation can time out before the actual charge is taken so you get the pattern you see first the authorisation appears then it times out and and finally the actual charge shows up

is right if a halt is in place then no trading will occur simple as that but in the practice of risk management it is a little different want to remind you that you are assuming that trading is halted immediately upon the drop in price that does n't always happen so if there is any time between the actual price drop and halt of trading then it is possible that your order will be filled depending on how liquid your security is also not every security has circuit breakers in place and the exact requirements to trigger a breaker is not public information   in some cases trades are ordered to be rolled back reversed by the exchange but this is usually reserved for institutional traders who make some sort of mistake   this article below mentions day traders who bought at or near the bottom of the may 6 2010 flash crash this was before circuit breakers but i think it 's a good story for someone looking to understand the finer workings of the electronic market

there are two things you need to keep in mind when you look at inflation as an entity inflation is necessary to keep in check the value of goods as per moore 's law for example a mobile phone that you buy for £ 100 today will be available for £ 50 in two years with increased purchasing power one needs to maintain balance between the purchasing power and its value if you think about the loss at a rate of 2 you would have £ in terms of today 's value in two years but if you looked at the same cell phone as leverage for your business where it allowed you to do work and earn £ 1000 in two years the investment would clearly offset the cost of inflation inflation is incentive for people to spend their money if you for example spent all of your £ 100 today it is £ 100 income for someone else he has further incentive to spend it creating a chain of transactions in theory while this is a true mathematical loss the increasing purchasing power helps you leverage your financial asset to get a return on your investment

you have heard the old adage buy low sell high right that sounds so obvious that you 'd have to wonder why they would ever bother such an expression it should rank up there with do n't walk in front of a moving car on the duh scale of advice well your question demonstrates exactly why it is n't quite so obvious in the real world and that people need to be reminded of it   so in your example the stock prices are currently low relative to what they have been so per that adage do you sell or buy when prices are low hint it is n't sell yes your gut is going to tell you the exact opposite thanks to the fact that our brains are unfortunately wired to make us susceptible to the loss aversion fallacy when the market has undergone a big drop is the worst time to stop contributing buying stocks   this example might help get your brain and gut to agree a little more easily if you were talking about any other non investment commodity cars for instance   your question equates to i really need a car but the prices have been dropping like crazy lately     maybe i should wait until the car dealers start raising their prices again before i buy one dollar cost averaging as littleadv suggested if you have an automatic payroll deduction for your retirement account you are getting the benefit of dollar cost averaging because you are investing the same amount on a scheduled interval you are buying more shares when they are cheap and fewer when they are expensive it is like an automatic buy low strategy is built into the account the alternative which you are implying is a market timing strategy under this strategy instead of investing regularly you try to get in and out of investments right before they go up drop there are two major flaws with this approach    1 your brain will work against you see above and encourage you to do the exact opposite of what you should be doing    2 unless you are this strategy is n't much better than gambling if you are lucky it can work but because of 1 the odds are stacked against you

during the settlement period the buyer transfers payment to the seller and the seller transfers ownership to the buyer this is really a from the days when so much of stock trading was done by individual human traders and computers were still not a huge part of the operation   back then paper tickets for trades exchanged hands and the time period was actually 5 days so 3 days is an improvement    a settlement period was necessary for everyone to figure out their trades and do what was necessary to make the settlements happen so it was not always a quick process mainly because of smaller trading firms that did n't have technology to help them along nowadays technology makes settlements easy and they usually occur at the end of the trading day   the trading firms sum up their trades figure out who they owe and send lump sum settlements to the counterparties to their trades   if anything the period may just be used now to let parties verify trades before settling i hope this helps good luck

yeah because under those conditions its usually a 50 50 joint venture with a chinese company local government meaning its in the contract they show the partner how they do things and how their technology works they also lose control on who they bring in   at least with a wholly own factory they can control who they hire and have heavy restrictions on who they show their technology     before you go on and say china will with and steal their technology when it comes to corporate espionage what would be stopping tesla or any multinational company from hiring a spy in their current facilities in the us or anywhere else

when you set up a short sale for equities you are borrowing stock from someone else typically another client at the broker   the broker usually an agreement to let your shares be borrowed for short sales in your account details   so if client a wants to short a stock he borrows stock from client b to do the short sale it 's usually not this direct as they can borrow from many clients   if client b then wants to sell his shares if the broker ca n't shift around assets to find another client 's shares to let client a borrow then he has to close the short position out because he does n't have the shares in the brokerage to let client a borrow to short anymore

you need to look at the numbers when you 're ready to transact   what your crossover is worth now what the truck will lease for then what financing deals may or may not be available will all change i 'm not sure why you 've already decided you will lease the truck perhaps you 're planning to take advantage of some kind of business write off   i would personally never put anything down on a lease though i have argued with people on here about that particular decision   the reality is you need to look at the numbers   some banks will adjust the interest you pay on your lease to account for your down payment some do n't    consider a $ 9,000 lease $ 250 per month for 36 months   consider you pay $ 1,000 up front as a down payment    example 1 $ 1,000 lowers the amount due on the lease to $ 8,000 lowering your monthly payment to $ from $ 250 the downpayment has accomplished nothing   over the 36 months you will have still paid the same $ 9,000    example 2 $ 1,000 up front changes the amount owed and other fees generally applicable to a lease gap insurance etc and your payment drops to $ your total over the lease is now $ $ 1,000 down and $ in payments    you need to look at the numbers   in general if you know you will be purchasing the truck at the end of the lease it 's more financially advantageous to just purchase it from the start

taking examples from this loosely googled page if you find or calculate the standard deviation volatility of the returns from your various investment classes you will find they range from low risk low volatility such as cash to high risk high volatility such as strategic growth   the risk rating volatility is a good indicator of how reactive to market conditions your investment is likely to be   as you can see below from to the high risk index performed really well but it was also most reactive when the market subsequently turned down   the medium risk indices performed the best over the chart period 2010 to 2013 but it could have turned out different   generally you choose your investment according to your risk appetite how much you 're willing to risk   you might play safe with say 30 cash 60 medium risk 10 high risk   then again are you paying someone to manage cash which you might be able to do for free in a bank assuming for a moment european 3 and equity tracker 9 had the same medium risk profile then holding 50 50 would also add some currency diversification which is usually advisable   however the main choice is down to risk appetite to address your specific question my main interest for now is between stockmarket growth and strategic growth first thing to do is check their volatilities for a further level of sophistication you can check how they are correlated against each other   if they are inversely correlated i.e. one goes up when the other goes down then holding some of each could be a good diversification fyi an introduction to investment theory the historical returns are important too but the investment classes your pension fund is offering will probably be reasonably aligned on a risk return basis   you should check though   i.e. do they line up on a plot of 3 year return vs volatility e.g. the line through sa cash sa bonds vol target 20 sa equity   source

yes i am in favour of democracy and a small state and help to those that truly need it like the handicapped poor children and disaster victims however if you do not reward work savings and investments the only way to get people to actually behave sensibly and do the boring tasks needing to maintain and improve standards of living is by punishing those that do not work like they do in socialist states

i do n't see how this concept takes off first and foremost is not a bank but a tech company as one leaves industry regulation and treasury management the core of banking to outside parties   call me old fashioned but i prefer to have as few stops between me and my money as possible if not for a fear of losing it in a robbery and inability to earn interest i 'd shove it under a mattress so why would i want to bank with an intermediary who does n't understand how the process works how is that looking out for my interests and how is your security better than other institutions that offer encryption and multiple security questions to test a customer 's identity   i 'd like to add that not charging overdraft fees and providing lines of credit to help customers out in the event they spend more than they have is nice in concept but what happens when those same customers do not make deposits to cover their shortfalls when it comes to money people will take advantage of any opportunities they have to circumvent the system especially if funds are tight

i think the one single answer is that the answer depends on the two countries involved and their banks practices to find that answer you need to ask other expats from your country living in france and ask them for their experience   note that most expats do not know what fees they are paying for example in the philippines the lowest fee charged still involves waiting 30 days to get your money   specifically i opened a us dollar savings account with the minimum of us $ 500 required other rules are involved for opening a bank account deposited a personal check drawn on my us bank account no fee charged and waited 30 calendar days to withdraw usd bills   the philippines bank did not have a branch in the us but had financial arrangements with us banks   after getting usd dollars in my hand i walked to a nearby exchange business store which usually offered a better daily rate than a bank but a rate between the banks buy and sell rates and exchange the dollars for pesos   note that years ago banks did not give usd bills when dollars were scarce in the philippines however this process does not work in thailand due to bank rules against private individuals opening a usd account with exceptions   and there are still fees involved march 2017

those are some very broad questions and i do n't think i can answer them completely but i will add what i can barron 's finance and investment handbook is the best reference book i have found it provides a basic description definition for every type of investment available it covers stocks preferred stocks various forms of bonds as well as mortgage pools and other exotic instruments it has a comprehensive dictionary of finance terms as well i would definitely recommend getting it   the question about how people invest today is a huge one there are people who simply put a monthly amount into a mutual fund and simply do that until retirement on one side and professional day traders who move in and out of stocks or commodities on a daily basis on the other

there is a substantial likelihood over the next several years that the us dollar will experience inflation you may have heard terms like quantitative easing with inflation the value of each dollar you have will go down this also means that the value of each dollar you owe will go down as well   so taking out a loan issuing a bond at a very good rate converting it into an asset that 's a better way to store value possibly including stock in a big stable company like msft and then watching inflation reduce the real value of the loan faster than the interest piles up that 's like getting free money combine that with the tax shelter games alluded to by everyone else and it starts to look like a very profitable endeavour
