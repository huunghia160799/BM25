generally credit card networks as opposed to debit atm cards that may or may not have visa mc logos have a rule that a merchant must accept any credit card with their logo visa rules for merchants in the us say it explicitly accept all types of valid visa cards although visa card acceptance    rules may vary based on country specific requirements or local    regulations to offer the broadest possible range of payment options    to cardholder customers most merchants choose to accept all    categories of visa debit credit and prepaid cards unfortunately the visa site for china is in chinese so i ca n't find similar reference there you can complain against a merchant who you think had violated visa rules here that said its not a law its a contract between the merchant processor and the visa international organization and merchants are known to break these rules here and there most commonly refusing to accept foreign cards including in the us also local laws may affect these contracts for example in the us it is legal to set minimum amount requirements when accepting credit cards this only affects credit card processing and merchants that do n't accept credit cards may still accept debit cards since those work in different networks under a different set of rules those who accept credit cards are also required to accept debit cards at least if used as credit

index funds are well known to give the best long term investment are they maybe not all the time if you had invested in an index fund tracking the s&p500 at the start of 2000 you would still be behind in terms of capital appreciation when taking inflation into considerations your only returns in 13.5 years would have been any dividends you may have received see the monthly chart of the s&p500 below   diversification can be good for your overall returns but diversification simply for diversification sake is as you said a way of reducing your overall returns in order of smoothing out your equity curve after looking up indexes for various countries the only one that had made decent returns over a 13.5 year period was the indian bse 30 index almost 400 over 13.5 years although it also has gone nowhere since the end of 2007 5.5 years see monthly chart below   so investing internationally especially in developing countries when developed nations are stagnating can improve your returns but i would learn about the various international markets first before straight in regarding investing in an index fund vs direct investment in a select group of shares i did a search on the us markets with the following criteria on the 3rd january 2000   if the resulting top 10 from the search were bought on 3rd january 2000 and held up until the close of the market on the 19th june 2013 the results would be as per the table below   the result almost 250 return in 13.5 years compared to almost no return if you had invested into the whole s&p 500 index note this table lists only the top ten from the search without screening through the charts and no risk management was applied if risk management was applied the 4 losses of would have been limited to a maximum of 20 but possibly much smaller losses or even for gains as they might have gone into positive territory before coming back down as i have not looked at any of the charts i can not confirm this this is one simple example how selecting good shares can result in much better returns than investing into a whole index as you are not pulled down by the bad stocks

in your entire question the only time you mention that this is an investment inside an ira is when you say every quarter six months whatever i d have to rebalance my ira while vanguard would do this for the fund of funds without me needing to within an ira there are no tax implications to the rebalancing but if this investment were not inside an ira then the rebalancing done by you will have tax implications in particular any gains realized when you sell shares in one fund and buy shares in another fund during the rebalancing process are subject to income tax similarly losses also might be realized and will affect your taxes however if you are invested in a fund of funds there are no capital gains or capital losses when re balancing is done you have gains or losses only when you sell shares of the fund of funds for a price different than the price you paid for them

when you say donate it usually assumes charitable donation with in this context tax benefit that is not what happens in your scenario giving someone money with the requirement of that someone to spend that money at your shop is not donation it is a grant you can do that but you wo n't be able to deduct this as charitable donation but the money paid to you back would be taxable income to you i respectfully disagree with joe that its a wash it is not you give them money that you can not deduct as an expense as it is not business expense or donation as strings are attached but you do give them the money it is no longer yours when they use the money to pay you back that same money becomes your taxable income end result you provide service and you 're the one paying taxes for it why would you do that

gt;no it has the intellectual rigor of saying that if you want to claim something then you have to prove it not parrot some propaganda that has been repeated endlessly without any proof   where 's my proof where 's my proof    you 're the one arguing for a change away from the status quo here to something that not only is entirely untested but requires everyone to do it at once and everyone to think just like you do for it to work properly it 's nothing but hypotheticals yet you 're saying the burden of proof is on me to prove that your hypothetical scenarios wo n't work    that 's not a thing you can do you ca n't prove a negative all i can do is say look around at all the free markets and populations we have now living in perfect harmony with each other and the environment oh wait they do n't exist because they do n't work in the real world    any advantage is going to be used to the competition with until you have a monopoly quasi state and it relies on the population being informed in and believing in the system enough to make a conscious effort to not buy the cheaper goods at the store with the bad business practices or potentially drive further to a different store if it 's the store doing the bad practice    charter free market you can only have one    so you 're saying there can never be a truly free market then because it strikes me that companies trading without regulatory oversight as the british dutch portuguese spanish etc did is pretty much as close as we can get they made huge huge profits of course but at the cost of a lot of human misery in fact you can look at a lot of what the british did in the 19th century as semi case studies for this as they had a proper hard on for the free market no government bailout for the famine in ireland because they did n't want to foster dependency on the state let private charities do it instead look it up people donated but not anywhere near enough to alleviate the human misery it also got all caught up in religious bullshit which did n't help matters you had little kids getting their arms ripped off by textile looms for fucks sake people working 14 hour days but it made more money than working in the fields so worth right    gt;in what way people do n't suddenly cease to have resources to deal with these things just because their resources are not forcibly centralized that does n't follow   because the pooling of vast resources for disaster relief is something that states do because there are efficiencies of scale to be had with the military the us military was a huge player in the disaster response to disasters like the boxing day tsunami and hurricane you have like and the red cross doing great and very quickly but they just ca n't provide the same resources a modern navy can in the same time wiki it turns out you face a lot of the same problems in a modern as you do in a humanitarian crisis again charities just do n't get the funding to do this sort of thing on the same scale there was a huge amount of funding dropped on the 2004 tsunami from many countries but you ca n't build a hospital ship in two weeks or a nuclear reactor to provide monumental amounts of fresh water or the helicopters and operational procedures to tie everything together many thousands more would have died without their presence    gt;what evidence or reason you have to believe that hundreds of millions of people would have died in a century without governments   this is my point neither you nor i have any evidence to base this off rather than a tendency for people to be utter bastards to each other looking at history you 're that if all governments in a puff of smoke there would n't be huge conflict in the resulting power vacuum    did not try to carry out genocide   yeah good one there were n't any anarchists in a position to do any of that great straw man    and that statement by is just that a statement why is the burden of proof on the statists it 's the anarchists who are arguing for the change in the status quo you 're the one making the claim that it would be a better system here with nothing to back it up but well people probably would n't start murdering each other pretty low bar there tbh   but if you want reasoning see my previous point if it 's such a better system if people wo n't exploit every advantage they can get and distort the free market if people would n't try and the system for their own personal gain why do we have states right now would any anarchist state region not have simply outperformed neighbours if it 's so much more efficient

there has been almost no inflation during 2014 2015 do you mean rental price inflation or overall inflation housing price and by extension rental price inflation is usually much higher than the basket of goods cpi or numbers the low levels of these two indicators are mostly caused by technology oil and food price deflation at least in the us uk and europe other inflation my slightly biased i 've just moved to a new rental property and entirely london centric empirical evidence suggests that 5 is quite a low figure for house price inflation and therefore also rental inflation your landlord will also try to get as much for the property as he can so look around for similar properties and work out what a market rate might be within tolerances of course and negotiate based on that for the new asked price i could get a similar apartment in similar condos with gym and pool this one does n't have anything or in a way better area closer to supermarkets restaurants etc suggests that you have already started on this and that the landlord is trying to artificially inflate rents if you can afford the extra 5 and these similar but better appointed places are at that price why not move it sounds like the reason that you are looking to stay on in this apartment is either familiarity or loyalty to the landlord so it may be time to benefit from a move

for all stocks expected dividends are a part of the price it is traded for consider that originally the whole idea of stocks was to participate in the earnings of the company = get dividends the day the dividend is paid that expectation is of course removed and thereby the stock value reduced by just the amount of dividend paid you will see that behavior for all stocks everywhere the dividend in your example is just high relative to the stock price but that is a company decision they can decide whatever amount they want as a dividend in other words the day before dividend payments investors value the stock at $ plus an expected dividend payment of 12 $ which adds to 26 $ the day after the dividend payment investors still value the stock at $ plus no more dividend payment = 0 $ nothing changed really in the valuation

in addition to the answer by craig sometimes brands are owned by publicly traded companies which have a very diverse product portfolio in case of microsoft their stock price and dividend will not be controlled solely by that one product they make but also by their many other products plus a billion other factors which can influence a stock price so when you want to bet specifically on the success of windows phone then betting on the microsoft corporation as a whole might not achieve that goal however you can also try to find companies whose success depends indirectly on the success of the product that can be suppliers someone who makes a specific part which is only used for windows phones companies which make windows phone specific accessories or software developers who make applications which specifically target the windows phone ecosystem when the product portfolio of these companies is far narrower than that of microsoft they might be more dependent on the success of windows phone than microsoft themselves but as always keep in mind that the success of their products is not the only factor which decides the stock value of a company the stock market is far more complex than that

of course the situation for each student will vary widely so you 'll have to dig deep on your own to know what is the best choice for your situation now that the disclaimer is out of the way the best choice would be to use the unsubsidized stafford loan to finance graduate school if you need to resort to loans the major benefits to the unsubsidized stafford are the following you 'll be forced to consider other loan types due to the unsubsidized stafford loan 's established limits on how much you can borrow per year and in aggregate the borrowing limits are also adjustable down by your institution the plus loan is a fallback loan program designed to be your last resort the program was created as a way for parents to borrow money for their college attending children when all other forms of financing have been exhausted as a result you have the following major disadvantages to using the plus loan you do have the bonus of being able to borrow up to 100 of your educational costs without any limits per year or in aggregate the major benefit of keeping your loans in the direct loan program is predictability many private student loans are variable interest rate loans which can result in higher payments during the course of the loan private loans are also not eligible for government loan forgiveness programs such as for working in a non profit for 10 years

gt if everyone on average gets say a ~3 boost on their score why would n't banks just adjust their standards by 3   because the score change only affects those who have had delinquent payments but are current now on medical debt in the past 7 years   that 's not everybody by a long shot   also no lender except possibly automated consumer debt applications gives a shit about what your actual score is   mortgage lenders review each application based on things like debt income existing installment payments and actual credit history meaning account details and repayment history

there have been many interesting and correct answers but to give a direct answer to your first question dividend yield is simply dividend over current share price so if the share price drops your dividend yield increases proportionately dividend yield is not something one should use as the only source of information of whether a stock is a good bad buy it does not show many important factors the riskiness of the company business its financial position profitability ability to generate cash furthermore dividend yield is just a snapshot of an income gain at a given point in time it does not mean that this very dividend policy is going to continue in the future especially not so if the company finances this dividend payments using not its own cash reserves but outside capital by issuing debt securities which is unsustainable

the perceived risk depends on the entire situation but often it is considered more risk especially if you want to occupy yourself things you need to consider it can be very difficult to show a property with tenants occupying it there are many reasons for this and most homes show sell better empty i have found many tenants make it difficult on the seller leaving their areas a mess being and especially in markets that are flooded with options a lot of buyers just wo n't bother with the difficulty of scheduling a showing in occupied properties i 've tried to purchase many properties where the renter insists on being there during a showing but wo n't open the door and there 's no recourse for the landlord because his lease or laws in the area do n't allow you to enter without permission also it can be difficult to look past a lot of clutter and other people 's decorating and preferences to be kind is the property currently under lease and what is the period of that lease it could be that the lease is month to month or it could be years remaining on the lease period it is likely a legal requirement in most areas that you honor the existing lease i would never buy a property that has multiple years remaining while some amateur landlords will allow 2 or even 5 year leases this is a very bad idea for many reasons what are laws like in your area for evicting tenants you should know this regardless of whether or not you intend to occupy or keep it a rental it can be a very difficult process evicting tenants and this process is vastly different from country to country and state to state here in the usa look into the security deposit assuming there is one how much is the deposit will it cover damage that may not exist yet do n't think that just because you plan on evicting them soon it is n't important people can trash a place on the way out and an expensive lawsuit could be your only recourse it is far easier to take a deposit than sue i would absolutely demand that the deposit transfer to you upon sale view the current renters with a fresh eye especially if you are considering leave it a rental look into all of the typical requirements their monthly income their credit history their criminal record their payment history their references are they likely to be good or terrible renters if you 're interested in the property consider an offer which requires the current landlord to evict within the time frame of the buy sell agreement this is n't an uncommon requirement i think the first thing to do is go look at the property and see if you can determine for yourself why it has n't sold yet properties all have different reasons for not selling in a reasonable time to the local market having renters alone in most markets should n't be that big of a factor i would suspect bad smells nasty renters or an unfavorable lease agreement exists

not for the tax break no as others have said that still costs you money however with rates being low right now and brought a bit lower by the tax break this is an opportunity for the safest form of leveraged investing you will ever find if you invest that money the returns on investment will probably be better than the mortgage rate and that leaves you with a net profit there is some risk if the market collapses but it 's less risk than any other form of borrowing to invest that also leave you with more flexibility if you need cash in a hurry you can draw down the investments rather than taking another loan if the risk bothers you you can do what i did and split the difference i put 50 down and financed the rest i sometimes regret not having pushed it harder since it has worked out well for me but that was the level of risk i was comfortable with

check out the questions about why stock prices are what they are in a nutshell a stock 's value is based on the future prospects of the company generally speaking if a growth company is paying a dividend that payment is going to negatively affect the growth of the business the smart move is to re invest that capital and make more money as a shareholder you are compensated by a rising stock price when a stock is n't growing quickly a dividend is a better way for a stockholder to realize value if a gas and electric company makes a billion dollars investing that money back into the company is not going to yield a large return and since those types of companies do n't really grow too much the stocks typically trade in a range and do n't see the type of appreciation that a growth stock will so it makes sense to pay out the dividend to the shareholders

if it is true that for the same price you could get a better place or that for a lower price you could get an equivalent place you should do some soul searching to decide what monetary value you would place on the hassle of moving to such an alternative   you should then negotiate aggressively for a rent that is no more than the rent of the alternative place plus your hassle costs and if the landlord does not meet your price you should refuse to renew your lease and instead move out to an alternative   of course you might also want to double check your research to ensure you really can get such a good alternative and that your new landlords wo n't try a similar bait and switch and force you to move again in a year barring local ordinances such as rent control laws i do n't think it 's worth it to worry about whether the increase is normal   if you can get a better deal somewhere else then what your landlords are asking is too much   if you have a good relationship with them on a personal level you may be able to tell them this in a nice way and thus get them to make a more reasonable offer   otherwise the landlords will learn that their expectations are unreasonable when all their tenants move out to cheaper places

how much is rent in your area you should compare a rental payment versus your mortgage payment now bearing in mind the opportunity cost of the difference let 's say that a rental unit in your area that has the same safety convenience as your house costs $ 1600 per month to rent and your mortgage is $ 2400 by staying in the house you are losing that $ 800 month as well as interest earned on banking that money however right now interest rates are negligible factor in total cost of ownership too meaning extra utilities for one or the other sometimes houses are cheaper sometime not property insurance and taxes for the house if they are n't already in escrow through your mortgage and generic house repair stuff   if the savings for a rental are worth more than a couple hundred a month then i suggest you consider bailing start multiplying $ 500 1000 per month out over a year or two and decide if that extra cash is better for you than crappy credit also this is not the most ethical thing but i do know of one couple who stopped paying their mortgage for several months knowing they were going to give the house back at the end they took what they would have spent in mortgage payments during that time into a savings account and will have more than enough cash to float for the few years that their credit is lowered by the default also something to consider is that we are in a time of ridiculous numbers of people defaulting as such a poor credit score might start to be more common among people with decent incomes to the point where a poor score in 5 years is worth about the same as an average score today i would n't count on that but it might soften the blow of your bad credit if you default

i am using the same logic as the two answers above i got almost the same result $ instead of $ per share using the sold fractional share basis however the jci qualified dividend on the 1099-div not the 1099-b divided by the number of shares spun off yields a basis per share of only $ that compares to $ in answer two above it seems that we should get the approximately same basis per share using the same arithmetic and i do not know why we do n't for my tax files i plan to use the basis equal to the dividend from the 2016 1099-div of jci the plc after the merger my reasoning is that i can not use an amount for the basis that is greater than the dividend i paid taxes on in case this part of the question comes up again you can get historical quotes at various websites such as which does show $ as the closing price on

it is important to distinguish between cause and effect as well as the supply saving versus demand borrowing side of money to understand the relationship between interest rates bond yields and inflation what is mean by interest rates is usually based on the officially published rates determined by the central bank and is referenced to the overnight lending rate for meeting reserve requirements   in practice what the means is for example in the united states the federal reserve will have periodic meetings to determine whether to leave this rate alone or to raise or lower the rate   the new rate is generally determined by their assessment of current and forecast national and global economic conditions and factors in the votes of the various regional federal reserve presidents   if the fed economic weakness they will tend to lower and keep rates lower while when the economy seems to be overheated the tendency will be to raise rates bond yields are also based on the expectation of future economic conditions but as determined by market participants   at times the market will actually lead the fed in bidding bond prices up or down while at other times it will react after the fed does   however ignoring the varying time lag the two generally will track each other because they are really the same thing   the only difference is the participants which are collectively determining what the rates yields are the inverse relationship between interest rates and inflation is the main reason for fluctuating rates in the first place   the fed will tend to raise rates to try to slow inflation and lower rates when it feels inflation is too low and economic growth should be stimulated   likewise when the economy is doing poorly there is both little inflationary pressure driving interest rates down both in terms of what savers can accept to keep ahead of inflation and at and depressed levels of borrowing reduced demand for money driving down rates to try to balance supply and demand and the opposite is true when the economy is booming bond yields are thus positively correlated to inflation because during periods of high inflation savers wo n't want to invest in bonds that do n't provide them with an acceptable inflation adjusted yield   but high interest rates tend to have the effect or in inflation because it gets more costly for borrowers and thus puts a on new economic activity so to summarize

some qualitative factors to consider when deciding whether to finance with equity vs debt for a publicly traded company     1 the case for equity is the stock trading high relative to what management believes is its intrinsic value if so raising equity may be attractive since management would be raising a lot of $ $ $ but the downside is you give up future earnings since you are diluting current ownership   2 the case for debt what is the expected return for the project in which the raised capital will be utilized for is its expected return higher than the interest payments in terms if so raising debt would be more attractive than raising equity since current ownership would not be diluted   that 's all i can think of off the top of my head right now i 'm sure there are a few more qualitative factors to consider but i think these two are the most intuitive

pre enron many companies forced the 401 k match to be in company shares that is no longer allowed becasue of changes in the law therefore most employees have only a small minority of their retirement savings in company shares i know the esop and 401 k are n't the same but in my company every year the number of participants in the company stock purchase program decreases the small number of participants and the small portion of their new retirement funds being in company shares would mean this spike in volume would be very small   the esop plan for my employer takes money each paycheck then purchases the shares once a quarter this delay would allow them to manage the purchases better i know with a previous employer most esop participants only held the shares for the minimum time thus providing a steady steam of shares being sold

according to the sec shareholder reports a mutual fund and a closed end fund respectively must provide    shareholders with annual and semi annual reports 60 days after the end    of the fund ’s fiscal year and 60 days after the fund ’s fiscal    mid year these reports contain updated financial information a list    of the fund ’s portfolio securities and other information the    information in the shareholder reports will be current as of the date    of the particular report that is the last day of the fund ’s fiscal    year for the annual report and the last day of the fund ’s fiscal    mid year for the semi annual report   other reports a mutual fund and a closed end fund must file a form n q each quarter    and a form n each year on the sec ’s edgar database although funds    are not required to mail these reports to shareholders funds disclose    portfolio holdings on form n q. form n identifies specific    proposals on which the fund has voted portfolio securities over the    past year and discloses how the fund voted on each this disclosure    enables fund shareholders to monitor their funds’ involvement in the    governance activities of portfolio companies which means that sixty days after the end of each quarter they will tell you what they owned 60 days ago this makes sense why would they want to tell the world what companies they are buying and selling

to me the key is a budget   each month before it begins decide on what to spend on each dollar that you earn   money should be allotted for normal expenses such as housing food transportation and utilities if you have any consumer debt that should be a priority   extra money should go to eliminate that debt there should be money allotted to savings goals such as retirement home down payment or vacation home   also there should be money set aside for clothing and giving   giving is an important part and often overlooked part of wealth creation    somewhere in there you should also give yourself a bit of free money   for example one of the things i spend my free money on is coffee   i buy freshly ground coffee from a really good supplier   it is a bit expensive but that is okay as it does not preclude me from meeting other goals if you still have money left after all of that increase your giving some your savings some and your free money some   you can then spend that money without guilt if your budget includes $ 100 of free money per month and you want something that costs $ 1000 save up the $ 1,000 and then buy it   do not borrow to buy free money stuff    doing those sorts of things will make you weigh purchasing decisions very carefully if you find that you can not stick to a budget you should enlist a friend to be your accountability partner   they have to be very good with money

great question   first my recommendation would be for you to get a card that does not have a yearly fee there are many credit cards out there that provide cash back on your purchases or points to redeem for gift cards or other items be sure to cancel the credit card that you have now so you do n't forget about that yearly fee canceling will have a temporary impact on your credit score if the credit card is your longest held line of credit   second it is recommended not to use more than 20 of all the available credit staying above that line can affect your credit score i think that is what you are hearing about running up large balances on your credit card if you are worried about staying below the 20 line you can always request a larger line of credit just keep paying it off each month though and you will be fine   you already have a history of credit if you have begun paying off your student loans

margin is when you borrow to buy stock     the margin is the amount you can have borrowed over your own stock there may also be some other considerations e.g. risk portfolio say you have 10,000 your broker allows you buy on margin with a margin requirement of 100 so you buy 18,000 of stock you have 10k of your own and borrowed 8k to buy this so you have 80 extra stock on margin say the stock has a downturn and loses 12 or so suddenly you have 16k stock value but you still owe 8k you are now at 100 margin 8k is yours 8k is borrowed money      at this point if you drop anymore you are exceeding 100 margin and your broker may sell to ensure they get their 8k     the benefits of this are of course if the stock goes in your favor 10 rise is 1,800 instead of 1,000

quick answer when it comes to fixed income assets whether rental real estate or government bonds it 's unusual for highly leveraged assets to yield less than the same asset unleveraged or lowly leveraged   this is especially so in countries where interest costs are tax deductible if we exclude capital losses i.e. the property sells in future at a price less than it was purchased or net rental income that does n't keep up with maintenance regulatory taxation inflation and or other costs there is one primary scenario where higher leverage results in lower yields compared to lower leverage even if rental income keeps up with non funding costs   this occurs when variable rate financing is used and rates substantially increase explanation borrowers and lenders in different countries have different mortgage rate customs   some are more likely to have long term fixed rates some prefer variable rates and others are a hybrid i.e. fixed for a few years and then become variable if variable rates are used for a mortgage and the reference rates increase substantially as they did in the us during the 1970s the borrower can easily become upside down i.e. owe more on the mortgage than the property is then worth and have mortgage service costs that exceed the net rental income   some of those costs are n't easy to pass along to renters even when there are periodic lease or base rent increases referencing inflation rates   central banks set policies for what would be the lowest short term rates in a country that has such a bank   private sector rates are established broadly by supply and demand for credit and can thus diverge markedly from central bank rates over time the higher finance carrying cost to net rental income ratio should as 1 rental market prices change to reflect the costs and 2 the landlord can reinvest his net rental income at a higher rate   in the short term though this can result in the landlord having to eat the costs making his yield on his leveraged fixed income asset less than what he would have without leverage even if the property was later sold at same price regardless of financing method = = = = = = = = = = interestingly and on the flip side this is one of the quirks in finance where an accounting liability can become at least in part an economic asset   if a landlord borrows at a high loan to value ratio for a fixed interest rate for the life of the mortgage and rates variable and fixed were to increase substantially the difference between his original rate and the present rates accrues to him if he 's able to sell the property with the loan attached which is not uncommon for commercial industrial and sometimes municipal real estate the buyer will be assuming a liability with a lower carrying cost than his present alternatives and will hence pay a higher price for the property than if it were unleveraged with long term rates in many economically advanced countries at historic lows if a borrower today were to take a long term fixed rate loan and rates shortly after increased substantially he may have an instant profit in this scenario even if his property has n't increased in value

when stocks have a change in price it is because of a trade to have a trade you have to have both a buyer and a seller   when the price of a security is going up there are an equal amount of shares being sold as being bought when the price of a security is going down there are an equal amount of shares being bought as being sold   there almost always is an unequal amount of shares waiting to be sold compared to the amount waiting to be bought but waiting shares do not move the price only when the purchase price and the sale price agree and a trade occurs does the price move   so the price does not go down because more shares are being sold neither does the price go up because more shares are being bought

unless a study accounts for whether the users are following a budget or not it is irrelevant to those who are trying to take their personal finances seriously i can certainly believe that those who have no budget will spend more on a credit card than they will on a debit card or with cash under the right circumstances spending with cards can actually be a tool to track and reduce spending if you can see on a monthly and yearly basis where all of your money was spent you have the information to make decisions about the small expenses that add up as well as the obvious large expenses   debit cards and credit cards offer the same advantage of giving you an electronic record of all of your transactions but debit cards do not come with the same fraud protection that credit cards have so i and many people like me prefer to use credit cards for security reasons alone cash back and other rewards points bolster the case for credit cards over debit cards it is very possible to track all of your spending with cash but it is also more work the frustration of accounting for bad and every transaction multiple times is worth discussing too as a reason that people get discouraged and give up on budgeting my point is simply that credit cards and the electronic records that they generate can greatly simplify the process of tracking your spending i doubt any study out there accounts for the people who are specifically using those benefits and what effect it has on their spending

emv cards use an offline transaction counter to increase security this counter is maintained inside the card and every time a transaction is confirmed by the card for online contact transactions the card will usually receive feedback from its issuer which among other actions will reset that counter to zero for offline transactions the card will increment the counter by one each time it is used for contactless transactions things are a bit different since contactless transactions usually do not maintain a connection between the card and the terminal long enough to transmit issuer feedback to the card the counter can not be reset that way the counter will therefore even be for online transactions the implications of this are dependent on what your issuer is actually doing with the contents of the offline counter some issuers use this as a safety measure for contactless cards and allow only a limited number of contactless transactions since those usually do not require any cardholder verification method below a certain threshold e.g. 25 € in many european countries and the total risk in case of physical card theft can therefore be limited to < number of offline contactless transaction usually you would have to use your card in a contact based transaction to reset the counter and the terminal would display an according notice it is indeed strange that the terminal instead requested your pin if this happens again you could try to use your card once via the contact interface and see if this resets your offline counters and allows you to pay without pin entry for the next few transactions

the market is not stupid it that a company is worth less after paying out dividends than before paying them it 's obvious since that company has just given out part of its earnings so after a company pays out dividends its stock price normally drops approximately by the amount paid therefore if you buy get the dividend and immediately sell under normal conditions you wo n't make any profit

the faster they eliminate menial jobs the sooner we can start retraining our workforce for a modern economy   you contradict reality the study says traditionally a high proportion of workers in the low wage market are not experienced at all teens with their first jobs immigrants with their first jobs here he said data is pointing to since we have to pay more employers are looking for people with experience who can do the job from day   how many low level jobs do we see require multiple years of experience now days this is a problem of raising the minimum wage jobs is a worthy cry because right now the job is being eliminated so you have teens and immigrants getting no income which is somehow better than a little income teens do n't need a livable wage and adults who do can get subsidies from the government while they gain experience and work up to higher pay no job means no way to get either of those

i ca n't speak for canada but in the us banks and other financial industry firms will lobby the sec to some extent over proposed regulations basically any time the sec proposes a regulation they have a period where anyone including financial firms can comment on it via letters the purpose here is for the regulators to get different perspectives on the regulation to help them shape rules that go far enough to protect investors but do n't go so far as to over burden or harm the industries they 're regulating    now obviously this can be a problem largely because financial firms of course are always going to be opposed to new extensive regulations but also because more often than not few investors members of the public actually comment so the sec gets a lot more comments from the industry the sec frequently treats the volume of comments almost like votes so in return the massive volume of industry comments tends to shape their proposed regulations towards being more industry friendly you can see this in action as a huge majority of revisions to proposed regulation is use to water down the proposed rules    all in all industry members lobbying and working with their regulators is n't inherently bad after all these are the people firms that know the industry best and so their feedback is valuable and can truly help regulators to make more efficient and effective rules but it certainly can be excessive and will undoubtedly cause bad optics

if you withdraw money from an rrsp you are taxed on that money as ordinary income and will have to pay withholding taxes and potentially more income tax when you file additionally you lose that contribution amount if you subsequently deposit the same gross amount into another rrsp at a different bank that will lower your taxable income for the year and you 'll subsequently be able to recover the withholding taxes but you will have permanently lost the contribution room for example you have $ 100,000 in rrsp contribution room you buy $ 1,000 in rrsps from bank a. this leaves you with $ in rrsp contribution room next year you withdraw that $ 1,000 and deposit it in bank b in an rrsp account now you have $ in rrsp contribution room chances are good that bank a withheld 15 for taxes but when you file your tax return you 'll get that back your withdrawal and subsequent purchase of rrsps in the tax year cancel out far better is to transfer the rrsp from bank a to bank b. that has no tax implications and would not affect your rrsp contribution limit not all banks are willing to do this though

i think you may have a significant misunderstanding here   you have been renting your property out for two years now   there is no special roommate clause in the tax code roommates are renters and the rent they pay is rental income   if they were roommates in a property you both rented from a third party that would be different see publication chapter 4 for more details on the subject search on renting part of property   you should be you may also consider not renting for profit section which may be closer to what you 're actually thinking of changing from renting not for profit to renting for profit   not rented for profit means you can report on your 1040 as opposed to filing schedule e but it does mean you have to actually not make a profit and remember some of the money that goes to paying the mortgage is not deductible on this side of things since it 's your property and you 'll get that money back presumably when you sell it if that is what you 're asking about it sounds like it 's just a matter of money   are you going to start making money   or are you going to start making enough significant upgrades etc to justify the tax deduction   you should consider the actual specific numbers carefully probably with the help of a cpa who is familiar with this sort of situation and then make the decision that gives you the best outcome keeping in mind that there may be long term impacts of switching from not for profit to for profit rental treatment

in terms of operations banks are indifferent to inflation short rates except right before a recession or near recession are always lower than long rates regardless of inflation level assuming no quotas or price controls banks produce credit by borrowing short to lend long so as long as short rates are lower than long rates they can be expected to produce loans again assuming no quotas or price controls in short from the banks perspective inflation does not affect their desire to produce credit

let 's illustrate how typical mortgage and its insurance works from the very beginning few years pass you 're at the last point now the whole point of the insurance was to preserve value of bank 's collateral at least from its point of view by making a claim you have testified that a damage has occurred and some value of the property was lost it 's only reasonable for the bank that it wants the value of the asset to be restored to the value of the loan or the other way around bank does n't really care if your deck is repaired it only cares to have right side equal left side in the books by taking the mortgage you 've agreed to preserve the value of the property there are many ways out of this situation but pocketing the money is n't one of them   there is no need to fight the mortgage company because they 're right talk with them in good faith and walk through available options if you feel that you can live with the deck as it is then paying back part of the loan might be a good idea you do n't lose the money this way you 're still 2k ahead just not now but in 20 years   afterthought it 's possible that it would be enough to re evaluate the house to ensure it 's still worth its original value even with damaged deck eg due to other improvements you 've made over the years or general property prices rising in the area i put quotes because you have to count costs of which may be too big to make it worth and it might turn out it 's worth even less eg if the prices dropped or add another collateral but that means signing another lien which also costs money

as others have said if you do n't have dependents there 's little need for life insurance if you ca n't think of any obvious beneficiary for an insurance policy than you probably do n't need one dependents here should be understood broadly it would n't necessarily be limited to wife and children if you 're the only support for your handicapped cousin for example you might want to provide for him but i take it from your question that you have no such special case of course even if you have no dependents now you might pick some up in the future and if and when that does happen your medical situation may have changed making it difficult to get life insurance but if you have no immediate plans so that any such even is likely to be far away a serious alternative to consider would be to invest the money you would have paid in insurance premiums then if someday you do acquire dependents you have a pot of money set aside to provide for them in case something happens to you if it 's not enough and you can get insurance at that time then great but if you ca n't get insurance at least there 's something if you never do acquire dependents you can consider that pot of money part of your retirement fund

my wife and i meet in the first few days of each month to create a budget for the coming month during that meeting we reconcile any spending for the previous month and make sure the amount money in our accounts matches the amount of money in our budget record to the penny we use an excel spreadsheet how you track it matters less than the need to track it and see how much you spent in each category during the previous month   after we have have reviewed the previous month 's spending we allocate money we made during that previous month to each of the categories what categories you track and how granular you are is less important than regularly seeing how much you spend so that you can evaluate whether your spending is really matching your priorities we keep a running total for each category so if we go over on groceries one month then the following month we have to add more to bring the category back to black as well as enough for our anticipated needs in the coming month if there is one category that we are consistently underestimating or overestimating we talk about why if there are large purchases that we are planning in the coming month or even in a few months we talk about them why we want them and we talk about how much we 're planning to spend if we want a new tv or to go on a trip we may start adding money to the category with no plans to spend in the coming month the biggest benefit to this process has been that we do n't make a lot of impulse purchases or if we do they are for small dollar amounts the simple need to explain what i want and why means i have to put the thought into it myself and i talk myself out of a lot of purchases during that train of thought the time spent regularly evaluating what we get for our money has cut waste that was n't really bringing much happiness we still buy what we want but we agree that we want it first

that 's the way the markets work in theory in actual fact markets are subject to real world pressures that is there are so many things going on in the market that the end of the lined in lock up is just one of many to produce the result you describe traders would have to hold cash in reserve for this so called contingency to buy at the end of the lock up in most cases they would n't want to because of everything else that is going on   to use a real world analogy would you want to wait until the last possible moment before going to the bathroom or would you go now while you had the chance that 's what the decision about holding cash in reserve for a contingency is like

it 's very very unlikely that you received a phone call at work with an incorrect birth date from an actual lending company that thinks it loaned you any money   it 's much more likely that you received a phone call at work from a collections agency that would have bought some loan from the aforementioned agency for pennies on the dollar   they would have been hunting around trying to find someone with your name who was born years earlier   it 's even more likely that this is some sort of phishing scam   if you 're worried you can check your credit rating but it is likely that you can safely ignore the situation   if they call back ask for thorough details about the credit card   if they 're a real collections agency and for some reason they wo n't leave you alone iirc the most course of action is to hire a lawyer to send them a cease and letter

this is always a judgement call based on your own tolerance for risk   yes you have a fairly long time horizon and that does mean you can accept more risk more volatility than someone closer to starting to draw upon those savings but you 're old enough and have enough existing savings that you want to start thinking about reducing the risk a notch so most folks in your position would not put 100 in stocks though exactly how much should be moved to bonds is debatable one traditional rule of thumb for a moderately conservative position is to subtract your age from 100 and keep that percentage of your investments in stock for stock bond age will find lots of debate about whether and how to modify this rule i have gone more aggressive myself and have n't demonstrably hurt myself but past results are no guarantee of future performance a paid financial planning advisor can interview you about your risk tolerance run some computer models and recommend a strategy with some estimate of expected performance and volatility if you are looking for a semi rational approach that may be worth considering at least as a starting point

its so funny how people complain about the price of food the price of food in the us for the quality is so far and away better than the food you get in other countries outside of large areas in developing countries you ca n't get fresh food at all or if you do its off the back of a truck and the food is full of bugs and looks     the problem with amazon entering the food market is that food is a penny margin business walmart makes but a few cents on food sales this is because the market for food is so large and is nearly perfectly competitive if a tomato seller says i m raising the price of my tomatoes 1c then walmart will simply find another competitor to sell at lower   the only way amazon will be able to break into the market is by doing the two things they are doing now    1 buy a company that brings to market the same shit as everyone else but with a product differentiation organic this way they can front load the already expensive per ticket sales to hide step 2    2 make shopping more convenient with the margins being so low the cost of buying food at amazon at first will be insanely expensive think wholefoods with a surcharge

this is very much possible and happens quite a lot in the us for example promotional offers by credit card companies where you pay no interest on the balance for a certain period are a very common thing the lender gains a new customer on such a loan and usually earns money from the spending via the merchant fees specifically for credit cards at least the pro is obviously free money the con is that this is usually for a short period of time longest i 've seen was 15 months after which if you 're not careful high interest rates will be charged in some cases interest will be charged retroactively for the whole period if you do n't pay off the balance or miss the minimum payment due

its not just citi and bofa even barclays hsbc and other large banks are trading below book value in markets they are listed are there particular assets that are causing these two banks to be valued lower relative to their book values than the other banks there no particular assets given the current economic situation most banks are not making good returns i.e. expected returns of markets are around 10 12 and the returns getting generated are around 4 6 the overall slow down in various segments as well as regulations in most countries mean that banks have to at the business model in short term and generate more revenue the market believes that banks may loose money faster and hence the negative outlook and the trading below the book value note book value is derived in ideal conditions i.e. when the company is healthy if any company were to sell the assets in distress the actual funds raised would be quite a bit less than book value its also to be noted that typically banks would not close out and hence book value to an extent is just an indicator or is it a residual based on their being the biggest losers of 2008 that are still around today the 2008 has gone past this is more recent if you look most of these banks were doing quite well till last year and had recovered substantially after 2008

paying up in full before the statement is posted does not seem a good idea i feel you should keep some small amount to be posted as a statement balance and pay that in full each month if you keep your statements as always 0 will give creditors an impression that you have cards and you do n't utilize them so they ca nt really gauge how you preform being debt whether you are able to manage your debt well etc i always keep < 100 dollar in every credit card i have to be posted a statement balance i have > 100k credit line over 3 cards so if i take air ticket to se asia runs into 3000 $ for my family i pay a day before statement generates and keep 100 for statement to be posted pay 100 the next day or as auto debit this way you have some utilization + lower credit card outstanding at any point make your utilization right in single digits

but what about the following scenario which is my paraphrasing of a nanex article i 'm hoping you can help clarify this for me   1 i observe a 1,000 lot advertised for sell on a lit exchange   2 i try to lift the 1,000 by placing a limit order   3 my order goes through some kind of order routing process first 3 orders get executed on a dark pool let 's say i got a 50 lot filled so available offer reduces to 950   4 my order hits a lit exchange i get a partial fill for 100 offer shrinks to 850 but the offered size shrinks instead to 500 or 0   5 now in order to execute my trade i will have to take a higher price than the original advertised liquidity   my question maybe you can answer this is why did my original order size of 1,000 appear in smaller blocks is this because the order routing algorithm breaks up the size   or is it that market makers only post offers in small block sizes e.g. 100 so even if the order book looked like   100 10   100 10   100 10   100 10   100 10   100 10   all the way to 1,000 total as soon as the first 100 shares were lifted the mm can immediately cancel the remainder of the advertised liquidity in practical terms making it impossible to execute large orders at an advertised price

the simple answer is that even though mortgages can go for 10 15 20 and 30 year terms in the u.s. they 're typically backed by bonds sold to investors that mature in 10 years which is the standard term for most bonds these bonds in the open market are compared by investors with the 10-year treasury note which is the gold standard for low risk investment the u.s. government has a solid history of always paying its bills though this reputation is being tested in recent years with fights over the debt ceiling and government budgets the savvy investor therefore knows that he or she can make at least the yield from the 10-year t note in that time frame with virtually zero risk anything else on the market is seen as being a higher risk and so investors demand higher yields by making lower bids forcing the issuer to issue more bonds to get the money it needs up front mortgage backed securities are usually in the next tier above t debt in terms of risk when backed by prime rate mortgages they 're typically aaa rated making them available to institutional investors like banks mutual funds etc this forms a balancing act mortgage backed securities issuers typically ca n't get the yield of a t note because no matter how low their risk t debt is lower because one bank does n't have the power to tax the entire u.s. population but they 're almost as good because they 're still very stable low risk debt this bond price and the resulting yield is in turn the baseline for a long term loan by the bank to an individual the bank watching the market and its other bond packages knows what it can get for a package of bonds backed by your mortgage and others with similar credit scores it will therefore take this number add a couple of percentage points to make some money for itself and its stockholders how much the bank can add is controlled by other market forces you 're allowed to shop around for the lowest rate you can get which limits any one bank 's ability to jack up rates and this is the rate you see advertised and hopefully what shows up on your paperwork after you apply

for 1 i see no advantage in putting money from your non retirement savings into a roth just for the purpose of using it as a down payment on your house   why not just put the $ 5.5 k directly toward the down payment for 2 dollars converted from a traditional 401 k or ira to a roth are considered income and will be taxed at your marginal rate   so if your marginal tax rate is 25 you will need to pay $ 5 k in order to convert the $ 20k.   usually this payment is done independent of the conversion amount in other words you would convert the full $ 20 k but pay the $ 5 k in taxes out of other funds checking savings based on your stated goals of using the money for a down payment on a house i do n't see any advantage to contributing or converting to a roth ira

it 's extremely easy to get a rough valuation of your home just phone a real estate agent virtually any real estate agent will come and value your home free even if you say outright i 'm not considering selling i just want a valuation they will probably do it because for them getting contacts of people who might one day want to sell their home is all important even if a few turn you down some will do it you might say that an agent is n't going to be as accurate as an appraiser and you are right there is also an expectation that they will evaluate higher than the real value to you to sell that probably is n't a big issue and it 's something you can compensate for and even an appraiser is going to be based somewhat on speculation   you might try to do this calculation yourself but an agent has access to the actual sale prices of nearby houses you ca n't get that information you only have access to the asking prices and did i mention they will do it for free

this very much depends how you use that second line of credit and what your current credit is there are of course many more combinations buy you can probably infer the impact based on these cases    your credit score is based on your likely hood of being profitable to a creditor should they issue you credit this is based on your history of your ability to manage your credit   having more credit and managing it well shows that you have a history of being responsible with greater sums of money available   if you use the card responsibly now then you are more likely to continue that trend than someone with a history of irresponsibility   having a line but not using it is not a good thing   it costs the creditor money for you to have an account   if you never use that account then you are not showing that you can use the account responsibly so if you are just going to throw the card in a safe and never access it then you are better off not getting the card in the first place

take the case where a stock has just two owners a and b both at $ 10 one of them sells his shares to c at $ 11   now b has made $ 1 in profit but is no longer an owner of the stock a has n't sold anything but his shares are worth 10 more due to the last traded price printed c has bought shares at $ 11 and the price is $ 11 so technically he has n't lost any money in a larger market there are winners and losers every day on a single stock but they may not remain owners of a stock there could be days in which those that remain owners are all winners say when a stock goes up to an all time high and all those that are currently owners have an average buy price lower than the last traded price and the reverse applies too   it is of course more complicated say you own a stock and let someone else borrow it for a short selling opportunity he sells it in the market for each uptick in price you win the short seller loses and the guy he sold it to also wins a person that has a covered call on a stock is not a winner beyond a point and so on

similar to what adam f says above except instead of just transfering the amount you spend on the credit card into the high interest account why not keep the majority of your funds apart from a small amount say a couple of hundred for emergencies in the high interest account until the credit card needs to be paid off even better if you have a mortgage with an 100 offset account keep all your funds in this and pay off your credit card in full from it on or before the due date being a 100 offset to your mortgage interest rate you will be saving at a higher rate than a high interest rate savings account and you will be able to do all your normal banking from it unlike a high interest account which you usually have to link to an additional account to deposit and withdrawl money to and from if you are to use a credit card keep these simple rules in mind hope this has helped regards victor

i assume you are filing us taxes because you are a us citizen resident alien or other us person if you have a total of $ 10,000 or more in assets in non us accounts you are required to file fincen form 114 report of foreign bank and financial accounts also known as fbar to report those accounts   see comparison of form 8938 and fbar requirements   note this refers to the total balance in the account combined with any other accounts you may have the amount you transferred this year is not relevant   also note that the fbar is filed separately from your income tax return it does not go to the irs though if you have over $ 50,000 in offshore assets you may also have to file irs form 8938 simply reporting those accounts does not necessarily mean you will owe extra taxes   most us taxes are based on income not assets according to the page linked the maximum penalty for a willful failure to report such accounts is a fine of $ 100,000 or 50 of the assets in question whichever is greater in addition to possible criminal sanctions there may be other us filing requirements that i do n't know about so you may want to consult a tax professional   i do not know anything about your filing requirements under indian law

note that after 15 years the tax exemption is € per person which includes both the principal you and the accumulated interest   it 's possible that you will have a higher balance than this in your savings account at this point and would still owe tax on the interest accumulated above the exempted amount   after 20 years you get the full tax exemption the lesser of your portion of the mortgage debt and € per person in direct answer to your questions i 'm not aware of any exceptions to the 15 year rule for allowing the accumulated interest to be tax free when selling your house   if your accumulated interest is low enough you might consider just paying the tax on it as it would give you the most flexibility in choosing a new mortgage   this is why i asked about more details about your interest rate and how long the mortgage has been running it may however possible to couple the savings account to a new abn mortgage when you buy a new house   you should check your mortgage terms and conditions   for example section in abn 's terms and conditions from 2010 describes this   see here   it is probably best however to speak directly with either your mortgage broker or with a mortgage adviser with abn   if your mortgage broker still worked on commission when you closed your mortgage then they are obligated to assist you with this type of question in order to qualify for the tax exemption you must use the saved value to pay off debt on your primary residence   the savings account entirely from a mortgage will disqualify you from the tax advantages   you will owe tax on all accumulated interest

so does a post dated check have any valid use in a business or    personal transaction does it provide any financial or legal    protections at all yes most definitely you 're writing a future date on the check not past to ensure that the check will not be deposited before that day keep in mind that this may change from place to place since not every country has the same rules in the us for example such trick would not work since the check may be presented any time and is not a limited obligation however in some other countries banks will not pay a check presented before the date written on it while in the us the date on the check is the date on which it was supposedly written and as such is meaningless for obligation purposes in many other countries the date on the check is the date on which the payment to be made thus constitutes the start of the commitment and payment will not be made before that date for example in canada if you write a post dated cheque under the clearing rules of the    canadian payments association cpa your cheque should not be cashed    before the date that is written on it if the post dated cheque is cashed early you can ask your financial    institution to put the money back into your account up to the day    before the cheque should have been cashed

gt the same with the fact that just because i probably have had more collegiate studies on economics than you   that 's where you are wrong kiddo i 've got a minor in economics and a bba mba in finance you are talking to a guy that is both more educated than you on the topic and actually works with low income people more often than you   it 's very difficult to argue with people on reddit but it is fascinating to see how the positions and arguments of young liberals come together    the article you posted actually reinforces my position it shows that the majority as described by the author of people working low income jobs are gaming government assistance programs they are n't creating a career or looking for work by any standard not only do i mention that to tear apart the study but i actually explain from personal experience how it works and provide actual examples of people who are doing it   this is entirely lost on you liberals outweigh conservatives by a wide margin in academics it 's fairly obvious why when you dive into it want research funding there has to be a problem suggesting that the market is sorting out wages already and that there is no need for a minimum wage wo n't get you paid you have to make bogus studies like the one you provided which gets in hundreds of forms by similarly desperate professors gt   gt have you ever considered why the minimum wage came about in the first place it was to keep businesses in check because they were taking advantage of people and paying them poor wages    this is where things turn unexpectedly entertaining the minimum wage came about because of populous opinion it 's the same way that tariffs come about canadian lumber is too cheap so we must make it cost more because american jobs boom lumber rises 20 politicians are n't economists dumb people get elected bad decisions get passed they also get for decades just because   your position stands on one of compassion but it lacks much else i would encourage you to participate in production oriented fields do you pay for things that are no complete because the person working on them deserves it i highly doubt it it 's a double standard where employees deserve to get paid but businesses should n't if they do n't do things right people deserve to be paid what they produce for society there are no magical studies that will show me differently it 's not compassion to subsidize the poor it 's compassion to work with the poor to develop skills to better their lives you ca n't seem to figure out that people in construction magically do not make minimum wage anywhere in houston it 's fairly obvious would you stand in the texas sun it was nearly 100 today work hard get a job done only to be paid $ 70 hell no it 's not a government that needs to step in to assert that the market as i 'm sure your economics degree taught you will demand a higher wage a dude working at mcdonalds does n't even make minimum wage anymore i ca n't even think of people who do   but that does n't matter it does n't matter to you that people who actually work do n't make minimum wage you 've read a study done by a guy in another state who has never hired of managed low wage employees telling you all about life you 've got it   work on those logical fallacies i do n't think you could follow any of the arguments i made anyways but i do n't have the time to it all out

so here are some of the risks of renting a property plus the normal risk of losing your job health etc but those are going to be bad whether you had the rental or not so those are n't really a factor can you beat the average gain of the s&p 500 over 10 years   probably but there 's significant risk that something bad will happen that could cause the whole thing to come crashing down how many months can you go without the rental income before you ca n't pay all three mortgages is that a risk you 're willing to take for $ 5,000 per year or less    if the second home was paid for with cash and you could pay the first mortgage with your income then you 'd be in a much better situation to have a rental property   the fact that the property is significantly leveraged means that any unfortunate event could put you in a serious financial bind and makes me say that you should sell the rental get your first mortgage paid down as soon as possible and start saving cash to buy rental property if that 's what you want to invest in i think we could go at least 24 months with no rental income well that means that you have about $ 36k in an emergency fund which makes me a little more comfortable with a rental but that 's still a lot of debt spread across two houses    another way to think about it   if you just had your main house with a $ 600k mortgage and no heloc would you take out a $ heloc and buy the second house with a $ 200k mortgage

a checking account almost never earns any significant interest a checking accounts often does not have any limits in terms of how many times you can draw funds from it a checking account often comes with a debit card allowing you to pay online draw cash from an atm machine etc a savings accounts has much higher yields so you should be getting a decent interest unfortunately in the current climate this is not always true especially not with the big banks so you may want to look into a high yield savings account a savings account is often limited in terms of number of transactions meaning you ca n't constantly draw funds from it it must be stable a savings account often does not come with a debit card no a savings account should not be used for regular transactions it 's an account to park your money for a medium long time understand that banks loan out the money in your savings account to third parties so if it would constantly fluctuate they ca n't have this money available to others in return of you parking your money with your bank you should get a nice return interest yes but it 's not common assuming you are from usa passing banking data account number and routing number to third parties is not safe in europe it 's totally safe to share your account number to accept money depends some banks do charge fees some do n't often there are fees when you 're not using the account no transactions or when you do n't have a certain minimum in an account assuming you are american please specify this information clearly in future i would look into an internet bank like ally they do n't have many fees and they have an excellent high yield savings account they also give you a debit card disadvantage is that they do n't have physical branches

situation 1 i keep playing and eventually earn 1000 i withdraw    this will i get taxed if so by how much this is probably considered an award so whatever your country taxes for lottery gambling winnings would be applicable if there 's no specific taxation on this kinds of income then it is ordinary income situation 2 i deposit $ 5000 play the game lose some money and    withdraw equal to $ 4000 will i get taxed if so by how much since it is a game it is unlikely that deducting losses from your income would be allowed   however the $ 4000 would probably not be taxed as income since you are getting your own money back situation 3 i deposit $ 5000 and use this to buy in game items i    later sell these items for massive profits this can happen    over the course of 2 years for sure i withdraw $ 10000 will i get    taxed if so by how much either the same as 1 i.e. ordinary income or as capital gains although tax authority may argue that this was not a for profit investment and capital gains treatment should n't be applicable will i get taxed on withdrawals from real cash economy games and do    the taxes apply to the full withdrawal or only on the profits or    only on the profits above a certain amount generally income taxes only apply on income so if you paid $ 10000 and got back $ 12000 only the $ 2000 is considered income however some countries may tax full amounts under certain conditions such taxes are called franchise taxes for a proper tax advice consult with the locally licensed tax adviser

the answer to this question is very different depending on the type of item   from a purely financial perspective you would want to answer these questions which you may not have enough information to answer realistically the question i prefer to ask are when something fails there is a big difference to me between having the cash and having an insurance policy that is suppose to cover it even if they are theoretically the same value   some insurance policies may even be better than cash like homeowners insurance might help take care of details like finding a contractor to fix the issue finding temporary housing if your house burns down etc

advantage of cash you can spend the money without having to pay any fees or taxes to get it out disadvantage when inflation is greater than zero which it has been for many decades your cash is continually losing value advantages of an ira roth or classic your money will usually grow as the investments return a profit you get special tax benefits disadvantages there 's risk you may lose money there are tax penalties for withdrawing the money before retirement in general you should only put money in an ira if you expect to leave it there until you retire or at least for a long time whole life is a combination of a life insurance policy and an investment advantages combines insurance and investment into one convenient monthly payment disadvantages the investment portion typically has lower returns than you could get elsewhere if you have no need for life insurance if you 're not supporting anyone or you 're they could get along without you or you do n't like them and do n't care what happens to them when you 're gone or whatever then there 's no point buying life insurance whole or term you 're paying for a product that you do n't need it 's pretty common advice to tell people that instead of buying a whole life policy they should buy a term policy with the same coverage and then invest the difference in the premium for example if you were considering getting a $ 100,000 whole life policy that costs $ 50 per month just making up numbers of course it depends on your age health etc and you see you could get a $ 100,000 term life policy for $ 30 per month you will almost certainly do better in the long run to buy the $ 30 term policy and put the other $ 20 into investments the catch to this plan is that there are usually transaction costs to investing even a discount broker like ameritrade or scott trade charges around $ 10 per transaction so if you tried to invest $ 20 each month you 'd lose half of it to transaction fees which means that in practice you 'd have to save that money up until you had at least a few hundred and at that point many people find other things always seem to come up to spend the money on so that while they start out with every intention of investing this money they do n't

okay they 're faster than most other computers they either have a dedicated fiber line or are physically closer   but anyways they flood the nyse with tons of orders to slow it down so they see another broker 's order in the line up and delete the bogus orders they can then make the purchase faster than the other guy the other guy now has to pay a higher strike price than he initially thought the bid would be    so let 's say apple 's quote is 1.00   they send one order for apple   one for ibm   one for yahoo   one for nbc comcast   they see another guy wants apple so they cancel the orders for ibm yahoo and nbc comcast and leave the apple one to complete the apple one goes through and then they automatically resell it to the guy looking to buy apple at a price of   tldr   they flood a bunch of orders at a bunch of different prices quantities they cancel before it goes through unless they see someone else wants it if that person wants it they do n't cancel   edit i do n't even know if all or any of those stocks are listed on the nyse in today 's world it does n't make a difference anymore however replace nyse with any exchange and the stock with any ticker symbol   edit 2 they could also manipulate cross listing listing the same stock on two different exchanges those prices are mostly uniform but of course higher volume on one could mean a higher price on one before they stabilize so if you can move fast you can buy the stock at the lower price and sell it on the exchange with the higher price

you seem to be on the right track   i feel though that it 's worth addressing your maintenance budget   even if both cars described in your question are from the same model year one has been in service 2x more one car has been on the road in weather twice as much as the other   i 'm not sure what 's being represented in the $ 6k of maintenance but a whole host of systems can require maintenance or replacement at 200k+ miles   a c compressor all sorts of rubber parts seals hoses belts computer systems stereo window regulators the list goes on   i do n't know at what point the battery on a hybrid needs to be replaced or what that replacement entails but likely the battery or the hybrid recharge system will require something after 200k miles of service   i would learn more about what actual maintenance a high mileage prius can experience to answer your question though at this level of used i do n't think the dealership adds anything to the equation   when you 're buying certified pre owned the dealership manufacturer relationship and warranty can be meaningful   when you 're buying a 100k+ miles car from a random small used car lot it might as well be a stranger on craigslist

personal finances are not intuitive for everyone and it can be a challenge to know what to do when you have n't been taught   congratulations on recognizing that you need to make a change the first step that i would recommend is what you 've already done assemble your bank statements so you can get an accurate picture of what money you currently have   keep organized folders so you can find your bank statements when you need them in addition to the bank statements for your checking and savings accounts you also need to assess any debt that you have   have you taken out any loans that need to be paid back   do you have any credit card debt   make a list of all your debts and make sure that you have folders for these statements as well hopefully you do n't have any debts   but if you are like most people you owe money to someone and you may even owe more money than you currently have in your bank accounts   if you have debts fixing this problem will be one of your goals no matter what your debt is you need to make sure that from now on you do n't spend more money than you take in as income   to do this you need to make a budget a budget is a plan for spending your money   to get started with a budget make a list of all the income you will receive this month   add it up and write that amount at the top of a page   next you want to make a list of all the expenses you will have this month   some of these expenses are more or less fixed rent utility bills etc   write those down first   some of the expenses you have more control over such as food and entertainment   give yourself some money to spend on each of these   you may also have some larger expenses that will happen in the future such as a tuition or insurance payment   allocate some money to those so that by the time that payment comes around you will have saved enough to pay for those expenses if you find that you do n't have enough income to cover all of your expenses in a month you need to either reduce your expenses somewhere or increase your income until your budget is at a point where you have money left over at the end of each month after you 've gotten to this point the next step is figuring out what to do with that extra money left over   this is where your goals come into play   if you have debt i recommend that one of your first goals is to eliminate that debt as fast as possible   if you have no money saved you should make one of your goals saving some money as an emergency fund   see the question oversimplify it for me the correct order of investing for some ideas on what order you should place your goals doing the budget and tracking all of your spending on paper is possible but many people find that using the right software to help you do this is much easier   i have written before on choosing budgeting software   all of the budgeting software packages i mentioned in that post are from the u.s. but many of them can successfully be used in europe   ynab the program i use even has an unofficial german users community that you might find useful one of the things that budgeting software will help you with is the process of reconciling your bank statements   this is where you go through the bank statement each month and compare it to your own record of spending transactions in your budget   if there are any transactions that appear in the statement that you do n't have recorded you need to figure out why   either it is an expense that you forgot to record or it is a charge that you did not make   record it if it is legitimate or dispute the expense if it is fraudulent for more information look around at some of the questions tagged budget   i also recommend the book the total money makeover by dave ramsey which will provide more help in making a budget and getting out of debt

i think you 're a little confused about taxes first i 'm guessing that you feel your lack of home ownership makes your taxes higher   that might be true or it might not   the main tax break you would get from home ownership is the mortgage interest deduction and that is a fraction of what you 're paying in interest   so yeah your tax bill is lower but 3 4 times that amount is going out the door in interest   plus when you buy a property you may have substantial taxes on that property that your landlord is paying now secondly yes you can deduct expenses on a business but that only can be done without income for so long before the irs begins your deductions   but if you 're making money the expenses come right off of your income third owning a business means that you get the privilege of paying a self employment tax which is the same thing that your employer now pays into social security on your behalf   more taxes so in short owning and operating a business has the potential to be more rewarding than holding down a job and i recommend starting up a side business just to get another income stream going but the tax savings really are n't that appealing to do it just for those

i 'd say that it can not be meaningfully calculated or measured because the two are just too different in every way poker stock trading i guess the last point that someone relying on luck is in poker but not in stock trading could be interpreted as stock trading being based more on luck while the second and third points indicated that poker has more true randomness and is thus based more on luck something both have in common is that people who have been losing money are often tempted to take stupid risks which lose them everything

from investopedia   beating the market is a difficult phrase to analyze it can be used    to refer to two different situations 1 an investor portfolio manager fund or other investment specialist    produces a better return than the market average the market average    can be calculated in many ways but usually a benchmark such as the    s&p 500 or the dow jones industrial average index is a good    representation of the market average if your returns exceed the    percentage return of the chosen benchmark you have beaten the market    congrats to learn more read benchmark your returns with indexes 2 a company 's earnings sales or some other valuation metric is    superior to that of other companies in its industry matching the market i would presume will be generating returns equivalent to the index you are comparing your portfolio with if for a sector industry then it would be the returns generated by the sector industry as an index is more or less a of the market as a whole people tend to use an index

i would be surprised if a bank cared about an undergraduate major usually such things are only important if it is a professional degree like a law degree or medical degree the big issue is that if you are not a us citizen a us bank would be unlikely to make an unsecured loan because you could just return to your country and on the loan and they would have no way to collect therefore a bank in your own country might be more logical if you get accepted by a top ivy school they all have financial policies that will allow you to attend regardless of how rich or poor you are so if you are applying to a top school harvard princeton mit stanford yale and get accepted they will fully finance your attendance the only exception is if a they find out you lied about something or b your parents family are wealthy and they refuse to pay anything as long as neither of these two things is true all of the schools listed guarantee they will provide sufficient financial aid princeton even has a no loan policy which means not only will they fund your attendance they will do so without you having to take on any loans

i wonder if these two concepts are compatible or mutually exclusive   the minimum wage should provide a decent living standard above the poverty line we should have as close to zero unemployment as possible   if those two statements are not compatible with each other then i do n't see how prohibiting eligible members of the workforce from an opportunity is at all desirable   yes this would mean that some individuals would be earning less money than it would take to make a decent living but those individuals know who they are we do n't   which means that they have the ability to make choices concerning their lives that we should n't try to anticipate   if minimum wage is not a decent wage for what they need they need to adjust their situation to change that   minimum wage was never intended to be a livable wage only the lowest amount you could pay someone   i would argue that if someone has been stuck earning minimum wage for more than 2 years they 're doing something wrong   either they 're not trying to advance or they 're not looking for a better job

pre edit pete mentioned that he feels real estate agents would a like you to buy as much house as you afford and b would love to show you three houses and have you choose one   as a real estate agent myself i believe his warnings were understated as with any industry there are good and bad people agents are paid to move houses if the median us home is under $ 200 k and commissions average say 5 the $ 10,000 to be gained is split between the buyer brokerage and selling agent the $ 5000 to each is then shared with the house so this sale would net me $ 2500 gross move one a week and the income is great one per month not so much tire will waste an agent 's time for a potential decision to wait another year and continue renting their obligation is to tell you the truth but not to offer financial advice   remember the mortgage crisis it seems the banks and brokers are n't watching out for you either they will tell you what they 'll lend you but not what you can afford these numbers are worlds apart   i strongly recommend a 20 downpayment the fha pmi calculator shows that a 90 ltv i.e. a 10 downpayment for a $ 100 k house will cost you $ in pmi think about this for the $ 10,000 that you did n't put down you are paying an extra $ 1200 each year this is on top of the interest so even at 5 that last $ 10,000 is costing nearly 17 if you ca n't raise that $ 10 k or whatever 10 is on that house in cheaper funds you should hold off using the 401(k loan for this purpose is appropriate yet emotionally charged as if suck loans are written by the devil himself   buy the biggest house you can no i have a better idea buy the smallest place you can tolerate i have a living room in addition to family room that has been used 3 times in 20 years a dining room we actually use twice per year when your house is 50 too big you pay 50 more property tax more utility bills and more maintenance closing costs commission etc is n't cheap but the lifetime cost of living in a too big house is a money pit

so there are a few angles to this    the previous answers are correct in saying that cash is different than financing and therefore the dealer can rescind the offer   as for financing the bank or finance company can give the dealership a kickback or charge a fee based on the customer 's credit score    so everyone saying that the dealers want you to finance well yes so long as you have good credit   the dealership will make the most money off of someone with good credit   the bank charges a fee to the dealership for the loan to a customer with bad credit use that tactic with good credit no problem   use that tactic with bad credit problem

everyone would like a savings checking account that has the same liquidity as others but pays multiple times as much but such a thing would break the laws of finance   the thing keeping savings and checking accounts cheap is n't particularly the fdic insurance but the high liquidity and near certainty that you will not lose money   in all of finance you are compensated for the risk and perhaps illiquidity you bear   if you insist on a risk free and highly liquid investment you will get the risk free and highly liquid rate which is currently around 1 does n't matter what type of investment it is savings money market treasuries etc   money market funds in particular were designed to be a replacement for savings accounts   they have decent liquidity and almost no risk and no fdic insurance   but they earn about what good savings accounts do because that 's what risk free investments earn if you wish to earn more you must decide what you will give up decide on one or both of those to sacrifice and you will find yourself with options

at one point in my life i sold cars and from what i saw three things stick out   unless the other dealership was in the same network eg abc ford of city a and abc ford of city b they never had possession of that truck so no real application for a loan could be sent in to a bank just a letter of intent if one was sent at all with a letter of intent a soft pull is done most likely by the dealership where they then attached that score to the that the bank has an automated program send back an automatic decline an officer review reply or a tentative approval eg tier 8 the tentative approval is just that tentative sometime after a lender has a loan officer look at the full application something prompts them to change their offer they have internal guidelines but lets say an app is right at the line for 2 3 of the things they look at they chose to lower the credit tier or decline the app the dealership then goes back and looks at what other offers they had let 's say they had a chase offer at 3.25 and a capone for 5.25 they would say you 're approved at 3.5 they make their money on the .25 but after chase looks into the app and sees that let 's say you have been on the job for actually 11 months and not 1 year and you said you made $ 50,000 but your 1040 shows $ and you have moved 6 times in the last 5 years they comeback and say no he is not a tier 2 but a tier 3 5.5 they switch to capone and say your rate has in fact gone up to 5.5 ultimately you never had a loan to start with only a letter of intent the other thing could be that the dealership finance manager looked at your credit score and guessed they would offer 3.5 when they sent in the it came back higher than he thought or he was you so if you price shopped while they looked for a truck you would n't get far they did n't find that truck or it was not what they thought it would be if a dealership sees a truck in inventory at another dealer they call and ask if it 's available if they have it and it 's not being used as a demo for a sales manager they agree to send them something else for the trade a car or truck or whatever a transfer driver of some sort hops in that trade drives the 30 minutes 6 hours away and comes back so you can sign the real application today while you 're excited about your new truck and willing to do whatever you need to do to get it because they said it would take 2 5 days to ship it tells me it was n't available time kills deals and dealerships know this they want to sign you today some dealerships want honest money or a deposit to go get the truck but reality is that that is a trick to test you to make sure you are going to follow through after they spend the gas and add mileage to a car but if it takes 2 the truck is n't out there or the dealer does n't have a vehicle the other dealership wants back or no other dealership likes dealing with them the only way it would take that long is if you were looking for something very rare an odd color in an unusual configuration   like a top end model in a low selling color or configuration you had to have that would n't sell well like you wanted all the options on a car except a cigarette lighter you get the idea 99.99 of the time a good enough truck is available deposits are bs they do n't setup any kind of real contract notice most of the time they want a check because holding on to a check is about as binding as making you wear a chicken suit to get a rebate all it is is a test to see if you will go through with signing the deal as an example of why you do n't let time pass on a car deal is shown in this one time we had a couple want us to find a cadillac hybrid in red with every available option total cost was about $ 85 90k only two new red hybrids were for sale in the country at the time one was in new york and the other was in san and our dealership is in texas and neither was wanting to trade with us so we ended up having to buy the suv from one of the other dealerships inventory that is a very rare thing to do by the way we took a 25 down payment around $ 20,000 in a check we flew a driver to wherever the suv was and then drove it back to texas about 4 days later the couple came back and hated the color they would not take the suv the general manager was pissed he spent around $ 1000 just to bring the thing to texas not to mention he had to buy the thing the couple walked and there was nothing the sales manager gm or salesman could do we had not been able to deliver the car and ultimately the dealership ate the loss but it shows that deposits are useless you ca n't sell something you do n't own and dealerships know it   long story short you ca n't claim a damage you never experienced not having something happen that you wanted to have happen is not a damage because you ca n't show a real economic loss one other thing when you sign the paperwork that you thought was an application it was an authorization for them to pull your credit and the fine print at the bottom is boiler plate defense against getting sued for everything imaginable ours took up about half of one page and all of the back of the second page i know dealing with car dealerships is hard working at them is just as hard and i 'm sorry that you had to deal with it however the simplest and car deals are the ones where you pay full price

so yes changing the industry this that would be great if they could get a car in they sub 20k class and assuming the government continued to give energy credits for ev trump could shut that down although why pick a fight with us auto makers    that said the point of these announcements is to set the stage for infrastructure let the oil companies know that in 10 years they will lose half their auto market so they need to migrate their investments to fleet and jet fuels chemicals and power generation diversify assets and investments etc sucks but definitely but yes they will fight so 2023 will be more like next of course is electronic filling stations which is where the oil companies really need to invest in as well as gain investment in the power grid which will also need to be ramped up especially in rural areas many of which were not even prepared for air conditioning in all residences and of course you have battery technology which requires lithium and other rare earth metals or ideally new organic based alternatives and the concerns with crash explosion fire and toxic gas is the devil we know batteries on a scale and the environmental impact with the number of serious crashes we have   so yes do n't get excited about what they are gon na do but understand the implications of such an announcement

i 'd put as much of it as possible into an isa that pays a decent amount of interest so you get the benefit of the money accruing interest tax free for the rest i 'd shop around for notice accounts but would also keep an eye out for no notice accounts the latter might be beneficial if you expect interest rates to rise and are willing to shop around and move the money into accounts paying better interest every few months just make sure you 're also factoring in the loss of interest when moving the money you could look into fixed term savings bonds but i do n't think they currently pay enough to make it worthwhile locking away your money

my realtor told me that even though they 're only asking for 1/2     the money and have excellent credit that the mortgage company may    not lend it to them if i 'm over priced is this true i 've never heard of it before it is a chance but it is a red herring to the discussion having excellent credit has nothing to do with being eligible for a debt object of a specific size just because you have excellent credit would you get approved for a property of $ 10,000,000 if you only made $ 35,000 a year and had no other net worth but regarding your potential buyers a chance vs a good chance is different your realtor just told you some basic always true lending fact that has nothing to do with your situation

keynes is hard to defend he makes some very basic errors in the core of his work however the best defense of keynes at least with respect to his intellectual contribution is roger time amp money argument is that keynes is right if you dismiss time as an irrelevant variable time is a complicated issue and keynes was brilliant in the way he managed to describe an economy that exists outside of time   keynes more or less admits that the solution is very short term with long term harm he just does n't think the long term problems are all that bad i really do n't think he would defend what his work has been twisted to advocate

looking at the numbers quickly   if he makes this amount for the entire year single no kids no investment income standard deduction only his taxable income will be about $ 110,000   that puts him in the 28 tax bracket   his federal tax would be   $ plus 28 of the amount over $ which comes out to about $ in tax liability   his federal withholding is $ for the year so with absolutely no deductions whatsoever he will be getting a tax refund of about $ 2200 i 'm not very familiar with the california tax return but it is entirely possible that he would get a decent sized refund from the state as well   this means that his tax refund could be about the size of an extra paycheck   he may want to consider increasing his allowances which would make his paychecks bigger and his tax refund smaller that having been said taxes are high no doubt about it   remember that when you are in the voting booth   here is how i got the taxable income number for the year

take the long term view   build up the cash   once you have enough cash in the bank you do n't need a credit score   with 6 months living expenses in the bank after paying 20 down on a small house he should have no issues getting a reasonably priced mortgage    however if he waited just a bit longer he might buy the same house outright with cash when i ran the computations for myself many years ago it would have taken me half as long to save the money and pay cash for my home as it did for me to take a mortgage and pay it off

first off high five on the paycheck   there are a few retirement issues to deal with 401k issues at that income level you will probably fall into the highly compensated employee category which means things get a little more complicated both for you and your employer   wikipedia link ira issues as you already realized you make too much to directly open and contribute to a roth ira   you can open a traditional ira however   your income is already over the limit for traditional ira deduction bummer so it would seem there is little point to opening an ira at all however there is a way to take advantage of a roth ira even at your income level   it is possible to convert a traditional ira into a roth ira   there used to be income limits on the ability to do the conversion which would have normally made this off limits to you   starting in 2010 the income limit is removed so you can do this basically you open a traditional ira max it out then convert it to a roth   since there was no income deduction you should n't have to pay any more taxes   link disclaimer i 've never tried this nor do i know anyone who has so you might want to research it a bit more before you try it yourself

what your are talking about is price controls   the us of a has used price controls several times in the past   there was a maximum wage you could pay workers   so employers offered extra benefits such as medical and paid leave   to 1973 the nixon administration set the price of gas   this helped cause an oil shortage   we see lots of price controls in the form of rent control   not allowing rent prices to go up does n't give incentive to housing developers to build more housing   the problem with prices controls is they do n't tell consumers to stop consuming   say if there is a war and the military need all the metal it can get   by allowing the price of cars and other metal products to go up in price   the people will not buy as many cars and fix up what they have freeing up metal to be used on tanks also the metal producers will make more money from higher prices and re invest their profits to make more metal for tanks and a very few expensive cars   but if prices did not increase the people will buy cars like normal and the government will try to used up the metal on tanks   the price of metal is the same so metal producers wo n't make much extra profit as such wo n't be able to re invest in expanding their production   the biggest example of price fixing was the soviet union   but if we look just under the hood there was long lines and shortages all throughout the soviet union   as soviet planners tried to make prices correct for each product based on many number of variables such as man hours and needs   but no mathematical equation seemed to work   the gave up and used the prices out of the sears catalog for some products like shoes   if you want to good read on the subject this is a really good article

i love the flat rate vat scheme it 's where you pay a percentage based on your industry an example might be computer repair services where you 'll pay 10.5 of your total revenue to the hmrc but you 'll be invoicing for vat at 20 still would definitely recommend registering for it since you 're expecting to cross the threshold anyway and like dumbcoder said you also get a first year discount of 1 so in the example above you 'd end up paying 9.5 vat on your turnover i personally found it a pain to invoice without vat my clients expected it so registering made sense regardless of the fact i was over threshold the tricky bit is keeping under the £ 150k turnover so you stay eligible for the flat rate it does get more complex otherwise

you do n't have to hire a tax consultant there is a number of companies who sell software or web based that helps you do it by asking for all relevant data interview style these typically cost between 15 and 25 eur i 'm not sure whether any of them are available in english but if you can read german well you should be ok is in english but to be honest it looks a bit dodgy to me now for your questions are there some tricky fields lines that after filling in my taxes will be counted higher this is rare at least for employees you nearly always get something back are there some tricky fields lines that after filling in my taxes could be counted lower not in general marriage is mentioned below and otherwise it 's all about individual deductibles ah one important factor if you have investment income and have not filed a with your bank you can get some of the taxes by filling out the form with data you got in the from your bank are there some flat rates that i could get advantage from absolutely as an employee the biggest factor is the of i think currently 1000 eur for general work related expenses which will be accepted without proof if your expenses are higher than that and you file individual expenses there are flat rates for work related moving and for commuting distance is it better to give a tax return together with my wife who was only a girlfriend in 2013 living with me in one household or to give it separately it 's not possible to do a joint tax filing for the time before your marriage what you should consider is to apply for a different tax class from now on if one of you earns significantly more than the other when separately do i have to fill her information in my tax return or can i just pretend there is nobody else in my apartment as far as taxes are concerned unmarried roommates are treated completely separately with one exception only one of you can deduct service charges included in your rent you have to get a from your landlord and service charges i.e. janitor etc should be marked separately but this may not be worth bothering with usually it results in a tax return of maybe 15 eur is there any guide in english that could be of help with filling in the tax return form i could n't find anything that looked really useful in a short search

as mentioned before you 're over thinking the hard pull issue but do try to make the preapproval as close to the actual bidding as possible because it costs money at least from my experience you 'll get charged the application fee for preapproval while pre qualification is usually free if you 're seriously shopping i find it hard to believe that you ca n't find a house within 3 months if you 're already in the process and your offer has been accepted and you opened the escrow i believe the preapproval will be extended if it expires before closing i 've just had a similar case from the other side as a buyer and the seller had a short sale approval that expired before closing it was extended to make the deal happen and that 's when the bank is actually loosing money so do n't worry about that if you have n't even started the process and the preapproval expired you might have to start it all over again from scratch including all the fees the credit score is a minor issue unless you do it every 2 3 months

you have a few options none of which are trade off free apply for a credit card and live off of that    here of course you will go into debt and there are minimums to pay   but it will tide you over   in any case you are getting unsecured credit so your rates will probably be very very high   you do n't want to build up a lot of 20 per annum debt an alternative to this would be to go to any bank and ask for an unsecured loan   having no income it will be difficult though not necessarily impossible to secure some funds   when i was in between houses once for example i was able to borrow $ 30,000 in unsecured debt to help me construct my new house just based on my income   grant you i paid it 2 months later in order to avoid the 10 year interest but the point is that unsecured debt does exist   credit cards are easier to get   arrange for personal financing through your parents or other relatives if your parents can send you remittances the terms will most likely be more generous   they know your credit and your true ability to repay   just because they send you money does n't mean you have to live with them   as a parent i have a stake in ensuring my children 's success   if i think that them over briefly is in their best interest and mine you better be sure i 'll do it a variation on this is something like kiva   here if you can write up a story compelling enough to get finance there are people who might lend you money   kiva is normally directed towards poorer countries and but local variations exist update google backed is far more appropriate to this situation than kiva   same general idea but that 's the vendor find freelance contract or light employment your concern about employment is justified you do n't want to be in a position where you are unable to travel to an interview because starbucks or mcdonalds will fire you if you do n't show up for a shift   then again do you really care if mcdonald 's lets you go   as such you need to find income that is less bound by schedule   freelance work in particular will give you that freedom assuming you have a skill you can trade   likewise short term contract work is equally flexible usually   finally it may be easiest just to get temporary pickup work in a service capacity   in any event doing something will be better than doing nothing   who knows you might want to be a manager owner of a mcdonalds some day   would n't hurt to say i started at the bottom

it all depends on the trust level you have in them handling it correctly if they never deposit it it does n't matter what happens to the check they could frame it and hang it on the wall the risk is that someone someday deposits it incorrectly double charging you and you need to do what think is appropriate to avoid this risk if your trust in them is too small only sending it back to you makes sure that you physically control the check

the initial story sounds normal happens every day can not prevent this since it is a typo by the sender the sender typed in a wrong account number that account number happened to exist so the sender would n't get any immediate error message your account but that innocent story can also be used as part of a money laundering plan namely to give the money a legitimate source also can be used in a scheme to frame you for something the question of how the person got your phone number raises suspicion the to avoid the normal paperwork and then disappearing make it no doubt take this to the police the question arises even if the plan whatever it was failed why did n't he do the paperwork and get the money back the answer is that that would leave a trail to possibly be picked up in a future investigation

a minimum purchase quantity just means that you need to round your result up to the nearest 100 in your example it comes out evenly if we look at an example where it does n't come out even you 'd round up and round that up to 700 due to purchase quantities for a slightly more complex and accurate approach you 'd then evaluate how many of the extras you had to buy due to the minimum purchase quantity would need to be sold so you 'd have to sell of the 700 purchased to break even

it 's impossibly difficult to time the market generally speaking you should buy low and sell high picking 25 as an arbitrary ceiling on your gains seems incorrect to me because sometimes you 'll want to hold a stock for longer or sell it sooner and those decisions should be based on your research or if you need the money not an arbitrary number to answer your questions if the reasons you still bought a stock in the first place are still valid then you should hold and/or buy more if something has changed and you ca n't find a reason to buy more then consider selling keep in mind you 'll pay capital gains taxes on anything you sell that is not in a tax deferred e.g. retirement account no it does not make sense to do a wash sale where you sell and buy the same stock capital gains taxes are one reason i 'm not sure why you would ever want to do this what reasons were you considering you can always sell just some of the shares see above and link regarding wash sales buying more of a stock you already own is called dollar cost averaging it 's an effective method when the reasons are right dca minimizes variance due to buying or selling a large amount of shares at an arbitrary single day price and instead spreads the cost or sale basis out over time all that said there 's nothing wrong with locking in a gain by selling all or some shares of a winner buy low sell high

i support the strategy to buy a less expensive car at the outset and then save for that more expensive car you mentioned that you would be able to save $ 9000 by the time you had to start making payments that sounds like a great budget for car shopping for $ 9k you can get a dependable used car   if you find the right high yield savings account you can get around 2 on your $ 500/month direct deposit that 's a difference of about 5 when you add in the 2.9 interest that you would have been paying on the loan you ca n't find such a low risk investment that would yield 5 these days   also at that rate 2 you would have $ saved up in less than 52 months or over $ in 60 months then you could buy a bmw with cash and i 'm sure they would give you a cash discount alternatively you could be just finishing paying off the loan and might already be looking at the next car you 'll take a loan out for the point is not that you have to completely deprive yourself for the rest of your life but by not taking out a loan you were certainly come out ahead in 5 10 years time   also one common mistake that new grads make is thinking that they are rich right out of college yes you definitely have a nice salary and could afford it by most people 's standards   i have a coworker that graduated and started work a year ago he first bought a brand new subaru why subaru i do not know but that is what he thought he wanted after driving the car for a few months he decided for a few reasons that it was not what he wanted so he sold the car for a loss and bought a slightly used nissan z. he has since decided that he needs a more practical car for day to day driving to minimize the abuse that his z takes so he has bought another car this time a low budget honda had he started with a low budget car he could be driving the same car to work right now but have a good chunk of savings for a new car instead of a loan and a car that he drives only occasionally

i 'm not sure about the laws in specific states however it 's part of their merchant agreement that they can not charge a fee for a customer paying with credit card it 's also against merchant agreements to require a minimum purchase to use a credit card although this is less commonly enforced apparently merchants can offer a cash discount offering payment by credit card though practically a requirement in todays retail environment is a privilege for the merchant it 's a way of making buying convenient for the customer as a result penalizing the customer in any way is not just against their agreement but rather disingenuous as well edit here 's a bit more information about what they can and ca n't do amex prohibits discrimination so if a merchant ca n't do something to a visa mc customer they ca n't do it to an amex customer either

some of this is demand management   the local 's wholesale club sells gas $ 0.10 less than the prevailing rate typically there are lines of 3 5 cars waiting for a pump during busy periods people are price conscious when buying gas which draws crowds and the retailer actually wants a line the whole point of the gas station is to draw traffic to the warehouse club other gas stations have the opposite problem big crowds lead to fewer people buying food and drinks in the convenience store which is where the business actually makes its money they want a steady stream of people in my area there is a gas station that is on a busy intersection right off the highway ramp going to the airport their problem is that people returning rental cars used to the gas station and cause traffic tie ups on the road a problem averted by marking up the gas $ 0.30

it is unusual to need a consultant to open a bank account for you and i would also be concerned that perhaps the consultant could take the money and do nothing or continue to demand various sums of money for expenses like permits licenses identity check etc   until you give up     some of the more accepted ways to open a bank account are a call up an established bank and follow their instructions to open a personal account make sure you are calling on a real bank one that has been around a while hints has permanent locations in the local phone book and has shares traded on a national stock exchange   call the bank directly do n't use a number given to you by a 3rd party consultant as it may be a trick discuss on the phone and find out if you can open an account by mail or if you need to visit in person   b create a company or branch office in the foreign country assuming this is for business or investing    and open an account by appointing someone like a lawyer or accountant or similar professional in the foreign country to represent the company to open an account in person   if you are a us citizen you will want to ask your cpa accountant tax lawyer about the td f 90 22.1 foreign account bank report form and the fatca foreign account tax compliance act there can be very large fines for not making the required reports    the requirements to open a bank account have become more strict in many countries so do n't be surprised if they will not open an account for a foreigner with no local address if that is your situation

well i disagree with the economists who claim bitcoin ca n't or would n't be a currency   as far as i 'm concerned bitcoin is the best established digital unit of account and in the event of a dollar euro crisis you are likely to see some entrepreneurs figure out ways to speed its adoption   i do n't own any bitcoin now and i would n't put more than 15 of my total portfolio in it simply because it 's not possible to predict if something like that would catch on   but i own a ton of silver about 20 of which is physical and the other 80 is via 's etf   i also do n't own physical gold but i own a lot of swiss francs which in my view are a good proxy for gold and a safe haven given the fact switzerland owns so much gold per capita   you get the benefits of gold and a captive skilled tax livestock   soros indicated recently he thinks the euro wo n't last much longer than a few months   i 'm always amazed by how the elite can push things off though   so i hold about 50 of my savings as cash usd   in the event of market turmoil you 'll know it when you see it like 2008 you can use this to scoop up some cheap stocks and gold silver coins   do n't beat yourself up over missing opportunities though   the main thing is just to steer clear of government bonds and the stock market   if you do that you 're going to come out in the top 20 over the next few years

i am surprised at the amount of work this contract wants done   i 'd question if it 's even legal given the high costs   i suspect it 's only there to remind abusive tenants of responsibilities they already have in law for extraordinary abuse beyond ordinary wear and tear they are already on the hook to repaint if they trash the paint think child writing on walls happens a lot and already need to and a lot more if they are a type hoarder who brings in a serious infestation happens a lot   the landlord can already go after these people for additional money beyond the deposit    but that 's not you   so do n't freak out about those clauses until you talk to the landlord and see what he 's really after   almost certainly he really wants a fit and ready to rent unit upon your departure so he does n't have to take the unit off the market for months fixing it   as long as that 's done there 's no reasonable reason for further work a decent landlord would n't require that   nor would a court imo   the trouble with living in a place for awhile is you become blind to its deficiencies   what 's more it 's rather difficult to size up a unit as ready when it 's still occupied by your stuff   a unit will look rather different when reduced to a bare room without furniture and whatnot distracting you   add to it a dose of vanity and it becomes hard to convince yourself of defects others will easily see   so tread carefully here   if push comes to shove first stop is whether it 's even legal    cities and states with heavy tenant populations tend to have much more detailed laws and as a rule they favor the tenant    right off the bat in most states the tenant is not responsible for ordinary wear and tear   in my opinion 6 years of ordinary exempt wear would justify a repaint so that should n't be on the tenant at all   as for the i 'm not in florida so i do n't know the deal maybe there 's some special environmental issue there which somehow makes that reasonable it sure would n't fly in ca   again that assumes you 're a reasonable prudent tenant not a or hoarder   as for the pro carpet cleaning that 's par for the course in any of the tough rent control areas i 've seen so that 's gotten a pass from the legislators   though $ 600 seems awfully high   other than that you can argue the terms are unconscionable too much of a raw deal to even be fair   however this will depend on the opinion of a judge hit or miss   i 'm hoping your landlord will be happy to negotiate based on the good condition of the unit which he may not know landlords rarely visit tenant units unless they really need to you certainly should make the case that you make here that the work is not really needed and it 's prohibitive   your best defense against unconscionable deals is do n't sign them   remember you did n't know the guy when you initially signed the now objectionable language should have been a big red flag back then saying this guy is epic evil run screaming even if that turned out not to be true you have hung around to find out   you may have gotten lucky this time but do n't make that mistake again   unless one of the above pans out though a deal is a deal   you gave your word   the powerful act here is to keep your word   forgive me for getting but successful people say it creates success for them   and here 's the thing you have to read your contracts because you ca n't keep your word if you do n't know what word you gave   it 's a common mistake thinking good business is trust hope faith submission or giving your all   no    in business you take the time to hammer out mutually beneficial win win agreements and you set them on paper to eliminate confusion argument and stress in the future as memories fade and conditions change   that conflict resolution is how business partners remain friends or at least professional colleagues

yes this is possible in the most liquid securities but currently it would take several days to get filled in one contract at that amount there are also position size limits set by the occ and other self regulatory organizations that attempt to prevent people from a market through the options market getting loads of contacts without effecting the price of the underlying asset exercising those contracts and suddenly owning a huge stake of the asset and nobody saw it coming although this is still very very possible so for your example of an option of $ 1.00 per contract then the position size limits would have prevented 100 million of those being opened by one person account that is realistically you would spread out your orders amongst several options strike prices and expiration dates stock indexes are some very liquid examples so for the standard poors you can open options contracts on the spy etf as well as the s&p 500 futures as well as many other s&p 500 products that only trade options and do not have the ability to be traded as the underlying shares and there is also the saying liquidity liquidity meaning that because you are making the market more liquid other large market participants will also see the liquidity and want to participate where they previously thought it was too illiquid and impossible to close a large position quickly

when interest rates rise the price of bonds fall because bonds have a fixed coupon rate and since the interest rate has risen the bond 's rate is now lower than what you can get on the market so it 's price falls because it 's now less valuable bonds diversify your portfolio as they are considered safer than stocks and less volatile however they also provide less potential for gains although diversification is a good idea for the individual investor it is far too complicated and incurs too much transaction costs not to mention that rebalancing would have to be done on a regular basis in your case where you have mutual funds already it is probably a good idea to keep investing in mutual funds with a theme which you understand the industry 's role in the economy today rather than investing in some special bonds which you can not relate to the benefit of having a mutual fund is to have a professional manage your money and that includes diversification as well so that you do n't have to do that

well depends but on average the stock market has historically returned somewhere around 10 per year   note this can vary wildly from year to year see so it would be roughly 2.8 years to get your 30 if you happen to get the average market return for those 3 years but the chances of that happening exactly are slim to none   you could end up with + 50 or -30 over that ~3 year period of time so the calculation does n't do you that much good for that short period of time but if you are talking a span of 30 years then you could plan using that as a very rough ballpark good rule of thumb is you should n't put any money in the stock market you think you will need anytime in the next 5 years formula to figure out total gain would be   principal x 1 + rate of return ^ years

google 's management is already aware of forces and likely has better intel than any material publicly available apple is not in the isp business and while people having faster internet would possibly benefit apple to a mild extent this is n't a pressing issue for them    unfortunately the dominance of the cable oligopoly is upheld by political forces outside the influence of much of the private sector i 'm not too familiar with the american regulatory system but my guess is the doj would n't even look twice at this let alone have any jurisdiction on the matter    sorry

@victor above has provided a very good answer i shall try and highlight some differences the differences are specific to a country however it does offer some insight regarding the difference between investing in retirement fund vis a vis investing in stock directly in many countries the retirement fund is mandated by the govt and has to be invested in in form of direct deduction from salary ~ investing in stock is up to the individual in many cases if not most capital gain interest accrual in retirement funds are not taxable ~ depending upon current laws capital gain long term short term from stocks are taxable retirement funds are managed and are in general more stable in their returns ~ returns from direct stock investments are dependent on investment decisions of the investor retirement funds tend to though this is very country specific return somewhat less than market as an example in india public provident fund provident fund epf return tax free ~ as for direct investment on stocks nifty has returned approx 17 cagr over 15 20 years given the above if you can invest in stock by taking informed calls and you have a good understanding of the financial markets and their and probably looking at long term investment then investing directly in stock could fetch returns that might not be by retirement funds if on the other hand if you feel investing in stock is not for you then it probably is better to stick with retirement funds and other low risk investments either way you probably have to and may be you should carry some portion of your portfolio as retirement funds

break the transactions into parts go to your bank or credit union and get a loan commitment when applying for loan get the maximum amount they will let you borrow assuming that you will no longer own the first car take the car to a dealer and get a written estimate for selling the car pick one that gives you an estimate that is good for a week or ten days you now know a data point for the trade in value finally go to the dealer where you will buy the replacement car negotiate the price tell them you do n't need financing and you will not be trading in the car get all you can regarding rebates and other special incentives once you have a solid in writing commitment then ask about financing and trade in if they beat the numbers you have regarding interest rate and trade in value accept those parts of the deal but do n't let them change anything else if you keep the bank financing the dealer will usually give you a couple of days to get a check   if you decide to the car to the first dealer do so as soon as you pick up the replacement car if you try to start with the dealer you are buying the car from they will keep adjusting the rate length of loan trade in value and price until you have no idea if you are getting a good deal
