in any country individuals and shops can reject any form of payment that is not legal tender defined by law as a payment form that must be accepted shops are typically more generous because they want to do business with you but individuals are in a different position in france only official coins and bills are declared as legal tender so if they do n't want to individuals do n't even need to accept bank transfers this is for doubts you need to pay in addition as you are not forced to do business with them people and shops can require whatever they feel like to require if you want to buy their car they can ask you to stand on your head and spit coins and if you do n't like it they do n't sell to you they wo n't do much business then probably

the post war us was riding high as the lone major non bombed industrial power we had all the steal plants all the car plants we had everything and we were supplying everyone by the 60s the world had rebuilt from the war and they rebuilt with newer factories than our pre war ones suddenly we were n't the only option around we had lost our competitive edge simply by the fact that the rest or the world had rebuilt by the late 70s and early 80s it was n't just first world nations we were competing against any more the rest of the world was catching up too countries had come from no where to be actual competition   long story short the 50s and 60s lifestyle was a result of us not being bombed out we are n't going to get that back plus now we are n't just competing with western europe and japan we have half the damn world as competitors with the other half following behind and sadly technology while awesome is allowing one person and a computer to do the job of what used to be 5 men keeping wages down even more i do n't have an answer but i doubt that kind of lifestyle is coming back for the mainstream any time soon

gt home solar does n't need to completely replace grid power a 70 reduction in demand would be sufficient to reduce generation requirements to only existing hydro wind nuclear plants   that is exactly where the problem is when your home solar and battery is out of power then your grid without traditional backup is out of power as well so in the end you need your grid to supply power in the 30 of time when your renewable plus some storage has none at the same time all household equipped like yours are out of power as well so either the grid power company has conventional backup or huge storage of course the cost of these must be levied over the 30 of time they are used not economically attractive   so you expect as a household to be able to just get energy from the grid power company when it is necessary for you as a backup are you ready to pay the triple rate during that time

short answer google finance 's market cap calculation is a.k.a wrong the standard way of computing the market capitalization of a firm is to take the price of its common stock and multiply by the number of outstanding common stock shares   if you do this using the numbers from google 's site you get around $   this can be verified by going to other sites like yahoo finance and bloomberg which have the correct market capitalization already computed the whole foods acquisition appears to be very cut and dry   investors will be compensated with $ 42 cash per share why are google finance 's numbers wrong for market cap   sometimes people will add other things to market capitalization like the value of the firm 's debt and other debt like securities   my guess is that google has done something like this   whole foods has just over $ 3b in total liabilities which is around the size of the discrepancy you have found

yes merchants may charge a fee for using a credit card for a credit card transaction interchange fees flow from the merchant to the card issuer this is why australians are seeing a boom in debit mastercard visa cards the issuing banks make income when you select credit   these costs can be passed from the merchant to the customer as a credit card fee for an transaction the interchange flows the other way from the card issuer to the acquiring bank the merchant 's bank   as an aside the setup of these fees is why some large supermarket chains in australia restrict you from selecting credit with a scheme debit card mastercard and visa are schemes   they are in the payments networks and they make interchange fees when you hit savings and pay if you hit credit therefore where you can hit either credit or savings they prefer and may force you to press savings

lowering of the us credit rating would affect all us bonds   some institutional investments are required to invest in securities with a certain credit rating i.e. money markets and some low risk mutual funds   if the credit rating is lowered these institutions would be required to dump their us bond holdings   this could have a serious affect on bond prices   the lower bond prices would drive up yields if the us credit rating was lowered after you purchased tips then the price you could sell your tips for would most probably be lower then what you bought them   you would lose money all us bonds including tips would be affected by a lower credit rating since the credit rating is suppose to indicate the borrower 's ability to repay the debt   this is independent of inflation   tips provide no additional benefit over regular bonds in regard to credit rating

as others have explained defined contribution is when you or your employer contributes a specified amount and you reap all the investment returns   defined benefit is when your employer promises to pay you a specified amount benefit and is responsible for making the necessary investments to provide for it    is one better than the other we can argue this either way    defined benefit would seem to be more predictable and assured   the problem being of course that it is entirely reliant upon the employer to have saved enough money to pay that amount   if the employer fails in that responsibility then the only fallback is government guarantees   and of course the government has limitations on what it can guarantee   for example from wikipedia    the maximum pension benefit guaranteed by pbgc is set by law and adjusted yearly for plans that end in 2016 workers who retire at age 65 can receive up to $ per month or $ per year under pbgc 's insurance program for single employer plans benefit payments starting at ages other than 65 are adjusted which means the maximum guaranteed benefit is lower for those who retire early or when there is a benefit for a survivor and higher for those who retire after age 65 additionally the pbgc will not fully guarantee benefit improvements that were adopted within the five year period prior to a plan 's termination or benefits that are not payable over a retiree 's lifetime other limitations also apply to supplemental benefits in excess of normal retirement benefits benefit increases within the last five years before a plan 's termination and benefits earned after a plan sponsor 's bankruptcy by contrast people tend to control their own defined contribution accounts   so they control how much gets invested and where   defined contribution accounts are always 100 funded    defined benefit pension plans are often underfunded   they expect the employer to step forward and subsidize them when they run short   this allows the defined benefits to both be cheaper during the employment period and more generous in retirement   but it also means that employers have to subsidize the plans later when they no longer get a benefit from the relationship with the employee    if you want someone else to make promises to you and are n't worried that they wo n't keep them you probably prefer defined benefit    if you want to have personal control over the money you probably prefer defined contribution    my personal opinion is that defined benefit plans are a curse   they encourage risky behavior and false promises   defined contribution plans are more honest about what they provide and better match the production of employment with its compensation   others see defined benefit plans as the gold standard of pensions

by paying off 50 k in debts now you 'll have 50 k less to invest in your new house that means that you 'll have a mortgage that 's 50 k higher so it 's trading one debt for another this means you should be comparing the t&cs for the two the most obvious is the interest rate that 's slightly tricky for your future mortgage as 20 money down may affect the mortgage interest rate the easiest way is to calculate the raw $ interests you 'd pay in both cases besides interest there are more conditions some debts may include life insurance which has a definite value in your case it would be hard to compare those here you 'd have to do so yourself

the hardest part seems to be knowing exactly when to sell the stock   well yes that 's the problem with all stock investing reports come out all the time sometimes even from very smart people with no motivation to lie about expected earnings for this company or for that industry whether those predictions come true is something you will only find out with time what you are considering is using financial information available to you and equally available to the public to make investment choices this is called fundamental analysis that is the analysis of the fundamentals of a business and what it should be worth it forms the basis of how many investment firms decide where to put their money   in a perfectly efficient market all information available to the public is immediately factored into the market price for that company 's stock ie if a bank report states with absolute certainty through leaked documents that coca cola is going to announce 10 revenue growth tomorrow then everyone will immediately buy coca cola stock today and then tomorrow there would be no impact even if pwc is 100 accurate in its predictions if the rest of the market agrees with them then the price at the time of ipo would equal the future value of the cashflows meaning there would be no gain unless results surpassed expectations so what you are proposing is to take one sliver of the information available to the public have you also read all publicly available reports on those businesses and their industries and using that to make a high risk investment are you going to do better than the investment firms that have teams of researchers and years of experience in the investment world you can do quite well by picking individual stocks but you can also lose a lot of money if you do it be aware that there is risk in doing any type of investing there is higher than average risk if you invest in equities the stock market there is higher risk still if you pick individual stocks there is yet even higher risk if you pick small startup companies   there are some specific interesting side elements with your proposal to purchase stock about to have an ipo those are better dealt with in a separate question if you want more information search this site for ipo and you should find a good starting point in short the company about to go public will hire a firm of analysts who will try to calculate the best price the public will accept for an offering of shares stock often goes up after ipo but not always sometimes the company does n't even fill its full ipo order adding a new type of risk to a potential investor that the stock will drop on day 1 consider an analogy outside the investing world   let 's say auto trader magazine prints an article that says all 2015 honda civics are worth $ 15,000 if they have less than 50,000 miles assume you have no particular knowledge about cars if you read this article and you see an ad in the paper the next day for a honda civic with 40k miles should you buy it for $ 14k the answer is not without more research and even if you determine enough about cars to find one for $ 14k that you can reasonably sell for $ 15k there 's a whole world of mechanics out there who buy and sell cars for a living and they have an edge both because they can repair the cars themselves to sell for more and also because they have experience to spot low offers faster than you and if you pick a or a stock that does n't perform even when everyone expected it would then you could lose some serious money as with buying and selling individual stocks there is money to be made from car trading but that money gets made by people who really know what they 're doing people who go in without full information are the ones who lose money in the long run

if the fee is paid directly from the account then unfortunately no you can not deduct it it 's probably too late now but in the future you can ask the financial institution if they will allow you to write them a separate check to cover the fees if they allow that then you can preserve your tax free account balance and potentially deduct the fees too more details here update as discussed in the comments below a strict interpretation of the irs description of deductible investment expenses may not include expenses for a roth ira even if they are paid outside of the account however there seems to be conflicting interpretations of this irs rule so i would advise speaking to an accountant or the irs directly for clarification but even if you determine you can not deduct the fees paying for them outside of the roth is still a good idea because it enables you to maintain a higher balance in your tax advantaged account

a while back i sold cars for a living   over the course of 4 years i worked for 3 different dealerships   i sold new cars at 2 and used at the last one when selling new cars i found that the majority of people buying the higher end cars honestly should n't have been 80%+   they almost always came in owing more on their trades then they were worth put down very little cash and were close to being financially strapped    from a financial perspective these deals were hard to close not because the buyer was picky but rather because their finances were a mess   fully half and probably more we had to switch from the car they initially wanted down to a much cheaper version or try to convert to a lease because it was the only way the bank would loan the money   we called them $ 30,000 millionaires because they did n't make a whole lot but tried to look like they did   as a salesman you knew you were in serious trouble when they did n't even try to negotiate around 2 of the deals i did were actual cash deals meaning honest cash not those who came in with a pre approved loan from a bank   these were invariably for used cars about 3 to 4 years old and they never had a trade in   the people doing this always looked comfortable but never dressed up you would n't even look at them twice   the negotiations were hard because they knew exactly how much that car should go for and would n't even pay that    it was obvious they knew the value of money that said i 've been in the top 3 of wage earners for about 20 years and at no point have i considered myself in a position to afford a new luxury car   imho there are far more important things you can do with that kind of money

thank you for misunderstanding   gt;then i shudder to think what an explanation of how the price of money can be derived from plotting is and lm together and extending it 's meeting point into the money market to determine the price of currency would do to your notion of control by powerful offices in government   and upon the very rant i knew you had in you   i am well aware of the federal reserve 's purpose of controlling the money supply as is everyone else   you are literally the last one to the party   your mistaken feeling of superiority is derived from a position of complete ignorance     your shock and outrage at the most simplistic of economic facts that have been the foundation for understanding international economics since the cold war represents a massive twisting of self education you have your way out of the dark pit of complete ignorance by reading up on how the economy works but in a twist you have learned this information from biased sources perhaps the abolish the fed folks putting around and instead of taking steps forward into understanding the world of finance you have flipped your lid and assume that you have somehow become neo in the matrix and have taken on a faux intellectual persona in a desperate attempt to assert an identity of superiority over the masses of far more educated people around you who do not react with shock and outrage to things they already knew   tldr you are just a smug asshole who has reacted to basic facts about the economy by incorporating them into making more credible tinfoil hat conspiracy theories and i hate people like you because you distract from legitimate criticism of the international banking system by acting shocked by what you learned in economics 101

as i recall from the documentation presented to me any gain over the strike price from an iso stock option counts as a long term capital gain for tax purposes if it 's held from 2 years from the date of grant and 1 year from the date of exercise if you 're planning to take advantage of that tax treatment exercising your options now will start that 1-year clock now as well and grant you a little more flexibility with regards to when you can sell in the future of course no one 's renewed the bush tax cuts yet so the long term capital gains rate is going up and eventually it seems they 'll want to charge you medicare on those gains as well because they can soo the benefit of this tax treatment is being reduced lovely time to be investing

you can not do this as per the reasons mentioned by others above mainly foreign banks can not hold mortgages over properties in other countries   if this was possible to do do n't you think many others would be applying overseas for mortgages and loans and even if it was possible the overseas bank would give you a comparative rate to compete with the rates already offered in australia to compensate with the extra risks if you can not afford to purchase a property at record low rates of below 5 in australia then you may want to re think your strategy

those government workers in greece were just off a corrupt system that was enabled by the blind pursuit of yield and the moral hazard of bailout expectations they were way overpaid to do nothing but collect bribes and drink coffee all day good greece is a poor agricultural country with some tourism and some shipping and needs to go back to living within its means nobody is going to starve and high unemployment was always the norm there until a few years ago i lived there before the euro and they managed just fine despite high interest rates and inflation    japan has had lost decades because its banks like those in the west now are practicing extend and pretend so there has n't been a proper flush of the system the piigs should just flat out default and get it over with rather than slowly default while giving up sovereignty    even germany would be better off if the piigs defaulted since it is german taxpayers and savers who are going to pay for these bailouts let the banks fail meaning let their equityholders and bondholders take losses the depositors will be fine the resulting lower asset prices will tempt risk capital back into the system and life will go on bailouts just throw good money after bad and prop up corrupt banks and politicians   edit let me clarify about depositors making out fine the banks equityholders and bondholders take losses before depositors who are insured anyway in most cases in europe as in the us the write downs are not large enough to eat through this cushion before threatening depositors creditors were rewarded with higher interest for lending to these irresponsible banks so they should take the hit rather than get made whole at taxpayer and saver inflation expense

this answer is applicable to the us   similar rules may hold in some other countries as well    the shares in an open ended non exchange traded mutual fund are not traded on stock exchanges and the market does not determine the share price the way it does for shares in companies as brokers make offers to buy and sell stock shares the price of one share of   the mutual fund usually called net asset value nav per share is usually calculated at the close of business and is as the name implies the net worth of all the shares in companies that the fund owns plus cash on hand etc divided by the number of mutual fund shares outstanding the nav per share of a mutual fund might or might not increase in anticipation of the distribution to occur but the nav per share very definitely falls on   the day that the distribution is declared if you choose to re invest your distribution in the same fund then you will own more shares at a lower nav per share but the total value of your investment will not change at all   if you had 100 shares currently priced at $ 10 and   the fund declares a distribution of $ 2 per share you will   be reinvesting $ 200 to buy more shares but the fund will be selling you additional shares at $ 8 per share and of course the 100 shares you hold will be priced at $ 8 per share too   so you will have 100 previous shares worth only $ 800 now + 25 new shares worth $ 200 for a total of 125 shares at $ 8 = $ 1000 total investment just as before if you take the distribution in cash then you still hold the 100 shares but they are worth only $ 800 now and the fund will send you the $ 200 as cash either way there is no change in your net worth however assuming that the fund is is not in a tax advantaged account that $ 200 is taxable income to you regardless of whether you reinvest it or take it as cash the fund will tell you what part of that $ 200 is dividend income as well as what part is qualified dividend income   what part is short term capital gains and what part is long term capital gains you declare the income in the appropriate categories on your tax return and are taxed accordingly so what advantage is there in re investing well your basis in those shares has increased and so if and when you sell the shares you will owe less tax if you had bought the original 100 shares at $ 10 and sell the 125 shares a few years later at $ 11 and collect $ you owe long term capital gains tax on   just $ = $ 175   which can also be calculated as $ 1 gain on each of the original 100 shares = $ 100 plus $ 3 gain on the 25 new shares = $ 175 in the past some people would forget the intermediate transactions and think that they had invested $ 1000 initially and gotten $ back for a gain of $ 375 and pay taxes on $ 375 instead this is less likely to occur now since mutual funds are now required to report more information on the sale to the than they used to in the past so should you buy shares in a mutual fund right now most mutual fund companies publish preliminary estimates in november and december of what distributions each fund will be making by the end of the year they also usually advise against purchasing new shares during this period because one ends up buying a dividend   if for example you bought those 100 shares at $ 10 on the friday after thanksgiving and the fund distributes that $ 2 per share   on december 15 you still have $ 1000 on december 15 but now owe taxes on $ 200 that you would not have had to pay if you had postponed buying those shares till after the distribution was paid for simplicity of i have not gone into the detailed of when the fund goes ex dividend when the distribution is recorded   and when cash is paid out etc but merely treated all these events as happening simultaneously

keeping a receipt does allow you to verify that the expected amount was charged debited it also can help when you need to return an item   regarding double charging the credit card companies look for that if the same card is used at the same vendor for the same exact amount in a short period of time the credit card company will flag the transaction they assume either a mistake was made or fraud is being attempted the most likely result is that the transaction is denied   a dishonest vendor can write down the card number expiration date and cvv number then after you leave make up a new transaction for any amount they want you of course would n't have a paper receipt for this fraudulent transaction the key is reviewing your transaction history every few days looking for unexpected amounts locations or number of transactions

you can do several things after the fact if you believe the stock will go up you can buy more stock now it 's what 's called averaging so you bought 100 at $ 10 now it 's at $ 7 to gain money from your original investment it needs to raise to over $ 10 but if you really think it 'll go up you can buy and average so you buy say 100 more stock at $ 7 now you have 200 shares at $ 8.50 average so you gain money on your investment when the stock goes over $ 8.50 instead of $ 10   of course you risk losing even more money if the stock keeps going down before the fact when you buy stock set triggers in most trading houses you can set automatic triggers to fire on conditions you set when you buy 100 shares at $ 10 you can set a trigger to automatically sell the 100 shares if it drops below $ 9 so you limit your losses to 10 for example

there are two types of 529 programs   one where you put money aside each month the one offered by your state may give you a tax break on you deposits you can pick the one from any state if you like their options better during the next 18 years the focus the investment changes from risky to less risky to no risk this happens automatically the money can be used for tuition room board books fees the 2nd type of 529 is also offered by a state but it is geared for a big lump sum payment when the child is young this will cover full tuition and fees not room and board or books at a state school the deal is not as great if they child wants to go out of state or you move or they want to go to a private school you do n't lose everything but you will have to make up the shortfall at the last minute there are provisions for scholarship money if you kid goes to west point you have n't wasted the money in the 529 the money in either plan is ignored while calculating financial aid other options such as the coverdell education savings account also exist but they do n't have the options and state tax breaks accounts in the child 's name can impact the amount of financial aid offered plus they could decide to spend the money on a car the automatic investment shift for most of the state 529 plans does cover your question of how much risk to take there are also ways to transfer the money to other siblings if one decides not to go to college keep in mind that the funds do n't have to be spent as soon as they turn 18 they can wait a few years before enrolling in college

i want to recommend an exercise find all the people nearby who you can talk to in less than 24 hours about credit cards your family whoever lives with you and friends now ask each of them what 's the worst situation you 've gotten yourself into with a credit card personally the ratio of people who i asked who had credit cards to the ratio of people with horror stories about how credit cards screwed up their credit was nearly 1:1   pretty much only one of them had managed to avoid the trap that credit cards created that sole exception had worked for the government at a high paying job and was now retired with adult children and a lucrative pension   because it 's trivially easy over extend yourself as a result of how credit cards work if you had the cash at any second you would have no need for the credit but do your own straw poll and then see what the experience of people around you has been   and if there 's a lot more bad than good out there then ask yourself am i somehow more fiscally responsible than all of these people

at what rate millions no one would start at that rate but the range is standard for harvard undergrads entering finance plus generous benefits and bonuses but the structure in most institutions weeds most of these people out after five years that 's fine for most people who are just trying to pay off loans buy a house and maybe feel secure starting a business people who stay for 5 10 years could certainly be in the million range when bonuses and benefits are considered

i 'm going to look just at purchase price essentially you ca n't always claim the whole of the purchase price or 95 your case in the year the accounting period of purchase but you get a percentage of the value of the car each year called writing down allowance which is a capital allowance it is similar to depreciation but based on 's own formula in fact it seems you probably can claim 95 of the purchase price because the value is less than £ 1000 the logic is a bit involved but i hope you can understand it you could also claim simplified expenses instead which is just based on a rate per mile but you ca n't claim both note by year i mean whatever your account period is this could be the normal financial year but you would probably have a better idea about this see the hmrc webpage on this for more details   the big idea is that you record the value of any assets you are claiming writing down allowance on in one of a number of pools that attract the same rate of writing down allowance so you do n't need to record the value of each asset separately they are similar to accounts in accounting so they have an opening balance and closing balance if you use an asset for personal use it needs a pool to itself call that a single asset pool so to start with look at the business cars section and look at the rates for cars section to determine the rate you can claim each one links to a further article which gives more detail if you need it your car is almost certainly in the special rate category special rate is 8 a year main rate is 18 and first year allowance is essentially 100 then you look at the work out what you can claim article that talks you through the steps i 'll go through your example you would have a pool for your car which would end the account period before you bought the vehicle at zero step 1 you then add the value of the car in the period you bought it step 2 you would reduce the value of the pool if you dispose of it in the same year step 3 because the car is worth less than £ 1,000 see the section on if you have £ 1,000 or less in your pool you would normally be able to claim the whole value of the pool the value of the car in the first accounting period and reduce the value of the pool to zero as you use the car for personal use you only claim 95 of the value but still reduce the pool to zero see the section on items you use outside your business this £ 1000 is adjusted if your accounting period lasts more or less than 12 months once the pool is down to zero that it you do n't need to think about it any more for tax purposes apart from if you are claiming other expenses or if you sell it   it gets more complicated if the car is more expensive i 'll go through an example for a car worth £ 2,000   then after step 3 on the year of purchase you would reduce the value of the pool by 8 and claim 95 of the reduction this would be a 160 reduction and = 152 claim leaving the value of 1860 in the pool you then follow the same steps for the next year start with in the pool reduce the value by 8 then claim 95 of the reduction this continues until you sell or dispose of the car step 3 or the value of the pool is 1000 or less then you claim all of it in that year selling the car or disposing of the car is discussed in the   capital allowances when you sell an asset article the basic idea is that if you have already reduced the value of the pool to zero the price you sell the car for is added you your profits for that year see if you originally claimed 100 of the item if you still have anything in the pool you reduce the value of the pool by the sale value and if it reduces to below zero to say you add that amount £ 200 in this case to your profits if the value is above zero you keep applying writing down allowances in your case that seems to just means if you sell the car in the same year you buy it you claim the difference or 95 of it as writing down allowance and if you do it later you claim the purchase price in the year of purchase and add 95 of the sale price to your profits in the year you sell it i 'm a bit unclear about starting to use it outside your business which does n't seem to apply if you use it outside the business to start with    you can claim simplified expenses for vehicles if you are a sole trader or partner but not if you claim capital allowances such as writing down allowances on them or you include a separate expense in your accounts for expenses it 's a flat rate of a mile for the first 10,000 miles and per mile after that for cars and a mile for motorcycles see the page on mileage expenses for details for any vehicle you decide to either claim capital allowances claim running costs separately or claim simplified mileage expenses and once you use the flat rates for a vehicle you must continue to do so as long as you use that vehicle for your have to stick with that decision for that vehicle   in your case it seems you can claim 95 of the purchase price in the accounting period you buy it and if you sell it you add 95 of the sale price to your profits in that accounting period it gets more complicated if you have a car worth more than £ 1000 adjusted for the length of the accounting period also if you change how you use it consult the page on selling selling an asset as you may have disposed of it you can also use simplified mileage expenses but then you ca n't claim capital allowances or claim running costs separately for that car i hope that makes sense please comment if not and i 'll try to adjust the explanation

you have a high risk tolerance then learn about exchange traded options and futures or the variety of markets that governments have decided that people without high income are too stupid to invest in not even kidding it appears that a lot of this discussion about your risk profile and investing has centered around stocks and bonds the similarities being that they are assets issued by collections of humans corporations with risk profiles based on the collective decisions of those humans that does n't even scratch the surface of the different kinds of asset classes to invest in bonds boring bond futures happening over there also there are potentially very favorable tax treatments for other asset classes for instance you mentioned your desire to hold an investment for over a year for tax reasons well every futures trade gets that kind of tax treatment partially whether you hold it for one day or more see the 60/40 rule a rebuttal being that some of these asset classes should be left to professionals stocks are no different in that regards either educate yourself or stick with the managed 401k funds

when you invest in an etf or mutual fund you 're not investing in stocks or bonds you 're buying shares of a company that invests in stocks or bonds this level of is what makes it so bond funds do not mature bonds inside of etfs or mutual funds do have a maturity date when they mature the fund manager uses the principal value that is returned to purchase another bond that meets the investment objectives of the fund so the fund never matures since it is always investing in more bonds when the old ones mature unit investment trusts made of bonds do have a maturity date as well since the portfolio does not change once the uit is issued as the individual bonds in the portfolio mature the principle value is returned to investors so the overall maturity date is effectively the maturity date of the last bond in the trust all of the statements quoted above are accurate in explaining why there is no guarantee of a return of principle when investing in bond funds etf or open ended mutual fund the bonds they hold do mature but are replaced within the fund as needed the investor will never see it happen unless they watch the holdings reports filed by the funds   the only way to have an assurance of the return of principle is to invest in individual bonds or in unit trusts made up of bonds

in a fixed currency system large corporations can easily fund big new investments and it 's super cheap   that 's because they are using retained earnings and not competing with lots of fractionally reserved money that is squandering resources chasing whatever bubble is in vogue at the moment   if you know that a company called toyota with no access to any retained earnings should build a car for $ 1 billion dollars and it is guaranteed to be a success before you ever even got started well then you 've solved the central planning problem and can just do away with private industry and run the whole world by decree because you have perfect information about the future     that does n't mean that government should n't exist   in a gold backed system the government can tax the population and invest in infrastructure or whatever but when they do that the population will have less to spend consumption industries will contract and production will be to the government 's whim until the investing is over and then the people will all get their money back through wages or business profits from selling to the government   it 's important that the government have a stable and predictable spending program so they do n't cause undue damage to the capital structure

the issue is that housing price increases ca n't sustain themselves indefinitely in comparison to the rental market increases drive people back to the rental market which brings the rental market up   also just as a airbnb would drive property prices to go up it also allows people who would otherwise not be able to buy a house to make the house purchase example is a mortgage lender that will give you a cheaper loan if you put your house on airbnb. that enables people to purchase a home when they otherwise would n't be able to so over time many years the market should work itself out   in the short term airbnb can definitely cause market fluctuations for example it might enable people to continue to own their homes during a depression which would cause a supply shortage    the only factor that affects ownership prices differently than rental prices in the long term would be regulation here 's a good seattle builds apartments but vancouver bc builds about that aspect specifically

there are many variables to this answer one is how close are you to the average salary range in the industry you are working in if you are making more than average it would make sense that you are not getting a big raise from the employer 's perspective you have to be a top performer if you are looking for the top salary range big raises come from promotions or new jobs generally speaking   the short and personal answer is i worked at a big company bank and now know that companies do not give large raises to people as a rule   honestly the only way to make good $ is to leave all employers have all kinds of excuses as to why they are not giving you significant raises large raises and bonuses are reserved for management the bigger the company the less likely it is that they will give you raises just because esp above 3 5 at the same time the market sets the rate and if you are not getting passively recruited it may mean that you need to work on getting a broader skill set if you are looking to make more $ somewhere else the bottom line is you have to think of yourself as a free agent at all times you also need to make yourself more attractive as a potential hire elsewhere

my experience is in the united states only in the past american express marketed its products as more exclusive and prestigious than other cards   there was an attempt to give the impression that cardholders were more qualified financially   in return fees were higher both to merchants and to cardholders   at the time early 1990 's it was not common to use credit cards for small purchases such as groceries or fast food   credit cards were used for larger purchases such as jewelry or electronics or dinner in a nicer restaurant once it became popular to use credit cards for everyday purchases the demand for customers using credit cards changed to the highest number of people instead of people of higher status   at that point visa and to a lesser extent mastercard transaction volume increased dramatically   merchants needed the largest number of customers with cards not the most financially stable   as visa volume grew and people started using visa for small purchases the use of american express decreased as their habits changed once someone got used to pulling out visa they did it in every situation   merchants are less willing to go through the extra hassle of accepting cards that are used by fewer people   over time i suspect this process led to the gap between visa and american express as a merchant in order to accept credit cards you have to set up a bank account and maintain a merchant account   accepting visa mc and discover can all be done through one account but american express has traditionally required a separate relationship as well as its own set of rules and fees that were generally higher   since there are relatively few american express cardholders compared to visa there is doubt about whether it is worth it accept the card   it depends upon the customer base   fine restaurants still generally accept american express

yeah the biggest problem with this is that it far more heavily taxes the poor than the rich   poor people spend all of their income   month to month living paycheck to paycheck poor people have no choice but to spend their entire incomes on basic necessities utilities etc   rich people on the other hand spend very little of their incomes   most of it gets stashed in and overseas holdings and does n't really change hands in a way that allows it to be taxed under this style of tax structure   so your tax continuously hits 100 of the wealth of the bottom of households while largely bypassing the rich folks who have more money than they can   in short this kind of tax structure is really bad for anyone who does n't make $ a year and store most of their wealth in stocks and so forth   if you want to help the general public households making less than $ 300k year you need to generate more tax revenue from investments and capital   a 2 tax say on stock trades valued over $ 10,000 obviously would n't hurt poor people at all and also would n't really hurt the rich   cuz if you 've got 10 grand or a hundred or thousand or whatever to stash in shares of amazon or whatever you 're really not gon na miss the $ 200 that comes off the top of your trade   but this would generate huge tax revenue as there are thousands of such transfers a day

my understanding i 've never filed one myself is that the 1040es is intended to allow you to file quarterly and report unpredictable income and to pay estimated taxes on that income    i was in the same sort of boat for 2016 i had a big unexpected income source in 2015 and this took away my safe harbor for 2016   i adjusted my w-2 to zero exemptions eventually and will be getting a refund of about 1 of our income so lets say you make 10000 in in march and another 15000 in in april   file a quarterly 1040-es between march 31 and april 15   report the income and pay some tax   you should be able to calculate the tax for 10k pretty easily   just assume that it comes off the top and does n't add at all to your deductions   then for april do the same by june 15 just like your w-2 is used to estimate how much your employer should withhold the 1040es is designed to estimate how much extra you need to pay to the irs to avoid penalties   it 'll all get resolved after you file your final 1040 for the 2017 calendar year

scanned or electronic copies of invoices should be sufficient as long as they are accurate and you can deliver them during an audit also if you have an accountant prepare your taxes you would either need to provide them a copy of the invoices or a summary of them with the corresponding amounts to be claimed personally i prefer to print out a paper copy and file that away with that quarter 's and year 's other tax documents i do my own taxes and find paper copies handy as i can go through each invoice receipt and make sure i have entered its information by ticking it i find that when handling a large number of documents that paper copies are more easy to handle than electronic ones in the end you will need to use a system that you feel comfortable with and are able to use effectively

from investopedia   beating the market is a difficult phrase to analyze it can be used    to refer to two different situations 1 an investor portfolio manager fund or other investment specialist    produces a better return than the market average the market average    can be calculated in many ways but usually a benchmark such as the    s&p 500 or the dow jones industrial average index is a good    representation of the market average if your returns exceed the    percentage return of the chosen benchmark you have beaten the market    congrats to learn more read benchmark your returns with indexes 2 a company 's earnings sales or some other valuation metric is    superior to that of other companies in its industry matching the market i would presume will be generating returns equivalent to the index you are comparing your portfolio with if for a sector industry then it would be the returns generated by the sector industry as an index is more or less a of the market as a whole people tend to use an index

different bonds and securitized mortgages are bonds that have similar average lives tend to have similar yields or at least trade at predictable yield spreads from one another so why does a 30 year mortgage not trade in lock step with 30-year treasuries first a little introduction mortgages are pooled together into bundles and securitized by the federal agencies fannie mae freddie mac and ginnie mae investors make assumptions about the prepayments expected for the mortgages in those pools as explained below those assumptions show that mortgages tend to have an average life similar to 10-year treasury notes   100 a so called average rate of prepayment means that the prepayment increases linearly from 0 to 6 over the first 30 months of the mortgage after the first 30 months mortgages are assumed to prepay at 6 per year this assumption comes from the fact that people are relatively unlikely to prepay their mortgage in the first 2 1/2 years of the mortgage 's life see the graph below   the faster the repayments the shorter the average life of the mortgage with 150 a mortgage has an average life of nine years on average your investment will be returned within 9 years some of it will be returned earlier and some of it later this return of interest and principal is shown in the graph below   the typical investor in a mortgage receives 100 of this investment back within approximately 10 years therefore mortgages trade in step with 10 year treasury notes average life is defined here the length of time the principal of a debt issue is expected to be    outstanding average life is an average period before a debt is repaid    through amortization or sinking fund payments to calculate the    average life multiply the date of each payment expressed as a    fraction of years or months by the percentage of total principal that    has been paid by that date summing the results and dividing by the    total issue size

some very general advice lifestyle borrowing is almost always a bad idea you should limit your borrowing to where it is an investment decision or where it is necessary and avoid it when it is a lifestyle choice for example many people need to borrow to have a car house education or go without also if you are unemployed for a long period of time and ca n't find work charging up the credit cards seems very reasonable   however for things like entertainment travel and other nice to haves can easily become a road to crushing debt if you do n't have the cash for these types of things my suggestion is to put off the purchase until you do note i am not including credit cards that you pay off in full at the end of the month or credit used as a convenience as borrowing

the stock market is not a zero sum game   some parts are forex some option trading but plain old stock trading is not zero sum that is to say if you were to invest at random you would on average make money   that 's because the market as a whole makes money it goes up over time 6 10 annually averaged over time   that 's because you 're not just gambling when you buy a stock you 're actually contributing money to a company directly or indirectly which it uses to fund activities that on average make money   when you buy caterpillar stock you 're indirectly funding caterpillar building tractors which they then sell for a profit and thus your stock appreciates in value   while not every company makes a profit and thus not every stock appreciates in true value the average one does to some extent buying index funds is pretty close to investing at random   it has a far lower risk of course since you 're not buying a few stocks at random but instead are buying all stocks in an index but buying stocks from the s&p 500 at random would on average give the same return as voo with way more volatility so for one you definitely could do worse than 50/50 if you simply sold the market short sold random stocks short you would lose money over time on average above and beyond the transaction cost since the market will go up over time on average secondly there is the consideration of limited and unlimited gains or losses some trades specifically some option trades have limited potential gains and unlimited potential losses take for example a simple call option   if you sell a naked call option meaning you sell a call option but do n't own the stock for $ 100 at a strike price of $ 20 for 100 shares you make money as long as the price of that stock is under $ 21   you have a potential to make $ 100 because that 's what you sold it for if the price is under $ 20 it 's not exercised and you just get that $ 100 free    but on the other hand if the stock goes up you could potentially be out any amount of money   if the stock trades at $ 24 you 're out $ 400 100 = $ 300 right   plus transaction costs    but what if it trades at $ 60   or $ 100   or $ 10000   you 're still out 100 that amount so in the latter case $ 1 million   it 's not likely to trade at that point but it could if you were to trade at random you 'd probably run into one of those types of situations   that 's because there are lots of potential trades out there that nobody expects anyone to take but that does n't mean that people would n't be happy to take your money if you offered it to them    that 's the reason your vs argument is faulty   you 're absolutely right that if there were a consistently losing line that the consistently winning line would exist but that requires someone that is willing to take the losing line   trades require two actors one on each side if you 're willing to be the there 's always someone happy to take advantage of you but you might not get a

you seem to have a grasp of the basic principles involved but your estimation of the risk you are taking seems a bit low your non investment reserves are unlikely to cover your expenses for more than a month so the chance that you would need to sell investments to cover additional expenses is high you mention that i am flexible with the cash on hand amount for instance for about three months i put a very tight spending investing freeze on my life because i knew i 'd be leaving jobs and moving i already had the other job lined up those savings presumably went toward moving expenses as your usual savings were insufficient in the event that you are laid off suddenly you might find yourself in the same position again with added unplanned expenses like fees for breaking a lease your current plan involves selling investments to cover the gap based on your age you have probably only invested in a predominantly positive market so the chance that you might need to sell investments for cash seems like a reasonable trade off for the added potential gains your perception might change if the markets go south and you are forced to sell into a down market possibly at a significant loss you also do n't indicate if your investments are currently sufficient to cover an extended period of unemployment you are taking on a lot of risk under your current plan essentially you are trading possible investment gains for flexibility and time by making small changes like saving at least enough to move as you did previously you can give yourself time to react to job loss or other unexpected financial need rather than give the traditional emergency funds advice i suggest you look at the broader picture the total amount of savings risk is up to you but you should consider your current savings as insufficient to rely on as a safety net

probably she asked for some kind of registered delivery someone asked her what are the contents worth in order to get a number to put into the insurance calculator and she said $ 60000 if that 's true meaning that if the letter goes you ca n't get a new one issued then yes you should insure it to the value of $ 60000 or rather since the insurance is so much you should not post it at all your girlfriend could perhaps return it to her client and agree with them another way to transfer money i 'm also not sure what happens when a letter hits us customs with a declared value of $ 60000 however it 's probably not true this is a check or if drawn on a bank here in the uk a cheque not a bearer bond if it goes missing then with some trouble and expense she can almost certainly get another one issued so the correct answer to what 's this worth is the cost of replacing it not the amount of money that it instructs the bank to transfer as for whether it 'll cause a red flag for you i 'm afraid i do n't know enough about us banking to say here in the uk there should be no problem with a cheque for that amount unless one of the banks involved has reason to suspect money laundering or related financial crime in which case they 're required to report it but if the cheque is from a non us account and you 're paying it into your us account then maybe you need to make a customs declaration

unless your brokerage will sell you fractional shares the most obvious difference without us knowing the actual identify of the companies is that with the $ 260 one you will have 3 shares plus you will have $ 220 minus commission left over that you wanted to invest but were n't able to simply because of the mechanics of long division you could put that $ 220 into one of the cheaper stocks but now the multiple commissions will start to eat your returns my personal opinion is you should go for a low cost index mutual fund or etf and wait to pick individual stocks until you have more than $ 1000 to work with and even then probably still go with the low cost index fund

this might be a bit of r conspiracy thinking but   dol rule has altered investment companies ability to make money on accounts many are still struggling to figure out how to adopt monitor and be in compliance with it this will hit the insurance companies hard too especially variable annuities providers since it is that much more difficult to justify their high cost products for rollovers dol    if you reduce the limit to 2,400 people are going to have to find other places to put money to continue to save   if you already saving 18,000 or 10,000 or 5,000 a year your going to need a new place to put that money   what other products are there that are tax deferred for non money after tax annuities    and since these dollars are no longer in qualified plans they are not subjected to the dol rules     if a variable annuity company comes out with a hybrid qualified non qualified account that allows you to have one contract with two accounts in it the fix is in   so maybe the insurance companies or the financial services companies lobbying groups or supported think tanks came up with the idea and served it to the government    my tin foil hat is on

a indexed guaranteed income certificate market growth gic fits the criteria defined in the op the guaranteed part of the name means that if the market falls your capital is guaranteed they cover the loss and return all your capital to you and the index linked or market growth means that instead of the roi being fixed determined when you buy the gic the roi depends on is linked to the market growth e.g. an index so you get a fraction of profit which you share with the fund manager the upside is that you ca n't lose lose capital the fund manager does n't just share the losses with you they take cover all the losses the downside is that you only make a fraction of whatever profit you might make by investing directly in the market e.g. in an index fund another caveat is that you buy a gic over some fixed term e.g. you have to give them you money for a year or more two years

honestly i wonder if the other are n't overthinking it their answers are detailed and correct but what your coach may be saying is this when you have bought a stock on cash or margin and you are watching it rise you are evaluating when you sell on the price of the stock you are seeing in reality you should look at the bid price buyers will give you for the stock and ask price sellers will charge you for the stock prices if the stock is going up odds are the price of the stock is very close to the ask price because it is purchases that are driving it up but that 's not what you 're going to get when you sell you 're going to get something around the bid price if the spread between the two is large i.e. a volatile stock this could be many cents or more lower than the ask price therefore what your coach may mean by selling on ask is you 're using the stock price when it 's equal or close to the ask price to decide when to sell instead of letting the stock peak and drop when its price will approach the bid price or letting the trailing bid offers catch up to your desired sell point and selling then i.e. letting the stock point grow past your sell point dragging the bid price up with it just a thought but that sounds like a term a coach would come up with to mean selling and getting less than you thought you were going to from the sale i know it 's a reply but the interwebs are and people come via google i did

couple points 1 since the roth is after tax you can effectively contribute more than you could with the traditional ira before hitting the limits so in your example if you had extra money you wanted to invest in an ira you could invest up to $ more into the roth but only $ 500 more into the traditional current limits are $ 5,500 per year for single filers under 50 your example assumes that you have exactly $ 3,750 in spare money looking for an ira home   2 the contributions but not earnings can be withdrawn from the roth at any time penalty and tax free   3 the tax rate lock in can be significant especially early on when you are at a relatively low tax bracket say 15 but expect to be higher at retirement   4 traditional iras and 401(k are taxed as ordinary income so you go through the tax brackets even if the marginal rate is 25 the effective rate may be lower if you have a roth conceivably you could reduce the amount you need to withdrawal from the trad to reduce the effective tax rate on those of course subject to minimum distributions and all that this is more an argument to have a mix of pre- and post tax retirement accounts than strictly a pro roth reason

absolutely terrible on many fronts firstly why are you giving away equity at all usually it 's to attract people you otherwise would n't be able to hire like extremely talented coders or business development managers but normal employees bad idea if you really want to give up equity then make sure it 's only realized valued once certain targets are met i.e. sales revenue share price investment etc as for the nomenclature they 're not co founders that 's typically reserved for the people that the company not just people who happened to be working for the company it started trading call them founding employee if you must but they 're certainly not founders why does this matter if the company ever takes or you get investment or you fire one of them or one just gets the idea to sue you their position name suddenly really matters and by not being careful they could win a substantial cut of your company in a lawsuit there 's even stories of employees up on their bosses and they end up owning the company i know someone that 's been involved in high 8 figure suit for 7 years for exactly the same reason so unless they 're putting in startup capital or they 're taking a serious hit on their salary in return for compensation in the form of equity do n't give anyone equity

i think it 's wise to account for those inevitable but unpredictable expenses like car house repairs and abnormal medical bills when deciding on your emergency fund amount   so if you average $ 100/month for car repairs and you have a 6-month emergency fund then part of that fund is $ 600 for car repairs if your total annual out of pocket for health insurance is $ then emergency fund gets $ 2,500 and so on this way you add cushion to your emergency fund to handle those unpredictable but inevitable expenses without setting up a bunch of separate accounts it does n't have to be inflexible either i know my furnace and air conditioner are way past their expected life so i 'm keeping a larger than normal emergency fund ultimately it 's personal preference to me cash is all the same no matter what account it 's in but other people do best by keeping some logical physical separation of funds intended for different purposes

if you are intent on becoming a quant i concur with most of the opinions in this thread you will need a graduate degree because it is a relatively small field and it is densely populated with people who have graduate degrees specializing more closely in the field than engineering will ever touch upon   however do n't give up searching for killer work opportunities like the kind you are currently getting if you maintain an excellent gpa in combination with these work placements you can easily secure a spot in a top degree program you are placed in an comparable program meaning you will possess a top notch understanding of math and have demonstrated experience in business    if you plan to search for work in canada after graduation i would highly recommend getting your graduate degree from university of toronto while it is often a poorly regarded undergraduate finance school when employers are looking for soft skills and queens slaughter undergrads for job placements absolutely no one disputes that university of toronto students have a top notch grasp of theory and it is commonly regarded from what i have heard at least as one of the toughest schools   at u of t there are two degrees that might fit for your field the and index mfe it would probably be prudent to call around or tap people in the industry in nyc or toronto to let you know which is preferable or a best fit i sense the but my opinion is next to worthless here    if you are interested in working in nyc and have the money for a graduate degree in the states without putting yourself under a mountain of debt get educated there your program directors will know the street better than those in toronto most likely gave excellent advice though i would add one thing know that doing this work in canada and the us are very different propositions especially for the sell side you probably know this but look no further than places like wso or colleagues at internships for horror stories related to hours conditions perks pay etc at american banks these days i have friends that have worked 55 hours straight in their offices if you consider that a point of pride go crazy otherwise be wary

disclaimer this should go without saying but this answer is definitely an opinion i 'm pretty sure my current accountant would agree with this answer and i 'm also pretty sure that one of my past accountants would disagree when i started my own small business over 10 years ago i asked this very same question for pretty much every purchase i made that would be used by both the business and me personally i was and naive then and i just assumed everything was deductible until my accountant could prove otherwise at some point you need to come up with some rules of thumb to help make sense of it or else you 'll drive yourself and your accountant here is one of the rules i like to use in this scenario if you never would have made the purchase for personal use and if you    must purchase it for business use and if using    it for personal use does not increase the expense to the business it    can be fully deducted by the business even if you sometimes use it personally too here are some example implementations of this rule note about partial expenses i did n't mention partial deductions above because i do n't feel it applies when the criteria of my rule of thumb is met note that the irs states personal versus business expenses generally you can not deduct personal living or family expenses however if you have an expense for something that is used partly for business and partly for personal purposes divide the total cost between the business and personal parts you can deduct the business part at first read that makes it sound like some of my examples above would need to be split into partial however i think the key distinction is that you would never have made the purchase for personal use and that the cost to the business does not increase because of allowing personal use partial deductions come into play when you have a shared car or office or something where the business cost is increased due to shared use in general i try to avoid anything that would be a partial expense though i do allow my business to reimburse me for mileage when i lend it my personal car for business use

some highly pessimistic things worth noting to go alongside all the stability and tax break upside that homes generally provide negative equity is no joke and basically the only thing that the middle classes consistently en masse the uk is at the end of a huge housing bull run where rents are extremely cheap relative to buying often in the 1 range within the brexit is looming and interest rates could well sky rocket with inflation borrowing to buy a highly illiquid asset you might have to fire sale in case of emergency job loss etc for 300k in a few years when lots of relatively cheap rental housing is available to rent risk free could be argued to be a highly lopsided and dangerous bet vs the alternatives locking in preferential mortgage rates can be a huge trap low interest rates generally increase asset values if when they rise assets fall in value as the demand shrinks making you highly exposed to huge losses if you need to sell before it is paid off in the case of housing this can be exceptionally vicious as the liquidity dramatically dries up during falls meaning fire sales become much more severe than they are for more liquid assets like stock   and unlike most products people tend to buy the very best house they can get leverage for rather than work out what they need want and finding the best value equivalent if a bank will lend you £ 20 a day to buy lunch and you can just afford to pay it do you hunt out the very best £ 20 lunch you can every day or do you make some solid compromises so you can save money for other things etc you seem to be hunting very close to the absolute peak amount you can spend on these numbers related to above at that level of mortgage salary you have very little margin for error if either of you lose jobs etc   houses are much more expensive to maintain trade than most people think you spend ~2 5 every time you buy and sell and you can easily spend 2 a year depending what happens just keeping the thing paid for liveable and staying up you need to factor this in and be pessimistic when you do   most people do n't factor in these costs to the apparent index rise in house values and what they expect to sell for in x years in reality no buy and hold investor can ever realise even close to the quoted house price returns as they are basically stocks you have to pay 5 each time you buy or sell and then 1 20 percent a year to own they have to rise dramatically over time for you to even break even after all the costs   in general you should buy homes to make memories not money and to buy them at prices that do n't cause you sleepless nights in case of disasters

not to be rude but i think you have an extremely naive view of how the united states operates insurance and health care are the exact same thing in this country for 99.9 of the people in it the reason for this is that there is no way that anyone can afford healthcare without an insurance company unless they are in the top .1 that is the way the system was set up and it results in millions being uninsured and millions more being uninsurable   i am not an ignorant person but clearly it makes you feel superior to say it so carry on you have no idea what you are talking about or whom you are talking to

as joetaxpayer has commented the markets are littered with the of those who buy into the idea that markets submit readily to formal analysis    financial markets are amongst the most complex systems we know of   to borrow a concept from mathematics that of a chaotic system one might say that financial markets are a chaotic system comprised of a structure of chaotic for example the unpredictable behaviour of a single big market participant can have dramatic effects on overall market behaviour in my experience becoming a successful investor requires a considerable amount of time and commitment and has a steep learning curve   your actions in abandoning your graduate studies hint that you are perhaps lacking in commitment most people believe that they are special and that investing will be easy money   if you are currently entertaining such thoughts then you would be well advised to forget them immediately and prepare to show some humility tl dr it is currently considered that behavioural psychology is a valuable tool in understanding investors behaviour as well as overall market trends   also in the area of psychology confirmation bias is another aspect of trading that it is important to keep in mind   quantitative analysis is a mathematical tool that is currently used by hedge funds and the big investment banks however these methods require considerable resources and given the   performance of hedge funds in the last few years it does not appear to be worth the investment if you are serious in wanting to make the necessary commitments then here are a few ideas on where to start there are certain technical details that you will need to understand in order to quantify the risks you are taking beyond simple buying and holding financial instruments   for example how option strategies can be used limit your risk how margin requirements may force your hand in volatile markets how different markets impact on one another e.g. the relationship between bond markets and equity markets and a host of other issues   also to repeat it is important to understand how your own psychology can impact on your investment decisions

one explanation is that movie patrons are considering their total willingness to pay for the movie experience so that if the ticket price plus the market price of popcorn is less than their willingness to pay the theater has an opportunity to extract more consumer surplus by charging higher than market prices for the popcorn that is price discrimination there is a working paper on the subject by and 2008 the abstract of which reads prices for goods such as blades for razors ink for printers and concessions at movies are often     set well above cost   theory has shown that this could yield   a profitable price discrimination     strategy often termed metering   the idea is that a customer ’s intensity of demand for     aftermarket goods e.g. the concessions provides a meter of how much the customer is willing to     pay for the primary good e.g. admission   if this correlation in tastes for the two goods is     positive a high price on the aftermarket good allows firms to extract a greater total price     admissions plus concessions from higher type   customers   this paper develops a simple     aggregate model of discrete continuous demand to motivate how this correlation can be tested     using simple regression techniques and readily available firm data   model simulations illustrate     that the can be used to predict whether aftermarket prices should be above below or     equal to their marginal cost   we then apply the approach to box office and concession data from     a chain of spanish theaters and find that high priced concessions do extract more surplus from     customers with a greater willingness to pay for the admission ticket   and 1992 make a similar argument in a article   they essentially argue that purchases of things like movie tickets are made by groups once individuals are constrained by the group 's choice the firm has additional market power we present models in which price discrimination in the context of   a    two part price can occur in some competitive markets purchases   take    place in groups which choose which firms to patronize while   firms    are perfectly competitive with respect to   groups they have   some    market power over individual consumers who are constrained   by their    groups choices we find that firms will charge an entry fee   that is     below marginal cost   and   the   second part of   the   price is   marked    up   above marginal cost the   markup not only is positive   but    increases with the quality of the product the quote you are looking for is similar and again attributes the discrepancy to price discrimination   from the armchair economist p. the purpose of expensive popcorn is not to extract a lot of money from    customers that purpose would be better served by cheap popcorn and    expensive movie tickets instead the purpose of expensive popcorn is    to extract different sums from   different customers popcorn lovers    who have more fun at the movies pay more for their additional    pleasure that is some people like popcorn more than others   the latter idea is that the movie experience for popcorn lovers is worth more than the sum of its parts that a movie ticket + popcorn is worth more than either of them separately for some people

is this amount an adequate starting amount to begin investing with yes you can open an account at a brokerage with this amount i 'm not sure i would invest in individual stocks at this point which services should i use to start buying shares currently my bank offers this service but i 'm willing to use other sources i ca n't make uk specific recommendations but i 'd compare your bank 's fees to those of a discount broker as well as the variety and level of service available i would like to regularly increase the amount invested in shares is it worth doing this in say £ 200 increments take a look at the fees associated with each investment divide the fee by the increment to see what percent you 'll lose to fees commissions keep in mind that you have to gain more than that percentage to start earning a positive return on your investment if you have access to fee free automatic mutual fund investments and you can commit to the £ 200 amount on a regular basis going forward then this can be a completely free way of making these incremental investments see also this answer on dollar cost averaging and my comment on the other answer on that question for how fees impact returns when buying shares should i focus on say two or three companies or diversify more i would diversify into two or three different index funds read up on asset allocation for example you might invest 1/3 of your balance into s&p 500 index fund bond index fund and msci eafe index fund but that 's just a rough example and not necessarily good for you i highly recommend the intelligent asset allocator by william bernstein for excellent info on diversification and asset allocation

i suggest that you 're really asking questions surrounding three topics 1 what allocation hedges your risks but also allows for upside 2 how do you time your purchases so you 're not getting hammered by exchange rates 3 how do you know if you 're doing ok allocations your questions concerning allocation are really what if questions as points out only you can really answer those i would suggest building an excel sheet and thinking through the scenarios of at least 3 what ifs   a what if you keep your current allocations and anything in local currency gets cut in half in value could you live with that b what if you allocate more to stable economies and your economy recovers so stable items grow at 5 per year but your local investments grow 50 for the next 3 years could you live with that missed opportunity   c what if you allocate more to stable economies and they grow at 5 while sa continues a gradual slide remember that slow or flat growth in a stable currency is the same as higher returns in a declining currency i would trust your own insights as a local but i would recommend thinking more about how this plays out for your current investments   timing you bring up concerns about timing of buying expensive foreign currencies you ca n't time the market if you knew how to do this with forex trading you would n't be here   read up on dollar cost averaging for most people and most companies with international exposure it may not beat the market in the short term but it nets out positive in the long term   rebalancing for you there will be two questions to ask regularly is the allocation still correct as political and international issues play out have any returns or losses thrown your planned allocation out of   alignment   put your investment goals in writing and revisit it at least once a year to evaluate whether any adjustments would be wise to make   and of course i am not a registered financial professional especially not in sa so i obviously recommend taking what i say with a large dose of salt

first i 'm not a cpa or international tax accountant my entire understanding of the french tax system is entirely from what i 've read in places like the wsj wapo etc    however my understanding is that french tax law works something like this let 's say france has a tax rate of 35 first it must be assessed where the controlling entity is in this case if the majority of production and labor or if the corporation is primarily based in france it would proceed as follows taxes are initially paid based on transfer pricing to the original local entity this avoids double taxation so in the example above you would pay 10 to india on the $ in profits $ 300,000 you would then reduce the 35 french tax rate by the 10 already paid this means you would pay an additional 25 to france $ 750,000 the premise is that you have an effective minimum tax threshold for being in france in the case above companies like ge would have to pay the difference this does n't get into tax breaks shelters on previously recorded losses etc    again i am not sure on this is my basic understanding and am by no means a tax accountant lawyer etc from what i understand however this has n't necessarily been a good thing for france either california is likely a similar case study with the return requirement the fact is the world is very global nowadays its easier and cheaper for the companies to just leave instead of being forced to pay higher taxes   imo germany hit it right on the head low corporate tax rates with high personal tax rates this maintains a very business friendly environment business move there because of the skilled labor and low corporate taxes but they effectively pass the burden on to individuals who also benefit from the pro business environment you 'd be hard pressed to find an economist that does n't think germany 's economy has been very strong over the past decade very good soros speech that was recently posted about his analysis of the euro and germany 's unfair benefits but that 's a whole different gear    what i find the issue to be is the whole concept is complex enough that 's difficult to explain to the average person with a 2 second attention span that 's why i like writing posts like this to try to help people understand how finance and businesses operate behind the scenes

one idea if you came up with a model to calculate a fair price range for a stock then any time the market price were to go below the range it could be a buy signal and above the range it could be a sell signal there are many ways to do stock valuation using fundamental analysis tools and ratios dividend discount model peg etc see wikipedia stock valuation and while many of the inputs to such a fair price range calculation might only change once per quarter market prices and peer sector statistics move more frequently or at different times and could generate signals to buy sell the stock even if its own inputs to the calculation remain static over the period for multinationals that have a lot of assets and income denominated in other currencies foreign exchange rates provide another set of interesting inputs i also think it 's important to recognize that with fundamental analysis there will be extended periods when there are no buy signals for a stock because the stocks of many popular profitable companies never go on sale except perhaps during a panic moreover during a bull market and especially during a bubble there may be very few stocks worth buying fundamental analysis is designed to prevent one from overpaying for a stock so even if there is interesting volume and price movement for the stock there should still be no signal if that action happens well beyond the stock 's fair price otherwise it is n't fundamental analysis it 's technical analysis whereas technical analysis can by definition generate far more signals because it largely ignores the fundamentals which can make even an overvalued stock 's movement interesting enough to generate signals

note that after 15 years the tax exemption is € per person which includes both the principal you and the accumulated interest   it 's possible that you will have a higher balance than this in your savings account at this point and would still owe tax on the interest accumulated above the exempted amount   after 20 years you get the full tax exemption the lesser of your portion of the mortgage debt and € per person in direct answer to your questions i 'm not aware of any exceptions to the 15 year rule for allowing the accumulated interest to be tax free when selling your house   if your accumulated interest is low enough you might consider just paying the tax on it as it would give you the most flexibility in choosing a new mortgage   this is why i asked about more details about your interest rate and how long the mortgage has been running it may however possible to couple the savings account to a new abn mortgage when you buy a new house   you should check your mortgage terms and conditions   for example section in abn 's terms and conditions from 2010 describes this   see here   it is probably best however to speak directly with either your mortgage broker or with a mortgage adviser with abn   if your mortgage broker still worked on commission when you closed your mortgage then they are obligated to assist you with this type of question in order to qualify for the tax exemption you must use the saved value to pay off debt on your primary residence   the savings account entirely from a mortgage will disqualify you from the tax advantages   you will owe tax on all accumulated interest

utilities and cost of living vary from city to city but maybe not that much   for basic planning purposes you can probably figure to spend as much as you are now maybe a little more   and adjust as needed when you get there   and adjust if for example you 're moving from a very low cost of living area or to a very high cost of living area the cost of housing varies quite a bit from city to city but you can do this research using zillow craigslist other places now on to moving itself   the cost of moving can vary hugely depending on how much stuff you have and how much work you want to do   on the cheap end you can rent a u haul or one of those portable boxes that they plant outside your old house and move for you   you 'll do all the packing loading unloading yourself but it saves quite a bit of money   my family and i moved from seattle to california last year using one of those portable box places and it ended up costing us including 30 days of storage at the destination while we looked for a place   we have a < 1000 sq foot place with some furniture but not a huge amount and did all the packing loading ourselves   if we had wanted full service where people come pack load unpack etc it could have been 2 3x that amount   and if we had more stuff it could have been a lot more expensive too   try not to acquire too much stuff as you just end up having to move it around and take care of it all   your employer may cover moving expenses ask about this when talking about job offers   un reimbursed moving expenses are tax deductible in the us even if you do n't itemize    since you 're just starting out your best bet is to overestimate how much you think things will cost then adjust as you arrive and settle in for a few months   try to save as much as you can but remember to have fun too   hope this helps

since near term at the money atm options are generally the most liquid the listed implied vol for a stock is usually pretty close to the nearest atm volatility but there 's not a set convention that i 'm aware of   also note that for most stocks vol skew the difference in vol between away from the money and at the money options is relatively small   correct me if i 'm wrong iv is the markets assessment that the stock is about 70 likely 1 standard deviation to move in either direction by that percent over the next year not exactly   it 's an annualized standard deviation of the anticipated movements over the time period of the option that it 's implied from   implied vol for near term options can be higher or lower than longer term options depending on if the market believes that there will be more uncertainty in the short term   also it 's the bounds of the expected movement in that time period so if a stock is at $ 100 with an implied vol of 30 for 1-year term options then the market thinks that the stock will be somewhere between $ 70 and $ 130 after 1 year   if you look at the implied vol for a 6-month term option half of that vol is the range of expected movement in 6 months

this situation sounds better than most the company it seems likely to be profitable in the future   as such it is a good candidate to have a successful ipo    with that your stock options are likely to be worth something   how much of that is your share is likely to be very small   the workers that have been their since the beginning the venture capitalist and the founders will make the majority of profits from an ipo or sale   since you and others hired at a similar time as you are assuming almost no risk it is fair that your share of the take is small    despite being employees expect your share of the profits to be much smaller than   how about we go with .01    lets also assume that they go public in 2.5 years and that revenues during that time continue to increase by about year   profit margins remains the same   so revenues to 112 m profits to typically the goal for business is to pay no more than 5 times profits that could be supplanted by other factors but let 's assume that figure   so about 112 m from the ipo   so .01 of that is about 11k.   that feels about right keep in mind there would be underwriting fees and also i would discount that figure for things that could go wrong   i 'd be at about 5k. that would be my expected value figure 5k.   i 'd also understand that there is a very small likelihood that i receive that amount   the value received is more likely to be zero or enough to buy a there might also be some value in getting to know these people   if this fails will their next venture be a success in my own life i went to work for a company that looked great on paper that just turned out to be a bust   great concept horrible management and within a couple of years of being hired the company went bust   i worked like a dog for nothing

before you invest in a house make sure you account for all the returns risks and costs and compare them to returns risks and costs of other investments if you invest 20 of a house 's value in another investment you would also expect a return you also probably will not have the cost interest for the balance 80 of i have heard people say if i have a rental property i 'm just throwing away money i 'll have nothing at the end if you get an interest only loan the same will apply if you pay off your mortgage you 're paying a lot more you could save invest the extra and then you will have something at the end + interest if you want to compare renting and owning count the interest against the rental incoming against lost revenue for however much actual money you 've invested so far + interest   i 've done the sums here renting vs. owning which is slightly different e.g. my house will never be empty i pay extra if i want a different house location not counting for the up front costs real estate mortgage establishment etc and not accounting for house price fluctuations i get about the same return on buying as investing at the bank houses do of course fluctuate both up and down risk usually up in the long term on the other hand many people do lose out big time some friends of mine invested when the market was high everyone was investing in houses they paid off as much as they could then the price dropped and they panicked and sold for even less than they bought for the same applies if in your example house prices drop too much so you owe more than the house is worth the bank may force you to sell or offer your own house as collateral do n't forget about the hidden costs lawn mowing and snow shoveling were mentioned insurance maintenance etc and risks like fluctuating rental prices bad tenants tenants moving on loss of incoming cleaning expenses up the place etc

if you are just starting out i would say there is no disadvantage to using a personal card for business expenses in fact the advantage of doing so is that the consumer protections are better on personal cards than on business cards   one possible advantage to business credit cards is that many but not all will not show up on your personal credit report unless you default this might help with average age of accounts if you have a thin credit file but otherwise it wo n't make much difference issuers also expect higher charge volumes on business cards so as your business grows might question a lot of heavy charges on a personal card whether this would ever happen is speculation but it 's worth being aware of it

probably a big fat no update re this edit note i 'm not suggesting that i melt the coins i 'm just suggesting that i hold onto the nickels and sell them later when they are worth more than 5 cents for example you can sell coins with silver in them for far above their face value this is silly as an investment   right up there with stockpiling cars    the increase in value will likely never be enough to make the cost hassle of storage worth it   as mrchrister states it is a fine idea as a collection but not as a stockpile edit from the comments i am surprised i did not onto this in the previous update   silver is considered a previous metal nickel and copper are not   btw the u.s. nickel is 25 nickel and 75 copper also how in the world do you plan on actually selling a stockpile of nickels

this sounds like a fatca issue   i will attempt to explain but please confirm with your own research as i am not a fatca expert if a foreign institution has made a policy decision not to accept us customers because of the foreign financial institution obligations under fatca then that will of course exclude you even if you are resident outside the us   the us government asserts the principle of universal tax jurisdiction over its citizens   the institution may have a publicly available fatca policy statement or otherwise be covered in a new story so you can confirm this is what has happened   failing that i would follow up and ask for clarification you may be able to find an institution that accepts us citizens as investors   this requires some research maybe some legwork of your citizenship is the most certain way to circumvent this issue if you are prepared to take such a drastic step   such a step would require thought and planning   note that there would be an expatriation tax exit tax that deems a disposition of all your assets mark to market for all your assets under irc a less direct but far less extreme measure would be to use an intermediary either one that has access or a foreign entity i.e. non us entity that can gain access   a non financial foreign entity is itself subject to withholding rules of fatca so it must withhold payments to you and any other us persons   but the investing institutions will not become by paying an the obligation rests on the pwc australia has a nice little writeup that explains some of the key terms and concepts of fatca of course the simplest solution is probably to use us institutions where possible   non foreign entities do not have foreign obligations under fatca

i think that people only use the phrase only spend what you can afford to lose when they are talking about the most risky or speculative investments or even gambling    when talking about gambling the following quote is a bottom line the speculative investment that brought me to this question via google is how much should i invest in bitcoin   i was tempted to put in 10 of my investments not including the 6 month safety fund and not including equity in my home   now thinking about this question it seems that it depends on your income as a percentage of your investment income which should grow in proportion to the whole over time   for example early stage of career not much investment income 20 mid career 5 mid late career moving to more safe investments 5 late career retirement 1 another way to calculate would be as a percentage of the amount you put into retirement savings per year   maybe 10 of this figure when you 're young and 1 nearer to retirement

as an easy way to answer look at an index let 's say the s&p 500   look at the price this last october and predict where it will move in november easy right   it already happened and you have the benefit of hindsight   the move looks like such a consistent obvious continuation of the previous up and down pattern   it looks predictable like you could have guessed that   now look at today 's price and predict where it will go next month   not so easy now   the problem is every point you 're at all the time looks like a possible inflection point or turning point   if you 're following an uptrend you may think it 'll continue but you may also think that it so far up already that now it 's ready for a down where you 'll buy   so you wait and it keeps rising and you kick yourself for missing out   next time you see another uptrend and resolve to buy it regardless thinking now it 'll keep going but it turns down the second you buy it and keeps dropping   you kick yourself again   the market is amazing at doing this to you every time   in real time every wiggle in the price looks simultaneously like a trend that could continue and like a trend that has moved far enough and is ready to reverse   and more likely you 'll guess the wrong one    the only way with some little hope of succeeding is to study study study and find and learn trading rules with just over 50/50 chances like buying when a moving average is touched within an uptrend as an example and setting a stop loss at -1 and a sell limit at + 2 or something and then never ever deviate from that strategy because your only hope is in the consistency of statistics and odds over time   you 'll get many -1 losses and hopefully enough 2 gains to compensate the losses plus some profit    or to make it easier just buy in on a dip and hold and hold and collect dividends and be content to match the market without effort

short answer if you bought the car as opposed to leasing it there is no one to turn it in to   the reality of cars and car loans is this the value of a car tends to fall rapidly the first couple of years then more slowly after that like it might lose $ 2000 the first year $ 1000 the second $ 500 the third etc what you owe on a loan falls slowly at first because a lot of your payment is going to interest but then as time goes on you pay off the loan faster and faster so you may pay off $ 1000 the first year $ 1100 the second etc i 'm just making up numbers depends on the value of the car and the term and interest rate of the loan but that 's the general idea combining these two things means that in the first few years after you buy a car if you had a small or no down payment you might well owe more on the car than it is worth that 's just how the numbers work out if you keep the car long enough eventually you hit a point where it is worth more than you owe keep it until you 've paid off the loan and you owe $ 0 but the car is still worth something exactly how much depending on its condition and other factors if you just use the car and pay off the loan i.e. if you do n't sell the car or refinance the loan or some such then this does n't matter very much you make your loan payments and you have use of the car what difference does the book value of the car at any given moment matter to you if the idea of owing more than the car is worth bothers you in principle then in the future you could make a larger down payment or make extra payments on the loan the first couple of years to knock the principle down faster that 's about the only things you can do well you could buy with cash so you owe zero and the car is always worth more than you owe but given that you are where you are if you just keep the car and keep driving it and keep paying the loan then you are exactly where you thought you would be when you bought the car right i mean the day you bought the car you presumably were n't thinking that at some future date you could refinance at a lower rate how would you know so i think the easy answer is do n't sweat it just enjoy the car and pay your bills

closed accounts are used when calculating average age of accounts aaoa by fico they will drop off your report 7 years after their closure at which time your aaoa will decrease and most likely lower your credit score keeping your oldest card with an annual fee af is a tough question since the exact calculations are a secret it 's hard to quantify the value of that card keep in mind that if you do decide to close it now or right before the next af it will continue to count for the next 7 years what you can do is the following assume you wo n't be applying for any new cards in the next 7 years look at all your current accounts and calculate the aaoa of all of them that would still be on your report 7 years from now calculate it with and without your oldest card the difference will show you the effect closing the card today will have there is a potential way to raise your aaoa depending on if you have an amex card amex reports all accounts as being open from your original member since date if your oldest amex ever not necessarily still open is older than your aaoa opening a new amex will actually raise your average   age of accounts is 15 of your score note that some websites that calculate your aaoa for you like creditkarma do n't count closed accounts but since fico does the age those websites generate should be ignored

you said your strategy was to put it into a index fund   but then you asked about setting   stock limits    i 'm confused funds usually trade at their price at the end of the day so you should n't try to time this at all just place your order if you are buying etfs there is going to be so much volume on the market that your small trade is going to have no impact on the price you should just place a market order a market order is an order to buy or    sell a stock at the current market    price a limit order is an order to buy or    sell a security at a specific price in the us when you place a trade with any broker you can either place a limit order or a market order   a market order just fills your order with the next best sellers in line   if you place an order for 100 shares the sellers willing to sell 100 shares at the lowest price will be matched with your order sometimes you may get 50 shares at one price and 50 shares at a slightly different price     if your stock has a lot of volatility and you place a market order for a small amount of shares   you will get the best price if you place a limit order you specify the price at which you want to buy shares   your order will then only be filled with sellers willing to sell at that price or lower i.e. they must be at least as good as you specified   this means you could place an order at a limit that does not get filled the stock could move in a direction away from your limit price   if you really want to own the stock you should n't use a limit order   you should n't only use a limit order if you want to tell your broker i will only buy this stock at this price or better   p.s every day that passes is not a waste   it 's just a day that you 've decided investing in cash is safer than investing in the market

always use limit orders never market orders period do that and you will always pay what you said you would when the transaction goes through whichever broker you use is not going to negotiate for the best price on your trade if you choose a market order   their job is to fill that order so they will always buy it for more than market and sell it for less to ensure the order goes through it is not even a factor when choosing between tradeking and scottrade i use trade king and my friend uses   besides the transaction fee tk is a few $ $ cheaper the only other things to consider are the tools and research and customer service if you need it that each site offers i went with tk and the lower transaction fee since tools and research can be had from other sources i basically only use it when i want to make a trade since i do n't find the tools particularly useful and i never take an analyst 's opinion of a stock at face value anyway since everybody always has their own agenda

i do n't think investing in only one industry which you may know well is very wise you may want to invest in that industry but you should not restrict yourself from investing solely in that industry   there are many times when your chosen industry may not be performing very well and other industries are performing much better if you restrict yourself to just one industry you may be either out of the market for long periods of time or your portfolio may show negative returns for extended periods of time you may want to know an industry or a number of companies very well but do not fall in love with them the worst thing you can do is get emotional about an investment an investment is there to make you money not for you to get emotional about do n't restrict yourself instead look to maximise your returns with investments that are performing better at the time

following 's advice i am posting this as an answer so it stands apart from the question but all the credit goes to whose instructions i followed i was able to get this collection completely deleted removed from the 2 bureaus that were reporting it using only the online dispute process of course your mileage may vary but here 's some more details that may be helpful to others equifax success 3 weeks after disputing the collection using the online dispute process and uploading my scanned final account statement to show that i paid the apartment complex i received an email confirmation that it is deleted i had to go to a webpage to get the actual result transunion success although i never heard back from tu my creditkarma account now shows that the collection is no longer on my tu report either i am not sure if this is because equifax deleted it and tu just followed suit or if tu did their own investigation ideas comments could help others their online dispute process out and did n't accept my upload so they would have had to contact the apartment complex so i was supposed to receive something by mail i still have n't but it 's definitely gone from my report experian it did n't show up on this report so i ca n't give any feedback i suppose it 's also worth noting that i did not ever have any contact with the collections agency i did visit the apartment office in person in order to get a copy of my final statement while there i spoke with the new manager who said she would try to reach up the chain of command to figure something out i 'm not sure how much difference if any this may have made as the complex is now owned by an entirely different company in fact the new manager had no idea who the old management company was much less which collections agency they used also worth noting removing the collection made my score rise from to i know because after getting the collection removed from my report i re applied for the auto loan i had been denied 3 weeks prior and they gave me my equifax score both times

you will be charged a stock borrow fee which is inversely related to the relative supply of the stock you are shorting ib claims to pay a rebate on the short proceeds which would offset part or all of that fee but it does n't appear relevant in your case because it is a bit strange to me that ib would not require you to keep the cash in your account as they need the cash to the stock borrow with the lending institution   in fact per t the short position requires an initial margin of 150 which includes the short proceeds as described by investopedia in the first table of figure 1 a short sale is initiated for 1,000    shares at a price of $ 50 the proceeds of the short sale are $ 50,000    and this amount is deposited into the short sale margin account along    with the proceeds of the sale an additional 50 margin amount of    $ 25,000 must be deposited in the account bringing the total margin    requirement to $ 75,000 at this time the proceeds of the short sale    must remain in the account they can not be removed or used to purchase    other securities here is a good answer to your question from the street even though you might see a balance in your brokerage account after    shorting a stock you 're actually looking at a false credit according    to one big brokerage firm that money is acting as collateral for the    short position so you wo n't have use of these funds for investment    purposes and wo n't earn interest on it and there are indeed costs associated with shorting a stock the    broker has to find stock to loan to you that might come out of a    broker 's own inventory or might be borrowed from another stock lender

almost any financial institution has the technical ability to do this simply called sweeps auto sweeps or deposit sweeps the issue you face is finding an institution that is willing to do it for you   i think you will have the most luck at your primary financial institution where you currently keep the majority of your banking relationship   you will have better luck at small town banks and credit unions   the mega banks will likely not from their established policies deposit sweeps are common for business accounts   they are usually tied to a savings account which is usually held within the same institution however this is not a requirement   the sweep can send money to any us bank if you can provide the routing number and account number   the sweep will establish a peg balance or floor balance on the checking account   at the end of the day any amount above the peg is swept into the savings account automatically i doubt you will find what you ’re asking for within an online banking system   you will likely have to go into a branch and speak with a personal banker   explain to them you want to establish a sweep on your checking account and want to send the funds to another financial institution   you will have better luck asking for a peg of $ 100 or some other small amount   they may not take your request seriously if you want to completely empty the checking account to zero

is this an employee stock purchase plan espp if so and there is no required holding period selling right away is essentially a guaranteed bonus with minimal risk one caveat is that sometimes it takes a while to actually receive the shares at your brokerage and in the meantime your company may have an earnings report that could cause the share price to drop if your discount is only 5 for example a bad earnings report could easily wipe that out the only other cons i can think of is espp contributions being withheld from you for months albeit for a virtually guaranteed return and it complicates your taxes a bit on the flip side another pro is that after you sell the shares you are more likely to invest that money rather than spend it

so if we rent it out we do n't want to just charge what we 're paying on our mortgage we 'd definitely be losing money if we did that i think you 're overlooking one thing your profit loss is not monthly your profit is the property that 's left after the mortgage ends even if you have to add extra $ 100 every month because you rent lower than the mortgage + maintenance + taxes after 30 years you 're left with property worth while you 've paid for it ie 30 years 12 months $ 100 = $ 36k you can rent it lower than your costs and still make a profit in the long run

do all most unit trusts have policy it is really that some value of the fund is given to the investor so the fund value goes down by that much per unit it depends on the type of mutual funds for example there are growth type mutual funds that do not give any dividend and the total value of the fund is reflected in its price do the companies whose stocks we owned directly apply policy on their dividends as well why not as far a stock price is concerned it usually decrease by the same amount of the dividend payout at ex date so in effect the market in a way does the equalization the company directly does not do it

all fair points and i agree that there is no silver bullet perhaps it 's human nature maybe a product of our ideologies whatever but i think you hit it on the head when you said that people treat their agenda as a perfect solution when in reality there is no such thing automation will kill jobs livable wage is variable not everyone fits a uniform mold and conversely not every business operates the same some are completely profit driven others are more conscious of their societal obligations regardless of legal requirement so all businesses into the same obligations seems like a losing battle as well if the long term data backs up the finding that higher minimum wages kill jobs at a disproportionate rate when accounting for factors like automation then the evidence should be conversely i do believe that we will reach a point possibly even in this lifetime where so much automation exists there will be fewer and fewer opportunities to get your foot in the door or things of that nature and a universal basic income will be needed how that is paid for what the societal and social implications are those are questions for another day but that day is also fast approaching

while you want it to grow faster than inflation there are things like i bonds that can carry some inflation protection with them for an idea that may make sense for part of this there are now some more details and i 'd think this seems alright initially though i would suggest considering having some kind of on going plan to handle periodically seeing how much more to invest here and what kind of taxes will this generate for you as taxable accounts can carry a mix of dividends interest and capital gains that you may have to pay even though you did n't see the gain yourself keep in mind that if you do go with a big name investment bank this could well add more fees as well as other stuff   lehman brothers was a big name investment bank once upon a time and they went broke   while you may want to be hands off i 'd still suggest having some kind of timeline for how often are your investments to be reviewed and things re allocated   each quarter semi annually or annual   there is n't so much a right or wrong answer here as much as i 'd point out that one should be aware of the trade offs in each case   if you take annual and wonder each week how it is doing then something a bit more frequent may make sense   on the other hand some people may well set it and forget it which can work as long as there is something to know about where to go if something does go broke   as these are managed investments the sipc check i 'd make may not hold though this would be the equivalent of fdic for deposits when dealing with securities the reit can be useful for diversification sure   you do realize that there may be some interesting taxes for you in the next few years given the nature of a reit investment right   the return of capital that a reit may pass through as a reit to maintain its tax status must distribute 90 of its net income each year that can be quite a off shoot of funds   where would those proceeds be invested   this is n't mentioned in your post and thus i 'm curious as if the reit passes out a dividend yield of say 5 then this is $ that could go somewhere

p e is the number of years it would take for the company to earn its share price   you take share price divided by annual earnings per share   you can take the current reported quarterly earnings per share times 4 you can take the sum of the past four actual quarters earnings per share or you can take some projected earnings per share it has little to do with a company 's actual finances apart from the earnings per share   it does n't say much about the health of a company 's balance sheet and is definitely not an indicator for bankruptcy   it 's mostly a measure of the market 's assumptions of the company 's ability to grow earnings or maintain it 's current earnings growth    a share price of $ 40 trading for a p e ratio of 10 means it will take the company 10 years to earn $ 40 per share it means there 's current annual earnings per share of $ 4   a different company may also be earning $ 4 per share but trade at 100 times earnings for a share price of $ 400   by this measure alone neither company is more or less healthy than the other   one just commands more faith in the future growth from the market to circle back to your question regarding a negative p e a negative p e ratio means the company is reporting negative earnings running at a loss   again this may or may not indicate an imminent bankruptcy   increasing balance sheet debt with decreasing revenue and or earnings and or balance sheet assets will be a better way to assess bankruptcy risk

it depends on what you 're talking about if this is for your retirement accounts like iras then absolutely not in your retirement accounts you should be broadly diversified not just between stocks but also other markets like bonds target retirement funds and solid conservative or moderate allocation funds are the best quick and dirty recommendation for those accounts since it 's for the long haul you want to be managing risk not chasing returns returns will happen over the 40 or so years they have to grow   now if you 're talking about a taxable stock account and you 've gotten past pf questions like am i saving enough for retirement and have i paid off my debt then the question becomes a little more murky   first yes you should be diversified the bulk of how a stock 's movement will be in keeping with how its sector moves so even a really great stock can get if its sector is going down diversification between several sectors will help balance that   however you will have some advantage in this sector knowing which products are good which products everybody in the industry is excited about is a huge advantage over other investors it 'll help you pick the ones that go up more when the sector goes up and down less when the sector goes down that over time and investments really adds up just remember that a good company and a good stock investment are not the same thing a great company can have a sky high valuation and if you buy it at that price you can sit there and watch your investment sink even as the company is growing and doing great things have patience know which companies are good and which are bad and wait for the price to come to you   one final note it also depends on what spot you are in if you 're a young guy looking looking to invest his first few thousand in the market then go for it on the other hand if you 're older and we 're talking about a couple hundred grand you 've got saved up then it 's a whole different ball of wax it that spot you 're back to managing risk and need to build a solid portfolio at a measured pace

i do n't see why an online only bank would need to do anything more against fraud than a bank that also has brick and mortars in the contrary they would need less physical security as they do n't have to protect cash lock boxes and other physical assets all banks nowadays have an online business so they all have the same online fraud risks and they all need the same level of protection

yes if you can split your income up over multiple years it will be to your advantage over earning it all in one year   the reasons are as you mentioned you get to apply multiple deductions credits exemptions to the same income rather than just 1 standard deduction you get to deduct 2 standard deductions you can double the max saved in an ira you benefit more from any non refundable credits etc this is partly due to the fact that when you are filing your taxes in year 1 you ca n't include anything from year 2 since it has n't happened yet it does n't make sense for the government to take into account actions that may or may not happen when calculating your tax bill there are factors where other year profit loss can affect your tax liability however as far as i know these are limited to businesses look into loss carry forwarded back if you want to know more regarding the 30 simple rate i think you are confusing something that is simple to say with something that is simple to implement   are we going to go change the rules on people who expected their mortgage deduction to continue there are few ways i can think of that are more sure to cause home prices to plummet than to eliminate the mortgage interest deduction what about removing student loan interest under a 30 simple rate what tools would the government use to encourage trade in specific areas will state income tax deduction also be removed this is going to punish those in a state with a high income tax more than those in states without income tax those are all just common deductions that affect a lot of people you could easily say no to all of them and just piss off a bunch of people but what about selling stock though i paid $ 100 for the stock and i sold it for $ 120 do i need to pay $ 36 tax on that because it is a simple 30 tax rate or are we allowing the cost of goods sold deduction it 's called something else i believe when talking about stocks but it 's the same idea what about if i travel for work to tutor individuals can i deduct my mileage expenses do i need to pay 30 income tax on my earnings and principal from a roth ira a lot of people have contributed to a roth with the understanding that withdrawals will be tax free changing those rules are punishing people for using vehicles intentionally created by the government are we going to go around and dismantle all non profits that entirely on tax deductible donations do i need to pay taxes on the employer 's cost of my health insurance what about 401k 's and ira 's being true to a simple 30 tax will eliminate all benefits from every job as you would need to pay taxes on the value of the benefits i should mention that this is n't exactly too crazy there was a relatively recent irs publication about businesses needing to withhold taxes from their employees for the cost of company supplied food but i do n't know if it was ultimately accepted at the end of the day the concept of simplifying the tax law is n't without merit but realize that the complexities of tax law are there due to the complexities of life the vast majority of tax laws were written for a reason other than to benefit special interests and for that reason they can not easily be ignored

how to break 90 golf is a lifelong pursuit that will always challenge may entertain and will almost certainly at times   for most players golf scores similar to those consistently seen from our favorite pros may be unattainable   a more reasonable goal for most is to find a way first to routinely break 90 but how do you get there   a few regular adjustments will provide the best opportunities to do so pre shot routine every needs a pre shot routine that happens every time you approach the ball for example during practice always visualize a target plan your shot and try to see the outcome take one or two practice swings to get a feel for the stroke before you step to the ball the key to this is consistency if it happens every time you can begin to take the guesswork out of your game golf    practice more than you play do n’t try to fix your mistakes on the back nine when you are on the course you should n’t be thinking about how to correct your stroke grip stance etc in fact if you ’ve done the work off the course you should n’t have to think about much at all trust your muscle memory to do what you have practiced   practice the minimum to perfect any physical skill it is important to focus on the smallest amount of information possible at one time you can not simultaneously pay attention to the plane of your stroke while thinking about the weight on your left foot and refining your grip try to pick one small thing to focus on at one time and work it into your muscle memory practicing the minimum will allow you to stop thinking about each factor of the game while on the course again the goal of this process is to make your motions automatic and fluid   care less   it may seem counterintuitive but when you step onto the golf course the more invested you are in each shot the less you can rely on the hard work you have put into your game during practice do the work on the driving range so that you do n’t need to worry about it when you need it http://www

where are you getting the idea that i think there is any altruism whatsoever in what whole foods does you are missing the point entirely let me make it perfectly clear they are selling me what i personally want and selling it to me in the way i personally want it     every single grocery store is consumerist i 've been shopping at whole foods for almost 30 years and the reason is because whole foods has put its research into discovering what and how to serve me and then delivering the experience of shopping in a safeway 's or the like is ugly uncomfortable cold and smelly they are too big and take forever to get from one item i want to another they are filled with junk they are trying to trick me into thinking is nutritious    what makes you think whole foods is in any way more deceptive than walmart publix costco etc because they responded to a market that wanted quality food that could be traced back to it 's source why would n't they respond to that    it is a myth that wf is selling only luxury food and drink items i can go into a wf and see local produce what is so extravagant about that   gt;do you ever wonder if maybe that passion is appealed to and marketer towards by businesses   i 'm thrilled that it is that means i can access food that i want and enjoy and it costs less than it would otherwise i can buy sugar free bacon at whole foods yay i feel great about that i ca n't get that at safeway     do you think commercial food producers and other grocery outlets do n't collectively far whole foods to promote less nutritious food that is as inexpensive as possible to produce that they do n't sacrifice quality for profits     where do you live that commercial grocery chains are somehow operating from the goodness of their hearts tell yourself whatever you want but if you have the impression that wf has somehow fooling me thanks for your concern but i 'm good i love that they figured out what i want to eat and how i want to shop for it

there are multiple reasons why this may have happened 1 i could n't tell in your question whether or not you had already paid off the loan before requesting the rollover but if the loan was defaulted then the $ 9k left in your account is not but is there to pay back the remaining balance on your loan the $ 9k will be treated as income and will be taxed you will receive   a 1099-r detailing the taxes you 'll owe i do n't know why this was n't done when they did your rollover distribution typically it all happens at the same time but it can vary depending on the administrator 2 do you get some type of safe harbor discretionary match or profit sharing contribution if so perhaps this contribution was made after your account was liquidated so now there is residual money in your account and it is treated as a new distribution which incurs a new $ 60 distribution fee 3 stock if some of your investments were in stock these take a few extra days to liquidate typically a tpa recordkeeper would wait until all of the funds are liquidated before issuing the rollover but some companies may be shady and do it separately incurring an additional $ 60 distribution fee if this was the case i would go to your former employer 's hr and tell them what s happening and to start looking for a new 401(k administrator i hope this helps good luck

the short answer is the annualised volatility over twenty years should be pretty much the same as the annualised volatility over five years for independent identically distributed returns the volatility scales proportionally so for any number of monthly returns t setting the factor m = 12 the volatility   it should be the same for all time scales   however note the discussion here scaling volatility like this only is mathematically correct when the    underlying price model is driven by geometric brownian motion which    implies that prices are log normally distributed and returns are    normally distributed particularly the comment its a well known fact that volatility is overestimated when scaled over long periods of time without a change of model to estimate such long term volatility now a demonstration   i have modelled 12,000 monthly returns with mean = 3 and standard deviation = 2 so the annualised volatility should be 2 =    calculating annualised volatility for return of various lengths 3 6 12 60 months etc reveals an for shorter   the five year sequence average got closest to the theoretically expected figure and as the commenter noted volatility is slightly overestimated when scaled over long periods of time annualised volatility for varying return sequence lengths   edit re comment reinvesting returns does not affect the volatility much   for instance comparing some data i have handy the dow jones industrial average capital returns cr versus net returns nr   the return differences are somewhat 0.1 each month 0.25 every third month   more erratic dividend reinvestment would increase the volatility

gt i believe transparency when it comes to our food is important    totally agreed here 's my amateur solution   all food companies are required to have the answers to a set of questions available via email or website phone or standard mail those questions are determined by a combination of independent panel and consumer polling what those questions are may change over time allowing for a reasonably generous grace period for the companies to prepare   for example if consumers really have to know what gm ingredients are in their food for whatever asinine reasons then fine require the company to answer if consumers really want to know what color shoes the workers wear then so be it   i also think we need a series of third party organizations rather than the usda organic system we have what 's acceptable and what is n't is super arguable and rather than just taking the standard that exists which imo is not meaningful folks can choose which standard they wish to head combined with the mandated transparency above this would lower costs by removing the need for active investigation and lead to more informed decision making on the part of the consumers

one potentially useful option to avoid the crippling tuition fees in the states is to instead get your degree abroad numerous european countries have very low tuition fees even for international students tuition can be as low as a 1000 eur and housing is generally also very affordable there is of course the language barrier but many universities are oriented towards receiving international students providing relocation assistance and offering courses in english as a bonus most europeans speak excellent english and are generally quite happy to practice it so you should n't have any problems off campus either going to the uk is an option but likely considerably more expensive than colleges in mainland europe this article while written for a nigerian audience lists some of the most attractive options for the international student the quality of the education is also generally very high for these colleges as an example belgium one of the cheapest options in the list has two universities ranked in the top 100 and many other german french dutch or universities figure in that list

this may vary some by the state but the general facts are consistent broadly the elements of check fraud typically are this means that not only do you have to have presented a check that is returned for insufficient funds but you must have known at the time that it would n't be honored    it must typically also be given for present consideration which is why the comments to the other answer correctly note that the post dated check scam cooked up by the payday loan folks should n't generally be relevant under these laws on the same site they note the cases that are clearly not present consideration so if i give you a check for $ 50 and it 's returned for nsf because i screwed up my bank accounts and had all my money in savings that 's probably not fraud   but if i decide i really want a tesla x and give tesla motors a check for $ 95,000 knowing i do n't have $ 95,000 that 's fraud how the prosecutor proves knowledge is probably beyond the scope of personal finance and money stack exchange though i imagine it tends to commonly be done so by showing the person does n't normally have that much money in their account

just like pete for me a simple budget is good my budget is probably more complicated than some but for medical expenses i only have one budget item titled medical   however if you 've already been breaking it out further than that and you are happy with it there is no need to change now   something you can do is to separate your budget categories from your money accounts here 's what i mean let 's say that last year at this time before the fsa you had $ 500 total allocated to your various medical budget categories this year you can do the same the only difference is that $ 300 of that just happens to be in your fsa and $ 200 is in whatever account you kept your medical money in last year then when you have your next medical expense you 'll subtract it from one of your medical budget categories which tells you how much you have left to spend on medical expenses and you 'll also subtract it from whichever account you actually spent the money so you know your current account balances you 'll want to spend your fsa money first since it 's use it or lose it if that seems like a lot of work a good budgeting software program such as ynab everydollar or mvelopes will do most of the accounting for you separating your budget category balances from your bank balances they allow you to split up your money without having to worry about which account you are paying from

as per chad 's request i recommend that you keep at least one card in each name   as primary card holder with the spouse being the secondary   card holder most easily done by each adding the spouse as the secondary holder to his her own card since credit reporting is usually in the name of the primary credit card holder this allows both to continue to have credit history important when the marriage ends in death or divorce as the case may be when you travel each should carry only the   cards on which he she is the primary card holder not all   cards this helps in case of a wallet or purse being stolen   you have to report only one set of cards as lost and request   their replacement and you have a set of cards that you can   use in the mean time as long as you are not in different   places when the loss occurs

great topic as interest rate swaps are one of the most commonly used derivatives by bank in the simplest form an interest rate swap is an exchange of payments between two parties    say party a has a $ 100 loan with a fixed 4.25 interest rate and party b also has a $ 100 loan with a variable rate lets say prime plus 1 prime is 3.25 so b is also paying 4.25    party a thinks interest rates are going to go lower and wants to lower his interest expense while party b is a small company and does n't want to be exposed to variable interest rates and needs to have a steady cash flow to project his budget   party a and b agree to enter into an interest rate swap for a notional amount of $ 100 where party a agree to pay b prime plus 1 fixed for floating and party b agrees to pay a 4.25 floating for fixed for some period of time they agree upon usually the maturity of the loan   now from the start the swap has a market value of $ 0 since a and b both receive the same as they are paying as interest rates move the value of the swap moves say interest rates fall and prime is now 2 b still pays 4.25 to a he agreed to pay a fixed 4.25 no matter what and a only pays 3 prime plus 1 to b. remember the terms of the individuals loans did not change so a owes $ 4.25 to his bank and b owes $ 3 to his bank party a uses the $ 4.25 from b to pay his bank and pays $ 3 to b. party a has lowered his interest expense by $ 1.25 and his position is considered in the money which means he is benefitting from the transaction party b gets $ 3 from a but still owes his bank $ 4.25 in reality the transaction nets out to b paying a $ 1.25 rather than both a and b paying each other different amounts b is out of the money because in aggregate he is paying a. the market value of the swap would be the present value of that $ 1.25 benefit a receives discounted using expected future interest rates the same number but negative is the value to b   please ask if you have additional questions or need

jurisdictions will vary but i can imagine calculation methods for child support where the raise could become significant in the present with long future ramifications as well even if the job is temporary or the parent wanted to step away from working full time to attend school the timing of the raise might coincide with disclosure of income to an ex spouse or to the court related and it might be preferable to postpone the increase of course the court would probably frown on declining the raise for only these reasons if it found out it might the higher income anyway and i 'm not suggesting that people dodge responsibility for their kids we 've all seen those cases where child support is not particularly equitable between the two parties and/or the kids do not necessarily benefit by the transfer of money i would n't blame a parent for and considering this type of second order effect and consulting an attorney as with so many other financial implications of divorce regardless of personal moral objections it 's certainly an answer to the question in technical terms that somebody somewhere has taken into account

an order is your command to the broker to say sell 100 shares of aapl an executed order or partially executed order is when all or some of that command is successfully completed a transaction is an actual exchange of shares for money and there may be one or more transactions per executed order   for example the broker might perform all of the following 5 transactions in order to do what you asked on the other hand if the broker can not execute your order then 0 transactions have taken place the fee schedule you quote is saying that no matter how many transactions the broker has to perform in order to fill your order and no matter what the share prices are they 're only going to charge you $ 0.005 per share $ 0.50 in this example of 100 shares subject to certain limits however as it says at the top of the page you linked our fixed pricing for stocks etfs exchange traded products or and warrants charges a fixed amount per share or a set percent of trade value and includes all ib commissions exchange and most regulatory fees with the exception of the transaction fees which are passed through on all stock sales certain transaction fees are passed through to the client   the transaction fee you included above is the sec fee on sales   many but not all transaction fees do depend on the prices of the shares involved as a result they can not be called fixed fees for example if you sell 100 shares of aapl at $ 150 each but if you sell 100 shares of amzn at $ each so the broker will charge you the same $ 0.50 on either of those orders but the sec will charge you more for the expensive amzn shares than for the cheaper aapl shares the reason this specific sec fee mentions aggregate sales rather than trade value is because this particular sec fee applies only to the seller and not to the buyer   so they could have written aggregate trade value but they probably wanted to highlight to the reader that the fee is only charged on sells

for what it 's worth the distribution i 'm currently using is roughly with about 2/3 of the money sitting in my 401(k i should note that this is actually considered a moderately aggressive position i need to phone my advisor not a broker so they are n't biased toward things which are more profitable for them and check whether i 've gotten close enough to retirement that i should readjust those numbers could i do better maybe at higher risk and higher fees that would be likely to eat most of the improved returns or by spending far more time micromanaging my money than i have any interest in i 've validated this distribution using the various stochastic models and it seems to work well enough that i 'm generally content with it as i noted in a comment elsewhere many of us will want to get up into this range before we retire i figure that if i hit $ 1.8 m i can probably sustain my lifestyle solely on the income despite expected inflation and thus be safely covered for life so this is n't all that huge a chunk of cash by today 's standards cue duck i 'm rich i 'm wealthy i 'm comfortably well off $ 2 m these days is comfortably well off

to supplement existing answers the appraised value does not necessarily represent the net amount the bank could actually recover with a foreclosure let 's look at it from the point of view of the bank   suppose the property appraises at $ 200,000 and they do what you want loan you $ 200,000 with the property as collateral   now suppose a short time later you quit paying the mortgage and they have to foreclose   can the bank get their $ 200,000 back an appraisal is only an estimate nobody can predict perfectly how much a property will sell for   maybe the appraiser missed something significant and the property will only fetch $ 180,000 even if the appraisal was accurate when it was made property values may have dropped in the meantime   maybe a sudden economic crisis is driving real estate prices down across the board   maybe interest rates have spiked   maybe the county has changed the zoning regulations to locate a toxic waste dump next door to the property   in any of these cases the property may again fetch well under $ 200,000 maybe the condition of the property has changed   perhaps you trashed the place and it will take $ 30,000 to clean it up   people have a tendency to do things like that when they get foreclosed if the bank wants to get full market value for the property they will incur the usual costs of selling a property paying a real estate agent 's commission painting renting furniture to stage the property and so on   this will eat into the net amount they actually get from the sale it may take some time perhaps months for a property to sell at its full market value   during this time the bank is out $ 200,000   that 's money they would rather be loaning out at interest to someone else so this represents lost income foreclosing a mortgage is a fairly complicated procedure   the bank has to pay its staff including lawyers for a significant number of hours to get the foreclosure done   there will be court filing fees and so on   if you refuse to leave they may have to get the sheriff to evict you that has a fee as well   if you fight the foreclosure that racks up even more legal fees   this too eats into the net proceeds from the sale so if the bank loans you the full $ 200,000 they stand a pretty significant risk of not getting all of it back after expenses   you can understand that risk may not be worth the interest they would get from you on the extra $ 40,000 on the other hand if they loan you only 80 of the property 's appraised value $ 160,000 they effectively shift that risk onto you   should you default on the loan and they foreclose all they have to do is sell the property for $ 160,000 or a little bit more    that should n't be too hard even if it is not freshly painted or a bit trashed   they probably do n't need to hire a real estate agent just hold a quick auction maybe first calling up a few investors who might be interested in flipping it   if it happens to sell for more than the outstanding principal of the loan plus the bank 's costs then they will pay you the difference but they have no incentive to make that happen and every incentive to just get it sold quick   so any difference between the property 's true value and the actual sale price now represents a loss to you first not to the bank so you can see why the bank would rather not loan you the full value of the property   80 is a somewhat arbitrary figure but it cuts their risk by a lot

1 yes in theory that is right minus any state taxes as well        2 they could since there is an unknown amount outside of the us and probably it will be a percentage and not all most of these companies that make a difference are already international companies        3 they would most likely still do it for any money kept offshore and it does n't prevent them from continuing to do it again i did n't say this was a good solution they are just hoping to ward off economic collapse a little longer by doing this or perhaps hire more accountants to be able to look at their books to figure out how much they are hiding to punish them there could be many motivations for doing this tax but i doubt any of the motivations intend to stop it from continuing to happen after the tax the problem is any company that takes advantage of it basically says yes i broke the law in this amount thus it might be a good way to get a list of companies to audit more thoroughly

how often do investors really lose money all the time and it 's almost always reason number 1 let 's start with the beginner investor the person most likely to make some real losses and feel they 've learned that investing is no better than vegas this person typically gets into it because they 've been given a hot stock tip or because they 've received a windfall decided to give this investing a try and bought stock in half a dozen companies whose names they know from their everyday lives i own a bit of google how cool is that these are people who do n't understand the cyclic nature of the market bear gives way to bull gives way to bear and on and on and so when they suddenly see that what was $ 1000 is now $ 900 they panic and sell everything especially as all the pundits are declaring the end of the world they always do until the moment they sold they only had paper losses but they those losses made them real and ended at a loss then there 's the trend follower these are people who do n't necessarily hit a bear market or even a downturn in their early days but never really try to learn how the market works in any real sense they jump into every hot stock then panic and sell out of anything that starts to go the wrong way both of these reactive behaviours seem reasonable in the moment it 's gone up 15 in the past week buy buy buy and i 've lost 10 this month on that thing get rid of it before i lose any more but they work out over time to lots of buying high and selling low the very opposite of what you want to do then there 's the day trader these are people who sit in their home office buying and selling all day to try and make lots of little gains that add up to a lot the reason these people do n't do well in the long run is slightly different to the other examples first fees yes most platforms offer a discount for frequent traders but it still ai n't free second they 're playing in the big leagues of course there are exceptions who make out like bandits but day traders are playing a different game than the people i 'd call investors that game unlike buy and hold investing is much more like gambling and day traders are the enthusiastic amateurs sitting down at a table with professional poker players institutional investors and the computers and research departments that work for them even buy and hold investors even the more sophisticated ones can easily realise losses on a given stock you say you should just hold on to a stock until it goes back up but if it goes low enough it could take a decade or more to even just break even again more savvy stock pickers will have a system worked out something like ok if it gets down to 90 of what i bought it for i cut my losses and sell this is actually a sensible precaution because defining hard rules like that you eliminate emotion from your investing which is incredibly important if you want to avoid becoming the trend follower above it 's still a loss but it 's a calculated one and hopefully over time the exception rather than the rule there are probably as many other ways to lose money as there are people investing but i think i 've given you a taste the key to avoiding such things is understanding the psychology of investing and defining the rules that you 'll follow no matter what as in that last example or just go learn about index investing that 's what i did

from the perspective of an investor and someone in high tech during that period here is my take   a few high tech companies had made it big apple microsoft dell and a lot of people were sitting around the fact that we all should have realized that computers were going to be huge and invested early in those companies we all convinced ourselves that we knew it was going to happen whether we did or not but for some reason we did n't put our money where our mouth was and now we were because we could be millionaires already in the meantime the whole internet thing transitioned from being something that only nerds and academics used to a new paradigm for computing many of us reasoned that we were n't going to be suckers twice and this time we were getting on that boat before it left for money land   so it became fashionable to invest in internet stocks everyone was doing it it was guaranteed to come up in any conversation at parties or with friends at work so with all this investment money out there for the internet 's next big thing naturally lots of companies popped up to take advantage of the easy money it got to the point where brokers and venture capital firms were beating the looking for companies to throw money at and often they did n't scrutinize these company 's business plans very well and/or bought into insane growth projections frankly most of the business plans amounted to we may not make any money off our users but if we get enough people to sign up that has to be valuable right   problem 2 was that most of these companies were n't run by proven business types but that did n't matter it worked for those rag tag kids at google apple and microsoft right well business types who know how to build a sustainable business model are so in the new internet economy   also the implicit agenda of most of these new entrepreneurs is 1 get enough funding to make the company big enough go public while keeping enough equity to get rich when it does 2 buy a ferrari 3 repeat with another company    now these investors were n't stupid they knew what was going on and that most of these internet companies were n't going to be around in a decade everyone was just playing the momentum and planned to get out when they saw the signal that the whole house of cards was going to fall at the time we always talked about the fact that these investments were totally playing with monopoly money but it was addictive during the peak at least on paper my brokerage account was earning more money for me than my day job   the problem was that it was all kind of a pyramid scheme these dot com companies needed a continual supply of new investment because most of them were operating at a loss and some did n't even have a mechanism to make a profit at all at least not a realistic one a buddy of mine for example worked for an ipo bound company that made a freaking web based contact management system they did n't charge yet but they would one day turn on the meter and all of those thousands of customers who signed up for a free account would naturally start paying for something the company was actively devaluing by giving it away for free this company raised more than $ 100 m in venture capital   so eventually it started to get harder for these companies to continue to raise new money to pay operational costs without showing some kind of roi that is the tried and true model for valuing a company started to back in and these companies had to admit that the ceo had no clothes so without money to continue paying for expensive developers and marketing these companies started to go under when a few of the big names tumbled everyone saw that as the signal and it was a race to the bank the rest is history

i personally found the for dummies books on property investment very helpful and a great primer i found them unbiased and very informative laying out the basic principles depending on your knowledge it can provide you with enough of a foundation to have an informed conversation with banks real estates etc   watch the markets for a while at least 6 months to know what prices vendors will be expecting and rents tenants will be expecting most property magazines will also contain a suburb summary in the back   when you get closer to purchase make sure to ask your bank for the rp data reports on the properties you are looking at the banks will typically provide these for free i also set out some points for myself which i made clear for myself at the beginning this might provide a good starting point and really narrow down your research options as generic research on property investment can be overwhelming i ended up with a 3 in western sydney that has so far happily paid for itself building a good relationship with real estate agents and attending lots of open homes auctions and talking to other investors can only help   i was once told if you attend free property investment seminars you will always learn at least one new thing be it statistics methodologies finance options etc with that in mind always keep a level head leave your wallet at home and do n't sign up to anything   at the end of the day keep a cool head do n't stop reading and rush nothing

life strategy funds are more appropriate if you want to maintain a specific allocation between stocks and bonds that does n't automatically adjustment like the target retirement funds which have a specific date   thus it may make more sense to take whichever life strategy fund seems the most appropriate and ride with it for a while unless you know when you plan to retire and access those funds in theory you could use vanguard 's total market funds i.e total stock market total international and total bond and have your own allocations between stocks and bonds be managed pretty easily and do n't forget that the fees can come in a couple of flavors as betterment does n't specify where the transaction fees for buying the etfs are coming out just as something to consider

what   your reasoning is exactly what you are projecting on me   you want to give the few people with all the money control over anything they can buy   gt;at the very least the private sector is by the government according to the rule of law who polices the government when the people no longer have any authority or power over it   you just told me you ca n’t trust the government to police properly   now you want to rely on them policing others   does n’t that logic sound ridiculous   what i said was the government ’s job is policing   if they are doing their job wrong you replace them   what you are saying is   i do n’t trust the government to police anyone   so let ’s give more power to the financial sector which we already know is immoral and greedy because the government is policing them   wtf

it 's important to consider your investor profile when deciding the right kind of vehicle for your finances you are a young guy with a considerable earned income and no dependents sorry this was not clear from the question this means that you are able to take a lot of risks that people who also have a family to think about might not = = high risk tolerance you should definitely not put your money in a wealth management fund or mutual fund or any other hands off vehicle these typically have worse returns than the ftse itself their popularity is due to an amazing marketing job and the fact that people in general want to believe there is an easy way to grow their money probably the best vehicle for your money is property so the first thing you should do with the money is hire a competent accountant and solicitor

from personal experience of having been abroad for a while for work i found the simplest method to be to paypal it to myself from one country to the other yes you incur a transaction fee but it was always less expensive than real bank fees for me also if you use a bank that has offices in both countries adding an authorized user with a debit card and having them visit the bank every x often and making a withdrawal is a viable route

i think practically although we most surely will have real estate bubbles nothing will hit 2008 style panic for a long time as the banks are now not nearly as leveraged as they were back then all large banks passed the feds stress test this year for the first time housing prices may drop a bit and that correction may dip the market or vice versa but there will be much less damage to the economy

the sec reference document pdf explains order types in more detail a fill or kill order is neither a market order nor a limit order instead it 's something in between a market order asks to be filled at the best available price whatever that price might be when the order gets to the exchange   additionally if there are not enough counterparties to fill the order at the best available price then part of the order may be filled at a worse price   this all happens more or less immediately there 's no way to cancel it once it has been placed a limit order asks to be filled at a particular price and if no counterparties want to trade at that price right now then the order will just sit around all day waiting for someone to agree on the price it can be canceled at any time a fill or kill order asks to be filled at a particular price like a limit order but if that price or a better one is not currently available then the order is immediately canceled   it does not accept a worse price the way a market order does nor does it sit around waiting the way a limit order does   since the exchange computes whether to fill or kill the order as soon as it is arrives there 's also no way to cancel it like a market order

you can get a drive by appraisal or an assessment from a local real estate agent this obviously will give you a less precise and not as reliable information as a full appraisal but will be significantly cheaper

gt are you trying to say that all the above will not help the economy and employment   well let 's go point by point on this one   gt reducing regulation   you do know that monopolies and mega corporations are bad for consumers right over time bad for consumers --&gt bad for economy --&gt bad for companies employment that 's basic stuff   gt killing the   debatable at best depends on his ability to get a better deal from the fact that many countries have already tried to undercut on this could cause more issues with trade rather than fewer   gt killing nafta   see above   gt reducing immigration   well there 's actually pretty strong evidence that increased immigration has a net positive impact on an economy but you know scary mexicans or whatever   gt investing in infrastructure   i guess this depends on the type and cost of infrastructure if you 're talking about a giant wall plus the roads that would be required to be built just to get the equipment and materials out to the remote border locations in question only to have a questionable at best impact on illegal immigration the investment would be a gigantic waste i 'd be interested in seeing specifics about these alleged investments estimated costs and timeframes etc because i have serious doubts about the legitimacy of this claim   gt pulling out from wars syria   when was the last time bombing a foreign country was used as a strategy for pulling out of a war if he really were going to do such things it would be great but there 's no evidence that that 's happening anytime soon

i still can not food shop online for everything else it 's fine but for some reasons when it comes to food i just need to be able to wander around looking at the produce on offer and thinking about various dishes that could be made if someone can make an online browsing experience which is n't centered around you searching for things you want that would make a huge difference

the interest in your account is usually calculated based on the average monthly balance what the bank will do is try to figure out how much money did you have on average over the month and give you interest on that amount for example if you had 10k on deposit and took it out half way through the month you will still receive interest on about 5k based on a monthly rate what i would do is read in detail your agreement with the bank to figure out if your interest is based on an average annual balance and is paid at the end of the year or if it is based on a different measurement also i would be very careful if this is a cd account since they will have early withdrawal fees hope this helps

call your bank and inquire if they send out the kinds of notices like the one you received   do n't call the number in the message because if it is a scam you 're calling the scammers themselves more than likely be very cautious about this situation and if your bank is local then it might not hurt to pay a visit to a local branch to talk to someone in person   print out the you receive to show them and let their fraud division look into it
