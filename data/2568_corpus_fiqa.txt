i usually get a cashiers check to cover about 90 95 of the expected amount whatever i think is just below my wet dream price and bring the rest in cash that does n't require so much cash to be carried alternatively you can write a personal check for the exact reminder or go to the bank for the reminder after the deal is made with the majority already paid in a cashiers check nobody would disagree

you can pay with a cashiers check or personal check you can even pay cash or combine payment methods however in the usa if you give the dealership $ 10,000 or more in actual cash they will be required to fill out a form with the irs

i have in the last few years purchased several used cars from dealers they have handled it two different ways they accepted a small check now and then gave me three business days to bring the rest as a cashiers check they also insisted that i submit a application for credit in case i needed a loan   they accepted a personal check on the spot ask them before you drive to the dealer of course they would love you to get a loan from them

the very first time i bought a new car i wrote out a personal check for $ 5000 this was a time ago   and got a call from the sales person that he had called the bank and was told that i did not have that much money in my checking account   i explained that i had just that day transferred money from savings to checking   the sales person accepted that and there was never a problem after that

when you pay cash for a car you do n't always necessarily need to pay cash you just are n't using credit or a loan is all a few options you have are obviously no dealer expects anyone to just have the cash laying around for a car worth a few thousand dollars nor would you bother going to your bank or credit union for the cash you can simply get a cashier 's check made out for the amount note that dealers may not accept personal checks as they may bounce   after negotiations at the dealer you would explain you 're paying cash likely pay a deposit depending on the price of the car but $ 500 would probably be enough again the deposit can be a check or bank deposit and then come back later on with a cashier 's check or deposit into a bank account you would be able to do this later that day or within a few days but since you 've purchased a new car you would probably want to return asap
# 388798
you could write a personal check after the final price has been set and you 're ready to purchase another option would be to get the final price then walk over to your bank and get a cashier 's check

okay let me introduce you to a distinction that may help you as you go through life you can thank me later    the distinction is between prescription and description    what you get when you look in a dictionary or a reference source like wikipedia for a definition of a word or phrase is a descriptive example it 's a description of a common usage but not a limitation or restriction    you seem to have confused this descriptive resource with a such as a law against parking in a handicapped zone without plates that allow you to do so the latter is a hard fast rule that can not be altered and that seems to be what you think a dictionary or wikipedia represents that 's not what how it works you can go ahead and write a letter to jimmy wales yourself if you like but i 'm sure he 's on my side     besides which if you do n't like the phrase patent troll in reference to lego then i 'm happy to work with you and say instead they 're ugly thugs that abuse the patent system does that work out better for you    anyway glad you took the time to make sure the message was crystal clear

to expand a bit on 's answer when i read your question title i assumed that by retirement funds you meant target date funds that are close to their target dates say the 2015 target fund   when i saw that you were referring to all target date funds it occurred to me that examining how such funds modify their portfolios over time would actually help answer your question if you look at a near term target fund you can see that a smaller percent is invested internationally the same way a smaller percent is invested in stocks   it 's because of risk   since it 's more likely that you will need some of the money soon and since you 'll be cashing out said money in us dollars it 's risky to have too much invested in foreign currencies   if you need money that 's currently invested in a foreign currency and that currency happens to be doing poorly against usd at the moment then you 'll lose money simply because you need it now this is the same rationale that goes into target date funds moving from stocks to bonds over time   since the value of a stock portfolio has a lot more natural volatility than the value of a bond portfolio if you 're heavily invested in stocks when you need to withdraw money there 's a higher probability that you 'll need to cash out just when stocks happen to be doing relatively poorly   being invested more in bonds around when you 'll need your money is less risky similarly being more invested in us dollars than in foreign currencies around when you 'll need your money is also less risky

i actually do know what i 'm talking about no need to be rude   believe me i understand tax advantages of each i 'm subjected to them every single day at my work i am of the belief that buybacks are great when used responsibly however at the recent rate and scope that companies have been using them i think it 's overkill and will have a negative future impact on real company growth
# 66342
yes i do i think it 's irresponsible to not pay back your debt your response was the definition of millennial entitlement and why so many of you are socialists think it 's moral to steal from someone else   why is it responsible to take out a huge amount of debt and cross your fingers you get a job with a degree in gender studies   even if they did get a good major school what if they did n't work hard to network or add experience   and even if they did get a job what if they spent it all at the bar instead of living cheap and paying off the loan   why do they get a break and i do n't for being responsible and living cheap
# 246690
not directly but companies benefit in various ways from a higher stock price one way a high stock price can hurt a company is that many companies do share buybacks when the price is too high economically speaking a company should only buy back shares when those shares are undervalued but management may have incentives to do buybacks at irrationally high prices

while the question is highly subjective as you noted putting extra money will of course save you interest payments it depends on how much enjoyment is worth now i would suggest you to not be overly aggressive as you might dig yourself a ditch your minimum monthly payments might get adjust upwards if some of these loans are student loans as it might seem you have a higher degree of disposable income to play with be aggressive in paying them off but not to aggressive i also think the interest is tax deductible what it really comes down to is how much more interest do you want to pay them for enjoyment now 50 months is not long its just north of 4 years i 'd say if you think you can put 800 extra towards them do n't instead if it were me i would put an extra 400 towards the highest until its paid and then take the 400 plus the monthly minimum and add that to the next highest and keep the other 400 for a rainy day you will still get paid off quick but will leave yourself some scratch if necessary

i 'm being taxed at a 40 rate then i can give $ 500,000 to charity write it off and save $ 200,000 on my taxes that 's a net loss of $ 300,000 i may have paid less taxes but it cost me 300 grand your logic is correct however here 's another way to think about it suppose you are being taxed at a 40 rate you wish to purchase $ 500,000 worth of diamonds   how much do you have to make in income to do so   you need to make $ in income pay 40 of that $ in taxes and then spend the $ 500,000 on the diamonds   but to spend that $ 500,000 on a charitable donation you only need to make an income of $ 500,000 taxed at a rate of 0 because donations to charity count against your taxable income or yet another way to think about it is that if you make $ in income you can spend it on $ 500,000 worth of diamonds or $ worth of charitable contributions effectively you get to purchase $ worth of charitable contributions for free over the equivalent purchase that is not a charitable donation

your biggest risk with a vendor like this is not that your credit card number will be stolen in transit it is that it will be stolen from the vendor i agree with that using a one time number is the best plan provided you have a bank that offers such numbers   bank of america calls it shop safe while citibank calls it virtual account numbers   i think discover card has something similar but less useful in that they are n't really one time use and i think american express discontinued their service   afaik no one else offers anything like it   if you ca n't get a one time number then i was going to suggest buying a visa gift card until i put together the fact that you are making a purchase in asia and the gift cards are not authorized for international payments due to patriot act restrictions   visa does offer the service which might help but i doubt your vendor participates or would even be allowed to participate if they do n't offer a secure order form   you can open a pre paid visa card account which is probably what i 'd do you can buy pre paid visa cards the same way you buy visa gift cards the difference being you have to register the pre paid cards thanks patriot act before you can use them   but it 's not that big a deal to register one you just fill out the online form your your ssn etc and you 're good to go load it up with enough money to cover your purchase and the fx fees and then cut it up

if i understand you correctly no you should n't be charged interest lets say you have a billing cycle of monthly which usually is n't true you charge $ xx per day ending up at $ 1000 at the end of january so february 1st your bill for your january billing cycle is $ 1000 due by feb 15th lets say on february 1st you continue to charge $ xx per day you go to pay your bill online on feb 14th to be safe and you 'll usually see on your credit card website something like you 'd hit pay my bill and you 'd usually see these options at the date your cycle was due feb 15th if you have n't paid your full latest statement lets say you paid $ 500 they will charge you interest on the entire balance for the period so interest on $ 1000 or lets say $ 50 the other $ 500 will roll over to the next month so your next month you 'd be somewhere near a $ bill

i actually had a similar situation when i tried to buy my house i paid off all my loans and was proud of my debt free status i had no car note no student loans absolutely no debt but i did have a bank issued credit card usaa not chase but i assume the same may apply    when i tried to get a home loan they told me i had absolutely no information on my credit report aka i had no credit the mortgage lender had no idea what was going on nor did i or anybody else it took a lot of research before i realized that the credit bureaus use a formula for the credit rating that involves a lot of things but if you have n't had a current line of credit reported to the agency in over a year maybe it was longer i did n't have anything for 3 years you are n't going to have a credit score    because i was debt free i was also credit report free and eventually the credit bureaus had nothing to go on and my score disappeared the bank issued credit card was on my credit report but they did n't report monthly balances so the bureaus could n't use it to determine if i was paying off the card or if i even had a balance on it it was essentially not doing my credit any favors despite what i had thought in short based on the fact that you have no debt in her name and you have taken on all debt in your own name its very plausible that she has no credit rating anymore it wo n't take long to get it back once you have anything on your credit that 's actually reported the formula can kick back in and look at credit history as well as current credit and she 'll be fine

when evaluating a refinance you need to figure out the payback time refinancing costs money in closing costs the payback time is the time it takes to recover the closing costs with the amount of money you are saving in interest   for example if the closing costs are $ 2,000 your payback time is 2 years if it takes 2 years to save that amount in interest with the new interest rate vs. the old one   to estimate this look at the difference in interest rate between your mortgage and the new one and your mortgage balance for example let 's say that you have $ 100,000 left on your mortgage and the new rate is 1 lower than your current rate in one year you will save roughly $ 1,000 in interest if your closing costs are $ 2,000 then your payback time is somewhere around 2 years if you plan on staying in this house longer than the payback time then it is beneficial to refinance   there are mortgage refinance calculators online that will calculate payback time more precisely   one thing to watch out for when you refinance if you expand the term of your mortgage you might end up paying more interest over the long term even though your rate is less and your monthly payment is less for example let 's say you currently have 8 years left on a 15-year mortgage if you refinance to a new 15-year mortgage your monthly payment will go down but if you only pay the new minimum payment for the next 15 years you could end up paying more in interest than if you had just continued with your old mortgage for the next 8 years to avoid this refinance to a new mortgage with a term close to what you have left on your current mortgage if you ca n't do that continue paying whatever your current monthly payment is after you refinance and you 'll pay your new mortgage early and save on interest

there are no risk free high liquidity instruments that pay a significant amount of interest   there are some money market accounts around that pay but they often have minimum balance or transaction limits    even if you could get 3 on a $ 4 k balance that would be $ 120 per year or $ 10 per month   you can do much better than that by just going to $ two less times per month or whatever you can cut from your expenses and putting that into the savings account or work a few extra hours and increase your income i appreciate the desire to maximize the return on your money but in reality increasing income and reducing expenses have a much greater impact until you build up significant savings and are able to absorb more risk   emergency funds should be highly liquid and risk free so traditional investments are n't appropriate vehicles for them

i am going to break rank slightly with the consensus so far   here 's the deal it probably does help your credit slightly to pay it multiple times per month if it is n't a hassle but the bump is likely to be minimal and very temporary   here 's why a key component of your score is your credit usage ratio that is the ratio of how much of your credit limits you are using you want to keep this number down as low as possible now here is where it gets tricky although you have a grace period to pay off your card with no interest the credit card companies do n't generally report the balance as of the due date they either report the high balance or an average balance over the month that is it is based on how much you use not how much balance you carry over each month it is n't very intuitive but that 's just how it is so technically keeping that balance lower over the course of the month will probably help you but the credit usage ratio is generally a rolling average over the last x months so the effect will wear off quickly so it is probably not worth doing unless you know you are going to apply for a loan in the next 6 months and need a temporary small bump another consideration is that paying early provides no real financial benefit in terms of finance charges but you are giving up liquidity which does have some value     1 you probably could get at least a little interest for keeping the money in your account a few more weeks 2 if you have a major financial emergency e.g. broken down car you might appreciate the fact that you kept your options open to carry that balance over a month

's are pretty much the best crash course to financial modelling with excel be aware though he has two distinct types of book one is more of a walk through of financial principles in of finance with excel 2nd ed and the other could better be described as a of financial applications in oft recommended financial modeling as far as i 'm aware both contain roughly the same volume of information about the same topics could be some minor differences as the walk through style book is newer but are taught in somewhat different ways it might be useful to obtain a copy of one or the other from a library and see if you enjoy the style of the book before purchasing it i was fortunate enough to have a roommate where between us we have both but doing this individually is a 200 + dollar endeavor and you will only be duplicating identical information   if you 're interested in reading other interesting material that may help you develop different perspectives insight into investing i would suggest aside from reading the usual stuff intelligent investor random walk etc also obtaining a copy of seth klarman 's margin of safety you 'll have to do so in form as the book is entirely out of print and from what i 've heard klarman himself bought out many retailers of all of their copies and had them destroyed but it 's an interesting read that has a lot of modern relevance   perhaps best evidenced by the fact that it 's author president of one of the largest hedge funds in the world no longer wants it in print

you can get direct market access dma but you have to pay for data as this is part of the exchanges data plan and there are plenty of other fees that are passed straight down to you your clearing firm also has fees that are passed on to you in general you are looking at $ 150 a month on the low side in data and software fees if you wanted pure access nasdaq alone charges $ 6,000 a month last i checked the different routes data routes to the exchange all have different rules and they give you rebates for some kinds of orders in some conditions   brokers nowadays usually assume this responsibility including collecting the rebates lol at the very least and charge an average price for routing your orders a price that fits into their business plan and their target audience hope that helps

gt;&gt i propose to make the requirements for finish high school and college degrees much much higher as it was in the past   gt not gon na happen   totally agree with you what i was proposing is what should be done   gt waiting for disadvantaged kids to get higher scores will not happen until they get accepted into college   even then almost all disadvantaged kids smart or not smart the diploma they get is almost worthless the diploma will not give them much advantage or improve their situation the diploma barely even helps very smart kids from rich advantaged homes   actually if in the past no matter who you knew no matter your family background a diploma will almost always guarantee a secure and advantaged life   gt if you force schools to gain their income from future students earnings they will have high concern for kids that have a good p e ratio it will also stop the loan industry from putting these kids into debt   in theory you are correct in practice many many problems to implement for starters this makes college a very risky business because it 's very hard to predict future income of its students even the very smart and accomplished students and i will give you a related example colleges teach computer science programming to many kids today but the profession is about to die due ai and automation + outsourcing this was unexpected 1 2 years ago    barely economists can predict the economy so you want colleges to predict income based on what is taught   gt the downside is that it may turn colleges into trade techs    actually colleges are already trade techs because today almost all students study just for the hope to get a job   in the past you studied to become a scholar and wise and then pick some kind of a job of your interest where being generally smart and knowledgeable is needed   bottom line since you and i know that nothing will be done no higher standards and no future income based tuition here 's what what 's happening with my son which is what happened with me which is still happening in germany no i am not german but i come from a german culture my parents are of german descent but i was born and raised in israel   it 's called master and apprentice   i have been working since i was 13 with computers and if you consider my age 55 when i was 13 no pcs with internet and only punch cards were used to access a computer my parents did not push me it was me who felt the need to work while i was studying just like my father had that need when he was young   my son 13 today but since he was 10 the apple does not fall far from the tree found work he 's not even allowed to work by law and is making money he 's right now teaching administering and designing minecraft worlds and applications   hands on experience especially taught from a master is better than any diploma   he will probably go to some so so college to get a piece of paper called diploma while he will continue working in whatever he 's interested   he will be successful like i am not trying to brag i never pushed him but i explained to you some realities of the world   last word actually most masters real masters are desperate to teach for free their knowledge vision and know and the system does not allow them to do that to protect the colleges and universities only in medicine it 's still happens think about it

you should also update your net worth statement as well as an inventory of all your assets   unfortunately these are extremely time consuming but in the event that you pass away your loved ones will know all of your finances and it will be easier for them in a very difficult time    the net worth statement compiles just that your net worth   the net worth is compiled by subtracting your liabilities from you assets   assets include things such as cash money in accounts all estimated value of your household items any life insurance bonds mutual bonds and retirement money   the liabilities include amounts such as your mortgage second mortgage car loans unsecured loans credit cards student loans and life insurance loans   this statement is a great way to track year to year how you are doing on your finances and if you are where you need to be in order to retire when you would like the inventory is also very important this is used in the event that you have a fire or some sort of disaster that requires you to give a statement of any items you had in your home   this is a very difficult thing to go through and having this statement ready to hand over only makes thing easier   there are a couple ways to do this   some people take pictures of everything they have in their house and make notes of prices and values some people take a video of the whole house and some people write down item by item on the computer or on a piece of paper   whatever way you would like to do it is fine what works for one person does not necessarily work for the other

if this is an issue of opportunity cost then there is a benefit mortgage interest rates are extremely low low enough that they can effectively be used to indirectly fund investments if one stores equity in a house ie pays it off then that wealth returns only the rate of growth of the house less expenditures if one borrows against the house to fund investments then the above stated returns which on average exceed the mortgage interest rate can be augmented by the investments yielding a greater return the tax benefit is more of a cherry on top if one is using this as a justification to spend then it is

i strongly suggest you read up the option greeks you can be right about a stocks price movement and still not make money b c other factors come into play from time or volatility for a free option hedge you can look at collars buying puts and selling calls to offset the debit you pay for the transaction ex aapl is 115 you buy the 110 puts and sell the 120 calls this gives you a collar around he current price your hedged below 110 and can still participate in upside move to 120 also look into time value time decays exponentially in the last 30 days if you are long this hurts you if you are this is good be sure to take this into account delta relation of the option to the underlying stock move on a .01 1 scale .50 is normal deep in the money options have higher deltas it is possible other factors can offset this delta move this is why people will lose money on earnings plays even though they are right   ex say you buy an aapl call at 120 earnings comes out and the stock goes to 121 even though you are in the money your contract may still have less value than what you paid because of volatility collapse the market place knows earnings move a stock and that is factored into the price of the options expected volatility as mentioned watch out for dividend dates always be aware of dividend dates and earnings dates and if your contract is going to cover one of these events interest rates have an effect as well but since the fed has near 0 rates there is little impact at the present though this could certainly change if the fed starts raising rates research the black scholes pricing model whenever you trade always think about what the other guys is thinking sometimes we forget their is someone else on the other side of my trade that thinks essentially the exact opposite of me its a zero sum game as far as choosing strikes you can look at calculating the at the money straddle to see if the options are cheap stock price implied volatility for 30 60 90 days depending on your holding period sq root of days to expiration 19 which is sq root of days yr add and subtract this number to the current stock price to give you an approximate 1 standard deviation of expected price movement keeping with our example aapl at 115 lets say your formula spits out a 6 therefore price range is expected to be 109 to 121 for the time period helpful for selling options i would sell the   call or the 108 puts hope this helps start small and get a feel for things

math says invest in the market but paying off your mortgage early is a valid option if you are very risk averse you are going to get a better return by investing in the stock market   in the us in mortgages are and give you a tax break   the rate of return on the stock market is ~10 closer to 6 after you subtract out inflation taxes fees etc since 10 > 3 or 6 > 4 to use the pessimistic numbers   investing in the market is the better deal but the market has risk and your mortgage does not   if you are very risk averse paying off the mortgage may make sense as an example   family a has a single who works a low skilled job family b has 2 working spouses both in high skill white collar positions    these two families are going to have wildly different risk tolerances   it may make sense for family a to invest its extra money in paying off the mortgage after they have tackled high interest debt built an emergency fund maxed the 401k etc personally i would not in the us you can not recoup pre payments if you lose your job   if i was very risk averse i would keep my extra money as cash so i could pay my mortgage after i lost my job   it is never going to make sense for family b to pay the mortgage early   at that point any decision to pre pay is going to be based on emotion and not logic

in the united states most residential real estate transactions employ a title company to process all the paperwork and transfer all the funds some paperwork has to be filed with the local government but they also have to deal with the banks mortgage companies on the two ends of the transaction at closing both parties will sign a ton of paperwork all of which was coordinated by the title company as for the funds the buyer will write a check the lender will send over the loan commitment papers for the rest of the money   how much money that depends on the purchase price the deposit the down payment the taxes and fees an other closing costs they are responsible for initial escrow inspection title insurance   the seller hopefully does n't have to write a check but if they underwater they will have to bring funds to closing from the incoming funds the title company will send money to the old lender the real estate agents the local government to record the deed   the sellers escrow money with the old lender may end up being sent back to the seller or some of the funds could be transferred to the buyer to help cover the portion of the real estate taxes from the perspective of the buyer they will only write two checks one at the start of the process for the deposit and one on closing day for their portion of the transaction the seller will hopefully walk away with a check of course determining if they will owe taxes for the transaction depends on a lot more information

that is mostly true in most situations when there are more buy orders than sell orders higher buy volume orders than sell volume orders the price will generally move upwards and vice versa when there are more sell orders than buy orders higher sell volume orders than buy volume orders the price will generally move downwards note that this does not always happen but usually it does you are also correct that for a trade to take place a buyer has to be matched with a seller or the buy volume matched with the sell volume but not all orders get executed as trades say there are 50 buy orders in the order book with a total volume of 100,000 shares and the highest buy order is currently at $ 10.00 on the other side there are only 10 sell orders in the order book with total volume of 10,000 shares and the lowest sell order is currently $ at the moment there wo n't be a trade unless a new buyer or seller enters the market to match the opposing side or an existing order gets amended upper or lower to match the opposing side with more demand than supply in the order books what will be the most likely direction that this stock moves in most likely the price will move upwards if a new buyer sees the price moving higher and then looks at the market depth they would most likely place an order closer to the lowest sell order than the current highest buy order say $ 10.01 to be first in line in case a market sell order is placed on the market as new buy orders enter the market it drives the price higher and higher until the buy orders dry up

depends on the level of risk in the specific p2p provider i 've looked at which secures loans against property you can select loans based on loan to value ratio etc even if a recession happens if the ltv is around 50 it would have to be a pretty awful recession for you to lose any money once they recover although there will be a delay while you wait for the recovery to happen i would thus consider this lower risk than other p2p options so i 'd be willing to put more money into it at the end of the day as others have said there 's no objective answer this is just one factor to consider which i do n't think has been pointed out yet on this discussion

this is more clearly defined in the eitc for purposes of the earned income tax credit then no it is not earned income   see publication page 18 specifically scholarship or fellowship grants not reported on a form a scholarship or fellowship grant that was n't reported to you on a form w-2 is n't considered earned income for the earned income credit further form describes unearned income and explicitly includes scholarships again not on for form unearned income includes all taxable    income other than earned income as defined later    unearned income includes taxable interest ordinary    dividends capital gains including capital gain    distributions rents royalties etc it also includes taxable    social security benefits pension and annuity income    taxable scholarship and fellowship grants not reported on    form w-2 unemployment compensation alimony and    income other than earned income received as the    beneficiary of a trust so unless it was reported on a w-2 i.e. it 's for some sort of employment it 's not considered earned income   h t for that link the definition on the instructions of form is not particularly different though it 's more general earned income includes wages tips and other amounts received for personal services performed   scholarships do n't seem to fit any more into that so i would say they do not

we can not know if you owe them anything but at the least i would expect that they do n't just say you owe us but we found out that we were supposed to pay you $ x but we paid you $ y which is more and then we can go from there   there are things like we should have paid you $ per hour for the last year but we paid you $ 12.50 per hour where you can tell them that by paying you that rate you assumed it was correct one you would n't have worked for less so they effectively gave you a raise on the other hand if they say you worked here for 38 hours a week but we paid you for 40 hours a week and you did indeed work only 38 hours then most likely they are correct

what is a stock a share of stock represents ownership of a portion of a corporation in olden times you would get a physical stock certificate looking something like this with your name and the number of shares on it that certificate was the document demonstrating your ownership today physical stock certificates are quite uncommon to the point that a number of companies do n't issue them anymore while a one share certificate can be a neat certificates are a pain for investors as they have to be stored safely and you 'd have to go through a whole annoying process to redeem them when you wanted to sell your investment   now you 'll usually hold stock through a brokerage account and your holdings will just be records in a database somewhere you 'll pick a broker more on that in the next question instruct them to buy something and they 'll keep track of it in your account   where do i get a stock you 'll generally choose a broker and open an account you can read reviews to compare different brokerages in your country as they 'll have different fees and pricing you can also make sure the brokerage firm you choose is in good standing with the financial regulators in your country though one from a major national bank wo n't be unsafe   you will be required to provide personal information as you are opening a financial account the information should be similar to that required to open a bank account you 'll also need to get your money in and out of the account so you 'll likely set up a bank transfer it may be possible to request a paper stock certificate but do n't be surprised if you 're told this is unavailable if you do get a paper certificate you 'll have to deal with considerably more hassle and delay if you want to sell later   brokers charge a commission which is a fee per trade let 's say the commission is $ if you buy 5 shares of google at $ you 'd pay $ 5 + $ 10 = $ and wind up with $ worth of stock in your account you 'd pay the same commission when you sell the stock   can anyone buy own use a stock pretty much a brokerage is going to require that you be a legal adult to maintain an account with them there are generally ways in which a parent can open an account on behalf of an child though there can be different types of restrictions when it comes to investing in companies that are not publicly held but that 's not something you need to worry about stocks available on the public stock market are available to well the public how are stocks taxed taxes differ from country to country but as a general rule you do have to provide the tax authorities with sufficient information to determine what you owe this means figuring out how much you purchased the stock for and comparing that with how much you sold it for to determine your gain or loss in the us and i suspect in many other countries your brokerage will produce an annual report with at least some of this information and send it to the tax authorities and you you or someone you hire to do your taxes will use that report to compute the amount of tax owed your brokerage will generally keep track of your cost basis how much you bought it for for you though it 's a good idea to keep records if you refuse to tell the government your cost basis they can always assume it 's $ 0 and then you 'll pay more tax than you owe   finding the cost basis for old investments can be difficult many years later if the records are lost if you can determine when the stock was purchased even approximately it 's possible to look back at historical price data to determine the cost   if your stock pays a dividend a certain amount of money per share that a company may pay out of its profits to its investors you 'll generally need to pay tax on that income in the us the tax rate on dividends may be the same or less than the tax rate on normal wage income depending on how long you 've held the investment and other rules

disclosure i do n't have an iphone so i do n't use robinhood   that being said i have a less they're out to get ya view of what they 're doing as a small business owner 2 businesses employees cost the most   if you can create a solid business with few or no employees and let robots run it you will drastically reduce your costs   joe polish said it similarly with sales letters something along the lines of they never complain about a headache need to take a year off to discover or just need a personal day   robots are the same they do not have human limits   most simple trading can be done and maintained by well written code and ai there 's very little need for humans to do anything other than build it   think about the efficiency of bitcoin versus all the central banks combined how many people are employed by central banks robinhood states that they are using technology in these ways to minimize costs and they 're using a system that does n't need physical branches this does n't mean they will never have them just that they do n't need them   robinhood does not indicate that they allow everything to happen for free only stock trading   i worked for a large trading firm once and observed that stock trading was n't the bulk of where they made their money anyway trading options futures index funds etc are where the big money was and robinhood says nothing about those being free   like the cqm mentioned too they 'll be charging for margin as well in a way the individual stock trader is dead many people including this forum prefer index funds so more than likely robinhood will strike up a deal with an index fund company or create their own this is just easy passive income with an expense ratio   in this category the markets are their playground but they do need to attract enough people to their platform thus free stock trading is a good way to do it as for selling your information for advertising that is always a possibility but they have quite a few other options that would be good for most investors index funds with financial fund companies etc where they can start before ever needing to dip their toe in selling information   this is n't to say they wo n't do it but that there are few other options they have the major concern i have for robinhood is ongoing security   just building it and letting it run kind of assumes that there wo n't be major compromises in the future and as ai evolves superior ai might be able to crush older ai

the biggest challenge as a young person maxing out a 401k in my opinion is the challenge of saving for a house and if necessary paying off student loans you have to consider are you ok renting for the next 3 5 10 years or do you eventually want to buy a place how much will that cost vs your current expenses   that being said i did n't max out but had over 8 10 of 401k contribution in the same situation you 're in right now and i do n't regret it   your question i see you are considering investing in a roth ira especially at your current age assuming your wages will go up investing to the company match with the 401 k and then maxing out a roth ira would be my recommendation then continue maxing out the 401k if you wish   p.s. i highly recommend doing two things if you go down this path

what is the best option to start with and   i am not sure about my goals right now but i do want to have a major retirement account without changing it for a long time that is a loaded question your goals should be set up first else what is stopping you from playing the mega millions lottery to earn the retirement amount instantly if you have the time and resources you should try doing it yourself it helps you learn and at a latter stage if you do n't have the time to manage it yourself you can find an adviser who does it for you to find a good adviser or find a fund who which can help you achieve your monetary goals you will need to understand the details how it works and other stuff behind it   when you are thrown terms at your face by somebody you should be able to join the dots and get a picture for yourself many a rich men have lost their money to unscrupulous people i.e. bernie madoff so knowing helps a lot and then you can ask questions or find for yourself to calm yourself i.e. ditch the fund or adviser when you see red flags it also makes you not to be too greedy when somebody paints you a picture of great returns because then your well oiled mind would start questioning the rationale behind such investments have a look at warren buffet he is an investor and you can follow how he does his investing it is simple but very difficult to follow investing through my bank i would prefer to stay away from them because their main service is banking and not allowing people to trade i would first compare the services provided by a bank to td ameritrade or any firm providing trading services the thing is as you mentioned in the question you have to go through a specific process of calling him to change your portfolio which should n't be a condition what might happen is if he is getting some benefits out of the it clarified in the first place if you intend to go through them from the side of the fund he might try to dissuade you from doing so to protect his stream of income and what if he is on a holiday or you can not get hold of him secondly from your question it seems you are n't that investing literate so it is very easy to get you confused by jargon and making you do what he gets the maximum benefit out of it rather than which benefits you more   i ai n't saying he is doing so but that could be a possibility too so you have consider that angle too the pro is that setting up an account through them might be much easier than directly going to a provider but the best point doing it yourself is you will learn and there is nothing which tops that you do n't want somebody else managing your money however knowledgeable they maybe i.e. anthony

the difference in interest is not a huge factor in your decision   it 's about $ 2 per month    personally i would go ahead and knock one out since it 's one less to worry about   then i would cancel the account and cut that card up so you are not tempted to use it again to address the comments cutting up the card is not the ultimate solution   the solution is to stop borrowing money get on a strict budget live on less than what you bring home and throw everything you can at this high interest debt    the destroying of the card is partly symbolic it 's a gesture to indicate that you 're not going to use credit cards at all or at least until they can be used responsibly not paying a dime of interest   it 's analogous to a recovering alcoholic pouring out bottles of booze   sure you can easily get more but it 's a commitment to changing your attitude and behavior yes leaving the card open will reduce utilization and improve or not hurt credit score but if the goal is to stop borrowing money and pay off the other card then once that is achieved your credit score will be significantly improved and the cancelling of the first card will not matter   the card really both cards should never ever be used again

there 's two competing forces at work and they are at work worldwide banks can get money from several sources through inter bank borrowing and from raising capital capital can come from from selling assets stock offerings deposits etc the money the banks get from depositors is capital in the united states the federal reserve regulates the amount of capital that banks must maintain if there was no requirement for capital then there would   be zero demand for capital at an interest rate above the inter bank offering rate as capital requirements have risen banks are allowed to make less loans given a certain amount of capital that has caused an increased demand for capital from depositors as described in this federal reserve ruling effective january 1st 2014 the federal reserve is again raising capital requirements as you can see here money can be borrowed in the united states at 100 currently interest rates paid to borrowers are quite high compared to prevailing inter bank rates they could see more upward pressure given the fact that banks will be forced to maintain an increased amount of capital for a given amount of loans

a good measurement would be to compare to index 's basically a good way to measure your self would be to ask if i put my money somewhere else how much better or worse would i have done mutual funds and hedge funds use the sp500 as a bench mark some funds actually wave their fee if they do not outperform the sp or only take a fee on the portion that has outperformed the sp500 in today 's economy i do nt know how to expect such a return the economy is not a good benchmark on what to expect from the stock market for example in 2009 by certain standards the economy was worse then today but in 2009 the market rallied a great deal so your returns should have reflected that you can use the sp500 as a quick reference to compare your returns this is also considered the standard for a quick comparison the way you compare your performance is also dependent on how you invest your money if you are outperforming the sp500 you are doing well many mutual funds do not outperform the sp500 edit additional info here is an article with more comprehensive information on how to gauge your performance in the article is a link to a free tool from morning star use the right benchmark to accurately measure investment performance

you have figured out most of the answers for yourself and there is not much more that can be said from a lender 's viewpoint   non immigrant students applying for car loans are not very good risks because they are going to graduate in a short time maybe less than the loan duration which is typically three years or more and thus   may well be leaving the country before   the loan is fully paid off in your case the issue is exacerbated   by the fact that your opt status is due to expire in about one year 's time so the issue is not whether you are a citizen but whether the lender can be reasonably sure that you will be gainfully employed and able to make the loan   payments until the loan is fully paid off yes lenders care about work history and scores but they also care perhaps even care more about the prospects for steady employment and ability to make the payments until the loan is paid off   yes you plan on   applying for a h1-b visa but that is still in the future and whether the visa status will be adjusted is still a matter with uncertain outcome also these are not matters that can be explained easily in an on line application or in a paper application submitted by mail to a distant bank whose name you obtained from some list of lenders who have a reliable track record of extending   auto loans to non permanent residents for this reason i   suggested in a comment that you consider applying at a credit union   especially if there is an employees credit union for those   working for your employer if you go this route go talk to a loan officer in person rather than trying to do this on the phone similarly a local bank and especially one where you currently have an account hopefully in good standing is more likely to be willing to work with you   failing all this there is always the auto dealer 's own loan offers of financing   finally one possibility that you might   want to consider is whether a one year lease might work for you instead of an outright purchase and you can buy a car after your visa issue has been settled

typically one wants to see a credit score just because you may have money in the bank and decent income does not mean your going to pay there are plenty of people who have the money but simply refuse to cough it up credit is simply a relative way of seeing where one fits against another in a larger group it shows that this person not only can pay but does pay while not having a credit history should make no difference i can and hopefully easily posited above why it can be necessary to have one not all landlords will require a credit check i was not required to give one i did not have much credit to begin with given that i was forced to cough up a higher degree of a security deposit

i assume you 've looked into gold as an asset class which is considered to be a good in your portfolio at about 5 of investments because there are a lot of opinions around about that   but in terms of physical vs paper gold investment my experience has been that they 'll absolutely kill you on fees if you 're not careful i had a broker try and charge me $ they do it in the margins though so they 'll just sell at say $ 1,350 but buy at $ 1,200 just make sure you either know the market price when you walk in and stick to your guns or lock in a price ahead of time

in the united states if someone refers to the interest rate especially if heard on news or talk radio in particular they are almost always referring to the federal funds rate a rate set forth and maintained by the united states federal reserve the fed for short if the fed opts to raise or lower this rate it subsequently effects all interest rates whether by being directly connected in a chain of loans   or by market demand through the efficiency of financial markets in the case of bond auctions the fomc meets eight times each year to determine the target for the federal funds rate   the federal funds rate effects all interest rates because it is the originating rate of interest on all loans in the chain of loans because of this significance as a benchmark for all interest rates it is the rate most commonly referred to as interest rate when used alone that is why other rates are specified by what they actually are e.g. mortgage rates 10 year 30 year for 10 year treasury and 30 year treasury bond yields respectively savings rate auto rate credit card rate cd rate all rates of interest effected by the originating loan that is the federal funds rate   this is true in the united states but will vary for other countries in general though it will almost always refer to the originating rate for all loans in a given country institution etc   note that bonds have yields that are based on market demand that is in turn based on the federal funds rate it is because of the efficiency of financial markets that the demand and thus the yields are correlated to the federal funds rate

after seeing your most recent comment on the original question it looks like others have answered the question you intended and described the extreme difficulty of getting the timing right the way you 're trying to since i 've already typed it up what follows answers what i originally thought your question was which was asking if there were drawbacks to investing entirely in money market funds to avoid stock volatility altogether money market funds have the significant drawback that they offer low returns one of the fundamental principles in finance is that there is a trade off between low risk and high returns while money market funds are extremely stable their returns are paltry under current market conditions you can consider them roughly equivalent to cash on the other hand though investing in stocks puts your money on a roller coaster returns will be on average substantially higher since people often invest in order to achieve personal financial stability many feel naturally attracted to very stable investments like money market funds however this tendency can be a big mistake the higher returns of the stock market do n't merely serve to an investor 's greed they are necessary for achieving most people 's financial goals for example consider two hypothetical investors saving for retirement over the course of a career the first investor apprehensive adam invests $ 10k per year in a money market fund the second investor brave barbara invests $ 10k per year in an s&p 500 index fund reinvesting dividends let 's be generous and say that adam 's money market fund keeps pace with inflation in reality they typically do n't even do that at the end of 40 years in today 's money adam will have $ 10,000 40 = $ 400,000 not nearly enough to retire comfortably on on the other hand let 's assume that barbara gets returns of 7 per year after inflation which is typical though not guaranteed barbara will then have using the formula for the future value of an annuity $ 10,000 1 0.07 or about $ 2,000,000 which is much more comfortable while adam 's strategy produces nearly guaranteed results those results are actually guaranteed failure barbara 's strategy is not a guarantee but it has a good chance of producing a comfortable retirement even if her timing is n't great over these time scales the chances that she will have more money than adam in the end are very high i wo n't produce a technical analysis of this claim as it 's a bit complicated do more research if you 're interested

governments borrowing money does n't create new money when banks borrow money i.e. take deposits it does effectively create money because the depositor expects to be able to get the money back at any time but the bank assumes that most wo n't actually do this and lends out most of the money to other people if everyone did actually ask for their money back at once the illusion of the extra money created by this process would collapse and the bank would go bust in contrast when governments borrow money the loan is n't on demand it has a fixed maturity and the money is only repaid at the end of that period plus interest at defined points during the period so holders of government debt do n't have money they can spend they can turn it into money they can spend but only by finding someone else to buy it so government debt does n't create inflation in itself if they printed money then they 'd be devaluing the money of everyone who had saved or invested whereas if they borrow money and use taxes to repay it the burden falls more evenly across the economy and does n't disproportionately penalise certain sets of people

yeah i mean it 's natural economics that jobs go to low wage countries so i guess i ca n't be mad at that but in addition there 's also a shift in debt from what was usually mortgages to student loan debt it 's not good because you 're no longer paying yourself as you did with a mortgage so money just gets burned you ca n't shed that debt ever    people frame it like a bubble but it 's more like a long term hamper on consumer spending imo if the fed wants to help the economy this would be the most effective bailout for lifting long term growth i do n't have any student debt and i still think this is probably one of the better answers

title agencies perform several things research the title for defects you may not know what you 're looking at unless you 're a real estate professional but some titles have strings attached to them like conditions for resale usage changes etc research title issues like misrepresentation of ownership misrepresentation of the actual property titled misrepresentation of conditions again not being a professional in the domain you might not understand the text you 're looking at research liens those are usually have to be recorded i.e. the title company wo n't necessarily find a lien if it was n't recorded with the county cover your and the bank 's they provide title insurance that guarantees your money back if they missed something they were supposed to find the title insurance is usually required for a mortgaged transaction while i understand why you would think you can do it most people can not even if they think they can they can not in many areas this research can not be done online for example in california you have to go to the county recorder office to look things up for legal reasons in ca counties are not allowed to provide access to certain information without verification of who 's accessing it may be worth your while   to pay someone to do it even if you can do it yourself because your time is more valuable also keep in mind that while you may trust your abilities your bank wo n't so you may be able to do your own due diligence but the bank needs to do its own specifically to detroit the city is bankrupt every $ 100 k counts for them i 'm surprised they only charge $ 6 per search but that is probably limited by the state law

i think you came up with a worthy masters phd research project it is a great question this is in australia so it is difficult for me to have complete perspective   however i can speak about the us of a. to your first point relatively few people inherit their wealth   according to a brief web search about 38 of billionaires and 20 of millionaires inherited their wealth   the rest are self made again in the us income mobility is very common   some act like high level earners are just born that way but studies have shown that a great deal of income mobility exists   i personally know people that have grown up without indoor plumbing and extremely poor but now earn in the top 5 of wage earners    quid 's points are valid   for example a starbucks new i phone and a brake job on your car are somewhat catastrophic if your income is 50k year hurts if your income is 100 k and an inconvenience if you make 250k year   these situations are normal and happen regularly   the first person may have to take a pay day loan to pay for these items the second credit card interest the third probably has the money in the bank   all of this the effect of an emergency on one 's net worth     to me there is also a chicken and egg effect in wealth building and income   how does one build wealth   by investing wisely planning ahead budgeting delaying gratification finding opportunities etc   now if you take those same skills to your workplace is n't it likely you will receive more responsibility promotions and raises   i believe so   and this too the effect on one 's net worth   if investing helps you to earn more then you will have more to invest to me one of the untold stories of this graph is not just investing but first building a stable financial base   having a sufficient emergency fund having enough and the right kind of insurance keeping loans to a minimum   without doing those things first investments might need to be withdrawn often at an inopportune time for emergency purposes thanks for asking this

a good answer to the question really depends on where you want to live ultimately where you want to live pretty much dictates your investment priorities if you want to invest in terrain so you can build a house next to all the cool people in that should be your first priority your new wife may have an opinion on that matter you should consult her in real life most people are less concerned about their absolute level of wealth than with keeping up with their friends or other reference group if you do n't buy the terrain the danger is that in five years it may go up three four five times and be out of your reach even if your other investments do well on the absolute standard   while it 's fairly easy to invest the equivalent of $ 250 k in land it 's hard to invest that much in stocks if you want to buy stocks with that kind of money it will be u.s. european or maybe other latin american e.g. brazilian stocks that kind of asset allocation would tell me that you are thinking of leaving your country at some point if you 're a sensible allocation might be 50 50 but in any event first decide how you want to live your life then adopt the investment strategy that best supports that life

hope springs eternal in the human breast no actively managed fund has beaten the indices over a long period of time but over shorter periods actively managed funds have beaten the indices quite often sometimes quite spectacularly and sometimes even for many years in a row examples from the past include fidelity and mason value trust so people buy actively managed funds hoping to cash in on such   good performance the difficulty is of course that many people do n't even think about investing in a fund until it is listed in some top forty funds of last year compilation and for many funds they have already peaked and new buyers are often disappointed   some   people who invested earlier plan on getting out of the fund before   the fund falls flat on its face and fewer even succeed in doing so as to why 401k plans often have high cost actively managed funds there are several reasons a most important one is that there are numerous companies that act as administrators of 401k programs and these companies put together package deals of 401k programs funds administrative costs etc and small employers have to choose from one of these packages   second there are various rules that have come into existence since the first days of 401k and 403b programs such as the investment choices must include funds of different types and actively managed funds large cap small cap etc are one of the choices that must be offered gone are the days when the only choice was a variable annuity offered by the insurance company administering the 401k program finally program participants also have hopes cf opening sentence and used to demand that the 401k program offer a few actively managed funds not just index funds

you have absolutely no concept of a business plan if you think 30 50 pages is going to be read i have to agree with the guy you called an idiot this whole thing is a pipe dream and your idea has either been done and failed or you have n't done the research to see that it 's already a thing your friend has no concept of what a patent is and you have no idea how businesses are run if you 're rough estimate is 2 3 million i have a feeling you have no concept of the value of a million dollars to begin with scrap this bullshit idea go start a lemonade stand or something and get an idea of what business is before you go spouting off shit like this you sound like a stupid kid

you should be aware that many pubs in the london indeed the uk as a whole are sold as a leasehold with a beer tie this typically means you pay less rent for the building and premises but must enter a contract with the pub company to buy their beer and day to day supplies you have the legal option to instead pay market rent for some but not all pub cos under certain conditions if you go with leasehold the landlord can usually close your pub at their will this is becoming a quite common occurrence in the booming real estate market of london while your interest will be in running a pub the pub co 's interest will be in getting change of use planning permission and selling it to a real estate developer

as long as there is nothing more to this story you are n't sharing you can expect those bills you paid to come back you will have to pay them again later you can be pretty certain that the name he gave you was fake and that the bank account you paid your bills with was not his i would not try to do anything at all with the information he gave you because first it is not his and second your name is already tied to this bank account via your utility bills in other words that would be illegal and you are already on the list of suspects    i would say that if you do n't call the police they probably wo n't call you the police often times do not even waste their time when somebody 's light bill was paid with fraudulent financial information or whatever i have actually seen similar situations play out a number of times and the police have never gotten involved disclaimer i probably do n't live where you live and i 'm not an attorney   but i do know what i am talking about so here 's my advice i know you did n't ask for advice but you probably might benefit from it let that money go sometimes people get you take it as a lesson and move on   if you do end up having to have contact with the police and you do n't already know they will lie to you and try to trick you into acting in a way that is not in your self interest but then you kind of look guilty if you wo n't even talk to them and in this case you did not do anything illegal so if i was you i would probably just think of where i might be myself by telling the truth if there were any parts of my story that would raise any flags and think of how i would smooth those out ahead of time    also for your personal information you do not need to have a sophisticated understanding of computers to do anything you described if you are familiar with operating a web browser you can do all types of stuff with paypal most people that give off the vibe criminal are not going to be able to make any money people and would probably have given it up before they got to you the information you have is not like the most valuable stuff ever but somebody that knew what they were doing could use it to take money out of your account and if they had that and then could get a few other pieces they could really mess up   your life so that 's part of why they say to be careful any one piece is maybe not so valuable but if you are loose with everything you will probably have a shitty few weeks at some points in the future no aa lol

that depends on how you 're investing in them trading bonds is arguably riskier than trading stocks because it has a lot of the same risks associated with stocks plus interest rate and inflation risk that 's true whether it 's a recession or not holding bonds to maturity may or may not be recession proof or perhaps more accurately low risk as argued by depending on what kind of bonds they are if you own bonds in stable governments e.g. u.s. or german bonds or bonds in certain states or municipalities or highly stable corporations there 's a very low risk of default even in a recession you did n't see companies like microsoft google or apple going under during the 2008 crash that 's absolutely not the case for all kinds of bonds though especially if you 're concerned about systemic risk just because a bond looks risk free does n't mean that it actually is look how many aaa rated securities went under during the 2008 recession and many companies lehman brothers went bankrupt outright to assess your exposure to risk you have to look at a lot of factors such as the credit worthiness of the business how recession proof their product is what kind of security or insurance you 're being offered etc you ca n't even assume that bond insurance is an absolute guarantee against systemic risk that 's what got aig into trouble in fact they were writing credit default swaps cds which are analogous to insurance on loans basically the seller of the cds insures the debt promises some kind of payment if a particular borrower defaults when the entire credit market seized up people naturally started asking aig to make good on their agreement and compensate them for the loans that went bad unfortunately aig did n't have the money and could n't borrow it themselves hence the government bailout to address the whole issue of a company going bankrupt it 's not necessarily the case that your bonds would be completely worthless so i disagree with the people who implied that this would be the case they 'd probably be worth a lot less than you paid for them originally though possibly as bad as pennies on the dollar depending on how much under water the company was also depending on how long it takes to work out a deal that everyone could agree to my understanding is that it could take a long time before you see any of your money i think it 's also possible that you 'll get some of the money as equity rather than cash in fact that 's how the u.s. government ended up owning a lot of chrysler they were chrysler 's largest lender when they went bankrupt so the government ended up getting a lot of equity in the business as part of the settlement incidentally there is a market for securities in bankrupt companies for people that do n't have time to wait for the bankruptcy settlement naturally people who buy securities that are in that much trouble generally expect a steep discount to summarize

this is a somewhat complicated question because it really depends on your personal situation   for example the following parameters might impact your optimal asset allocation if you need the money before 3 years i would suggest keeping almost all of it in cash cds treasuries and ultra safe short term corporate bonds if however you have a longer time horizon and since you 're in your 30s you would ideally have decades you should diversify by investing in many different asset classes   this includes australian equity international equity foreign and domestic debt commodities and real estate   since you have such a long time horizon market timing is not that important

for practical purposes i would strongly suggest that you do create a separate account for each business you may have that is used only for business purposes and use it for all of your business income and expenses this will allow you to get an accurate picture of whether you are making money or not what your full expenses really are how much of your personal money you have put into the business and is an easy way to keep business taxes separate you will also be able to get a fairly quick read on what your profits are without doing much accounting by looking at the account balance less future taxes and expenses and less any personal money you 've put into the account check out this thread from paypal about setting up a child account that is linked to your personal account and can be set up to payments into your main account should you like you will still be able to see transactions for each child account note do be careful to make sure you are reserving the proper amount out of any profits your startup may have for taxes you do n't want to mix this with personal money and then later find out that you owe taxes and have to to come up with the money if you have already spent it this is one of the main reasons to segregate your startup 's revenues and profits in the business account for those using brick and mortar banking services rather than a service like paypal you likely do not need a business checking account if you are a startup most likely you can simply open a second personal account with your bank in your name and name it john doe dba company name dba = doing business as this way you can pay expenses and accept payments in the name of your startup check with your banker for additional details localized information

you do n't need a book you need to dig into the business and understand what has changed how long has there been a struggle to make ends meet what seasonality exists for the business look at the period over period change for each product category as well as each line item expense and find correlations that may exist if it 's possible find similar insights about competition both brick and mortar as well as online    it 's important to analyze the results of the business to understand 1 the normal and flows of the jewelry store seasonality and 2 any erosion of the business to online or brick and mortar competitors the other important takeaway is that you have to identify any changes in the business expenses are utilities suddenly taking up more of a share of the profits or are the costs of raw materials on the rise   look at the cash flow to see where the money is going or if there is a revenue problem if business is down and revenue as a result you know where to start perhaps the answer is marketing or providing additional products or services that better match the needs of the clientele who are dropping off i.e. online ordering and free shipping or product pricing is elevated above the competition on the other side if expenses have gotten out of control you know where to apply controls keep in mind that these are not mutually exclusive and the business could have a revenue and an expense problem   if you 've studied economics you have the skills to understand the numbers and drive out the answers but this problem requires application and not philosophy sociology or economics no single book can give you the step by step process every business is unique and no one but your family can provide the insights necessary to analyze the results    best of luck reach out with any additional questions

for a non etf mutual fund you can only buy shares of the mutual fund from the mutual fund itself at a price that the mutual fund will reveal only at the end of the day and can only shares back to the mutual fund again at a price that the mutual fund will reveal only at the end of the day there is no open market in the sense that you can not put in a bid to buy say 100 shares of vfinx at $ per share through a brokerage and if there is a seller willing to sell 100 shares of vfinx to you at $ then the sale is and you are now the proud owner of 100 shares of vfinx the only buyer or seller of vfinx is the mutual find itself and you tell it that you want to buy 100 shares of vfinx and please take the money out of my checking account if this order is entered before the markets close at 4 pm the mutual fund determines its share price as of the end of the day opens a new account for you and puts 100 shares of vfinx in it or adds 100 shares of vfinx to your already existing pile of shares and takes the purchase price out of your checking account via an ach transfer similarly for redeeming selling shares of vfinx that you own and these are held in an account at the mutual fund itself not by your brokerage you tell the mutual fund to that you wish to redeem 100 shares and please send the proceeds to my bank account and the mutual fund does this at the end of the day and the money appears in your bank account via ach transfer two or three days later   generally these transactions do not need to be for round lots of multiples of 100 shares for efficiency most mutual fund will gladly sell you fractional shares down to a of a share in contrast shares of an exchange traded fund etf are just like stock shares in that they can be bought and sold on the open market and your broker will charge you fees for buying and selling them selling fractional shares on the open market is generally not possible and trading in round lots is less expensive also trades occur at all times of the stock exchange day not just at the end of the day as with non etf funds and the price can fluctuate during the day too many non etf mutual funds have an etf equivalent voo is the symbol for vanguard 's s&p 500 index etf while vfinx is the non etf version of the same index fund   read more about the differences between etfs and mutual funds for example here

it makes sense for civil service jobs where you want the bureaucracy to remain if layoffs are based on performance you end up with gamed performance stats to favor the current regime and the opposition   this is especially the case in jobs where measuring performance is extremely difficult or subjective and in these cases seniority tends to act as a decent proxy or at least it 's the best of a few mediocre options

first let me answer the question the best way i can i do n't know if there are any studies other than those that have already been mentioned now let 's talk about something more interesting you do n't need to base your behavior on any study even if it is scientific let 's pretend for example that we could find a scientifically valid study that shows that people spend 25 more when using a credit card than they do when spending cash   this does not mean that if you use a credit card you will spend 25 more   all it means is that the average person spending with a credit card spends more than the average person paying cash   but there are outliers   there are plenty of people who are being frugal while using a credit card and there are others who spend too much cash   everyone 's situation is different   the idea that you will automatically spend less by using cash would not be proven by such a study when hearing any type of advice like this you need to look at your own situation and see if it applies to your own life   and that is what people are doing with the anecdotal comments   some say yep i spend too much if i use a card others say actually i find that when i have cash in my wallet i spend it on junk   and both are correct   it does n't matter what the study says the average person does because you are not average now let 's say that you are a financial counselor who helps people work through disastrous financial messes   your client has $ 20,000 in credit card debt and is having trouble paying all his bills   he does n't have a budget and never uses cash   probably the best advice for this guy is to stop using his card and start paying cash   it does n't take a scientific study to see that this guy needs to change his behavior for what it is worth i keep a strict budget keeping track of my spending on the computer   the vast majority of my spending is electronic   i find tracking my cash spending difficult and sometimes i find that when i have cash in my wallet it seems to disappear without a trace

public transportation is generally a lot slower and not a whole lot cheaper by car my commute to the would take me 20 minutes but if i took train bus subway it would take 90 minutes now i 'm working in manhattan again and public transportation costs me over $ 300/month just to get to the city and back and still takes over an hour   and on top of all that the irs is cutting the 2012 limit of pre tax income that can be allocated to public transportation commuting expenses from $ 225 to $ 125 per month interestingly the limit of pre tax income that can be used to pay for commuter parking is not being reduced i guess the government wants us to stop using public transit

my basic rule of thumb is that if the the bill come from a government office of taxation and that if you fail to pay the amount they can put a tax lien on the property it is a tax for you the complication is in assessments for local benefits     you can not deduct amounts you pay for local benefits that tend to increase the value of your property    local benefits include the construction of streets sidewalks or    water and sewer systems you must add these amounts to the basis of    your property   you can however deduct assessments or taxes for    local benefits if they are for maintenance repair or interest    charges related to those benefits an example is a charge to repair an    existing sidewalk and any interest included in that charge   if only a    part of the assessment is for maintenance repair or interest    charges you must be able to show the amount of that part to claim the    deduction if you can not show what part of the assessment is for    maintenance repair or interest charges you can not deduct any of it an assessment for a local benefit may be listed as an item in your    real estate tax bill if so use the rules in this section to find how    much of it if any you can deduct i have never seen a tax bill that said this amount is for new streets and the rest i for things the irs says you can deduct the issue is that if the center city tax bill is a separate line or a separate bill then does it count i would go back to the first line of the quote from pub you can not deduct amounts you pay for local benefits that tend to    increase the value of your property then i would look at the quote from the ccd web site the center city district ccd is a business improvement district our    mission is to keep philadelphia 's downtown called center city clean    safe beautiful and fun we provide security cleaning and promotional    services that supplement but do not replace basic services provided    by the city of philadelphia and the fundamental responsibilities of    property owners ccd also makes physical improvements to the downtown installing and maintaining lighting > signs banners trees and landscape elements   and later on the same page ccd directly bills and collects mandatory payments from properties in    the district ccd also receives voluntary contributions from the    owners of tax exempt properties that benefit from our services the issues is that it is a business improvement district bid and you are n't a business i did find this document from the city of philadelphia explain how to establish a bid if the nature of the bid is such that organizers wish to include    residential properties within the district and make these properties    subject to the assessment it may make sense to assess these    properties at a lower level than a commercial property both because    bid services and benefits are business focused and because    owner occupants often can not treat assessments as tax deductible    business expenses like commercial owners do care must be taken to    ensure that the difference in commercial and residential assessment    rates is equitable and complies with the requirements of the from the same document funds for bid programs and services are generated from a special    assessment paid by the benefited property owners directly to the    organization that manages the bid ’s activities note many leases    have a clause that allows property owners to pass the bid assessment    on to their tenants because they are authorized by the city of    philadelphia the assessment levied by the bid becomes a legal    obligation of the property owner and failure to pay can result in the    filing of a lien i have seen discussion that some bids can accept tax deductible donations this means if a person they can deduct the donation i would then feel comfortable deducting the tax because if you ca n't deduct it that would mean the only people who ca n't deduct it are home owners   so deduct it keep in mind i am not a tax professional

the answer to your question depends on what you mean when you say growth   if you mean a literal increase in the aggregate market capitalization of companies across the entire market then no this sort of growth is not possible without economic growth   the reason why is that the market capitalization of each company is proportional to its gross revenue and the sum of all revenue from selling final goods i.e. things purchased and used by consumers is apart from a few technicalities the definition of gdp   the exact multiplier might fluctuate up or down depending on investors expectations about how sales will grow or decline going forward but in a zero growth economy this multiplier should be stable over the long run   it might however still fluctuate over the short term but more about that in a minute    note that all of this applies to aggregate growth across all firms   individual firms can still grow of course but as they must do this by gaining market share from other companies such growth would be balanced by a decline for some other firm   also i 've assumed zero net exports that 's one of the technicalities i mentioned above because obviously you could have export driven growth even if the domestic economy were stationary however often when people talk about growth in the market what they really mean is return   that is how much does your investment earn for you   this is n't really the same thing as growth but people often think of it that way particularly in the saving phase of their investing career when they are reinvesting their returns and therefore their account balances are growing   it is possible to have a positive return averaged across the market even in a stationary economy   the reason why is that there are really only two things a firm can do with its net profits   one possibility is that it could invest it in growing the business   however there is not much point in doing that in a stationary economy because by assumption no increase in aggregate consumption and therefore in the long run aggregate production are possible   therefore firms are left with only the second option which is to pay them out to investors as dividends   those dividends provide a return that is independent of economic growth would the stock market still be a good investment in such an economy   yes   well sort of   the rate of return from firms dividend payouts will depend on investors demand in aggregate for returns on their investments   stock prices will rise or fall causing returns to respectively fall or rise to find that level   if your personal desire for returns is lower than the average across the investing public then the stock market would look like a good investment   if your desired return is higher than the average then it will look like a poor investment   the marginal investor will of course be indifferent   the practical upshot of this is that the people who invest in the stock market in this scenario will be precisely the ones for whom the stock market is a good investment given their personal propensity to save and desire for returns and so forth finally you mentioned that in your scenario the gdp stagnation is due to declining population   i am less certain what this means for investment but my first thought is that you would have a large retired population selling its investments to fund late life consumption and you would have a comparatively small relative to history working population buying those assets   this would lead to low asset prices and therefore high rates of return   however that 's assuming that retirees need to sell assets to fund their retirement consumption   if the absolute returns on retirees assets are large enough to fund their retirement consumption then you would wind up with relatively few sellers resulting in high prices and therefore relatively low rates of return   it 's not obvious to me which effect would dominate and so it 's hard to say whether or not the resulting returns would look attractive to the working age population

futures are an agreement to buy or sell something in the future   the futures price is the price at which you agree to make the trade   this price does not indicate what will happen in the future so much as it indicates the cost of buying the item today and holding it until the future date   hence for very liquid products such as stock index futures the futures price is a very simple function of today 's stock index value and current short term interest rates   if the stock exchange is closed but the futures exchange is open then using the futures price and interest rates one can back out an implied fair value for the index which is in essence the market 's estimate of what the stock index value would be right now if the stock market were open   of course as soon as the stock exchange opens the futures price trades to within a narrow band of the actual index value where the size of the band depends on transaction costs bid ask spread commissions etc

borrow money from the central bank wrong premise they can not borrow as much as they want and they can not borrow without collateral i.e. government debt instruments they hold or any other instrument with value   and banks do n’t have unlimited collateral to borrow against   secondly central banks are n’t in the business of lending unlimited money the more money they lend out the more is the money supply which inflation which will eventually lead them to stop lending at any point of time they want a certain amount of money movement so they can control inflation and interest rates within an agreed limit and as limited by their economy no sane central bank would want to by printing money at will e g helicopter money so the only other way for banks is to accept deposits from private individuals you can also argue that banks make money by connecting lenders and borrowers and make their profit by being the middleman without using their assets so you can say they are making a profit with the minimum usage of their capital albeit they have the central bank looking over their shoulder to police their behaviour while some banks do charge fees for keeping deposits yes but many provide certain extra services for which they charge that is how they differentiate between no fee accounts and fee paying accounts

# 458345
great answers here 's my two cents first do n't forget to look at the overall picture not just the dividend study the company 's income statement balance sheet and cash flow statement for the last few years make sure they have good earnings potential and are not carrying too much debt i know it 's dull but it 's better to miss an opportunity than to buy a turkey and watch the dividends and the share price tank i went through this with bac bank of america a couple of years ago they had a history of rising dividends when i bought them and the yield was about 8 then the banking crisis happened and the dividend went from $ to $ 0.04 and the price fell from $ 40 to $ 5 i stuck with it continuing to buy at lower and lower prices and eventually sold them all at $ 12 and managed to break even but it was not a pleasant experience do your homework still one of the most reliable ways to judge a company 's dividend paying ability is to look at its dividend history once a company has started paying a dividend there is a strong expectation from shareholders that these payments will continue and the company 's management will try very hard to maintain them though sometimes this does n't work out e.g. bac you should see an uninterrupted stream of non decreasing payments over a period of at least 5 years this timeframe is just a rule of thumb well established profitable companies also tend to increase their dividends over time which has the added benefit of pushing up their share price so you 're getting increasing dividends and capital gains next look at the company 's payout ratio over time and the actual cost of the dividend can the projected earnings cover the dividend cost without going above the payout ratio if not then the dividend is likely to get reduced in the case of the dividend history is short and erratic the earnings are also all over the place so it 's hard to predict what will happen next year the company is up to its eyeballs debt current ratio is .2 and its earnings have dropped by 20 in the last quarter they have lost money in two of the last three years even though earning have jumped dramatically this is a very young company and in my opinion it is too early for them to be paying dividends a very speculative stock and you are more likely to make money from capital gains than dividends is a different story they are profitable and have a long dividend history although the dividend was cut in half recently this may be a good to buy them hoping the dividend comes back once the economy recovers however they are trading at over 40 times earnings which seems expensive considering their low profit margins before investing your money invest in your education get some books on interpretation of financial and learn how to read the numbers it 's sort of like looking at the codes in the matrix and seeing the in the red dress or whatever it was good luck

so my advice for your financial situation depends on your aims are you aiming to    completely clear your debt    clear one card to free up more monthly income      clear some debt to allow further controlled spending    clear one card and focus on just using one having 2nd as emergency there are other things you may wish to do but you said to pay off some all of 2 credit card bills if you want to contact me i can plan this more precisely some seem the same but other factors can come into play as well differing rates of interest make the options clearer my first advice would be to call the card companies and see if you can get better rates first scenario some figures made up for visual credit card debts     8,000        8,000 monthly payment        100            100 apr 10              10 ignoring apr this will be 80 months to repay otherwise 140 months using my example amounts above £ 28,000 repaid over 11 years 8 months   your suggestion as per your suggestion originally paying off cards equally will allow smaller debt on both cards credit card debt       3,000       3,000 monthly payment        100           100 apr 10             10 with a 0 apr this would be paid off in 2 years 6 months cards are available to get free balance transfers need to look into this with the 10 apr this would take 3 years 1 month £ 10,000 lump and £ repaid over 3 years 1 month saving £ and 8 years 7 months aim to clear debt completely my advice here is to use the £ 10,000 lump sum to pay off one credit card the remaining £ 2,000 can then come off the other card this will free up your outgoings was 2 x £ 100 by £ 100 but then use this £ 100 to pay off the card this will result in the following credit card debt       6,000 monthly payment        200 apr 10 with a 0 apr this would be paid off in 2 years 6 months cards are available to get free balance transfers need to look into this with 10 apr this would take roughly 3 years 1 month £ 10,000 lump and £ repaid over 3 years 1 month saving £ and 8 years 7 months    this option is the same as above but you have the options on the odd tight month to reduce payments to £ 100    this also will allow the 2nd card to be used interest free for an emergency purchase to be paid off without any interest charge    if rates are different pay of the one with the higher apr aim clear one card to free up more monthly income   aim clear one card and focus on just using one having 2nd as emergency same as above but do n’t increase to £ 200 leave monthly payment at £ 100 credit card debt       6,000 monthly payment        100 apr 10 with a 0 apr this would be paid off in 5 years with the 10 apr this would take 88 months 7 years 4 months £ 10,000 lump and £ repaid over 7 years and 4 months saving £ and 4 years 4 months    this also allows for some extra spending even racking back up the debt although not advised aim clear some debt to allow further controlled spending as above apart from this will allow you to spend to get back up to full £ 16,000 debt note my figures are theoretical paying off £ 500 £ a month instead of the £ 100 would take lump sum 10,000 remaining 6,000 14 months £ 17,000 paid lump sum 5,000 remaining 2 x 5,500 26 months £ 18,000 paid lump sum 0 remaining 2 x 8,000 40 months £ 20,000 paid now i have finished i hope you have an idea on what you are aiming to achieve and a better idea of what to do when you receive the income stephen

platinum use is pretty heavily overweight in industrial areas according to the linked wikipedia article tonnes of platinum was sold in 2006 of which 130 tonnes went to vehicles emissions control devices and another tonnes to electronics gold sees substantial use as an investment as well as to hedge against economical decline and inflation with comparatively little industrial real world as some put it use that is their principal difference from an investment point of view according to wikipedia 's article on platinum during periods of economic uncertainty the price of platinum tends to decrease due to reduced industrial demand falling below the price of gold gold prices are more stable in slow economic times as gold is considered a safe haven and gold demand is not driven by industrial uses if your investment scenario is a tanking world economy for reason of its large industrial usage i for one would not count on platinum to not fall in price of course gold may fall in price as well but since it is not primarily an industrial use commodity i would personally expect gold to do better in such a scenario

and to answer your other questions about fees there are a number of sites that compare brokers fees google broker fee comparison i like the motley fool although there are a lot of others however do n't go just by the comparison sites because they can be out of date and usually just have the basic fees once you find a broker that you like go to that broker 's site and get all the fees as of now you ca n't sell the shares that are in your charles schwab account using some other broker however you can possibly now definitely eventually see below transfer the shares to another broker and then sell them there but be aware that charles schwab might charge you a fee to transfer the shares out which will probably be larger than the fee they 'll charge you to sell the shares unless you 're selling them a few at a time for example i have a charles schwab account through my previous employer and it 's $ 9.99 commission to sell shares but $ 50 to transfer them out note that your fees might be different even though we 're both at charles schwab because employers can negotiate individual deals there should be somewhere on the site that has a fee schedule but if you ca n't find it send them a message or call them one final thing to be aware of shares you get from an employer often have restrictions on sale or transfer or negative tax consequences on sale or transfer that shares just bought on the open market would n't so make sure you investigate that before doing anything with the shares

the share price on its own has little relevance without looking at variations in your case if the stock went from 2.80 to you should care only about the 88 drop in value not what it means in pre split dollar values you are correct that you can un split to give you an idea of what would have been the dollar value but that should not give you any more information than the variation of 88 would as for your title question you should read the chart as if no split occurred as for most intents and purposes it should not affect stock price other than the obvious split

if you have not already hired another potentially your best solution might be to try and work out something with these folks presuming of course that they still have access to their equipment etc and to the extent that what you have paid might cover their labor equipment use etc there might be some way for them to provide the services you have paid for if you pay for materials such as the food itself directly this presumes of course that it 's only the irs that they stiffed and have not had most of their material capital assets repossessed or seized   and you still trusted them enough to work out something otherwise as duff points out you will likely need to file a small claims lawsuit and get in line with any other creditors

sure but as a retail client you 'd be incurring transaction fees on entry and exit do you have the necessary tools to manage all the corporate actions too and index rebalances    etf managers add value by taking away the monstrous web of clerical work associated with managing a portfolio of at times hundreds of different names with this comes the value of institutional brokerage commissions data licenses etc i think if you were to work out the actual brokerage cost as well as the time you 'd have to spend doing it yourself you 'd find that just buying the etf is far cheaper   also a bit of a rabbit hole but how would you with traditional retail client tools even coordinate the simultaneous purchase of all 500 components of something like spy i would guess that on average you 're going to have significantly worse slippage to the index than a typical etf provider add that into your calculation too

as pointed out in their answer at any given time there is a finite amount of stock available in a company one you may be missing is that there is always a price associated with an offer to buy shares that is you do n't put in an order simply to buy 1 share of abc you put in an order to buy 1 share of abc for $ 10 if no one is willing to sell a share of abc for $ 10 then your order will go unfilled this happens millions of times a day as traders try to figure the cheapest price they can get for a stock practically speaking there is always a price at which people are willing to sell their shares you can put in a market order for 1 share of abc which says essentially i want one share of abc and i will pay whatever the market deems to be the price your broker will find you 1 share but you may be very unhappy about the price you have to pay while it 's very rare for a market to have nobody willing to sell at any price it occasionally happens that no one is willing to buy at any price this causes a market crash as in the 2007 2008 financial crisis when suddenly everyone became very suspicious of how much debt the major banks actually held and for a few days very few traders were willing to buy bank stocks at any price

when clearing funds from the sale of a home the following usually happens usa the left over amount is what you get   your real estate agent should be able to go over all of that with you if they have n't then you need to get a better real estate agent assuming you have n't listed the house on the market yet then you should probably start by finding out what the pay off amount is on your existing home call your mortgage company then look at the prices of recently sold homes in your neighborhood for a comparable house same style square footage amenities to see what it sold for now you will know exactly what all those costs are prior to sitting down and signing the paperwork for the sale during the closing proceedings   if for some reason the amount is less than what you owe on it then the mortgage company would have to be involved for you to even sell it if the real estate market in your area is somewhat normal you bought the house on a standard fixed rate mortgage you 've been paying faithfully these past 17 years you have n't gotten a home equity line of credit heloc loan or otherwise cashed out of your equity at any point you 've kept up the maintenance of the place and there are no liens against the property ie unpaid taxes lawsuits etc then it is highly likely you will get money from the sale of the house   however we internet people do n't know any of those details so talk to a good real estate agent

as many people here have pointed out a cfd is a contract for difference when you invest in stock at etoro you buy a cfd reflecting a bid on the price movement of the underlying stock however you do not actually own the stock or hold any rights shareholders have the counterparty to the cfd is etoro when you close your position etoro shall pay you the amount representing the difference between your buy and sell price for each stock   i suggest you read the following article about cfds it explains everything clearly and thoroughly as some of the responders have pointed out and as is mentioned in the article a broker can potentially the prices of underlying assets in order to manipulate cfds to their advantage however etoro is a highly reputable broker with over 2 million active accounts and we guarantee accurate stock quotes furthermore etoro is regulated in europe germany uk france etc by institutions that exact strict regulations on the cfd trading sector and we are obligated to comply with these regulations which include accurate price quoting   and of course cfd trading at etoro has tremendous benefits unlike a direct stock investment etoro allows you to invest as much or as little as you like in your favorite stocks even if the amount is less than the relevant stock price i.e. fraction stocks for example   if you invest $ 10 in microsoft and on the day of execution etoro ’s average aggregated price was $ 30 after a spread of 0.1 you will then have a cfd representing stocks of microsoft in your etoro account in addition with etoro you can invest in stock in the context of a social trading network meaning that you can utilize the stock trading expertise of other trader to your advantage by following them learning their strategies and even copying their stock investments automatically to put it briefly you wo n’t be facing the stock market alone   before you make a decision i suggest that you try stock trading with an etoro demo account a free demo account grants you access to all our instruments at real market rates as well as access to our social network where you can view and participate in trader discussions about trading stocks with etoro all without risking your hard earned money bottom line it ’s free there are no strings attached and you can get a much idea of what trading stocks with etoro is like if you have any further questions please do n’t hesitate to contact us through our site

this is my two cents pun intended   it was too long for a comment so i tried to make it more of an answer   i am no expert with investments or islam anything on a server exists physically   it exists on a hard drive tape drive and/or a combination thereof   it is stored as data which on a hard drive are small particles that are charged where each bit is represented by that electric charge   that data exists physically   it also depends on your definition of physically   this data is stored on a hard drive which i deem physical though is transferred via electric often via fiber cable   do n't fall for marketing words like cloud   data must be stored somewhere and is often redundant and backed up to me money is just paper with an amount attached to it   it tells me nothing about its value in a market   a $ 1 bill was worth a lot more 3 decades ago you could buy more goods because it had a higher value than it is today   money is simply an indication of the value of a good you traded at the time you traded   at a simplistic level you could accomplish the same thing with a friend saying if you buy lunch today i 'll buy lunch next time   there was no exchange in money between me and you but there was an exchange in the value of the lunch if that makes sense   the same thing could have been accomplished by me and you exchanging half the lunch costs in physical money or credit debit card or check any type of investment can be considered gambling   though you do get some sort of proof that the investment exists somewhere   investments may go up or down in value at any given time   perhaps with enough research you can make educated investments but that just makes it a smaller gamble   nothing is guaranteed   currency investment is akin to stock market investment in that it may go up or down in value in comparison to other currencies though it does n't make you an owner of the money 's issuer generally it 's similar   i find if you keep all your money in u.s. dollars without considering other nations that 's a sort of ignorant way of gambling you 're betting your money will lose value less slowly than if you had it elsewhere or in multiple places back on track to your question i really buying that currency   you are trading a currency   you are giving one currency and exchanging it for another   i guess you could consider that buying since you can consider trading currency for a piece of software as buying something or is the situation more like playing with the live rates it depends on your perception of playing with the live rates   investments to me are long term commitments with reputable research attached to it that i intend to keep through highs and lows unless something triggers me to change my investment elsewhere   if by playing you mean risk as described above you will have a level of risk   if by playing you mean not taking it seriously then do thorough research before investing and do n't be trading every few seconds for minor returns trying to make major returns out of minor returns my opinion or doing anything based on a whim was that money created out of thin air i suggest you do more research before starting to trade currency into how markets and trading works   think of a market as a closed system with other markets such as uk market french market etc   each can interact with each other   the u.s. or any market has a set number of dollars in the pool   $ 100 for example 's sake   each $ 1 has a certain value associated with it   if for some reason the country decides to create more paper that is green says $ 1 and stamps presidents on them money and adds 15 $ 1 to the pool making it $ 115 each one of these dollars value goes down   this can also happen with goods   this along with the trading of goods between markets peoples attachment of value to goods of the market and peoples perception of the market is what currency trading in simple terms   so essentially no money is not made out of thin air   money is a medium for value   though values are always changing and money is a static amount you are attempting to trade values and own the medium that has the most value if that makes sense   values of goods are constantly changing this is a learning process for me as well so i hope this helps answers your questions you seem to have   as stated above i 'm no expert i 'm actually quite new to this so i probably missed a few things here and there

think of all the limit orders waiting in line first organized by price and then by the time the order was placed earlier orders are closer to the front of the line   in order for your buy order to trade there must be no other limit orders of 10.01 or higher or the sellers order would have matched with them instead so once your order is filled the price is 10.00 even if just for a millisecond because there was a trade at 10.00 even though the price might go right back up after the trade

gt but the buying power of that money can be significantly reduced to the point where it 's fundamentally useless i.e. inter war germany and many countries in south and central america   that 's true but how does that come about the effect on buying power stems from the level of spending in the present period too little leaves you anywhere from outright deflation and contraction to weaker growth falling short of capacity too much reaches capacity and keeps spending bidding up prices and driving down purchasing power   it has nothing to do with debt gdp or interest payments   gt germany managed to skate by by creating a new in a confidence trick and it worked because germany is a solid iron clad manufacturing powerhouse of a lot of stuff    there are two important differences between inter war germany and the us first is that inter war germany lost a this real shock is kind of important when you 're talking about buying power of money one side of it is the amount of money in circulation but the other side of it is how much real output there is to buy and german real output capacity collapsed after the war their most productive regions were occupied territory and they were no longer a powerhouse manufacturing a lot of stuff driving down the value of their currency   so lesson number one from germany real output collapse harms your currency   the second problem is that losing a war left germany saddled with war denominated in foreign currency when you 're on the hook for something you do n't print you 're in a situation where you can run out of money and that 's exactly what happened to them they tried printing more of their own currency to buy the foreign stuff with but that quickly drove down the value of german currency   so lesson number two from germany is you do n't want to be on the hook for a currency you do n't issue   put the two together and you have a real supply shock + foreign denominated debt the buying power of german currency it was n't debt gdp but the real basis for their economy collapsing out from under them pushed along by a need for foreign currency   gt;my question is at what point do we engage washington 's unlimited money printing presses until we reach that point   in answer to your question the printing presses are what funds the real economy the worry in terms of avoiding that point is in making sure we keep that real economy productive and fully funded ironically taking our eye off the ball to focus on budget balance at the expense of real output pushes the economy in the direction you 're afraid of going see also the euro zone today

no do n't bother   you need to decide what you are saving for and how much risk you are prepared to take it would make sense if you wanted the money only in x years and could n't afford to lose say 20 or more if the stock market crashed the day before you needed the cash   typically if you are about to retire and buy an annuity you want to protect your capital   this is n't you at 28 you might be saving for a wedding a deposit on a house possibly for school fees or for eventual retirement   it does n't sound like you need to get back exactly 24k in july 2022 keep the 6 months expenses in accounts that you can withdraw from at short notice   some of this in a current account some might be in a savings account that does n't pay interest if you make withdrawals after that i 'd stick most of the rest in stock market tracker funds but you might go for actively managed funds instead ask another question and take professional advice there will presumably be local tax considerations too and add in most of your monthly savings too   these should beat the 2.3 over the 5 years and you can liquidate them easily if you want to buy a house if there is a recession and a stock market dip you presumably have the flexibility to hold on to them longer for the economy to recover   and if you are intending to buy a house then a recession will probably also involve a fall in house prices so the loss in your savings will be somewhat balanced by the drop in the purchase price of your house of course the worst case scenario is a severe downturn where you lose your job are unemployed for a considerable period of time burn through your emergency fund and need to sell shares at a considerable loss to meet your expenses    you might have family or dependents that you can borrow from or would need to support which would change your tolerance for risk   having money locked away for 5 years in this scenario is even worse   so if you do n't want to put all your non emergency savings into the stock market you still want to choose something that is accessible at a slightly lower interest rate but ultimately it sounds like you can afford to lose some of your savings and the probability is that you will be rewarded with much better returns than 2.3 over 5 years

i would say generally the answer is no    there might be some short term relief to people in certain situations but generally speaking you sign a contract to borrow money and you are responsible to pay   this is why home loans offer better terms then auto loans and auto loans better than credit cards or things like furniture   the better terms offer less risk to the lender because there are assets that can be repossessed   homes retain values better than autos autos better than furniture and credit cards are not secured at all people are not as helpless as your question suggests   sure a person might lose their high paying job but could they still make a mortgage payment if they worked really hard at it   this might mean taking several part time jobs   now if a person buys a home that has a very large mortgage payment this might not be possible   however wise people do n't buy every bit of house they can afford    people should also be wise about the kinds of mortgages they use to buy a home   many people lost their homes due to missing a payment on their interest only loan   penalty rates and fees jacked up their payment that was way beyond their means   if they had a fixed rate loan the chance to catch up would have not been impossible perhaps an injury might prevent a person from working   this is why long term disability insurance is a must for most people   you can buy quite a bit of coverage for not very much money typical us households have quite a bit of debt   car payments phone payments and either a mortgage or rent and of course credit cards   if income is drastically reduced making all of those payments becomes next to impossible   which one gets paid first   just this last week i attempted to help a client in just this situation   they foolishly chose to pay the credit card first and were going to pay the house payment last if there was anything left over   there was n't and they are risking eviction renters      people finding themselves in crisis generally do a poor job of paying the most important things first   basic food first housing and utilities second etc   let the credit card slip if need be no matter how often one is threatened by creditors   they do this to maintain their credit score how foolish i feel like you have a sense of associated with debt   it is there and real despite many people noticing it   there is also the fact that compounding interest is working against you and with your labor you are enriching the bank   this is a great reason to have the goal of living a debt free life   i can tell you it is quite

someone messed up here my tax accountant says she is supposed to enter the values as they are on the w2 and said they will not issue a new w2 because they were not involved in the refund of the money correct we decided that we will enter a value different from d subtract the money that was refunded to me because it 's already on the 1099   incorrect is there an alternative to avoid paying taxes twice on the 401k if not is there a better way to do this to minimize the risk of an audit you should enter the amounts in w2 as they are otherwise things wo n't tie at the irs and they will come back asking questions the amount in box was deducted from your wages pre tax so you did n't pay tax on it the distribution is taxable and if it was made before the tax day next year only taxable once so if you withdrew the same year of the contribution as it sounds like you did you will only pay tax on it once because the amounts were not included in your salary if the 1099-r is marked with the correct code the irs will be able to match the excess contribution box and the removal of the excess contribution 1099-r with the code and it will all tie no one will audit you the accountant is probably clueless as to how her software works by default the accounting software will add the excess contribution on w2 box back into wages and it will be added to taxable income on your tax return however when you type in the 1099 with the proper code this should be reversed by the software and if it is not should be manually this should be done at the adjustment entry not the w2 entry screen since a copy of the w2 will be transmitted with your tax return and should match the actual w2 transmitted by your employer if she does n't know what she 's doing find someone who does

as you own a company you need to know what your role is you can never just move money into or out of the company you have to identify the role in which you are doing it and do it properly   there is company and there is you in three different roles you are the sole shareholder and director of company you are the sole employee of company you are also just a private person you need to keep these three roles separate as the sole shareholder you own the company however you do n't own any assets of the company the company is yours but the money in its bank account is n't   as a private person you give a loan to your company you write on a sheet of paper that you personally give a loan to the company how much a loan is what interest is paid and when the loan will be paid back that could be whenever you demands the money paid back then you move the money from your private bank account to the company bank account and the company has the money it needs to fund its operation assume it was n't you who loaned the money but i gave the loan to the company you can imagine that i would have this loan written down and signed before i hand over the cash and you must have exactly the same papers that i would have   how do you get money from the company the company can pay back your loan that should be written down again in the same way as the loan itself was written down other than that there are three ways how you can get money out of the company the company can pay you in your role as its employee a salary which it can deduct from its profits the company can pay money into a pension of the company director that 's you in your role as company director up to £ 40,000 or so a year that money is deducted from its profits again the company pays 20 tax on its remaining profits then the company can pay you in your role as company director a dividend usually twice a year each of these payments has to be written down and given to hmrc properly   best by far to use an accountant to do all the paper work for you and advice you what to do you can lose a lot of money by just not getting the paperwork right by filing late etc which the accountant will get right the accountant will also tell you what are the optimal amounts for salary and dividend best is a small salary about £ 10,000 a year dividend of about £ 30,000 a year pension as much as the company can afford which is then all tax free to you you ca n't pay more dividend then the company can afford paying a dividend and then not being able to pay your suppliers is criminal and if you want higher dividends then you will have to pay taxes on them

behind the scenes of banking are a lot of very manual processes especially when something goes wrong these take extra time not only because it involves people reviewing what went wrong but also because the bank will take extra steps to reduce human error e.g. technical jargon about maker checker dual controls something like this can easily get held up for a month and the best way to jump the queue is to start complaining a lot calling customer service frequently asking to talk to management and otherwise the bank until someone senior gets your problem fast tracked so you stop giving them a headache

this depends in part on the bank holding your loan and the loan agreement   some loans will accept partial payments and apply them immediately some will not accept partial payments at all and some will accept the payment but hold the funds until the payment is at least your complete payment   you should check your loan agreement to find out how the payment will be processed as well as how it will be applied it also is relevant how interest is calculated and accrued if your interest is a daily rate then you may save some money this way but if it 's a monthly rate then you would n't necessarily   either way you would n't really save very much money in your particular case you 'd be saving $ 0.15 per month = .001 interest rate $ 150 paid halfway through the month means you pay .001 150 less interest   is that $ 0.15 worth it   up to you i guess   if you 're paying that for 5 year loan you 'll end up ahead $ 9 at the end of it finally there is a kind of program often offered to new mortgage holders where you pay every two weeks like your paycheck and thus pay down your mortgage faster by saving on interest which is true but it 's because you make 26 half payments per year instead of 12 full or 24 half payments not primarily because of particular savings on interest due to timing and of course the program has to make money somewhere   paying an extra each year is certainly a good way to pay off your loan faster but it 's not primarily due to the frequency of those payments

if you have 100 of your money in one security that is inherently more risky than splitting your money 50/50 between two securities regardless of the purported riskiness of the two securities the calculations people use to justify their particular breed of diversification may carry some assumptions related risk reward calculations   but these particular do n't change the fact that spreading your money across different assets protects your money from value variances of the individual assets   splitting your $ 100 between apple and microsoft stock is probably less valuable less well diversified than splitting your money between apple and whole foods stock but either way you 're carrying less risk than putting all $ 100 in to apple stock regardless of the assumed rates of return for any of these companies stock specifically edit i 'm sure the downvotes are because i did n't make a big deal about correlation and measuring correlation and standard deviations of returns and detailed portfolio theory   measuring efficacy and justifying your particular allocations that generally uses data from the past to project the future is all well and good   fact of the matter is if you have 100 of your money in stock that 's more stock risk than 25 in cash 25 in bonds and 50 in stock would be because now you 're in different asset classes   you can measure to your hearts delight the effects of splitting your money between different specific companies or different industries or different market or different countries or different fund managers or different whatever metrics and doing any of those things will reduce your exposure to those specific allocations    it may be worth pointing out that currently the hot recommendation is a plain vanilla market tracking s&p 500 index fund that just buys some of each of the 500 largest us companies without any consideration given to risk correlation over standard deviation calculating actively managed funds   if you ask me that speaks volumes of the true efficacy of hyper analyzing the purported correlations of various securities

stock basically implies your ownership in the company if you own 1 ownership in a company the value of your stake becomes equal to 1 of the valuation of the entire company dividends are basically of company 's profits to its shareholders by holding stocks of a company you become eligible to receiving dividends proportional to your ownership in the company dividends though are not guaranteed as the company may incur losses or the management may decide to use the cash for future growth instead of it to the shareholders for example let 's say a company called abc inc is listed on nyse and has a total of 1 million shares issued let 's say if you purchase 100 stocks of abc your ownership in abc will become let 's say that the share price at the time of purchase was $ 10 each total investment = stock price number of stocks purchased = $ 10 100 = $ 1,000 now let 's say that the company declares a dividend of $ 1 per share then   dividend yield = dividend stock price = $ = 10 if one has to draw analogy with other banking products one can think of stock and dividend as fixed deposits analogous to stock and the interest earned on the fixed deposit analogous to dividend

i am in australia but i think the banks in the uk would use similar your options 1 and 2 are basically no why would the bank consider your wife to be paying you rent when you live together these are the type of practices that led to the gfc and since then practices have been tightened regarding option 3 yes banks do take into consideration rent in their analysis of your loan however they would not include the full rent in their calculations but about 70 to 75 of the full rent this allows for loss of rent during vacant periods and adds a safety factor in their but they will not include the rent itself you would have to have other income as well to support your loan saying that we do have low doc loans in australia loans with little documentation required to get a loan with these loans you basically have to make a declaration that you are telling the truth regarding your income sources and you can only usually borrow a lower lvr as these loans are seen as a bigger risk these type of loans have also been tightened up since the gfc

what percent of my salary should i save is tightly coupled with its companion what size nest egg should my husband and i have and by what age interestingly mr 's answer 10 is the number that plugs into the equation that i reference jay 's 25x rule is part of this we start with the assumption that one 's required income at retirement will be 80 of their pre retirement income that 's high by some observations low by others a quick look at the expenses that go away in retirement the above can total 35 40 it would be great if it ended there but there are costs that go up the above extra spending is tough to nail down after all you knew what you spent and what 's going away but the new items crapshoot for non native speakers this refers to a game with dice meaning a random event again referencing mr 's answer financial planners whom you could pay to give you a very accurate number i 'm going to disagree with that consider when retirement is 30 years away you do n't know much if i can offer an analogy i once had the pleasure of hearing jim the played by tom in apollo 13 give a speech he said that for the first 99 of the trip to the moon they simply aimed ahead of their target never directly at the moon in this manner i suggest that with so many variables accuracy is impossible it 's a moving target start young take the 10 offered and keep saving every few years stop and see if you are on target if not bump the number a bit   better to turn 50 and find that after a good decade you 've reached your number and can drop your savings to a minimum perhaps just to capture a 401(k match than to turn 50 and realize you 've and need to bump to an unsustainable level imagine planning ahead in 1999 you 've seen 2 great decades of returns and even realizing that could n't continue you plan for a below average 7 this would double your 1999 balance in 10 years instead you saw zero return for a decade in sum when each variable has an accuracy of + you are not going to combine them all and get a number with even 10 accuracy as if were wrong but the pro would tell you 11 is right for you this is as absurd as packaging up a bunch of c rated debt and thinking that enough of this paper would yield a final product that was aaa

this is lan investment analyst at betterment to answer your question american investors are drawn to use the s&p 500 spy as a benchmark to measure the performance of betterment portfolios particularly because it ’s familiar and it ’s the index always reported in the news however going all in to invest in spy is not a good investment strategy and even using it to compare your own diversified investments is misleading we outline some of the pitfalls of this approach in this article why the s&p 500 is a bad benchmark an algo advisor service like betterment is a preferable approach and provides a number of advantages over simply investing in etfs spy or others like voo or ivv that track the s&p 500   so why invest with betterment rather than in the s&p 500 let ’s first look at the issue of diversification spy only exposes investors to stocks in the u.s. large cap market this may feel acceptable because of home bias which is the tendency to invest disproportionately in domestic equities relative to foreign equities regardless of their home country   however investing in one geography and one asset class is riskier than global diversification because inflation risk exchange rate risk and interest rate risk will likely affect all u.s. stocks to a similar degree in the event of a u.s. downturn in contrast a well diversified portfolio invests in a balance between bonds and stocks and the ratio of bonds to stocks is dependent upon the investment horizon as well as the individual 's goals   by constructing a portfolio from stock and bond etfs across the world betterment reduces your portfolio ’s sensitivity to swings and the diversification goes beyond mere asset class and geography for example betterment ’s basket of bond etfs have varying durations e.g. short term treasuries have an effective duration of less than six months vs. u.s. corporate bonds which have an effective duration of just more than 8 years and credit quality the level of diversification further helps you manage risk   dan betterment ’s director of behavioral finance and investing examined the increase in returns by moving from a u.s only portfolio to a globally diversified portfolio on a risk adjusted basis the betterment portfolio has historically outperformed a simple diy investor portfolio by as much as 1.8 per year attributed solely to diversification    now let ’s assume that the investor at hand investor a is a sophisticated investor who understands the importance of diversification additionally let ’s assume that he understands the optimal allocation for his age risk appetite and investment horizon investor a will still benefit from investing with betterment   automating his portfolio management with betterment helps to insulate investor a from the or the tendency for investors to sacrifice returns due to bad timing studies show that individual investors lose on average anywhere between 1.2 to 4.3 due to the behavior gap and this gap can be as high as 6.5 for the most active investors compared to the average investor betterment customers have a behavior gap that is 1.25 lower how betterment has implemented smart design to discourage market timing and short sighted decision making   for example betterment ’s tax impact preview feature allows users to view the tax hit of a withdrawal or allocation change before a decision is made currently betterment is the only automated investment service to offer this capability this function allows you to see a detailed estimate of the expected gains or losses broken down by short- and long term making it possible for investors to make better decisions about whether short term gains should be deferred to the long term now for the sake of comparison let ’s assume that we have an even more sophisticated investor investor b who understands the pitfalls of the behavior gap and is somehow able to avoid it betterment is still a better tool for investor b because it offers a suite of tax efficient features including tax loss harvesting smarter cost basis accounting municipal bonds smart dividend reinvesting and more each of these strategies can be automatically deployed inside the portfolio investor b need not do a thing each of these strategies can boost returns by lowering tax exposure to return to your initial question why not simply invest in the s&p 500 investing is a long term proposition particularly when saving for retirement or other goals with a time horizon of several decades to be a successful long term investor means employing the core principles of diversification tax management and behavior management while the s&p might look like a investment one year there are always reversals of fortune the goal with long term passive investing the kind of investing that betterment offers is to help you reach your investing goals as efficiently as possible    lastly betterment offers best in industry advice about where to save and how much to save for no fee

if there is   no match and you are disciplined enough to contribute without it coming directly out of your paycheck dump the 401k.   the reason most 401 k plans have huge hidden fees built into the investment prices you wo n't see them directly but 3 is not uncommon 3 is a horrible drag on your investment performance get an ira or roth ira and pick something with low fees   bonus you will have a lot more investment choices

since you 've already maxed out your 401k and your ira if you wanted to invest then it would either be in a brokerage account or a 529 if you have intend on going back to school as to investing versus paying off your loans the interest on them are small enough that it will depend on your preference   if you need the cash flow for investment purposes ie if you are going to buy an investment property then i would pay off the car loan first otherwise i would invest the money    since you 've already expressed that you would n't be too interested in paying the mortgage off early i 've left that off the table i would prioritize car loan over mortgage for the cash flow reason   if you do open a brokerage account make sure you are minimizing your taxes by putting the right type of assets in a tax advantaged account

to expand on mhoran 's answer once you mention the 401(k we 're compelled to ask a what is the match if any and b what are the expenses within the funds offered   depositing to get the full match is going to get you the biggest return on your money it 's common to get a dollar for dollar match on the first 5 or 6 of your income if the fees are high you stop at the match and move to an ira for the next money you wish to save   at 22 i 'd probably focus on the roth if you have access to a roth 401(k that 's great the match will be pre tax dollars and you 'll get started with a decent tax status mix   these accounts can form the core of your investing most people have little left over once their retirement accounts are fully funded and yes reading to understand stocks is great but also to understand why stock indexing is the best choice for most investors

whenever you 're not sure you can always contact the regulatory agency in the location of the lender and see if they are registered   organizations that lend out money tend to get oversight and have reporting obligations   reputable banks in the united states will be a member of the fdic however without even looking anything up i can already tell this is a scam   an actual lender would be required to identify who you are beyond a doubt this is called kyc and in addition would have to report your loan to some sort of tax authority that means they must ask you for a tax identifier number of some kind and would probably want your full date of birth instead of just your age

what you 're getting at is the same as investing with leverage usually this comes in the form in a margin account which an investor uses to borrow money at a low interest rate invest the money and hopefully beat the interest rate   is this approach unwise that completely depends on how your investments perform and how high your loan 's interest rate is the higher your loan 's interest rate the more risky your investments will have to be in order to beat the interest rate if you can get a return which beats the interest rates of your loan then congratulations you have come out ahead and made a profit if you can keep it up you should make the minimum payment on your loan to maximize the amount of capital you can invest if not then it would be better to just use your extra cash to pay down the loan   are there really are investments aside from stocks and such that i can try to use to my advantage with interest rates as low as they are right now at least in the us you 'll probably be hard pressed to find a savings account or cd that will return a higher interest rate than your loan 's if you 're nervous about the risk associated with investing in stocks and bonds as is healthy then know that they come in a wide spectrum of risk it 's up to you to evaluate how much risk you 're willing to take on to achieve a higher return

the short answer is that the people who know are n't saying lisa blog author at ft has made a effort at figuring it out but working from what is publicly known and making some reasonable assumptions she ca n't even find $ 1 billion of losses much less 9    all we know for sure is that jpm sold massive amounts of protection on a particular cds index roughly that means that they sold insurance on a group of 125 companies and they would lose money if one of those companies went bankrupt or looked like it might go bankrupt and make money if those companies look less likely to go bankrupt    however they were certainly combining that position with other offsetting positions since their banking business loses money when companies go bankrupt it would make sense if they protected themselves with an even more massive position that made money when companies went bankrupt    a common strategy is to bet that the price of 1 thing will go up and the price of a very similar thing will go down so you are protected and can make money if both prices go up or if both go down however if the 2 things are not as similar as you thought you can lose money from both bets that 's what seems to have happened to jpm   dimon has basically said that jpm screwed up their calculations and positions that they thought were offsetting were not     what also seems likely is that other companies figured out that jp morgan had massive amounts of certain things that they needed to sell so jpm was forced to sell at bad prices you never want to play poker against someone who can see your hole cards   so my speculative theory is that the main point of the trading was to protect jpm if other companies went bankrupt but they did it with a complicated strategy that included selling protection they got the calculations wrong and then they were forced to sell at bad prices to other companies who knew they had to sell

you said your mother in law lives with you does she pay rent or are you splitting the cost of housing that would also have to figured into the equation   if you had a business you would now have to declare the expense on your business taxes this would also then be income for her which she would have to account for on her taxes remember there are both state and federal taxes involved regarding expenses like diapers if the mil had the business she could deduct them as a business expense if you have the business it would greatly complicate the taxes your business would be essentially covering your personal expenses if your mil was not a business the cost of diapers would be paid by you regardless of the working situation of you and your spouse to claim the tax credit you must report the name address and taxpayer identification number    either the social security number or the employer identification    number of the care provider on your return if the care provider is a    tax exempt organization you need only report the name and address on    your return you can use form pdf dependent care provider 's    identification and certification to request this information from the    care provider if you do not provide information regarding the care    provider you may still be eligible for the credit if you can show    that you exercised due diligence in attempting to provide the required    information the irs will be looking for an income tax form from your mil that claims the income   getting too cute with the babysitting situation by starting a business just for the purpose of saving money on taxes could invite an audit also it is not as if you just claim 3000 and you are good to go you can only claim a percentage of the expenses based on the household agi the more the make the more you have to have in expenses to get the full 3000 credit which mil cause more taxes for your mil plus the whole issue with having to pay social security and other taxes on a household employee it might be best to skip the risk of the audit claiming your mil as a dependent might just be easier

my experience is in the united states only in the past american express marketed its products as more exclusive and prestigious than other cards   there was an attempt to give the impression that cardholders were more qualified financially   in return fees were higher both to merchants and to cardholders   at the time early 1990 's it was not common to use credit cards for small purchases such as groceries or fast food   credit cards were used for larger purchases such as jewelry or electronics or dinner in a nicer restaurant once it became popular to use credit cards for everyday purchases the demand for customers using credit cards changed to the highest number of people instead of people of higher status   at that point visa and to a lesser extent mastercard transaction volume increased dramatically   merchants needed the largest number of customers with cards not the most financially stable   as visa volume grew and people started using visa for small purchases the use of american express decreased as their habits changed once someone got used to pulling out visa they did it in every situation   merchants are less willing to go through the extra hassle of accepting cards that are used by fewer people   over time i suspect this process led to the gap between visa and american express as a merchant in order to accept credit cards you have to set up a bank account and maintain a merchant account   accepting visa mc and discover can all be done through one account but american express has traditionally required a separate relationship as well as its own set of rules and fees that were generally higher   since there are relatively few american express cardholders compared to visa there is doubt about whether it is worth it accept the card   it depends upon the customer base   fine restaurants still generally accept american express

well it depends on whether or not your differentiating against if its capital stock or stock as in a share certificate in the company if its a share in the company then in my opinion using equity would be best as it is a form of an asset and does refer to a piece of ownership of the entity i would n't consider a share of stock a service since the service to you is say facebook or the broker who facilitates the transaction of buying or selling fb stock i also would not consider it a capital good as the capital good 's would be the referring to the actual capital like the servers other computer equipments etc

is there a solution here that would allow me to provide him with a    debit card in his name that i could fund that would n't have foreign    transaction fees associated with it i 'd probably be okay with a small    fixed atm fee   there are separate issues here   there is no law limiting bank accounts to u.s. citizens but most banks will not open an account for a non citizen outside their declared service area   there are substantial legal liabilities to the bank in allowing it whether a citizen or non citizen    the difficulty will be compliance with the patriot act   this is an extension of the older know your customer doctrine   it is improbable that the bank could comply with the act without the potential customer being physically present   you would have to check with your bank in advance as to their policies   banks are not required to accept a customer outside their policies as to waiving the foreign transaction fee that is very improbable   although a handful of institutions do this in specific cases it is uncommon because the bank is n't actually charging the fee they are passing it along   with a credit card they collect interest and waiving the fee can be thought of as a reduction in interest income that is n't possible on a debit card you would want to make sure you have a honest nephew   you could be held criminally liable for any actions he takes at both the state and the federal level   u.s. law is global   a citizen who commits a crime in any country of the world can be charged for it in the united states   by being on the account you can acquire any liabilities that are created as an   this is a bigger issue at the federal level because 4,000 federal laws do not require criminal intent   some do not require you to even know the action happened   unlike state law which generally requires you intended to commit a crime and had to be aware of it federal law often does not   it is also not adequate that the action is legal in russia if it would be illegal in the united states if i get a card in my name and give it to him to use to withdraw money from atms is that legal what problems might that cause it is legal but you are now strictly liable for its use   see the above answer   it would probably get shut down anyway when they phone you and asked are you in russia right now   the bank is still liable for you giving away the card   the bank may close out all your accounts and submit a currency transaction report on you to the treasury for possible money laundering wire the money   plan out how much and when but just wire it

yeah pretty much most hotels will have a long term rate that 's much cheaper if you 're staying weeks or months at a time however it 's not something that they highly publicize because otherwise normal hotel guests can feel that they 're being overcharged the weekly rate usually applies to bookings longer than three weeks and the monthly rate for those more than three months the place i stayed at also had 6 monthly and 12 monthly rates which were even less again and i knew some people who had been living there for 2 3 years   although i guess it depends on your budget when you compare the rates of corporate short stay accommodation you can sometimes get a better deal from a hotel if you just call and negotiate something there was an article i read about this a few years back on some dude who started doing this because it worked out cheaper than keeping a permanent place in london and a place in ny but i ca n't for the life of me find it now

you are asking if getting a mortgage nearly 4x your income has the potential to make you house poor $ 2500 of your $ 9000 gross is not too much according to the bank but the bank only looks at a few ratios not your entire budget is this house appropriate for your needs at 3x the median home price are you reaching too high note this board has had multiple budget discussions recently for many people the mortgage is just where the trouble starts the other house related budget items just multiply up to make things worse

ca n't totally agree with that volatility trading is just one trading type of many in my opinion it does n't depend on whether you are a professional trader or not   as you might have heard retail traders are said to create noise on the market mainly due to the fact that they are n't professional in their majority so i would assume if an average retail trader decided to trade volatility he would create as much noise as if would have been betting on stock directions basically most types of trading would require a considerable amount of effort spent on fundamental analysis of the underlying be it volatility or directional trading arbitrage trading would be an exception here i guess however volatility trading relies more on trader 's subjective expectations about future deviations whereas trading stock directions requires deeper research of the underlying is it a drawback or an advantage on the other hand side volatility trading strategies cover both upward and downward movements but you can set similar hedging strategies when going short or long on stocks is n't it to i think it is a matter of preference imagine yourself going long on s&p500 since 2009 do you think there are many volatility traders who have outperformed that

sell the house in the scenario you describe he is using the property as an investment with a $ 250 per month buy in this investment does n't make a return right now and when you add in the cost of dealing with the tenant even if he does n't have those cost now he will when they move is out of more than $ 250 a month and he has no direct knowledge that the value will definitely increase he would be better spent selling the house and putting the funds into an investment even a risky investment it will have less maintenance cost associated with the risky investment than the rental property   besides sitting on the property for 10 15 years would cost him 30 45k plus the cost of re renting the house when empty not to mention the inevitable increases in taxes over that time which will either increase his deficit or eat up the rent increase he is able to charge do n't take the loss on the sale just short sale it and take the money and invest one last thought an alternative is to creatively finance a sale take payments from a buyer until they can buy outright that will cover the full mortgage and get him the price he needs you can look up owner financing to find out more on how to do this hope this helps

you 're making $ 100k together per year you 're not in the hole you 're in the top 25 of all households and the top 10 of non family households as yours would be   to be blunt you 're not in the rely on assistance area you 're in the save up for your downpayment sector my suggestion would be to figure out a way to save more than $ a month for now   $ 100k gross income means you have about $ 8k net income per month $ 2k for rent and other necessities means you have $ 6k per month that you can potentially save   even half of that $ 3k per month means you have $ saved by the end of this year and $ on an annual basis as far as marriage or domestic partnership i would n't get into one based on whether it helps you afford a home   it might be a good idea because it helps you handle some of the details arising when you have joint property perhaps but not solely for the financial aspect and as far as how much home is realistic   $ 250k is certainly realistic if you can save up enough for a good down payment   try to get to the 20 25 range   if you 're already halfway there another year of renting wo n't kill you and it will mean no pmi and much better rates    also consider a 15 year mortgage we 're in the same general income category as you and manage a 15 year on a $ 250k range house quite nicely   it does n't add all that much to your monthly payment amount compared to what you 'd expect particularly since the monthly payment includes property taxes which wo n't increase based on the length of the mortgage now that we have actual numbers from the op so without cutting anything you have $ 2k yourself you can be saving   this assumes your rent number of $ is your portion of rent and not the 100 amount   that 's $ per year just by yourself   on top of that you 've got another $ 40k or so coming from your partner at least some of which should be available as well if he she is going to be co owning   but if not at least you have about $ 2000 a month you can be saving   you could also downsize the car cut cable tv downsize the phone and have another $ 500 or so available but it does n't really look like you need to do that given how much you have available now i 'd look at what you 're doing with that per month right now and see how you can free most of it up   you have n't mentioned a few things like utilities not sure if that 's just or if your partner is paying them so perhaps not all of it is available   but even $ 1000 a month is $ 12000 to add to the $ 20000 you have now which makes a big dent in that down payment

it can certainly help build a credit score but remember that businesses gain credit differently from individuals   depending on the country there is n't usually a national register of business credit ratings the way there is for individuals   the credit record you 'd be gaining is with your own bank only banks will usually base your business credit record on revenue and transactional loads rather than merely on having and holding a credit card   that said it is n't always that easy to get a business credit card and so it is a useful thing to have for credibility with clients depending on the type of work you do a credit card can also sometimes work out cheaper and faster for financing small overdrafts than a regular business overdraft facility   that said i 've found that larger loans over a five year term can work out much cheaper for an established business than they would for an individual even where the business itself has no history of using credit

my understanding is that credit card companies are allowed to accept retirement income as part of the income that would qualify you for credit the consumer finance protection bureau issued a final rule amendment to regulation z the regulations around truth in lending act in 2013 in response to some of the tightening of credit that resulted from the credit card act of 2009   the final rule allows for credit issuers to consider income and assets to which such consumers have a reasonable expectation of access page 1   on page 75 it outlines some examples other sources of income include interest or    dividends retirement benefits public assistance alimony child support and separate    maintenance payments current or reasonably expected income    also includes income that is being deposited regularly into an account on which the consumer is    an e.g. an individual deposit account or joint account assets include for    example savings accounts and investments fannie mae explicitly mentions ira distributions in its documentation requirements on mortgage applications   for them they require that the income be expected to continue for at least three years after the date of the mortgage application lenders can reject or lower your credit limit for just about any reason that they want but it seems appropriate for you to include your retirement distributions in your income for credit applications

when you withdraw money from an rrsp account it is added to your current year 's taxable income it does not matter what year the money was previously deposited in if you deposited money into an rrsp this year and withdrew the same amount of money then the net effect is that you have $ 5000 rrsp contribution and $ 5000 extra income and the two effects should cancel out the only remaining effect is that you wasted $ 5000 of contribution room which can never be regained the exception to this rule is that after 90 days you can withdraw funds from an rrsp for the hbp and llp without adding to your taxable income

the answer will vary person to person and situation to situation   but the basic concept to always consider is this   what interest rate am i paying on my debt 10 18   and what interest rate am i making on my savings investment etc 3 7   it wo n't give you a hard and fast answer but will definitely let you know if you should take a closer look at it   i 'd suggest talking to a financial planner about it   find a fee based planner that you can turn to to make sure you are on the right track not a commission based planner a fee based one   with respectful apologies to any commission based planners who may read this my instinct is usually to pay off the debt try to clean everything up so you do n't have anything outstanding that is charging you interest   debt is clutter it 's stressful it can be a reminder of money you wish you had n't spent   as long as you have access to money in case of emergency job loss etc get your debt paid off and keep it paid off   you 'll sleep much better

the classic definition of inflation is too much money chasing too few goods   within a tight range say 1 3 inflation is somewhat benign   there 's a nice inflation widget at the inflation calculator which helps me see that an item costing $ 1000 in 1975 would now 2010 be about $ 4000 and $ 1000 from 1984 till now just over $ 2000 i chose those two years to make a point first i am 48 i graduated college in 1984 so in my working life i 've seen the value of the dollar drop by half on the other hand it only took 9 years from 75 84 to see a similar amount of inflation occur   i 'd suggest that the 26 year period is far more acceptable than the 9 savers should be aware of their real return vs what was a result of inflation i 'm not either way but logically have to acknowledge the invisible tax of inflation i get a say 6 return pay 2 in tax but i 'm not ahead by 4 3 may be lost to inflation on the flip side my mortgage is 3.5 after taxes that 's but less than 0 after long term inflation so as a debtor i am benefiting by the effect of inflation on what i owe   interesting also to hear about deflation as we 've grown used to it in the case of electronics but little else perhaps the ipad wo n't drop in price but every year it will gain features and competitors will keep the tablet market moving yet people still buy these items   right now there 's not enough spending i 'd suggest that good financial advice aside people as a whole need to start spending to get the economy moving the return of some inflation would be a barometer of that spending starting to occur

h.r. basically publication 15 this is the link to 2015 to determine how much to hold based on filing status exemptions and pay amount what 's described here is a form of estimation or in other words h.r. withholds what would be your actual taxes dividing across the number of paychecks you receive assuming your gross pay and exemptions do not change this usually results in a zero sum for taxes owed you will receive nothing and owe nothing as you can see from the charts the year is basically broken down into equal tax units that reflect how much you would owe if you worked at that bracket all year this estimation works best when you have steady hours from check to check in other words your taxes are based on the estimate of what you 'd make if you earned that much all year scaled down to the time frame e.g. if you are paid weekly or if you paid biweekly they do not go up near the end of the year because they 're estimated in advance you do n't move up a tax bracket but are instead taxed at a particular bracket every paycheck there 's also other forms of estimation mentioned there but basically follow the same scheme note that all estimation forms are just estimates it 's best to use a calculator and compare your current taxes whenever a significant change a raise a new child getting married or divorced etc you 'll want to be able to alter your exemptions so that enough taxes are coming out that 's also the reason for the withhold extra box so that you can avoid owing for example if you 're making $ 44 a week for the first 26 weeks and then you make $ a week for the second 26 weeks of the year you 'll end up with an actual tax liability of $ but end up paying only $ you would owe $ of course the actual math is a lot more complicated if you 're an employee paid by the minute for example or you have a child go to college etc paychecks that vary wildly like $ 10,000 one week and $ 2,000 the next tend to have the hardest to predict estimates e.g. jobs with big commission payouts you should avoid living check to check with jobs that pay this way because you 'll probably end up owing taxes conversely if you 've done your estimates right and you 're paid salary or exactly the same number of hours every week you 'll find that the taxes are much easier to predict and you can usually easily create a refund situation simply by having the correct exemptions on your check so in summation if your check falls in the 25 category which is of course 25 above the tax bracket break point you 're already paying the correct amount and no further drop in your check would be expected

you could make a browser that did that i would think   does such a thing exist already   it would track which sites you go to and for how long and whichever sites accepted payment through them it would distribute your budget to every month   i imagine you would have to review the payment at the end of the month just to verify and to prevent fraud

i feel these beliefs can not be changed so easily once someone loses their money how can you convince him and on what ground can you convince him can you give a guarantee that investments will perform at a certain level there are many people who are happy with low returns but highly safe instruments they are not concerned with what you earn in the stock market or the realty market they are happy not losing their money i known many people who earned decently during the up rise of the stock market but all profits were squared up in the downturn and it turned to negative such people have their own thinking and such thinking is not out of place after experience with much turmoil i feel that they are also right to a great extent hence i feel if the person is not getting convinced you should accept it with greatness

i will attempt to answer three separate questions here the standard answer is that an emergency fund should not be in an investment that can lose value   the safest course of action is to put it in a savings account or other very low risk investment somewhere this question becomes can a reasonable and low risk investment in sweden be comparable to or better than a low risk investment in brazil inflation in brazil has averaged a little less than 6 over the last 10 years with a recent spike up above 8   a cursory search indicates interest rates on savings accounts in brazil are outpacing inflation so you might still expect a positive return on money in a savings account there by contrast sweden 's inflation rate has been around 1 over the last 10 years and has around 0 or even deflation in recent years   swedish interest rates for savings accounts right now are very low nearly 0   putting money in a savings account in sweden would likely hold its value or lose a slight amount of value based on this you might be better off leaving your emergency fund invested in in brazil the answer to this a little unclear   the brazilian stock market has been all over the place in the last 10 years with a slight trend in recent years   in comparison sweden 's stock market has shown fairly consistent growth in spite of the big dip in 2008   given this it seems like the fairest comparison would your current 13 roi investment in brazil vs. a fund or etf that tracks the swedish stock market index if we assume a consistent 13 roi on your investment in brazil and a consistent inflation rate of 6 your adjusted roi there would be around 7 per year the etf that tracks the swedish 30 index has a 10 year annualized return of   if you subtract 0.8 inflation you get an adjusted roi 9 based on this sweden may be a safer place for longer term moderate risk investments right now

i have never had a credit card and have been able to function perfectly well without one for 30 years i borrowed money twice once for a school loan that was and once for my mortgage in both cases my application was accepted you only need to have good credit if you want to borrow money credit scores are usually only relevant for people with irregular income or a past history of delinquency assuming the debtor has no history of delinquency the only thing the bank really cares about is the income level of the applicant in the old days it could be difficult to rent a car without a credit car and this was the only major problem for me before about 2010 usually i would have to make a cash deposit of $ 400 or something like that before a rental agency would rent me a car this is no longer a problem and i never get asked for a deposit anymore to rent cars other than car rentals i never had a problem not having a credit card

we can only print money until we start to see the effect in inflation true but we 've got quite a way to go before that happens   currently t bills are paying under .2 interest year   money can be borrowed at a historic low rate   no one worried about this huge amount of debt when bush was running it up   now that the deficit has actually gotten under control people are up in arms     the government has always run a deficit except once   money is a closed loop   household savings spending + business savings spending + imports exports + government surplus deficit = 0   that 's an accounting identity   currently households are spending a bit businesses are saving like business and we export more than we import   we have to run a deficit to have an economy

for example for my employer i received a signing bonus and a    relocation lump sum separate from that signing bonus the relocation    lump sum is taxed and will appear as income on my w-2 and i can spend    it on anything i want that said should the relocation lump sum count    towards the entry quoted above in form or would it be considered    the same as any other bonus thus allowing me to take a full deduction    for all of my deductible travel expenses the signing bonus and relocation lump sum will appear as regular income on your w-2 you can think of the relocation bonus as something to cover the pain and suffering the cost of moving without needing to send in receipts lets assume that you meet the distance and time tests so there is potential to save money on your taxes lets also put your actual moving expenses as $ 2500 if you have valid moving expenses the irs will allow you to use them to reduce your agi so now you can reduce your agi by the $ 2500   enter the total amount your employer paid you for the expenses listed    on lines 1 and 2 that is not included in box 1 of your form w-2    wages this amount should be shown in box 12 of your form w-2 with    code p. my question is what exact payments from your employer should be    entered here i realize that you can just write the number you get in    box 12 with code p on your w-2 but i 'm curious how they come up with    this number in some cases the company will reimburse you your moving expenses up to a maximum of $ x. for example a maximum of $ 1000 that means you submit receipts for those expenses and they give you a check or add it to your next paycheck the check will either be for the amount on your receipts or the maximum amount whichever is smaller in this situation with actual expenses of $ 2500 and a reimbursement of $ 1000 you can reduce your agi by $ 1500

i do n't see balance sheet in what you 're looking at and i 'd definitely suggest learning how to read a balance sheet and looking at it if you 're going to buy stock in a company unless you know that the recommendations you 're buying on are already doing that and you 're willing to take that risk   also reading past balance sheets and statements can give you an idea about how accurate the company is with their predictions or if they have a history of financial integrity now if you 're going the model portfolio route which has become popular the assumption that many of these stock buyers are making is that someone else is doing that for them   i am not saying that this assumption is valid just one that i 've seen you will definitely find a lot of skeptics and rightly so about model portfolios   likewise people who trade based on what person x does like warren buffett or david are assuming that they 're doing the research   the downside to this is if you follow someone like this   yeah oops i should also point out that technical analysis especially high probability ta generally only looks at history   most would define it as high risk and there are many underlying assumptions with reading the price movements by high probability ta types

it sounds like they want to enter you into a contract in which they are allowed to charge a flat fee for filing contingent on money saving results from a tax review service paid in full like those who answered before i have no legal experience   irs circular 230 defines the ethics for tax practitioners and the definition of a tax practitioner is broad enough effective aug 2011 to include those who are not eas cpas as long as the person is compensated to prepare or assist in a substantial part of the preparation of a document pertaining to a taxpayer 's liability for submission to the irs section fees practitioner may charge a contingent   fee for services rendered in connection with the   service ’s examination of or challenge to i an original tax return paragraph c defines what a contingent fee is basically a fee that depends on the specific result attained in this case saving you money in the section above   service 's examination   is an audit in plain speak   if your 2013 return has not been submitted and you have not received a written notice for examination h&r block can not charge a contingent fee period furthermore h&r block can not hold your tax documents upon your request they must return all original tax documents like and 1099s they do n't have to return the tax forms an employee prepared like i said above i 'm not a lawyer unless i missed a key detail i do n't believe they were permitted to charge you a filing fee contingent on saving you money

in the case of vfiax versus voo if you 're a buy and hold investor you 're probably better off with the mutual fund because you can buy fractional shares however in general the expense ratio for etfs will be lower than equivalent mutual funds even passive index funds they are the same in this case because the mutual fund is admiral class which has a $ 10,000 minimum investment that not all people may be able to meet additionally etfs are useful when you do n't have an account with the mutual fund company i.e. vanguard and buying the mutual fund would incur heavy transaction fees

so this method makes sense and is reasonable and possible   the money multiplier effect ends up capped by the fact that the bank can only lend a percent of its cash     my issue understanding this is i 've been told that banks actually do n't hold 10 of the cash and lend the other 90 but instead hold the full 100 in cash and lend 900   is this accurate   the issue i see with it is that it becomes exponential growth that is   if the bank lends 900 it has created this money from nothing which by itself is n't different that the bank loaning 90 and keeping 10   the issue comes because the next bank who gets that money deposited will treat that amount as cash as well so they loan 900 of the 900   and so on and so forth   how does the system prevent this from happening

for most people investing in the stock market directly is one of the last things to do   that 's not to say you should n't but rather that there are other things to consider as well start with automatic monthly deposits to a liquid account such as savings or money market the morale boost you get from seeing the balance grow is nearly impossible to beat following that paying down any debts such as student loans or credit cards once you 've done that then you should look at company sponsored 401k plans or iras sharebuilder offers iras holding whichever stock or fund you pick again automatic monthly deposits are the way to go here good luck and happy investing
