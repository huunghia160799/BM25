there are way too many details missing to be able to give you an accurate answer and it would be too localized in terms of time location anyway the rules change every year and your local taxes make the answer useless to other people instead here 's how to figure out the answer for yourself use a tax estimate calculator to get a ballpark figure and keep in mind that these only provide estimates because there are still a lot of variables that are only considered when you 're actually filling out your real tax return there are a number of calculators if you search for something like tax estimator calculator some are more sophisticated than others fair warning i used several of these and they told me a range of $ 2k $ 25k worth of taxes owed for a situation like yours here 's an estimator from turbotax it 's handy because it lets you enter business income when i plug in $ 140 k $ 70 40 hours 50 weeks for business income in 2010 married filing jointly no spouse income and 4 dependents i get $ 30 k owed in federal taxes that does n't include local taxes any itemized deductions you might be eligible for ira deductions etc you may also be able to claim some expenses as business deductions that will reduce your taxable business income so you 'd net $ 110 k after taxes or about $ $ 110k 50 40 of course you could get an answer from the calculator and congress could change the rules through the year you might come out better or worse depending on the nature of the rule changes that 's why i stress that it 's an estimate if you take the job do n't forget to make estimated tax payments edit some additional info if you plan on doing this on an ongoing basis i.e. you are going into business as a contractor for this line of work there are some tax shelters that you can take advantage of most of these wo n't be worth doing if you are only going to be doing contract work for a short period of time 1 2 years these may or may not all be applicable to you and do your research into these areas before diving in i 'm just scratching the surface in the notes below

in addition to taking into account your deductions as mentioned by you also need to account for vacation and other time off such as sick days you also need to estimate what percentage of the year you expect to be working and pro rate your salary accordingly   for example it is not uncommon to use 40 weeks out of the year which is about 77 of the time   also check to see if you would be eligible for unemployment for the times you are not working   i suspect not   but in any case you might want to use worst case scenario figures to see if it is worth it especially in this economy

most companies have gross margins because it 's not just tied to cost of goods but cost of revenue fedex has costs of revenue and therefore a gross margin   in some cases however yes some companies will not have a cost directly tied to revenue these are services companies in which an employees salary is by no means tied to the revenue i.e. a salary of $ 50k will still do $ 100k of work or $ 1 m of work with no change    edit work has me looking at american addiction centers which is an example of a company without cost of revenue goods

picking yourself is just what all the fund managers are trying to do and history shows that the majority of them fails the majority of the time to beat the index fund that is the core reason of the current run after index funds what that means is that although it does n’t sound so hard it is not easy at all to beat an index consistently of course you can assume that you are better than all those high paid specialists but i would have some doubt you might be luckier but then you might be not

i find indexing minimum wage to inflation helps put upward pressure on non minimum wages due to behavior of humans if a person working at say $ 30/hr sees someone working at minimum wage getting a pay raise the person at $ 30/hr is going to feel like they are falling behind and more likely to ask for a raise    i do not shop at wal mart due to how they treat their employees

i can only give you advice on what i would do if i was in this situation   as mentions above the first question you have to ask yourself is how much time do you want to spend to manage your money the more money you have the more money you can possibly make by becoming educated in investing e.g. if you can increase your return on investment roi on $ 500,000   1 it does   a lot more than increasing your roi on $ 50,000 by 1   if i was you i would either track my investments myself or ask an accountant or a fee only financial advisor to determine 3 things at the very least i would spend some serious time getting educated about your newfound wealth   good luck and if you find a need for additional computer programmers at your company do nt hesitate to let me know

kudos for wanting to start your own business   now let 's talk reality unless you already have some kind of substantial track record of successful investing to show potential investors what you want to do will never happen and that 's just giving you the honest truth there are extensive regulatory requirements for starting any kind of public investment vehicle and meeting them costs money   you can be your own hedge fund with your own money and avoid all of this if you like   keep in mind that a hedge fund is little more than someone who is contrarian to the market and puts their money where their mouth is   i know some of you will argue this is simplistic and you 'd be right but i 'm deliberately avoiding complexity for the moment the simple truth is that nobody is going to just give you their money to invest unless for starters you can show that you 're any good at it and for the sake of it we 'll assume you 've had success in the markets and perhaps most importantly you have skin in the game meaning you have a substantial investment of your own in the fund too    you might have a chance at creating something if you can show that whatever your hedge fund proposes to invest in is n't already overrun by other hedge funds   at the moment there are more mutual and hedge funds out there than there are securities for them to invest in so they 're basically all fighting over the same pie   you must have some fairly unique opportunity or approach that nobody else has or has even considered in order to begin attracting money to a new fund these days   and that 's not easy trust me there is no short or easy path to what you want to do and perhaps if you want to toy around with it a bit find some friends who are willing to invest based on your advice and/or picks   if you develop a track record of success then perhaps you could more seriously consider doing what you propose and in the meanwhile you can look into the requirements for laying the foundations toward your goal i hope you do n't find my answer cruel because it is n't meant to be   i am all about encouraging people to succeed but it has to start with a realistic expectation   you have a great thought but there 's a wide gulf from concept to market and no quick or simple way to bridge it here 's a link to a web video on how to start your own hedge fund if you want to look into it more deeply how to legally start a hedge fund from the investopedia website good luck

according to this section in publication 15   collecting taxes from employees    if you withheld no    income social security or medicare taxes or less than the correct    amount from an employee 's wages you can make it up from later pay to    that employee but you ’re the one who owes the underpayment    reimbursement is a matter for settlement between you and the employee    it seems that if the employer withheld less than the correct amount of fica taxes from you it is still the employer who owes your fica taxes to the government not you i do not believe there is a way for you an employee not self employed to directly pay fica taxes to the government without going through the employer the employer can deduct the amount from you future paychecks assuming you still work for them or settle it with you in some other way in other words you owe the employer and the employer owes the government but you do not directly owe the government if they do deduct it from your future pay then they can issue a corrected w-2 to reflect the amount deducted from you but they can not issue a corrected w-2 that says fica were deducted from you if it was n't

closing a credit card decreases your total available balance which can have a small negative effect if that credit card is a significant portion of your available credit   if it is not then it likely will have little impact on your credit in that department however the case you explained get a card use it for a short while then dump it wo n't have much long term impact to your available credit since you will end up with the same amount as you started the second factor will be the average age of accounts   this will affect you both in the short and long term if you 've had accounts open for a fairly long time but wo n't impact you much if your credit history is fairly short   even closed accounts affect the average age of accounts for fico scores but not for some other scoring methods such as vantagescore   if you have only one other account and it was 10 years old then opening and closing this decreases your average age of accounts from 10 to 5 years a significant hit which will not go away for years 10 + years in some cases though usually 7 years   this will lower your score some   if you have had a lot of accounts though including things like mortgage student loan etc this wo n't have as significant of an impact and if you had a short history in the first place it wo n't hurt you much either the third factor will be the hard credit pull   that will have a small negative impact for around six months so do n't do this just before getting a mortgage but mostly this wo n't be a significant for you

on paper the whole 6 months living costs sounds and is great but in real life there are a lot of things that you need to consider for example my first car was constantly falling apart and was an suv that got i have to travel for work about 300 miles per week so getting a sedan that averages close to saves me more in gas and maintenance than the monthly payment for the new car costs when our apartment lease was up the new monthly rent would have been $ per month we got a 30 year mortgage with a monthly payment of $ so buying a house actually let us put aside more each month we have just under 3 months of living expenses set aside 1 month in liquid assets 2 months in a brokerage account and i worry about it i wish we had a better buffer but in our case the house and car made more sense as an early investment compared to just away all our savings also do you have any debt paying off debt student loans credit card debt etc should often take top priority have some rainy day funds of course but pay down debts and then create a personal financial plan for what works best in your situation that would be my suggestion

the stock markets are closed on week ends and public holidays because the banks are closed the banking is a must to settle the payment obligations so you may buy and sell as much as you wish but unless money changes hands nothing has really happened    now as to why banking itself is closed on week ends and public holidays well a different question keeping the system 24 hrs up and running does not actually push volumes but definately push expenses for brokers banks etc there definately is some to buyers and sellers

not to mention that many oil fields do n't make a profit below $   the saudis over produced on purpose based on that premise betting that they could drive much of the growing north american production out of business by keeping the price below the point where tar sands and hydraulic fracking could be profitable   if oil dropped to $ few countries would bother pumping it   while saudi arabia and some of the uae could make a profit at that point for now even iraq would be losing money     that reduced production would drive the price right back up since oil is still used in plastics shipping road construction etc   even if every car being sold becomes electric overnight and all the electric power plants become wind nuclear or solar based tomorrow we 'd still have a decade or more of existing ice cars on the road   it 's not the world would stop using oil in the next 6 8 years just because investment pours into electric cars   if anything a drop to $ would slow the move away from oil significantly what incentive would people have to buy a more expensive electric car when gas at the pump is suddenly is $ 1 again

he 's paying the interest and you 're paying the principal if you 're making minimum monthly payments you 'll still be doing the same thing 25 30 years from now i think 's advice was very very good but i 'd like to add to it a little of my own whatever dollar amount your son is sending to you as payment encourage him to continue doing that only instead of paying you have him put that money into a savings plan of some kind you mentioned that he 's struggling now yet able to come up with approximately my best guess $ 200/mo i guarantee you that if he puts that $ 200/mo back into his pocket he 'll still be struggling every month yet have nothing to show for it my suggestion changes nothing in his daily life yet gives him $ 2400 at the end of every year   i was in a somewhat similiar situation as your son only to the tune of $ 13,000 about 20 years ago i got a loan and bought a new truck in which to use to go back and forth to work every day the first 5 months the payments to the bank went as planned then my wife announces that we 're pregnant so my parents figured it would be best to just pay off my loan to the bank avoiding any further interest charges and take that truck payment and put it away for a rainy day at 33 y o with my first child on the way i finally started saving some of my money it was good advice on their part because the rainy days came they never asked me to pay them back however i did offer i 've been away $ 300 in the bank every month since then because i just got into the habit good thing i did too in the past 10 years i 've had to bury both of my parents one sister and two wives and i 'll tell ya one thing that was comforting was the fact that i had the money the little truck i bought 20 years ago is now my son 's it has around miles on it now when he trades it in for a newer vehicle i will probably loan him the money and have him make payments to me rather than the bank i too am not one to pay interest if i can help it if he defaults he 's my son i just wo n't buy him another vehicle or maybe he 'll get into the same habit of saving money the same way i did like johnfx said money loaned to family should be regarded as a gift otherwise you 'll end up losing your money and your family member hope some of this helps you make your decision

note i have no experience of attempting what is described below neither am i a lawyer nor an accountant the process may range from a small bureaucratic hurdle to a complex legal nightmare if it seems a plausible approach you would probably be well advised to reach out to others that have established for help and guidance according to this hmrc page the two ways a body can claim gift aid is if either it is a recognised charity or if it is a community amateur sports club casc so one option may be to try and establish a casc i suspect that this is unlikely to be an easy process but may be a more likely approach than trying to get the council to establish a charity the register as a community amateur sports club casc page on the hmrc site very briefly describes the steps as you can see from their eligibility criteria to register as a casc you would first have to create a sports club of some form that has a formal constitution is open to the whole community and has affordable membership fees is on an amateur basis provides facilities in the uk is managed by fit and proper persons you would probably need the co operation of the local council to allow the proposed sports club the use of the local park one of the several requirements of becoming a casc is that it must so it could in theory be possible to spend money raised through both membership fees and gift aid qualifying donations on the improving the facilities of the park tennis courts bowling green etc however note that how to register page mentions among many other requirements the need to provide accounts from the last 12 months and bank statements from the last 3 months it does n't as far as i can see explicitly state that the club must have been in existence for 12 months before applying for casc status it might be possible to send only what you have but be aware that you may need to establish the club and let it operate under its own steam for a period before applying

indeed there is conservation of money   if the insurance companies have those big buildings and television commercials and ceos then that money comes from only one place the insurance premiums of customers   to say insurance is a good deal is either the benefit and cost of insurance for most indeed of all the answers here james 's is best   if you ca n't afford to lose something it is vital to insure it   ideally insurance would be a non profit operation to best cover this   such that people would as a whole lose nothing   theoretically it could even be slightly for profit by making wise investment decisions and benefiting from the future value of money by beating inflation   but they do n't see this writeup for slightly dated information on health and this wikipedia article for more direction but even if you are taking an average loss by using a profit making insurance company by taking insurance you avoid the situation where you 're crippled by a catastrophe   you are paying a fee to hedge your losses   like james said insure what you can not afford to lose   but realize you 're going into a situation where the overall net is an average loss of between 10 50 of your money on average   basically you 're playing the lottery except your net losses mostly go to fund the company and the ceos rather than nominally support education but you sounded like you understood those ideas well so    can you self insure as others noted yes there is the option of self insurance in most places   even even often when insurance is considered as required   for example in the us basically car insurance coverage is required   but generally you are legally able to self insure to cover this requirement    the cost of self insuring there is one cost to self insure time   it takes time to research the laws time to to satisfy those requirements and then time to find setup all the care providers doctors mechanics lawyers etc when is it worth it   first again you must satisfy the prerequisite you are able to financially handle the loss of the topic under consideration at a commenter 's request here is an attempt to better spell out this requirement though it does n't appear pertinent to the question asked it is indeed very important not to mistakenly assume you satisfy this requirement can you comfortably cover the level of insurance you would otherwise be taking out   $ is a common reasonable insurance level so that would be $ 200,000   basically have enough money to cover the loss of your car your possible injury expenses and most importantly the damage and medical of anyone else you hit   you would need to have that value available optimally in your accounts   alternatively you could weigh it against your assets such that if you had low accounts but a paid off $ 200,000 house you could conceivably sell your property and still be able to survive financially afterwards   however it is indeed dangerous to make this assumption as there may be additional costs and troubles in selling assets and you may fail to recognize how precious the property is to you   having at least double or triple in property you 'd be willing to part with might be a more comfortable number   again the main idea is can you afford to lose the insured value tomorrow   though you hope it would n't happen if someone came and took $ 200,000 + of yours tomorrow would you be able to adjust to it relatively easily   if the answer is yes you 've satisfied this requirement   in many states it 's easier to understand whether you can meet this requirement it instead becomes can you take out the liability bond required if you 've met that requirement then it comes down to the time you 'd lose versus the savings you 'd gain   to get a fair idea you 'll need the premium you would pay to purchase the insurance since you are likely losing 10 50 of your premiums it should be fair to make a rough estimate of value lost by using 25 for most purposes especially given that this still ignores the future value opportunity cost of your money which could often be 5 10 if invested well the value of your time   you must properly identify either    a rough estimate of how much time it will take you to research the legal requirements and meet them and then to research handle the subsequent needs that come up which the insurance would take care of in an average year   so try to balance those typical years where you would n't have a lot of work to do with a year where you 'd need to call repair mechanics or find health practitioners   perhaps aim high research calling usually takes more time than we think    is this calculation positive your estimated net annual benefit or cost from self insuring is 0.25 insurance premium per year estimated value of your hours of to self insure per year   this is a rough estimate   but if the result is quite positive and you can afford to cover the hit the insurance would otherwise cover you 're likely better off self insuring if the result is quite negative or you ca n't cover the possible costs insurance would cover you 're probably better off buying insurance finally indeed there are still a few other factors on each side to consider most often those additional pluses and minuses probably are smaller than the primary cost benefits out earlier   but if you 're rich enough to have the money you 're in a situation where you can likely sacrifice a little income to have your peace of mind   so there 's certainly a lot to consider in it   but if you 're a self starter i believe you 're right that you 'll find it 's more worthwhile to self insure if you indeed have the resources

this can be done you can be prosecuted for some forms of it in any case there are more riskless ways of doing what you suggested first buying call options from market makers results in market makers buying shares at the same delta as the call option 100 shares x delta = how many shares mm 's bought you can time this with the volume and depth of the shares market to get a bigger resulting move caused by your options purchase to get bigger quote changes in your option so on expiration day you can be trade near at the money options back and forth between being out the money and in the money you would exit the position into liquidity at a profit the risk here is that you can be sitting on a big options position where the commissions costs get really big but you can spread this out amongst several options contracts second you can again take advantage of market maker inefficiencies by getting your primary position whether in the share market or options market placed and then your other position being a very large buy order a few levels below the best bid many market makers and algorithms will jump in front of your they think they are being smart but it will raise the best bid and likely make a few higher prints for the mark raising the price of your call option and eventually remove your large buy order again you exit into liquidity this is called spoofing there have been some regulatory actions against people in doing this in the last few years as for consequences you need to put things into perspective us capital market regulators have the most nuanced regulations and enforcement actions of worldwide capital market regulators and even then they get criticized for being unable or unwilling to curb these practices with that perspective american laws are basically a blueprint on what to do in 100 other country 's stock exchanges where the legislature has never gotten around to defining the same laws the securities regulator is even more underfunded and and the markets more inefficient not advice just reality

gt you 're the one arguing for a change away from the status quo here to something that not only is entirely untested but requires everyone to do it at once and everyone to think just like you do for it to work properly it 's nothing but hypotheticals yet you 're saying the burden of proof is on me to prove that your hypothetical scenarios wo n't work   i do n't have to prove anything when i 'm advocating for not being a part of your system i am in no way advocating that you be forced into mine i 'm not advocating any positive action towards you nor anyone else simply arguing against the status quo does n't place a burden of proof upon me   gt that 's not a thing you can do you ca n't prove a negative   then do n't make that claim easy as that i laid out how the market could deal with a court system and you into making unsupported claims when we get back to what does make sense we can have productive conversation it 's not productive to use baseless conjecture and unsupported claims   gt all i can do is say look around at all the free markets and populations we have now living in perfect harmony with each other and the environment oh wait they do n't exist because they do n't work in the real world   wrong it does not follow that because something does not exist that it does not work   gt any advantage is going to be used to the competition with until you have a monopoly quasi state   you have no evidence to support this why are you reverting to this nonsense   gt   it relies on the population being informed in and believing in the system enough to make a conscious effort to not buy the cheaper goods at the store with the bad business practices or potentially drive further to a different store if it 's the store doing the bad practice   no it does not this is a straw man a voluntary society does n't preclude the possibility of people buying bad food or something like that it does n't even preclude the possibility of third party assurances to prevent bad food it just does n't have a built in monopoly on assurance services that you have to use in order to buy sell   gt so you 're saying there can never be a truly free market then   no people buy and sell freely all of the time ever bought something from craigslist ebay silk road i 'd say those are pretty much free markets   gt you had little kids getting their arms ripped off by textile looms for fucks sake people working 14 hour days but it made more money than working in the fields so worth right   you 're conveniently leaving out how kids worked people all day and still starved to death as the alternative up until industrialization allowed a better quality of life it 's not like they could have just passed a fucking law and mandated a 40 hour week and instantly had prosperity it was because they did grind their way through the industrial revolution that we 're able to live lives of leisure and prosperity if you think that government action can get people out of poverty by decree then tell it to the third world countries that are still developing i 'm sure they 'd be all ears   gt because the pooling of vast resources for disaster relief is something that states do   that they do it does n't mean that it could n't happen without the state on a voluntary basis the funding for all of these programs combined is easily less than what a quarter of the government 's budget if the people who made this same objection put their money where their mouth is there would be no shortage of funding people from the left and the right alike claim that they want these things so which is it are you telling me that there are just millions and millions of people who virtue signal about humanitarian efforts   gt this is my point neither you nor i have any evidence to base this off rather than a tendency for people to be utter bastards to each other looking at history you 're that if all governments in a puff of smoke there would n't be huge conflict in the resulting power vacuum   actually i do n't think that immediately destroying governments will create the best outcomes as that usually happens violently and results in someone wanting to fill the roles performed by government instead i think that based upon history individuals are less likely to be violent when they are n't acting on behalf of governments and they can and will find alternatives to the state that will replace it over time if they are not violently stopped here are some examples   1 i would rather be entirely left alone by the state police agents and allowed to use my own private security i would not be taxed for state agents and would instead pay out of pocket this would likely lower the cost since they would be interested in preventing losses rather than busting people for parking tickets speeding tickets drug offenses civil asset forfeiture etc would you not agree that this is a superior model 2 i would rather have private large scale defense since it would not be involved in international wars of aggression i would not be taxed and would instead pay out of pocket all else equal this would be less expensive and less dangerous since resources would only be used for defense would you not agree that this is a superior model 3 i would rather have a private system of healthcare rather than a government one being free to not pay into medicare medicaid this along with eliminating certificates of need monopolization by the ama eliminating ip protections and the like would lower the cost more than nationalization would and would also allow providers to better align with my preferences would you not agree that this is a superior system   gt yeah good one there were n't any anarchists in a position to do any of that great straw man   actually the purported left wing anarchists in spain did carry out what is called the red terror i put that in quotes because i do not agree with their methods or their ideology change must be done through the market not through violence   gt why is the burden of proof on the statists it 's the anarchists who are arguing for the change in the status quo   because appeals to tradition are not rational arguments and anarchists are not advocating for positive action against you statists are arguing that others be subject to their government if a person is trying to argue against his own he would n't have the burden of proof simply because he had been enslaved for some time   gt you 're the one making the claim that it would be a better system here with nothing to back it up   on the contrary i do have something to back it up the market responds better to consumer preferences on an individual level than governments do if you disagree with me on healthcare and want a collective system the market can put you with other like minded individuals and me with those who share my views a state can not   gt why do we have states right now   you 're conflating violence and efficiency that 's like saying if kids have such great ideas why are they still living under their parent 's rule it 's not because the ideas are bad it 's because the parents are keeping them there states do n't compete they rule with violence the notion of creating a market for violence to stop rule by violence is contradictory

yes rebalancing with new money avoids capital gains taxes and loads although if you 're financially literate enough to be thinking about rebalancing techniques i 'm surprised to hear that you 're invested in funds with loads on the other hand if it 's taking you years to rebalance then a you are not rebalancing anywhere near frequently enough   rebalancing should be something you do every 6 months or 1 year such that it would take only a few weeks or maybe a month of new investment to get back in balance b you will be out of balance for quite a long time while the whole point of the theory of rebalancing is to always be mathematically prepared for swings in the market   any time spent out of balance represents that much more risk that an unexpected market move can seriously hurt your portfolio you should weigh the time it will take you to rebalance the long way i.e. the risk cost of not rebalancing immediately vs. the taxes and fees involved in rebalancing quickly   if you had said that it would take you only a couple weeks or a month to rebalance the long way i would say that the long way is fine   but the prospect of spending years without a balanced portfolio seems far more costly to me than any expenses you might incur rebalancing quickly since it 's almost the end of the calendar year have you considered doing two quick rebalances one this year and another in january   that way half of the tax consequences would happen in april and the other half not until the next april giving you plenty of time to up the money   also even if you have no capital losses this year with which to offset some of your expected capital gains you would have all of next year to harvest some losses against next year 's half of the rebalancing gains

it does n't make a difference if you will be keeping it in the 401 k or transferring it to an ira it is still retirement money that you plan on investing for decades   pre enron many employees invested significant amounts of their retirement funds with the employer one of the risks was that if a single stock was down at the wrong time you were hurt if you needed to sell   if you are going from an s&p 500 in the 401 k to an s&p 500 in the ira it does n't matter if the the market is up or down the two funds will be pretty much in

wtf yourself   results matter   billions of dollars are changing hands women are trying to be a part of that and the result is that women are getting a share that is according to most statistical analysis insignificant   you are getting all defensive as if this could only have happened if some nefarious persons at the top decided it must be so but the reality is that persons at the top do not dictate results as you   results are more what we end up with as the result of processes more complex than any of us fully understand and reality most women get excluded early on because of various issues like the intense harassment that they experience at almost every level   you say nothing stops women but analysis of available data appears to show that something is stopping women and that oddly enough we also find inappropriate behavior is endemic to all involved institutions   a lot of people get harassed   you better believe it   i am a gay man and you would not believe some of the shit that i get in   supposedly open minded tech industries   the big difference there is that most straight women have a lot of options open to them while as a gay man i can pretty much thrive and make a lot of money or starve to death in a world that is still with irrational spite that is n't even typically acknowledged   we can all do better   i am sure of that

other answers here cover some of the basics but this is also a great time to start establishing a credit history and developing good financial habits to carry throughout your life in addition to opening a free checking account with the local credit union establish an overdraft line of credit on that account never close this account or this line of credit as it will work to increase the average age of your accounts when you apply for credit later in life if you are disciplined with your use of credit cards you may also want to apply for a low limit credit card through the same credit union for the same purpose as above never carry a balance on this card but make minor purchases with it each month never more than 20 of the balance maybe just buy gas with it start tracking all of your spending and make a monthly budget there are a lot of online tools that make this very easy establishing the habit now will help you make informed financial decisions in the future open a roth ira and put at least 10 of your money away for retirement in the future your income may increase enough to put you in the 25 tax bracket if that ever happens open a regular ira and put the money there instead also when you have employers that offer 401k matching do the same thing with a roth 401k account keep your money invested in a low cost index fund

as the premiums go up so do the individuals subsidies because they are limited in how much they have to pay john has to pay $ 450 if his total insurance costs $ 11k or $ 15 k. so in effect he will get more money to pay for his increased insurance costs    this increases the overall costs to the taxpayers by millions of dollars the money goes to the person to pay premiums instead of straight to insurance companies    the taxpayers would be much better off if the payments to insurance companies continue to prevent the raise in premiums if trump stops the payments we are all going to pay more except for those near the poverty level

this is a clear example of annuities where you are trying to find net present value npv to find a quick solution you can use the excel function = npv solving it without excel is slightly more complicated you have to use the annuities formula   payment rate 1   this formula can be written in many different ways this is one of the simplest   so how do we translate that to your problem for the first option 1 ^ 2 = if you have n't made this years 5000 payment you have to subtract this years 5000 so option 1 would equal   option 2 is similar 1 ^ 10 = wait you also have to subtract the initial cost so option 2 is   so in essence option 1 is better but you will have to buy a machine sooner or later   part 2 discount rate = 12 is for you to understand the importance of high rates in long periods of time like option 2 's 10 years     edit for clearer formulas also made a mistake calculating option 2

i 'll take a stab at this question and offer a disclosure i recently got in ring 5.1 asx rio and   while i wo n't add to my positions at current prices i may add other positions or more to them if they fall further   this is called catching a falling and it 's a high risk move cons let 's scare everyone away pros the ecb did n't engage in as much qe as the market hoped and look at how it reacted especially commodities   consider that the ecb 's actions were tighter than expected and the fed plans to raise rates or claims so   commodities should be falling off a cliff on that news while most american western attention is on the latest news or entertainment china has been seizing commodities around the globe like crazy and the media have failed to mention that even with its market failing china is still seizing commodities   if china was truly panicked about its market it would stop investing in other countries and commodities and just bail out its own country   yet it 's not doing that   the whole china crisis is completely oversold in the west china is saying one thing oh no but doing another using its money to snap up cheap commodities capitalism works because hard times strengthen good companies   you know how many bailouts has received compared to goldman sachs   you know who owns more real wealth   oil does n't get bailed out banks do and banks ca n't innovate to save their lives while oil   hard times strengthen good companies   this means that this harsh bust in commodities will separate the winners from the losers and history shows the winners do very well in the long run related to the above point how many bailouts from tax payers do you think mining companies will get   zero   at least you 're investing in companies that do n't steal your money through government confiscation if you 're like me you can probably find at least 9 people out of 10 who think investing in miners is a very bad idea   what do they think is a good idea   duh snapchat and twitter   then there 's the old saying be greedy when everyone 's fearful and fearful when everyone 's greedy finally miners own hard assets   benjamin graham used to point this out with the dead company strategy like finding a used cigarette with one more smoke   you 're getting assets cheap while other investors are overpaying for stocks hoping that the fed qe   think strategy here seize cheap assets begin limiting the supply of these assets if you 're the saver and not borrowing then watch as the price begins to rise for them because of low supply   remember investors are part owners in companies take more control to limit the supply   using graham 's analogy stock pile those one puff cigarettes for a day when there 's a low supply of cigarettes many miners are in trouble now because they 've borrowed too much and must sell at a low profit or in some cases must lose   when you own assets debt free you can cut the supply   this will also help the federal reserve who 's been desperately trying to figure out how to raise inflation   the new patriotic thing to do is stimulate the economy by sending inflation up and limiting the supply here is key

for cross border transactions like this you should really take advice from an accountant or lawyer who specialises in them because there may be tax treaties between the two that complicate the situation however in general borrowing money does n't have tax implications in itself and there 's no limit as such you do need to consider the following points if this is zero or less than you could plausibly get commercially your friend is effectively giving you the difference between the interest rates if your friend in korea has a connection to the us she or he may be subject to the gift tax in practice this only matters if the total amount of gifts they give to anyone over their lifetime plus the size of their estate over their lifetime is large non us persons are exempt though if the amounts are large enough they may need to be reported financial institutions are generally required to report large international transactions typical thresholds are around $ 10,000 for scrutiny by the government in case the transaction is related to something illegal this should n't be a problem in itself but you should be aware it 'll happen it should n't make any difference how you transfer the money but it would be wise to get as much documentation as possible in case of later questions the best place to get further advice would be the us bank you 'll be transferring the money into initially this is really a question for a lawyer given the cross border nature of the transaction but you and your friend should sign a contract specifying how and when the loan will be repaid your friend should also consider setting up the loan as a mortgage and taking a charge on your home even if your friend trusts you a charge on the home will protect him or her in the event of you having financial problems and another creditor laying claim to the home

i have a quick question about statement of cash flows and how account receivable net and affect it i 've already asked the accounting subreddit but was wondering if anyone who does fundamental analysis etc would have a take on it    it stems from a homework problem where i have to a cash flow statement using two comparative balance sheets end of period 2013 and end of period 2014 and a change in retained earnings statement   the following transaction took place in 2014    the firm wrote off accounts receivable as totaling $ in 2013 and $ in 2014 it recognized expired insurance of $ in 2013 and $ 3,900 in 2014   my understanding is that the write offs have already been subtracted in order to yield account receivable net and therefore i can just take the change in that account and make the appropriate entry   for the recognition of expired insurance i can simply take the change in the prepayment account and record the appropriate cash flow entry   am i correct in assuming this or did they give me those amounts in order to figure out accounts receivable gross and take the change in that

full disclosure i ’m an intern for equityzen so i ’m familiar with this space but can speak with the most accuracy about equityzen observations about other players in the space are my own the employee liquidity landscape is evolving equityzen and help shareholders employees ex employees etc in private companies get liquidity for shares they already own and 137 ventures help with option financing and provide loans and exotic structures on loans to cover costs of exercising options and any associated tax hit equityzen is a private company marketplace that led the second wave of vc backed secondary markets starting early 2013 the mission is to help achieve liquidity for employees and other private company shareholder but in a company approved way equityzen with share transfers and also a proprietary derivative structure which transfers economics of a company 's shares without changing voting and information rights this structure typically makes the transfer process cheaper and faster as less paperwork is involved accredited investors find the process appealing because they get access to companies they usually can not with small check sizes to address the questions in 's post 1 equityzen does n't take a loan shark approach meaning they do n't front shareholders money so that they can purchase their stock with equityzen you ’re either selling your shares or selling all the economic risk upside and downside in exchange for today ’s value 2 equityzen only allows company approved deals on the platform as a result companies are more friendly towards the process and they tend to allow these deals to take place non company approved deals pose risks for buyers and sellers and are ultimately unsustainable as a buyer without company blessing you ’re taking on significant counterparty risk from the seller will they make good on their promise to deliver shares in the future or the risk that the transfer is under relevant restrictions and your purchase is invalid as a seller you ’re running the risk of violating your equity agreements which can have severe penalties like forfeiture of your stock your shares are also much less marketable when you ’re looking to transact without the company ’s knowledge or approval 3 terms do n't change depending an a shareholder 's situation equityzen is a professional company and values all of the shareholders that use the platform it ’s a marketplace so the market sets the price in other situations you may be at the mercy of just one large buyer this can happen when you ’re facing a big tax bill on exercise but do n’t have the cash because you have the stock 4 equityzen does n't offer loans so this is a non issue 5 not equityzen equityzen creates a clean break from the economics it ’s not uncommon for the loan structures to use an interest component as well as some other complications like upside participation and and also a liquidation preference equityzen for a simple structure where you ’re not on the hook for the downside and you ’ve transferred all the upside as well

figure out how much money you earn what you spend it on and how that will change when you have kids will one of you stay at home if not how much will daycare cost and how do you finance the first few month when your child is still too young for daycare you will usually plan to spend your current rent without utilities on your mortgage the that is secured by your house keep in mind though that a house usually has a higher utility cost than an appartment when you 've figured out what you can save pay towards a house now and how that will change when you have kids you can go on to the next step if you do n't want to buy now but want to commit to saving up for a house and also want to secure today 's really low interest rates consider getting a bausparvertrag   i did n't find a good translation for bausparvertrag so here is a short example of how it works you take a building saving sum of € with a savings goal of 50000 € the savings goal is usually between 20 and 50 of the sum and then you make monthly payments into the bausparvertrag until you reach the savings goal at which point you can take out your savings and a loan of 100000 € or whatever your difference between the and is if you 're living in an area you 're likely to need more than but this is just an example upsides downsides if you decide to buy sooner you can also use your bausparvertrag to refinance later if you have a decent income and a permanent job then ask your bank if they would consider financing your house now to get a sense of what you 'll be able to afford google and use a few of the many online calculators remember that these websites want to sell you on the idea of buying a house instead of paying rent so they 'll usually overestimate the raise in rents repeat the calculation with rent raise set to 0 to get a feeling for how much you 'll be able to afford in today 's money also do n't forget that you 're planning to get children so do the calculation with only one income not two and add the cost of raising the kids to your calculation once you 've decided on a property shop around a bit at different banks to get the best financing if you decide to buy now or soon start looking at houses now go to model homes to find out what style of house you like this is useful whether you want to buy an existing house or build a new one if buying an existing house is an option for you start visiting houses that are on sale in your area in order to practice what to ask and what to look for you should have a couple of visits under your belt before you really start looking for the one you want to buy once you 're getting closer to buying or making a contract with a construction company consider getting an expert when buying an existing house they can help you estimate the price and also estimate the renovation cost you 'll have to factor in for a certain house new heating better insulation when building a new house they can advise you on the contract with the construction company and also examine the construction company 's work at each major step source own experience

i was going to comment on the commission free etf answer which i agree with but i do n't have enough reputation td ameritrade has a list of commission free etfs and has no minimum deposit required to open an account another idea is to keep gifts in cash until a certain threshold is reached for instance $ 100 for birthday $ 100 for christmas $ 100 for next birthday $ 100 for next christmas now execute the trade sharebuilder has $ 4 scheduled trades so you 'd be at about 1 overhead for that if other people give money you 'll reach the threshold faster of course for what it 's worth i do something similar for my 2 nieces i combined their account and prepay christmas plus birthday so i do 1 trade a year i have my account at sharebuilder because my idea the commission free etfs that are now pretty popular i should really transfer the account hm

the choices given are either leave after some reasonable hours or put in endless crunch time until you drop dead   the reality as usual is between those extremes   most people are hired to get a job done   that is likely to require some extra work and if you really care about the job then that is n't really so bad and is not going to scale up to suicidal levels     crunch time as such is increasingly rare because the downsides are so obvious   it generates inferior work and burns out critical assets   at the same time there is no reason to believe that significant professional challenges will necessarily fit neatly into standardized work time arrangements   sometimes difficult problems come up and need to be handled or innovative products wo n't be released in time to make a difference in the marketplace

before you decide on moving into trading whether you have experience or not you need to sort out a couple of questions how much do you really understand about the markets   how much money you have and what would be the maximum loss you may be able to take   what supporting eco system you have to help you in terms of trading i.e. hardware software research connections who can provide you with solid information and sorts of it are you really prepared to take on institutions who have billions to spend and take losses i.e. amounts which might break you will be peanuts for them i am assuming you are in us so this website   may help you a bit trading websites where you can open an account   even if you reply in affirmative to the above questions you should still be wary about making money by trading it is a field where even the best people have been in the face without any mercy and above all do n't expect any person will take mercy on your hard earned cash they will take you to the cleaners if they have to there are some websites which allow you to participate in trading not involving real money try that out and see where you get to that should give you some pointers on where you are headed   and realize that it is human nature to assume when you hear news that such and such trader make loads of money in such and such trades trading is easy unless you do it for yourself the truth is such traders would be on their desk for 18 20 hours at a stretch 6 7 days a week without a life to make such money and they have loads of support staff i.e. analysts it guys who makes it easier for them do you have such help if no then look the other side   but giving up without trying at all will be but do it in limits which you can bear and not to get carried away when things are good

if they own the old house outright they can mortgage it to you in many jurisdictions this you of the obligation to chase for payment and of any worry that you wo n't get paid because a transfer of ownership to the new owner can not be registered until any charge against a property ie a mortgage has been discharged the cost of to your friends of setting up the mortgage will be less than the interest they are offering you and you will both have peace of mind even if the sale of the old house falls through you will still be its mortgagee and still assured of repayment on any future sale or even inheritance complications arise if the first property is mortgaged although second mortgages are possible and rank behind first mortgages in priority of repayment the first mortgagee generally has a veto on the creation of second mortgages

in australia we have a 50 capital gain discount if you hold the asset for more than 12 months whether it is in shares property or other assets the main reason is to encourage people to invest long term instead of speculating or trading the government sees speculation or short term trading as more risky than long term investing for the everyday mum and dad investor so rewards people it sees taking the lower risk long term view in my opinion long term investing short term trading and speculation can all be risky for someone who is in the financial markets and the first rule of investing should be to consider the asset itself and not the tax implications

from what i have read from to van tharp etc etc no one can pick winners more than 75 of the time regardless of the system they use and most traders consider themselves successful if 60 of the trades are winners and 40 are losers   so i am on the side that the chart is only a reflection of the past and can not tell you reliably what will happen in the future it is difficult to realize this but here is a simple way for you to realize it if you look at a daily chart and let 's say it is 9:30 am at the open and you ask a person to look at the technical indicators look at the fundamentals and decide the direction of the market by drawing the graph just for the next hour he will realize in just a few seconds that he will say to him or her self how on earth do you expect me to be able to do that   he will realize very quickly that it is impossible to tell the direction of the market and he realizes it would be foolhardy to even try because mickey hit over 250 every year of his career for the first 15 years it would be a prudent bet to bet that he could do it again over the span of a season but you would be a fool to try to   guess if the next pitch would be a ball or a strike you would be correct about 50 of the time and wrong about 50 of the time you can rely on larger patterns of behavior over years but short hourly or even minute by minute prediction is foolish that is why to be a trader you have to keep on trading and if you keep on trading and cut your losses to 1/2 of your wins you will eventually have a wonderful profit   but you have to limit your risk on any one trade to 1 of your portfolio   in that way you will be able to trade at least 100 times   do the math   trade a hundred times   lose 5 and the next bet gain 10   keep on doing it you will have losses sometimes of 3 or 4 in a row and also wins sometimes of 3 or 4 in a row but overall if you keep on trading even the best traders are generally only right 60 of the time   so lets do the math if you took 100 dollars and make 100 trades and the first trade you made 10 and reinvested the total and the second trade you lost 5 of that and continue that win loss sequence for 100 trades you would have dollars minus commissions that is a 1200 return in one hundred trades   if you do it in a roth ira you pay no taxes on the short term gains   it is not difficult to realize that the stock market does trend and the easiest way to make 10 quickly is to in general trade 3x leveraged funds or stocks that have at least 3 beta from the general index   take any trend up and count the number of days the stock is up and it is usually 66 75 and take any down trend and it is down 66 75 of the days   so if you bet on the the beginning of a day when the stock was up and if you buy the next day about 66 75 of the time the stock will also be up so the idea is to realize that 1/3 of the time at least you will cut your losses but 2/3 of the time you will be up then next day as well   so keep holding the position based on the low of the previous day and as the stock rises to your trend line then tighten the stock to the low of the same day or just take your profit and buy something else   but losing 1/3 times is just part of the unpredictable nature of the stock market which is causes simply because there are three types of traders all betting at the same time on the same stock   day traders who are trading from 1 to 10 times a day swing traders trading from 1 day to several weeks and buy and hold investors holding out for long term capital gains they each have different price targets and time horizons and that difference is what makes the market move   one person 's short term exit price at a profit is another persons long term entry point and because so many are playing at the same time with different time horizons stop losses and exit targets it is impossible to draw the price action or volume   but it is possible to cut your losses and ride your winners and if you keep on doing that you have a very fine return indeed

when i say dark navy i just mean that conservatively for an interview etc that something like thumbs is more appropriate than media cache    what you mention as lightly is called and on a black suit can be ok but it is a tougher look to pull off and you have a better chance of looking like a someone trying to dress like their media catalog product than looking like professional media cache suit chris they are also a bold choice for an interview and may draw attention to you as someone who wants to stand out in the wrong way or have the interviewer focusing on your suit rather than the content of your talking points    getting back to black i would n't suggest a black suit period unless you 've already amassed a mid gray mid dark navy light gray and even brown or other statement color or unless you are buying a if you do wear black you should only wear a white wp content black because blue does not contrast well with media cache these are some basic rules which can be broken but in general you 'll look objectively better from a pure fashion geek sense which tends to align with public perceptions if you stick to them    this is a really good primer from 2013 in /r on suits

the true answer is it depends because   it is up to the credit card issuer to follow the right path when issuing a replacement credit card typically issuers will transfer the account history to the new trade line says barry the consumer operations manager at fico the creator of the fico scoring formula the new account should have the old open date so you should retain your payment history he says the credit limit and balance should also stay the same how issuers report replacement cards we asked the major card issuers how they report replacement cards to credit reporting agencies american express the new card has the same open date and member since year as the previous card the balance on the old account number is transferred to the new account number all payment history transfers over bank of america all transactions and account history are transferred to the new account number when there is a card replacement or renewal capital one the new account number with all the original account data original open date etc is reported along with a notification to the bureaus that the new account number is replacing the old   the two can then be into one so that all the applicable payment history balance etc is now under the new account number chase the original does not change the history on the account remains just the account number field is updated with the new account number there is no new in this scenario

you lease one if you are going to get an economy car if you do n't drive too much < 15 k year and you want to hang on to the car for a long time   otherwise if you are a regular driver driving a leased new quality car can be cost effective many cars now have bumper to bumper warranties that last as long as the lease say 80 k so there is rarely any extra costs apart from regular maintenance the sweet spot for most new cars is in the 5th 6th or 7th years after they are paid off but at that point you may find you have maintenance bills that are approaching an average of $ 200 $ 300 per month in which case a lease starts to look pretty good i owned a 7 year old honda accord that cost only $ 80 less per month in maintenance than the new leased vw that replaced it   have n't looked back after that into my 3rd car and 9th year of leasing

spend your first 50 euros on research materials warren buffett got started as a boy by reading every book in the library of congress on investing and stock market analysis you can research the company filings for canadian companies at u.s companies at and european companies at find conflicting arguments and strategies and decide for yourself which ones are right the motley fool offers articles on good stocks to add to your portfolio and why as well as why not they provide a balanced judgement instead of just hype they also sell advice through their newsletter in canada the globe mail runs a daily column on screening stocks every day they present a different stock picking strategy and the filters used to reach their end list they then show how much that portfolio would have increased or decreased as well as talking about some of the good bad points of the stocks in the list it 's interesting to see over time a very few stocks show up on multiple lists for different strategies these ones in my opinion are the stocks to be investing in while the globe 's stock picks focus on canadian and us exchanges you might find the strategies worthwhile you can subscribe to the digital version at   once you have your analytical tools ready pick any bank or stock house that offers a free practice account use that account and their screening tools to try out your strategies and see if you can make money picking stocks   my personal stock picking strategy is to look for companies with a long uninterrupted history of paying dividends that are regularly increased and do not exceed the net profit per share of the company and whose share price has a long history of increasing these are called unicorn companies because there are so very few of them   another great read is do stocks outperform treasury bills by in this paper the author looks at the entire history of the u.s. stock universe and finds that less than 4 of stocks are responsible for 100 of the wealth creation in the u.s. stock market he discusses his strategies for picking the winners but it also suggests that if you do n't want to do any research you could pick pretty much any stock at random short it and wait i avoid mutual funds because they are a winner only for the selling them a great description on why the mutual fund industry is skewed against the investor can be found in a book called the rrsp secret by greg by tony robbins also discusses why mutual funds are not the best way to invest in stocks the investor puts up 100 of the money takes 100 of the risk and gets at best 30 of the return rich people do n't invest like that

old question but in the comments of the accepted answer i believe nate is correct and littleadv is incorrect nate copied the actual quote from the irs guidelines quoted below an expense is ordinary if it is common and accepted in your trade business or profession an expense is necessary if it is appropriate and helpful to your business an expense does n't have to be required to be considered necessary noise cancelling headphones certainly count as appropriate and helpful to your business in the software industry especially with the trend of open office layouts and because of the ubiquitous distractions inherent in the aforementioned office space noise cancelling headphones are becoming quite common and accepted for use by developers   i 'd be more hesitant about the keyboard and monitor as presumably the employer is providing those already as using your own could be said to just be a personal preference over those provided the argument that providing your own version is appropriate and helpful is a little more shaky   i am not a tax lawyer so do n't come after me if you get audited but my guess from reading the actual irs guidelines is noise cancelling headphones probably keyboard and monitor maybe

in 2014 the irs announced that it published guidance in notice 2014 21 in that notice the answer to the first question describes the general tax treatment of virtual currency for federal tax purposes virtual currency is treated as property general tax principles applicable to property transactions apply to transactions using virtual currency as it 's property like any other capital gains if and when you sell are taxed but there 's nothing illegal or nefarious about it and while you might get some odd questions if a large deposit ends up in your bank account as long as you answer them there really is n't a problem if you do n't have documentation of how much you paid for it if it 's a trivial amount compared to what it 's worth now you can just declare $ 0 as your basis i would suggest you try to have documentation that you 've held it at least one year so that it 's a long term capital gain but you can just mark the purchase date as various on your tax form i 've done this for a much smaller amount of bitcoins alas and have n't run into any trouble while there are some good reasons to sell slowly as others are saying i want to play devil 's advocate for a minute and give you a reason to sell quickly a decision to hold is equivalent to a decision to buy that is if a million dollars randomly ended up in your bank account for no reason you probably would n't choose to go put it all into bitcoin and then slowly sell it yet that 's more or less an equivalent financial situation to holding on to the bitcoin and slowly selling it while there are certainly tax advantages to selling over the course of many years bitcoin is one of the most volatile commodities out there and one has no idea what will happen over the next few weeks let alone the next few years it may go to tens of thousands of dollars a coin or it may go to basically zero if i had a million dollars in my pocket bitcoin is n't how i 'd choose to store it all just something to think about obviously you need to make the best choice for you for yourself

the implication is market irrationality is stronger than market rationality aka nothing makes sense when tsla climbs to $ 400 or when cmg rises to $ 750    i would n't say there is a systematic flaw in valuation i think there is just a lot of ignorance markets are more open to household investors than ever before you used to go to your broker and ask him what 's up and he 'd give you the inside scoop since you pay them money now you go onto marketwatch and get some random nobody 's opinion on everything and make stock selections based on that    but eventually the chickens come home to roost and things will correct itself big players will jump ship and cause signals to other traders to jump ship the public can pump stocks up pretty high but it does n't just go to infinity eventually someone will stop and say wtf is going on and start selling stocks are sold on a basis of a limit order book so it 's real prices that people are paying people do n't care about prices currently because most do n't have any finance knowledge but want to invest their own money   they just hear about tesla doing something amazing from some clickbait article or news outlet and ca n't stop thinking about buying tesla they go to chipotle and think wow this place is so good and hip they must be a great investment    the markets have been filled with more subjective analysis than ever before especially with so much low quality information at your equally ignorant people blogs about investment and personal finance being for other ignorant people in the end they all lose   people who this stock is going up to $ 250 easily with literally zero quantitative analysis or even a baseline reference point to back it up are prime examples of this    ignorance of markets and cheap money almost always lead to market runs that end dot com bubble 1929 market crash 2008 it 's always the same people who have no business taking loans out or buying on margin or leveraging positions with debt only to get fucked over once things are brought back down to earth after 2 runs of qe we now have cheap money and with everyone being a for their personal investment strategy we now also have rampant ignorance    i do n't expect things to last but no one can call the bottom or the top or else you 'd be very very rich have a safe portfolio do n't try to time the markets have a strategy that hedges against unexpected change do n't try to gamble on this change because it 's ultimately impossible to predict the movement of every single person on this earth that invests their money into markets so do n't try just be prepared      to expand further into valuation theory   at the end of the day people invest their money to make more money   it 's as simple as that   if your money does n't grow in an investment vehicle it 's ultimately a shit investment   but no one values intrinsic value of a company 's equity before they decide whether or not $ 380 for tsla is a good bad deal   as a result stocks can be pumped up way higher and people still see the gains on their stocks through capital gains fueled by other optimistic investors    non zero sum goes both ways   people can make shitloads of money on stock without an equitable loser people can also lose shitloads on stock without any real winner emerging from the   when this bubble bursts lots and lots of people will lose money on tsla when people 's expectations become rational and they stop paying $ 300 a share for a negative or 70 pe ratio   it 's insane what people will pay for these companies without even realizing the implication if you buy a share of a company with a pe ratio of 70 you just paid 70 times their earnings for a share   in an ideal world where they released every single penny of earnings as dividends it would take you 70 periods to reclaim your money on that share   this obviously does n't take into account capital gains but capital gains are n't supposed to be this irrational to where a stock can be pumped up into pe ratio in the first place   it 's a whole messed up web of confusion and irrationality and eventually something will a reaction   imagine a market where everyone just agreed to pump up a single stock to infinity and everyone just in shitloads of money   would this work   of course not   it 's literally a pyramid scheme that relies on future generations to constantly inject capital no real value is being created by this scheme   it requires constantly more future generations to continue adding money into the scheme and will crash once people stop pumping money into it   the same thing will happen here   everyone agreed to pump up tsla in a sense but eventually people will realize this is stupid as shit and the pyramid will come down because there is nothing they receive from this scheme other than the money from other people   it 's essentially moving money around making 0 use of it until people stop pumping money into the system and everyone realizes that nothing of real value had been produced through the use of this money   ultimately the only thing that creates real value is the money that is returned to shareholders from an outside party the company you 're invested in   real value is not created when people exchange stock and money   so why do these transactions create higher values in equity   the basis of equity valuation states that dividends are the only way for companies to raise the price of their stock going off the traditional dividend discount model   and theoretically that 's the only logical explanation   buying and trading stock does nothing for the company minus t stock they might own   ultimately the only party creating real value is the underlying company   if they are n't creating real value then their stock should not be increasing period   the way they create value is by efficiently utilizing assets to generate returns on investment which can be returned to investors through dividends   dividends can only be increased while maintaining an equitable payout ratio by generating more net income that can increase the actual pool of money that can be allocated back to investors   tsla does not do this   tsla regularly loses money and   there is no logical explanation for any of this except that everyone is irrational     obviously theory is not the same as in practice but the theory is important here because it 's really the basis for any investment at all   at the end of the day a share of stock is the right to a share of the company 's equity   people own equity in companies because companies generate money that it returns back to its owners   that 's what a company does   that 's what an owner does   if you own shares of a company you 're an owner   and if your company does not return more money back to you yoy then why are you invested in them     ultimately you 're riding a capital gains wave that will eventually once market irrationality to rationality   and it always does because the real value always catches up to the fake value that is caused by pumping and dumping stocks

this is not hypothetical this is an accurate story i am a long term investor i have a bunch of money that i 'd like to invest and i plan on spreading it out over five or six mutual funds and etfs roughly according to the canadian couch potato model portfolio that is passive mutual funds and etfs rather than specific stocks i am concerned that if i invest the full amount and the stock market crashes 30 next month i will have paid more than i had to as i am investing for the long term i expect to more than regain my investment but i still would n't be thrilled with paying 30 more than i had to instead i am investing my money in three stages i invested the first third earlier this month i 'll invest the next third in a few months and the final third a few months after that if the stock market climbs as i expect is more likely the case i will have lost out on some potential upside however if the stock market crashes next month i will end up paying a lower average cost as two of my three purchases will occur after the crash on average as a long term investor i expect the stock market to go up in the short term i expect much more fluctuation statistically speaking i 'd do better to invest all the money at once as most of the time the trend is upward however i am willing to trade some potential upside for a somewhat reduced risk of downside over the course of the next few months if we were talking a price difference of 1 as mentioned in the question i would n't care i expect to see average annual returns far above this but stock market crashes can cause the loss of 20 to 30 or more and those are numbers i care about i 'd much rather buy in at 30 less than the current price after all

the risk is that greece defaults on it 's debts and the rest of the eurozone chose to punish it by kicking it out of the eurozone and cutting off it 's banks from ecb funds since the greek government and banks are already in pretty dire straits this would leave greece with little choice but to convert deposits in those banks to a new drachma the exchange rate used for the forced conversions would almost certainly be unfavorable compared to market rates soon after the conversion there would likely be capital controls to prevent people pulling their money out in the to the forced conversion while i guess they could theoretically perform the forced conversion only on euro deposits this seems politically unlikely to me

when i was in that boat a few years ago i went for the car first   my thoughts if i get the car first i 'm guaranteed to have a car that runs well   that makes it more convenient to commute to any job or for social functions   i ended up dropping about $ 20k into a car paid cash i do n't like being in debt   i chose to buy a really nice car knowing it will last for many years to come i 'm expecting to not replace it for about 10 years from the purchase   i would urge you to consider paying in full for the car dumping $ is a lot and there are plenty of nice cars out there in the $ 10 20k range that will work just fine for years to come   one benefit of paying in full is that you do n't have a portion of your income tied into the car loan the main reason i chose not to go for the house first had more to do with the difference in commitment   a home mortgage is a 30-year commitment on a large chunk of your income   with the job market and housing markets both currently working against you it 's better to wait until you have a large safety net to fall into for example it 's always recommended to have several months worth of living expenses in savings   compared to renting having 6 or more months of mortgage payments + utilities + insurance + property taxes + other mandatory expenses see food gas comes out to a significant amount more that you should have saved for me i 'm looking at a minimum of about $ 20k in savings just to feel comfortable ymmv   also owning a house always has more maintenance costs than you will predict   even if it 's just replacing a few light bulbs at first eventually you 'll need something major an appliance will die your roof will spring a leak anything i had both of those happen in the first year though it could be bad luck   you should make sure that you can afford the increased monthly payments while still well under your income once you 're locked in to the house you can still set aside a smaller chunk of your income for a new car 5 10 years down the road   but if you 're current car is getting down to it 's last legs you should get that fixed up before you lock yourself in to an uncomfortable situation do n't be in too much of a hurry to buy a house   the housing market still has a ways to go before it recovers and there 's not a whole lot to help it along   interest rates may go up but that will only hurt the housing market so i do n't expect it to change too much for the next several months   with a little bit of sanity we wo n't have another outrageous housing bubble for many years so houses should remain somewhat affordable interest rates may vary   also keep in mind that if you pay less that 20 down on the house you may end up with some form of mortgage interest which is just extra interest you 'll owe each month

banks worry that the large gift might be a loan that is ultimately expected to be repaid if so that affects the cash flow of the recipient and makes it more difficult to make the mortgage payments to the bank   in some cases of course it is an informal loan dad advances a large $ x to son to use as a but does not charge interest and the expectation is that the money will be returned in smaller chunks as and when the son can afford to repay dad    in some cases dad truly means it as a gift but son feels an obligation to repay the money if not explicitly then by paying for the first few months of dad 's nursing home stay etc   so banks like to have an explicit document such as a copy of a letter from dad saying that this money is a gift and some assurance that this is on the up and up    if the amount is larger than the maximum gift that can be given each year without having to file a gift tax return then some assurance that a gift tax return will be filed is helpful mentioning this in the letter is good it indicates that there are no secret or secret agreements to the effect that this is in fact a loan with or without regular repayments

the schufa in germany works a bit different from the fico score in the us my background i am a german currently living in the us the information others want to see from the schufa are a bit different if you want to example rent a house or an apartment the landlord often wants to see a schufa statement which only shows that there are no negative entries this statement you can get easily from online and they do n't mention your credit score there if you apply for a real credit or want to lease a car they want to look deeper in your schufa profile however very important is they need signed permission to do this every participating company can submit entries to your profile where the score is calculated from for example mobile phone plans leasing a car applying for a loan some lenders decide on the score itself some on the overall profile and some also take your income into account since there is no hire fire in germany you are often asked to show your last 3 paychecks this in combination with your schufa score is used for determination if you are eligible for a loan or not however they check through every entry which is made there and as long as it is reasonable and fits to your income car for 800 eur month with a 1000 eur salary does not you should not have a problem establishing a good score the in my eyes unfair part about schufa is that they take your zip code and your neighborhood into account when calculating their score also moving often affects the score negatively to finally answer your question credit history is also built by mobile phone plans etc in germany as long as you pay everything on time you should be fine a bad score can definitely hurt you but it is not as important to have a score as it is in the us because the banks also determine your creditworthiness based on your monthly income and your spending behavior

if a company is doing well it seems less likely to go bankrupt   if a company is doing poorly it seems more likely to go bankrupt   the problem is where is the inflection point between well and poorly   when does a company start to head into oblivion   sometimes it is hard to know   but if you do n't call that right and hold onto your shares when a company is tanking others who call it before you do will sell off devalue the share price and now you 've missed your chance to get out at a good profit   if you hang on too long the company may just go bankrupt and you 've lost your investment entirely a healthy profitability of the company therefore has to bolster investor confidence in avoiding this very unpleasant scenario   therefore the more profitable a company is the more shareholder confidence it and the more willing to pay for it in the form of increased share price   and this then has a meta effect in that each shareholder thinks all other investors think this way too and so each feels good about holding the stock since he knows he can likely easily liquidate it for good cash if he needs to either now or in the next year or sometime hence

he 's misunderstanding buffett 's argument which is that all forms of investment compete and so when interest rates give you guaranteed low returns it makes sense for stocks to give you average low returns   that implies high prices for current stocks because your return on equities is the price tomorrow over the price today   buffett would likely agree with him that this implies slow growth in the future though he may not want to say so for competitive reasons   historical p e norms are a more wrong metric because they do n't capture any fundamental change that might have happened in the economy   what 's likely going on is a surplus of capital as business becomes more efficient i.e. generates more revenue with fewer workers that excess cash flow becomes investable capital but as it becomes more efficient i.e. less of that revenue filters down to workers in the form of wages that they can spend on consumer goods the amount of productive uses where that capital can be effectively deployed in income generating activities declines   more capital + fewer investable opportunities = higher supply + lower demand = the price of securities for the few areas of the economy that are doing well increases   this is why you see insane valuations for tech companies   if we do get a major economic crash it will likely come from a style financial crisis where all the money gets concentrated within emerging new industries focused on new technology who ca n't sell their products because nobody else has any money   we 're on the path to that already but it will likely take a decade or two to play out there 's still a lot of money left in the old economy which can be extracted   also these style of financial crises usually are accompanied by war and a breakdown of the established political order and so all bets are off anyway

yes i read those links   i also read edmunds other blogs about the car   i also watched the cr talking cars episode about it   which is why i recognize that they were very favorable   both entities loved the car kept the car longer than they normally keep their cars and were sad to see them go   edmunds found that the car 's depreciation was significantly below average   both entities had issues with their car which were fixed for free and with as little trouble as possible and a high level of service   cr stresses that their reliability survey of customers shows the model s to be average reliability not below average and this is for a early production car from a new manufacturer   edmunds stresses that many of the problems were ones which were fixed on their car and the fixes have been applied to all later production cars   and neither of them are anything but positive about the driving experience   perhaps you should read them again instead of reading the one quote the page click driven media has chosen for you from them

when interest rates rise the price of bonds fall because bonds have a fixed coupon rate and since the interest rate has risen the bond 's rate is now lower than what you can get on the market so it 's price falls because it 's now less valuable bonds diversify your portfolio as they are considered safer than stocks and less volatile however they also provide less potential for gains although diversification is a good idea for the individual investor it is far too complicated and incurs too much transaction costs not to mention that rebalancing would have to be done on a regular basis in your case where you have mutual funds already it is probably a good idea to keep investing in mutual funds with a theme which you understand the industry 's role in the economy today rather than investing in some special bonds which you can not relate to the benefit of having a mutual fund is to have a professional manage your money and that includes diversification as well so that you do n't have to do that

one reason i have heard beside to keep you paying rent is the cost of maintenance and improvements   if you hire someone else to do all the work for you then it may very well be the case though it is not as bad as a car many factors come into play    if you are lucky you may end up with a lot that is worth more than the house on it in a few decades time personally i feel that renting is sometimes better than owning depending on the local market   that said when you own a home it is yours   you do have to weigh in such factors as being tied down to a certain location to some extent   however only the police can in under certain circumstances where as a landlord can come in whenever they feel like given proper notice or an emergency   not to mention that if someone a door so hard that it through the entire place you can actually deal with it the point of this last bit is the question of home ownership vs renting is rather subjective   objectively the costs associated with home ownership are the drags that may make it a bad investment   however it is not like car ownership which is quite honestly rarely an

you will invest 1000 £ each month and the transaction fee is 10 £ per trade so buying a bunch of stocks each month would not be wise   if you buy 5 stocks then transaction costs will eat up 5 of your investment   so if you insist on taking this approach you should probably only buy one or two stocks a month it sounds like you 're interested in active investing would like a diversified portfolio so maybe the best approach for you is core satellite portfolio management   start by creating a well diversified portfolio core with index funds   once you have a solid core make some active investment decisions with the satellite portion of the portfolio   you can dollar cost average into the core and make active bets when the opportunity arises so you 're not killed by transaction fees

ditto to md tech but from a more philosophical point of view when you buy stock you own it just like you own a cell phone or a toaster or a pair of socks that you bought the difference is that a share of stock means that you own a piece of a corporation you ca n't physically take possession of it and put it in your garage because if all the stock holders did that then all the company 's assets would be scattered around all the stock holder 's garages and the company could n't function like if you bought a share in a football team you could n't take one of the football players home and keep him in your closet because then the team would n't be able to function i might want to take one of the home but that 's another subject in pre electronic times you could get a piece of paper that said xyz corporation 1 share you could take physical possession of this piece of paper and put it in your filing cabinet i 'm not sure if you can even get such certificates any more i have n't seen one in decades these days it 's just recorded electronically that does n't mean that you do n't own it it just means that someone else is keeping the records for you it 's like leaving your car in a parking lot it 's still your car the people who run the parking lot does n't own it they are keeping it for you but just because they have physical possession does n't make it theirs

i think your best bet here would be hsbc   they will provide the required currencies credit debit cards and very easy to use online banking transfers   this includes an online global account view which features all of your accounts on a single screen and allows you to drag and drop money between accounts regarding fees i suspect you will need to be a premier account holder in order to avoid any fees imposed on transactions such as money transfers and exchanging money between currencies   in my experience hsbc offers extremely good exchange rates when exchanging large amounts of money greater than $ 10,000 gbp 5,000   exchanging small amounts will carry a larger spread but still much better than most banks offer in my experience exchanging gbp 5000 will have a spread of about percent while exchanging more than will have a spread of as little as percent in order to qualify for a premier account if my memory of hsbc uk serves me correctly you will need to have at least gbp 50,000 net across all of your hsbc managed accounts including and other investment accounts in order to open a banking swiss account you will need to travel to switzerland and apply in person   you can not open a foreign bank account remotely   with a foreign investment account i believe you can open accounts remotely   for example i opened an account with fidelity switzerland using my fidelity uk account directly from the uk however obviously fidelity does not provide banking services so this is not of interest to you the simplest thing to do is to visit your local hsbc branch and discuss it with them in person other uk banks such as barclays will also provide such services but in my experience they are not as competitive on fees

a utma may or may not fit your situation the main drawbacks to a utma account is that it will count against your child for financial aid it counts as the child 's asset the second thing to consider is that taxes are n't deferred like in a 529 plan the last problem of course is that when he turns 18 he gets control of the account and can spend the money on random junk which may or may not be important to you a 529 plan has a few advantages over a utma account the grandparents can open the account with your son as the beneficiary and the money does n't show up on financial aid for college under current law which could change of course earnings grow tax free which will net you more total growth you can also contribute substantially more without triggering the gift tax also many states provide a state tax break for contributing to the state sponsored 529 plan the account owner would be the grandparents so junior ca n't spend the money on teenage junk the big downside to the 529 is the 10 penalty if the money is n't used for higher education the flip side is that if the money is left for 20 years you will also have additional growth from the 20 years of tax free growth which may be a wash depending on your tax bracket and the tax rates in effect over those 20 years

when you invest in an s&p500 index fund that is priced in usd the only major risk you bear is the risk associated with the equity that comprises the index since both the equities and the index fund are priced in usd the fund in your question however is priced in eur for a fund like this to match the performance of the s&p500 which is priced in usd as closely as possible it needs to hedge against fluctuations in the eur usd exchange rate if the fund simply converted eur to usd then invested in an s&p500 index fund priced in usd the eur priced fund may fail to match the usd priced fund because of exchange rate fluctuations here is a simple example demonstrating why hedging is necessary i assumed the current value of the usd priced s&p500 index fund is 1,600 usd share the exchange rate is 1.3 usd eur if you purchase one share of this index using eur you would pay eur share   if the s&p500 increases 10 to usd share and the exchange rate remains unchanged the value of the your investment in the eur fund also increases by 10 both sides of the equation are multiplied by 1.1   however the currency risk comes into play when the eur usd exchange rate changes take the 10 increase in the price of the usd index occurring in tandem with an appreciation of the eur to 1.4 usd eur   although the usd priced index gained 10 the appreciation of the eur means that the eur value of your investment is almost unchanged from the first equation for investments priced in eur that invest in securities priced in usd the presence of this additional currency risk mandates the use of a hedge if the indexes are going to track the fund you linked to uses swap contracts which i discuss in detail below to hedge against fluctuations in the eur usd exchange rate since these derivatives are n't free the cost of the hedge is included in the expenses of the fund and may result in differences between the s&p500 index and the s&p 500 euro hedged index   also it 's important to realize that any time you invest in securities that are priced in a different currency than your own you take on currency risk whether or not the investments aim to track indexes this holds true even for securities that trade on an exchange in your local currency like adr 's or gdr 's i wrote an answer that goes through a simple example in a similar fashion to the one above in that context so you can read that for more information on currency risk in that context   there are several ways to investors be they institutional or individual can hedge against currency risk ishares offers an etf that tracks the s&p500 euro hedged index and uses a over the counter currency swap contract called a month forward fx contract to hedge against the associated currency risk in these contracts two parties agree to swap some amount of one currency for another amount of another currency at some time in the future this allows both parties to effectively lock in an exchange rate for a given time period a month in the case of the ishares etf and therefore protect themselves against exchange rate fluctuations in that period   there are other forms of currency swaps equity swaps etc that could be used to hedge against currency risk in general two parties agree to swap one quantity like a eur cash flow payments of a fixed interest rate etc for another quantity like a usd cash flow payments based on a floating interest rate etc in many cases these are over the counter transactions there is n't necessarily a standardized definition   for example if the european manager of a fund that tracks the s&p500 euro hedged index is holding euros and wants to lock in an effective exchange rate of 1.4 usd eur above the current exchange rate he may find another party that is holding usd and wants to lock in the respective exchange rate of eur usd the other party could be an american fund manager that manages a usd price fund that tracks the ftse by swapping usd and eur both parties can at a price lock in their desired exchange rates   i want to clear up something else in your question too it 's not correct that the s&p 500 is completely unrelated to the euro far from it there are many cases in which the eur usd exchange rate and the level of the s&p500 index could be related for example troublesome economic news in europe could cause the euro to depreciate against the dollar as european investors flee to safety e.g. invest in treasury bills however this economic news could also cause us investors to feel that the global economy wo n't recover as soon as hoped which could affect the s&p500   if the euro appreciated against the dollar for whatever reason this could increase profits for us businesses that earn part of their profits in europe if a us company earns 1 million eur and the exchange rate is 1.3 usd eur the company earns 1.3 million usd if the euro appreciates against the dollar to 1.4 usd eur in the next quarter and the company still earns 1 million eur they now earn 1.4 million usd even without additional sales the us company earned a higher usd profit which is reflected on their financial statements and could increase their share price thus affecting the s&p500 combining examples 1 and 2 if a us company earns some of its profits in europe and a recession hits in the eu two things could happen simultaneously a the company 's sales decline as european consumers scale back their spending and b the euro depreciates against the dollar as european investors sell euros and invest in safer securities denominated in other currencies usd or not the company suffers a loss in profits both from decreased sales and the depreciation of the eur   there are many more factors that could lead to correlation between the euro and the s&p500 or more generally the european and american economies the balance of trade investor and consumer confidence exposure of banks in one region to sovereign debt in another the spread of asset mortgage backed securities from us financial firms to european banks companies municipalities etc all play a role   one example of this last point comes from this article which includes an interesting line among the victims of america ’s subprime crisis are eight municipalities in norway which lost a total of $ 125 million through subprime mortgage related investments long story short these municipalities had mortgage backed securities in their investment portfolios that were derived from far down the line subprime mortgages on us homes i do n't know the specific cities but it really demonstrates how interconnected the world 's economies are when an american family 's payment on their subprime mortgage in say chicago can end up backing a derivative investment in the investment portfolio of say norway

anything where the initial step of someone trying to get you into anything financial is to send you an e mail there are valid situations in which e mails may be used to introduce you to a financial product or offer such as if you have signed up for an electronic newsletter that includes such information but in that particular case the e mail is n't the first step rather whatever caused you to sign up for the newsletter was even in a valid legitimate scenario you should obviously still perform due diligence and research the offer before committing any of your money but the odds that someone is contacting you out of the blue via e mail with a legitimate financial offer are tiny the odds that a lawyer a banker or someone similar in a remote country would initially contact you via e mail are yet smaller i 'd call those odds non zero but unlikely enough that it is probably more likely that you would win the grand prize in the state lottery four times in a row keep in mind that responding in any way to spam e mails will simply confirm to the sender that your e mail address is valid and is being read that is likely to cause you to receive more spam not less no matter the content of your response hence it is better to flag the e mail as spam or junk if your e mail provider offers that feature or just delete it if they do n't the same general principles as above also apply to social media messaging and similar venues but the exact details are highly likely to differ somewhat

does it make sense for stocks to earn a premium indefinitely yes there is good reason to think that the stock market will make money indefinitely the stock market is the primary mechanism through which investors bear market risk which requires compensation   if you think of all the owners of firms stockholders and bondholders generally the risk premium that stocks earn stocks is the way bondholders pay equityholders to bear the risk that they do not wish to will stock prices always go up in the long run as long as companies pay out less in dividends than their profit prices will go up   that could change if we were to change our corporate culture and/or tax practices so that firms paid out more in dividends   however for the purposes of your question i think it does n't matter much whether the investor makes money as dividends or capital gains does the 5 7 guess apply only to the us market i did n't write nor read the books in question but most likely that is a global number   the us dominates the global equity market so it 's often a good proxy   however international returns taken together have no less risk and earn no less over long horizons in general   the particular examples you have pointed out are special cases that only apply to a part of the global economy and a particular time period   there are plenty of examples of stock markets and time periods that did much better than the us market to offset your examples is 5 7 a reasonable long term estimate of equity returns equity will always earn more in expectation than risk free securities will   how much more depends on major economic factors   5 7 has been a good estimate for the market risk premium for many many decades stocks should earn this plus whatever the risk free rate is   however that is just an empirical observation not a rule   it can change   some day technological progress could slow down or stop we could run out of important resources in a way that we ca n't compensate for our population permanently could stop growing aliens could invade etc   down the road it is certainly possible for expected equity returns to go down and never go back up again   this would result from a permanent global economic shift that i think would be pretty obvious   that is you would n't have to look at stock prices to know it was happening

myself i am in a similar position i 've had a few good conversations about this with people in the financial services industry   it all depends how much time you want to spend on yielding your profits and how much risk you would like to take high time and high risk obviously means higher expected gain but also has a high chance of creating a loss option 1 you could buy a home now and take out a mortgage with a high down payment thus lower interest rates and rent it out by the time you are ready to have your own house you can decide to either take out a mortgage on your second house and make money off your first house and keep renting it out or you could move in there yourself   if you use an asset back mortgage i 'm not sure if that is the term but a mortgage where in the worst case you give your home back to the bank you generally carry least risk if you keep doing this you can have 2 houses paid off if everything goes well option 2   you could also invest in stocks this all depends on the risk you want to take and the time you want to put in it   option 3   you could also put the money in a savings account some banks will give you better interest rates if you lock the money for a set amount of years   option 4   you could buy a foreclosure and try to flip it though this is very risky and requires a lot of time also it is important to also have some sort of emergency fund so whatever you do do n't spend all your money   save some for a rainy day hope it helps

well the simple answer is that i reject the assumptions of demand side economics i do n't believe that the velocity of money matters because money is n't real it 's just a proxy for actual value which is derived from the subjective perception of people   the trouble with looking at data is that it 's all observational data not experimental so a substantial amount of judgement needs to be employed in interpreting causation and with economics being a politically charged discipline there 's significant risk of bias in making those judgements particularly if they are being made in an ideologically homogeneous setting such as much of present day academia   i look at economics from a lens rather than an one which is why i do n't take studies as seriously as some others do

this probably is a question that belongs on history but here 's the basic reason the or employee retirement income security act erisa of 1974 established that health benefits under approved plans were not taxable to the employee   if the employer were to pay for an employees non erisa approved individual plan it would be a taxable benefit the longer story is that many esp president richard nixon were concerned that public pressure was going to lead public sentiment toward nationalized health care   this made health insurance more affordable to employees and effectively made it a cheaper way to compensate employees similar to how 401 k contributions are worth more in nominal terms to the employee than an equivalent amount of cash   while the law was not signed by richard nixon due to some other stuff that was going on it was something proposed and pushed by his administration

to add to @keshlam 's answer slightly a stock 's price is made up of several components the only one of these that is known even remotely accurately at any time is the book value on the day that the accounts are prepared even   completed cashflows after the books have been prepared contain some slight unknowns as they may be reversed if stock is returned for example or reduced by unforeseen costs   future cashflows are based on amongst other things how many sales you expect to make in the future for all time exercise for the reader how many iphone will apple sell in even known future cashflows have some risk attached to them customers may not pay for goods a supplier may go into liquidation and so need to change its invoicing strategy etc estimating the risk on future cashflows is highly subjective and depends greatly on what the analyst expects the exact economic state of the world will be in the future investors have the choice of investing in a risk free instrument this is usually taken as being modelled by the 10 year us treasury bond that is guaranteed to give them a return to invest in anything riskier than the risk free instrument they must be paid a premium over the risk free return that they would get from that the risk premium is related to how likely they think it is that they will not receive a return higher than that rate calculation of that premium is highly subjective if i know the management of the company well i will be inclined to think that the investment is far less risky or perhaps riskier than someone who does not for example since none of the factors that go into a share price are accurately measurable and many are subjective there is no right share price at any time let alone at time of ipo each investor will estimate these values differently and so value the shares differently and their trading based on their ever changing estimates will move the share price to an level in comments to @keshlam 's answer you ask if there is enough information to work out the share price if a company buys out the company before ipo dividing the price that this other company paid by the relative ownership structure of the firm would give you an idea of what that company thought that the company was worth at that moment in time and can be used as a for market price but it will not and can not accurately represent the market price as other investors will value the firm differently by estimating the criteria above differently and so will move the share price based on their valuation

this is a slightly different reason to any other answer i have seen here about irrationality and how being rationally aware of one 's irrationality in the future or in different circumstances can lead you to make decisions which on the face of it seem wrong first of all why do people sometimes maintain balances on high interest debt when they have savings standard advice on many money management sites and forums is to withdraw the savings to pay down the debt however i think there is a problem with this suppose you have $ 5,000 in a savings account and a $ 2,000 credit card balance you are paying more interest on the credit card than you get from the savings account and it seems that you should withdraw some money from the savings account and pay off the cc however the difference between the two scenarios other than the interest you lose by keeping the cc balance is your motivation for saving if you have a credit card balance of $ 2,000 you might be obliged to pay a minimum payment of $ 100 each month if you have any extra money you will be rewarded if you pay more in to the credit card by seeing the balance go down and understanding that you will soon be free from receiving this awful bill each month to maintain your savings goal it 's enough to agree with yourself that you wo n't do any new spending on the cc or withdraw any savings   now suppose that you decide to pay off the cc with the savings there is now nothing forcing you to save $ 100 each month when you get to the end of the month you have to motivate yourself that you will be adding spare cash to your $ 3,000 savings balance rather than that you have to pay down your cc yes if you spend the spare cash instead of saving it you get something in return for it but it is possible that spending $ 140 on small scale discretionary spending things you do n't need actually gets you less for your money than paying the credit card company $ 40 interest and saving $ 100 you might even be tempted to start spending on your credit card again knowing that you have a 0 balance and that you can always pay it off out of savings it 's easy to this to a situation with two types of debt suppose that you have a $ 2,000 debt to your parents with no interest and a $ 2,000 loan at high interest and you get a $ 2,000 windfall let 's assume that your parents do n't need the money in a hurry and are n't you to pay them otherwise you could consider the guilt or the hassle as a form of emotional interest rate might it not be better to pay your parents off if you do you are likely to keep paying off your loan out of necessity of making the regular payments in 20 paychecks or whatever you might be debt free if you pay off your loan you lose the incentive to save after 20 months you still owe your parents $ 2,000 i am not saying that this is always what makes sense just that it could make sense note that this is an opposite to the debt snowball method that method says that it 's better to pay off small debts because that way you have more free cash flow to pay off the larger debts the above argues that this is a bad idea because you might spend the increased cash flow on junk it would be better to keep around as many things as possible which have minimum payments because it restricts you to paying things rather than gives you the choice of whether to save or spend

the answer do n't use your actual card number some banks offer virtual credit card numbers services like apple pay are functionally the same bank of america 's virtual cards work like this the virtual card number is different from your actual card number so the merchant never sees your real card number in fact the merchant can not even tell that you are using a virtual card you can set the maximum amount to be charged you can set the expiration date from 2 to 12 months once the merchant has made a charge on that virtual card only that merchant can make any further charges on that same virtual card it is not possible to discover the real card number from the virtual card number so the result is that your risk is reduced to the merchant not delivering the order or charging too much but not over the limit you set there is nothing to be stolen since your real info never goes over the internet and once a merchant has used the virtual card once no other merchant can use it other banks may have virtual cards which have fewer features the only disadvantage of this is that you have to go to the bank 's website whenever you want to make a purchase from a new merchant but you do n't have to worry about them stealing your real credit card information

that 's exactly how i feel too   i do n't think there is an easy or painless way out of this mess   but i do think the government needs to step aside and let everything correct   promote competition by removing regulatory hurdles for new businesses and reduce taxes dramatically   i imagine a huge part of this can be financed just by stopping our military operations and not touching social services and healthcare   the hell out of wall street by letting the banks fail and or the federal reserve   the economy will fall into depression for a while but it will recover on its own in 1 to 2 years much like the depression of   absolutely do not try to prop prices up like they did in the great depression for example by slaughtering pigs when people were   the alternative to this is what we 're doing now which i think will at best end up similar to japan 's lost decade or at worst a hyperinflation of the us dollar

it is totally a demand problem   why are n't people buying things in greece   because everyone 's poor and there is no demand   why are people buying things in germany   because the german government spent their way out of their recession by spreading money around to the people that needed it   why did we get out of the great depression   because those without money were given some which they then spent   companies are n't making stuff because no one is buying   historically higher taxes on higher income people and businesses equate with a better economy   i do n't see any data your side just lots of hand waving

yes merchants may charge a fee for using a credit card for a credit card transaction interchange fees flow from the merchant to the card issuer this is why australians are seeing a boom in debit mastercard visa cards the issuing banks make income when you select credit   these costs can be passed from the merchant to the customer as a credit card fee for an transaction the interchange flows the other way from the card issuer to the acquiring bank the merchant 's bank   as an aside the setup of these fees is why some large supermarket chains in australia restrict you from selecting credit with a scheme debit card mastercard and visa are schemes   they are in the payments networks and they make interchange fees when you hit savings and pay if you hit credit therefore where you can hit either credit or savings they prefer and may force you to press savings

when you pay cash for a car you do n't always necessarily need to pay cash you just are n't using credit or a loan is all a few options you have are obviously no dealer expects anyone to just have the cash laying around for a car worth a few thousand dollars nor would you bother going to your bank or credit union for the cash you can simply get a cashier 's check made out for the amount note that dealers may not accept personal checks as they may bounce   after negotiations at the dealer you would explain you 're paying cash likely pay a deposit depending on the price of the car but $ 500 would probably be enough again the deposit can be a check or bank deposit and then come back later on with a cashier 's check or deposit into a bank account you would be able to do this later that day or within a few days but since you 've purchased a new car you would probably want to return asap

basically the idea of an ira is that the money is earned by you and would normally be taxed at the individual rate but the government is allowing you to avoid paying the taxes on it now by instead putting it in the account this tax deferral encourages retirement savings by reducing your current taxable income providing a short term carrot   however the government will want their cut specifically when you begin withdrawing from that account the principal which was n't taxed when you put it in will be taxed at the current individual rate when you take it out when you think about it that 's only fair you did n't pay taxes on it when it came out of your paycheck so you should pay that tax once you 're withdrawing it to live on here 's the rub the interest is also taxed at the individual rate at the time that was a good thing the capital gains rate in 1976 when the regular ira was established was 35 the highest it 's ever been now that 's not looking so good because the current cap gains rate is only 15 however these rates rise and fall cap gains more than individual rates and so by contributing to a traditional ira you simplify your tax bill the principal and interest is taxed at the individual rate as if you were still making a paycheck a roth ira is basically the government trying to get money now by giving up money later you pay the marginal individual rate on the contributions as you earn them it becomes a post tax deduction but then that money is completely yours and the kicker is that the government wo n't tax the interest on it if you do n't withdraw it before retirement age this makes roths very attractive to retirement investors as a hedge against higher overall tax rates later in life if you think that for any reason you 'll be paying more taxes in 30 years than you would be paying for the same money now you should be investing in a roth a normal non ira investment account at first seems to be the worst of both worlds you pay individual tax on all earned wages that you invest then capital gains on the money your investment earns stock gains and dividends bond interest etc whenever you cash out however a traditional account has the most flexibility you can keep your money in and take your money out on a timeline you choose this means you can react both to market moves and to tax changes when a conservative administration tax rates on capital gains you can cash out pay that low rate on the money you made from your account and then the money 's yours to spend or to reinvest you can if you 're and tax savvy use all three of these instruments to your overall advantage when tax rates are high now contribute to a traditional ira and then withdraw the money during your retirement in times where individual tax rates are low when tax rates are low like right now max out your roth contributions and use that money after retirement when tax rates are high use a regular investment account as an overage to roth contributions when taxes are low contribute when the individual rate is low then capitalize and reinvest during times when capital gains taxes are low perhaps replacing a paycheck deduction in annual contributions to a roth or you can simply fold it back into the investment account this is n't as good as a roth but is better than a traditional by capitalizing at an advantageous time you turn interest earned into principal invested and pay a low tax on it at that time to avoid a higher tax later however the market and the tax structure have to coincide to make ordinary investing pay off you may have bought in in the early 90s taking advantage of the lowest individual rates since the great depression while now capital gains taxes are the lowest they 've ever been if you cash out you may not be realizing much of a gain in the first place

i thought the line is much than that though say you have a company with divisions an overseas division makes an item sells it to another division overseas for final packaging then it 's sold domestically the domestic division should only pay taxes on the profits they earn and overseas on the profits from what they ship    but the company only wants to pay minimal taxes so they set the foreign price high so that a majority of profits are made overseas who will argue that this is n't correct is n't that it it 's not foreign sales but markup

is there any practical reason to hold off on making payments until i receive a billing statement yes a few    as for a zero balance fico consumer affairs manager barry says the idea here is the lower the better in terms of the utilization percentage but something is better than nothing the score wants to see some kind of activity   how low should you go in a recent interview fico spokesman craig watts said if your utilization is 10 percent or lower you 're in great shape as far as utilization goes that being said there are downsides especially if you wind up forgetting to make a payment   the easiest thing to do also from a time management perspective is to get your billing statement once a month verify the purchases on it and at that time you receive the statement schedule an online bill payment so that it will be paid in full before the due date    as aganju points out you do n't have to wait for a paper bill in hand or even an e mail notification you can go online after your statement date to get the statement   this makes sure you wo n't have extra costs related to of mail if you still receive paper mail though it does require remembering to check and/or setting a recurring calendar reminder   paying much in advance of that as is your current practice might be a good idea to free up available balance if you are planning a purchase that would take you over your credit limit but this should be relatively rare and some credit card companies will raise that limit if you have been paying well and ask nicely though find out first if they do a hard pull of your credit report for that

my recommendation is to pay off your student loans as quickly as possible it sounds like you 're already doing this but do n't incur any other large debts until you have this taken care of   i 'd also recommend not buying a car especially an expensive one on credit or lease either back during the dotcom boom i and many friends bought or leased expensive cars only to lose them or struggle paying for them when the bottom dropped out a car instantly depreciates and it 's quite rare for them to ever gain value again stick with reliable older used cars that you can purchase for cash if you do borrow for a car shop around for the best deal and avoid 3 + year terms if at all possible do n't lease unless you have a business structure where this might create a clear financial advantage avoid credit cards as much as possible although if you do plan to buy a house with a mortgage you 'll need to maintain some credit history if you have the discipline to keep your balance small and paid down you can use a credit card to build credit history however these things can quickly get out of hand and you 'll wonder why you suddenly owe $ 10 k $ 20 k or even more on them so be very careful with them as for the house speaking of us markets here save up for at least a 20 down payment if you can based on what you said this would be about $ 20 25k. this will give you a lot more flexibility to take advantage of deals that might come your way even if you do n't put it all into the house stretching to buy a house that 's too expensive can quickly lead to financial ruin as for house size i recommend purchasing a 4 bedroom house even if you are n't planning on kids right away it will resell better and you 'll appreciate having the extra space for storage home office hobbies etc also life has a way of changing your plans for having kids and such

the two dimensions are to open the trade creating a position and to buy or sell becoming long or short the option if you already own an option you bought it to open and then you would sell it to close if you do n't own an option you can either buy it to open or sell it short it to open if you are already short an option you can buy it back to close if you sell to open covered the point is you 're creating a covered call which means you own the stock and then sell a call since you own the stock the covered call has a lot of the risk of loss removed though it also subtracts much of the reward possible from your stock

i 'm not sure the term actually has a clear meaning we can think of what does this mean in two ways its broad semantic meaning and its mechanical what actual variables in the market represent this quantity net buying selling have a clear meaning in the former sense by analogy to the basic concept of supply and demand in equilibrium markets it 's not as clear what their meaning should be in the latter sense roughly as the top comment notes you could say that a price decrease is because of net selling at the previous price level while a price rise is driven by net buying at the previous price level but in terms of actual market mechanics the only way prices move is by matching of a buyer and a seller so every market transaction inherently represents an instantaneous balance across the bid ask spread so then we could think about the notion of orders actual transactions only occur in balance but there is a whole book of standing orders at various prices so maybe we could use some measure of the volume at various price levels in each of the bid ask books to decide some notion of net buying selling but again actual transactions occur only when matched across the spread if a significant order volume is added on one side or the other but at a price far away from the bid offer far enough that an actual trade at that price is unlikely to occur should that be included in the notion of net buying selling presumably there is some price distance from the bid offer where the orders do n't matter for net buying selling i 'm sure you 'd find a lot of buyers for brk.a at $ 1 but that 's completely irrelevant to the notion of net buying selling in maybe the closest thing i can think of in terms of actual market mechanics is the comparative total volumes during the period that would still have been executed if forced to execute at the end of period price assuming that traders valuations are fixed through the period in question and trading occurs on the basis of fundamentals which i know is n't a good assumption in practice but the impact of price history upon future price is too complex for this analysis we have two cases if price falls we can assume all buyers who executed above the last price in the period would have happily bought at the last price saving money while all sellers who executed below the last price in the period would also be happy to sell for more the former will be larger than the latter if the price rises the reverse is true

tldr is the purpose of doing this to ultimately avoid any sort of capital gains paid by someone in your family your plan accomplishes this if your dad is single and you are married but if your dad is married this is probably unnecessary one side effect of this plan is both you and your dad are unnecessarily giving up a portion of your lifetime gift tax exclusion your dad is giving up somewhere between 97 $ 41 k of his exclusion if both you and he are married and 97 $ 85 k if neither you or your dad is married and when you give the $ 430 k back you are giving up to that amount minus somewhere between 14 if your dad is married and you were to simply purchase the home from your dad for $ 430 k you would both avoid dipping into your lifetime max and your dad would n't realize any capital gains if he is n't married but you are then your plan works in avoiding any capital gains paid by anyone in your family unless you end up selling the home in the future for more than $ the plan also hinges on

the guideline for the size of an emergency fund is just a guideline   i 've usually heard it expressed as 3 to 6 months but everyone has a different idea of exactly how big it should be the purpose of the fund is to give you enough cash to be able to pay for unexpected expenses that have come up that you have not budgeted for without you having to borrow money to pay for them to figure out how big this fund should be we look at the worst case scenario   suppose that you lost your job tomorrow   what would you do cut your expenses   you 'd probably be much more careful how you spend money secure health insurance   this would be done by either continuing your employer 's policy with cobra or by purchasing your own insurance likely through the obamacare aca market   keep in mind that most likely your employer is paying for a portion of your insurance now so this expense will go up quite a bit no matter which option you choose look for another job   you 'd probably begin your search for a new job immediately the size of your emergency fund determines how long you will be able to go without income before you need to start a new job regarding cutting your expenses it is up to you how much you would cut   there are things that are easy to cut temporarily or permanently such as restaurants entertainment expenses vacations etc   you would probably stop retirement investing until you have income again   the more you cut the longer your emergency fund would last   things you do n't want to cut are necessities like housing groceries utilities transportation etc   i would also include health insurance in this list   certainly if you have a pre existing condition you do not want to let your health insurance coverage lapse your is also a factor   if you believe that you would have an easy time finding similar employment to what you have now your emergency fund might not need to be quite as big as someone who believes they would have a harder time finding another job

you report it as an expense against the 1099 income when you do your taxes you will only be taxed on the amount after the lawyers fees but if it cost you more in lawyers fees than you recover in damages the loss is not deductible be sure to keep documentation of the lawyers bill and the contract damages are generally not taxable at all you can see here for more information on that

how are shareholders sure to receive a fair percentage of each company   at the time the split occurs each investor owns the same proportion of each new company that they owned in the first   what the investor does with it after that selling one for example is irrelevant from a fairness perspective suppose company a splits into companies b and c.   you own enough stock to have 1 of a.   it splits   now you have a bunch of shares of b and c.   how much   well you have 1 of b and 1 of c.   what if all the profitable projects are in b   then shares of b will be worth more than those of c.   but it should be the case that the value of your shares of b plus the value of your shares of c are equal to the original value of your shares of a.   completely fair   in fact if the split was economically justified then b + c > a.   and the gains are realized proportionally by all equityholders remember when a stock splits every share splits so that everyone owns both companies in the same proportion as everyone else   executives do n't determine what the prices of the resulting companies are that is determined by the market   a fair market will value the child companies such that together they are worth what the original was

at 22 years old you can afford to be invested 100 in the stock market like many others i recommend that you consider low cost index funds if those are available in your 401(k plan since your 401(k contributions are usually made with each paycheck this gives you the added benefit of dollar cost averaging throughout your career   there used to be a common rule that you should put 100 minus your age as the percentage invested in the stock market and the rest in bonds but with interest rates being so low bonds have underperformed so many experts now recommend 110 or even 120 minus your age for stocks percentage my recommendation is that you wait until you are 40 and then move 25 into bonds then increase it to 40 at 55 years old at 65 i would jump to a 50 50 stock bonds mix and when you start taking distributions i would move to a stable value income portfolio i also recommend that you roll your funds into a vanguard ira when you change jobs so that you take advantage of their low management fee index mutual funds that have no fees for trading   you can pick whatever mix feels best for you but at your age i would suggest a 50 50 mix between the s&p 500 large cap and the russell 2000 small cap those with quarterly rebalancing will put you a little ahead of the market with very little effort

you can execute block trades on the options market and get exercised for shares to create a very large position in energy transfer partners lp without moving the stock market you can then place limit sell orders after selling directly into the market and keep an of low priced shares the technical analysis traders wo n't know what you specifically are doing and will call this resistance if you hit nice even numbers multiples of 5 multiples of 10 with your sell orders you can exacerbate selling as many market participants will have their own stop loss orders at those numbers causing other people to sell at lower and lower prices automatically and simultaneously keep your massive ask in effect if your position is bigger than the demand then you can keep a stock lower the secondary market does n't inherently affect a company in any way but many companies have borrowed against the price of their shares and if you get the share price low enough they can get suddenly margin called and be unable to service their existing debt you will also lose a lot of money doing this so you can also buy puts along the way or attempt to execute a collar to lower your own losses the collar strategy is nice because it is unlikely that other traders and analysts will notice what you are doing since there are calls puts and share orders involved in creating it one person may notice the block trade for the calls initially but nobody will notice it is part of a larger strategy with multiple legs with the share position you may also be able to vote on some things but that solely depends on the conditions of the shares

it 's a trade off the answer depends on your risk tolerance seeking higher rewards demands higher risk if you want advice i would recommend hiring an expert to design a plan which meets your needs as a sample point not necessarily right for anyone else i'm considered an aggressive investor and my own spread is still more conservative than many folks i 'm entirely in low cost index funds distributed as with the money tied up in a defined contribution pension fund being treated as a low yield bond some of these have beaten the indexes they 're tracking some have n't my average yield since i started investing has been a bit over not including the company match on part of the 401k which i consider good enough certainly good enough for something that requires near zero attention from me past results are not a guarantee of future performance this may be completely wrong for someone at a different point in their career and/or life and/or finances i 'm posting it only as an example not a recommendation   regarding when to rebalance set some at which things have too far from your preferred distribution value of a fund being 5 off its target percentage in the mix is one rule i 've sometimes used and/or pick some reasonable usually fairly low frequency at which you 'll actively rebalance once a year 4x year whenever you change your car 's oil something like that and/or rebalance by selecting which funds you deposit additional money into whenever you 're adding to the investments note that that last option avoids having to take capital gains which is generally a good thing you want as much of your profit to be long term as possible and to avoid triggering the wash sales rule generally you do not have to rebalance very frequently unless you are doing something that i 'd consider unreasonably risky or unless you 're managing such huge sums that a tiny fraction of a percent still adds up to real money

ideally stock price reflects the value of the company the dividends it is expected to pay and what people expect the future value of the company to be only one of those maybe one and a half is related to current   sales and not always directly short term motion of a stock is even less directly linked since it also reflects previous expectations a company can announce disappointing sales and see its stock go up if the previous price was based on expecting   worse news

i doubt that this exists but it could theoretically after all a share is kind of an option to a company 's future success and so a call is already a second level on the better approach would be to create your own put puts by investing less money a in the put you wanted to invest into and put the smaller rest b in the share itself or a call that way if the original put is successful at max b is lost and if it is unsuccessful the loss on a is covered by a gain on b potentially if you do the math you can reach a mathematical equivalent situation to a put put by buying the right amount and kind of calls however we know already that buying a put and a call is a poor strategy so that would mean a put put would also be a poor strategy

your company wants to raise $ for a new project but costs are incurred by issuing securities underwriting legal fees etc first you must determine how much of the $ is going to be debt and equity the company 's target d e ratio is 50 or .50 for every $ 0.50 of debt raised they want to raise $ 1.00 in equity $ 1.00 + $ 0.50 = $ 1.50 $ = 1/3 debt that leaves the equity portion being 2/3 $ 1/3 = $ debt   and $ 2/3 = $ equity using the weighted average cost then you would do something like this = 1/3 + 2/3 = = $ = $

two different takes on an answer the net loss concept you mentioned and a core business concept if a store is actually a net loss and anybody is willing to buy it it may well make sense to sell it   depending on your capital value invested and how much it would take you to make it profitable it may be a sound business decision to sell the asset   the buyer of the asset is of course expecting for some reason to make it not a net loss for them perhaps they have other stores in the vicinity and can then share staff or stock somehow the core business is a concept   investors seem to go in cycles like can like well diversified companies that are resilient to a market downturn in one sector but then they also like so called pure play companies where you are clear on what you are owning   to try an example which is likely not the case here lets say that in 5 of its stores had migrated away from a gas station model to a one stop gas and repairs model therefore they had to have service parts and trained staff at those locations   these things are expensive and could be seen as not their area of expertise selling gas so as an investor if i want to own gas stations i do n't want to own a full service garage so perhaps i invest in somebody else once they sell off their non core assets they free up capital to do what they know best it is at least one possible explanation

trying to time the market is usually a bad idea people who do this every day for a living have a hard time doing that and i 'm guessing you do n't have that kind of time and knowledge   so that leaves you with your first and third options commonly called lump sum and dollar cost averaging respectively    which one to use depends on where your preferences lie on the risk reward dollar cost averaging dca has lower risk and lower reward than lump sum investing in my opinion i do n't like it dca only works better than lump sum investing if the price drops but if you think the price is going to drop why are you buying the stock in the first place example your uncle wins the lottery and gives you $ 50,000 do you buy $ 50,000 worth of apple now or do you buy $ 10,000 now and $ 10,000 a quarter for the next four quarters if the stock goes up you will make more with lump than you will with dca if the stock goes down you will lose more with ls than you will with dca if the stock goes up then down you will lose more with dca than you will with ls if the stock goes down then up you will make more with dca than you will with ls so it 's a trade off but like i said the whole point of you buying the stock is that you think it 's going to go up which is especially true with an index fund so why pick the strategy that performs worse in that scenario

great question   a yield curve is a plot of the yields for different maturities of debt this can be for any debt but the most common used when discussing yield curves is the debt of the federal government the yield curve is observed by its slope   a curve with a positive slope up and to the right or a curve i.e. one that 's becoming more positively sloped or less negatively sloped may indicate several different situations the kansas city federal reserve has a nice paper that summarizes various economic theories about the yield curve and even though it 's a bit dated the theories are still valid i 'll summarize the major points here a positively sloped yield curve can indicate expectations of inflation in the future the longer a security has before it matures the more opportunities it has to be affected by changes in inflation so if investors expect inflation to occur in the future they may demand higher yields on longer term securities to compensate them for the additional inflationary risk a yield curve may indicate that investors are increasing their expectations of future inflation a positively sloped yield curve may also reflect expectations of in the dollar the publication linked before states that depreciation of the dollar may have increased the perceived risk of future exchange rate changes and discouraged purchases of long term treasury securities by japanese and other foreign investors forcing the yields on these securities higher supply shocks e.g. decreases in oil prices that lead to decreased production may cause the yield curve to because they affect short term inflation expectations significantly more than long term inflation for example a decrease in oil prices may decrease short term inflation expectations so short term nominal interest rates decline investors usually assume that long term inflation is governed more by fundamental macroeconomic factors than short term factors like commodity price swings so this price shock may lead short term yields to decrease but leave long term relatively unaffected thus the yield curve even if inflation expectations remain unchanged the yield curve can still change the supply of and demand for money affects the required real rate i.e. the price of credit loans etc the supply comes from private savings money coming from abroad and growth in the money supply while demand comes from private investors and the government the paper summarizes the effects on real rates by saying lower private saving declines in the real money supply and reduced capital inflows decrease the supply of funds and raise the required real rate a larger government deficit and stronger private investment raise the required real rate by increasing the demand for funds the upward pressure on future real interest rates contributes to the yield curve 's positive slope and a yield curve could indicate an increasing government deficit declines in private savings or reduced capital coming in from abroad for example because of a recession in europe that reduces their demand for us imports an easing of monetary policy when is economy is already producing near its capacity would initially expand the real money supply lowering required short term real interest rates with long term real interest rates unchanged the yield curve would lower interest rates in turn would stimulate domestic spending putting upward pressure on prices this upward price pressure would probably increase expected inflation and as the first bullet point describes this can cause long term nominal interest rates to rise the combination of the decline in short term rates and the rise in long term rates the yield curve   similarly an inverted yield curve or a positively sloped yield curve that is becoming less steep may indicate the reverse of some or all of the above situations for example a rise in oil prices may increase expectations of short term inflation so investors demand higher interest rates on short term debt because long term inflation expectations are governed more by fundamental macroeconomic factors than short term swings in commodity prices long term expectations may not rise nearly as much as short term expectations which leads to a yield curve that is becoming less steep or even negatively sloped forecasting based on the curve slope is not an exact science just one of many indicators used   note yield curve was not yet defined here and was key to my answer for what is the bernanke twist and operation twist what exactly does it do so i took the liberty of ask answer

from the banks point of view the point of a current account like this is to get you as a regular customer they want to be your main bank the bank you interact with the most the bank you turn to first when you need financial products and services the bank whose advertising you see every time you log into online banking or walk into a branch the bank knows that if they just offer the high interest rate or other perks with no strings that people will open the account and dump a bunch of savings in it but wo n't actually move their financial life over their old bank will still be their main bank so they strings like a required minimum deposit a minimum number of direct debits and similar these have minimal effect on people actually using the account as their main current account while being a pain for people trying to game the system of course as you point out it is still possible to game the system but they do n't need to make gaming the system impossible they just need to make it enough that most people wo n't bother

i 've had a mf stock advisor for 7 or 8 years now and i 've belong to for a couple of years i also have money in one of their mutual funds the fool has a lot of very good educational information available especially for people who are new to investing many people do not understand that wall street is in the business of making money for wall street not making money for investors   i have stayed with the fool because their philosophy aligns with my personal investment philosophy i look at the stock advisor picks sometimes i buy them sometimes i do n't but the analysis is very good they also have been good at tracking their picks over time and writing updates when specific stocks drop a certain amount with their help i 've assembled a portfolio that i do n't have to spend too much time managing and have done pretty well from a return perspective stock advisor also has a good set of forums where you can interact with other investors   in summary the view from the inside has been pretty good from the outside i think their marketing is a reflection of the fact that most people are n't very interested in a rational conservative approach to investing in the stock market so mf chooses to go for an approach that gets more traffic i 'm not particularly excited about it but i 'm sure they 've done ab testing and have figured out what way works the best i think that they have had money back guarantees on some of their programs in the past so you could try them out risk free not sure if those are still around

a few questions   1 are there any low emission fuels or technologies that are even remotely viable for long haul air travel within the next decade or two asking people to travel less is silly and punishing companies for co2 emissions when there is no alternative is also silly so i hope these regulations are trying to encourage some sort of positive behaviour    2 is there any evidence that co2 credits or offsets are actually helpful is there any proof that it 's not just a money laundering scam

littleadv has given you excellent general advice but to my mind the most important part of it all and the path which i will strongly recommend you follow is the suggestion to look into a mutual fund i would add even more strongly   go to a mutual fund company directly     and make an investment with them directly instead of making the     investment through a brokerage account   pick an index fund with low expenses e.g. there are s&p 500 index funds available with   expenses that are a fraction of 1 however many also require minimum investments on the order of $ 2500 or $ 3000 except for ira accounts   at this time your goal should be to reduce expenses as much as possible because expenses whether they be in brokerage fees which may be directly visible to you or mutual fund expenses which are invisible to you are what will eat away at your return far more than the difference between the returns of various investments

somewhat   the balance sheet will include liabilities which as michael points out would tell you the totals for the debt which would often be loans or bonds depending on one 's preferred terminology   however if the company 's loan was shorter than the length of the quarter then it may not necessarily be reported is something to point out as the data is accurate for a specific point in time only my suggestion is that if you have a particular company that you want to review that you take a look at the sec filing in full which would have a better breakdown of everything in terms of assets liabilities etc than the a summary page   would be where you could find a link to the 10-q that has a better breakdown though it does appear that apple does n't have any bonds outstanding   there are some companies that may have little debt due to being so profitable in their areas of business

according the fscs if the bank fails fscs would refund the maximum under our rules currently £ 75,000 per person   any credit balance over and above this would be offset against the mortgage by the insolvency practitioner responsible for the winding up of the bank fscs would play no part in that process unless the savings were larger than the debts but then it would n't make sense to have them in a zero interest offset account so the money would not be completely lost as such whether that would count as an overpayment is an open question but perhaps a moot point anyway if the bank went under finally arguably a pension or other investment might also be better for such amounts

back when i was 25 and living near kansas city i would put 500 700 miles on my car almost every weekend traveling to other places like omaha st. louis iowa city occasionally minneapolis once to fargo and one longer trip all the way to virginia there 's a whole lot of nothing out there so road trips are quite naturally long they 're also quite attractive and i still would n't miss an opportunity to get up and drive somewhere for the weekend but i have spent less money on cars in my entire lifetime than you have on this single car i preferred then and still do to buy older cars for a few thousand dollars or even less and drive them until they die or can no longer pass inspection changing the oil is usually the most maintenance i 'll do since i 've spent so little on each car i do n't really care if it suffers some minor damage or even gets totaled in an accident which fortunately has never happened so i would only carry the mandatory liability insurance this is going to be much cheaper than the full coverage you will have on your car if something did happen i would just go buy another junker one such car i bought cost me a grand total of $ 150 excluding gas and gave me almost 10,000 miles until its transmission fell out another that i paid $ 100 for had difficulty getting over 60 miles an hour but it did those trips almost every weekend for two years before the engine threw a rod this might not be something you want to do perhaps you do n't want to be seen driving what one of my called a mobile because people will you but consider that billionaire sam walton of wal mart could afford any vehicle he wanted but drove an old pickup truck i present it as an option because it works for me and might work for you and my ex liked my old cars especially the 1983 station wagon with enough space in the back for a full size bed thus you have one possible way to cut your expenses significantly the only thing left to deal with is parking and its attendant security issues my have never been stolen broken into or even looked at funny though i have never left anything visible in them but the occasional bit of trash thieves do n't seem to expect an old beater to contain valuables or even be and a chop shop certainly would n't want one and as i noted in a comment earlier it 's possible to find cheaper monthly parking in nyc if you search carefully the $ example in the being just the first one i found after 25 seconds on google i am pretty sure that if you do some more extensive research you can find cheaper parking that is reasonably secure and at least relatively convenient to your most common travel plans

there are those who are knowledgable in real estate who offer rules of thumb do n't pay more that 50x the rent for the house here $ 972 x 50 is $ assume half the rent goes to expenses so from $ 972 you net $ and after that mortgage you have $ 111 in profit zillow usually assumes 20 down here $ 20k. so you are seeing a return on your 20k. plus appreciation and principal paydown   for the record i just bought a 3 family under renovation now expecting total cost to be $ 160 k and total rent $ 2500 i missed ratio a by a bit but $ 1250 to go toward a $ 120 k mortgage works out fine $ 550 profit mo on the 25 down $ 40 k by the way a turnover of tenants can cost a a month of no rent b a cost to the real estate agent if you use one and the cost to paint repair this is generally considered 10 so if the 50 of rent seemed high here 's 10 of it

there is a large market where notes bills bonds are traded so yes you can sell them later   however if interest rates go up the value of any bond that you want to sell goes down because you now have to compete with what someone can get on a new issue so you need to discount the principal value of your bond in order for someone to want to buy it instead of a new bond that has a higher interest rate the reverse applies if interest rates fall although it 's hard to get much lower than they are now   so someone wanting to make money in bonds due to interest rate changes generally wants to buy at higher interest rates and then sell their bonds after rates have gone down   see my answer in this question for more detail why does interest rate go up when bond price goes down to answer is that good the answer depends on perspective

you say you are underwater by $   does that include the 6 comission that selling will cost you   if you are underwater and have to sell anyway why would you want to give the bank any extra money   a loss will be taken on the sale   personally i would want the bank to take as much of that loss as possible rather than myself   depending on the locale the mortgage may or may not be non recourse ie the loan contract implies that the bank can take the house from you if you default but if non recourse the bank has no legal way to demand more money from you getting the bank to cooperate on a short sale might be massively painful   if you have $ in your savings you might have more leverage to with the bank on how much money you have to give them in the event the loan is not non recourse   note that even if not non recourse it 's not clear it would be worth the banks time and money to pursue any shortfall after a sale or if you just walk away and mail the keys to the bank if you 're not worried about your credit the most financially beneficial action for you might be to simply stop paying the mortgage at all and bank the whole payments   it will take the bank some time to get you out of the house and you can live cost free during that time you may feel a moral obligation to the bank   i would not feel this way   the banks and bankers took a ton of money out of selling mortgages to buyers and then selling securities based on the mortgages to investors   they looted the whole system and pushed prices up greatly in the process which burned most home buyers and home owners   it 's all about business advice is to act like a business does and minimize your costs   the bank should have required a big enough downpayment to cover their risk   if they did not then they are to blame for any loss they incur   this is the most basic rule of finance

no this logic is dangerous   the apples to apples comparison between renting and buying should be between similar living arrangements one ca n't legitimately compare living in a 600 sq ft studio to a 3500 sq ft house   with the proposal you offer one should get the largest mortgage they qualify for but that can result in a house far too big for their needs borrowing to buy just what you need makes sense borrowing to buy a house with rooms you may never visit not a great idea   by the way do the numbers the 30 year rate is 4 you 'd need a $ 250,000 mortgage to get $ 10,000 in interest the first year that 's a $ house given an 80 loan on a median income do you think it makes sense to buy a house twice the us median   last a portion of the tax savings is lost to the fact that you have a standard deduction of nearly $ 6,000 in 2012 so that huge mortgage gets you an extra $ 4000 in write off and $ 600 back in taxes   do n't ever let the tax tail wag the investing dog or in this case the house dog   edit the investment return on real estate is a hot topic i think it 's fair to say that long term one must include the rental value of the house in calculating returns in the case of buying of way too big house you are not getting the return it 's the same as renting a four bedroom but leaving three empty   if i can go on a bit i own a rental it 's worth $ 200 k and after condo fee and property tax i get $ 10k yr a 5 return plus whatever appreciation now if i lived there i 'd correctly claim that part of my return is the rental value the rent i do n't pay elsewhere so the return to me is the potential growth as well as saved rent but if the condo rents for $ 1200 and i 'd otherwise live in a $ 600 apartment with less space the return to me is lost in my personal case in fact i bought a too big house not too big for our paycheck the cost and therefore the mortgage were well below what the bank qualified us for too big for the need i paid for two rooms we really do n't use

the general answer to this is yes   when you 're dealing with single digit millionaires the answer is that their insurance habits and needs are basically the same as everyone else   when you get into the double digit and triple digit millionaires or people worth billions they have additional options but those basically boil down to using self insurance rather than paying a company for an insurance policy   the following is based on both what i 've read and a fair deal of personal experience working for or with various stripes of millionaire and even one billionaire addressing the types of insurance you mention this is generally used to provide survivors with a replacement for income you can no longer provide when dead in addition to paying for costs associated with dying funeral hospital bills etc   even millionaires and billionaires have this yes but the higher your net worth the less value it has   if you 're worth 9 or 10 figures you probably already have trust funds set up for your family members so an extra payout from an insurance policy is probably going to represent a small fraction of the wealth you 're leaving your survivors and as has been noted insurance makes a profit so the expectation by the insurance company is that they 'll make more money on the policy than they 'll have to pay out on death   that being said the members of the 9 + figure club i 've worked for all had multi million dollar life insurance policies on them which were paid for or heavily subsidized by the companies they owned or worked for   i doubt they would have held those policies if they had to pay the full cost but when it 's free or cheap why not absolutely   as health insurance in america is an untaxed employment benefit owing to regulations from world war ii all the wealthy folks i 've had contact with got outrageously good plans as part of the companies they work for or owned   having said that even their trust fund beneficiaries held health insurance because this type of insurance in america at least is actually not really insurance it 's more of a pre payment plan for medical expenses and as such it provides broader access to health care than you 'd get from simply having enough money to pay for whatever treatments you need   if you walk into a hospital as a millionaire and state that you 'll definitely be able to pay for your open heart surgery with cash you 'll get a very different response than if you walk in with your insurance card and your diamond level coverage   so in this case it 's not as much as about the monetary benefits although this is a type of insurance that 's generally free or heavily discounted to the individual so that 's a factor as it is about easier access to health care although this is required by law it 's one of the common forms of insurance that the very wealthy can and often do handle differently than the rest of us   most if not all us states have a provision to allow to self insure themselves which amount to putting up a bond to cover claims against them   basically you deposit the minimum amount the state determines is required for auto insurance with the responsible state organization get a certificate of self insurance and you 're good to go   all the high wealth individuals i know when this route for two reasons first of all they did n't have to deal with insurance companies or pay sky high rates on account of all the speeding tickets they picked up and secondly they made their deposit with government bonds they had in their portfolios anyway and they could still collect the interest on their self insurance deposits   of course this meant that if they wrecked or dinged up their or or whatever they 'd be out of pocket to repair or replace it but i guess if you can afford one $ 200,000 car you can afford to buy a second one if you wreck it or get by riding one of your other luxury automobiles instead since someone else mentioned insurance i 'll point out here that what robert did in casino when he put a couple million dollars into a safety deposit box for his wife to use if he was kidnapped or needed to pay off a government official is essentially the same thing as self insurance   putting money away somewhere for unexpected events in lieu of buying an insurance policy against them in real life the very wealthy will often do this with us treasuries government bonds and other interest bearing safe investments they make a little money diversify their portfolios and at the same time self insure against a potential big loss this is another insurance area where even the very wealthy are remarkably similar to the rest of us in that they all generally have it yes although the reason is a little different   for normal folks the home they own is generally the largest part of their net worth or at least a very substantial fraction for those older folks with retirement savings that exceed the value of their homes   so for us we have home owners insurance to prevent a catastrophic event from wiping out the lion 's share of our net worth if you 're an ultra wealthy individual who can afford an 8 figure home that 's not really the case at least with the ones i 've dealt with who made their fortunes in business and are good managing their wealth and diversifying their assets could be different for sports stars or the entertainment industry and these people generally own multiple homes anyway so it 's not as big a deal if they lose one however no one actually buys a multi million dollar home by writing a multi million dollar check   they get a mortgage just like the rest of us   and to get a mortgage insurance on the property is a requirement   so yes even the ultra wealthy generally have insurance on their   there is an element of not wanting to shell out another 20 million if the place burns down or someone breaks in and steals your valuables but the bigger part of the reason is that it 's required to get a mortgage in the first place which is generally done for financial reasons interest on your mortgage is a tax deduction and you do n't want to sink millions of dollars all at once into buying a property that 's not going to appreciate in value when you can get a mortgage and invest those millions of dollars to make more money instead

when you add points a break even date comes into play that date varies depending on the rate and number of points as an approximate example having one point at those rates would have a break even point of about 5 years at that time the amount you save with the lower rate makes up for the extra cash you paid for points after that you are saving money if you do n't plan on having the loan that long the points are not worth it also you need to calculate the break even date based on your own parameters i suggest searching for an online calculator or spreadsheet that supports point calculations you may also be able to deduct of your points every year ask you accountant about that

the number one difference is that bank savings accounts or money market accounts allow limited checking six non atm withdrawals per month max else possible fees have fdic insurance up to $ 250,000   however do n't put that much in allow some room for interest so you never go over the $ 250,000   money market mutual funds do not enjoy fdic insurance   there may be some insurance generally against brokerage failure though but its coverage is questionable search out those details and if they apply to anything besides actual cash held at the brokerage   if the money market mutual fund is strictly invested in us treasury securities like t bills or other short term us treasury instruments it enjoys the full faith and credit of the us government fwiw but many invest in corporate instruments   if the fund has any pricing issues there might be a delay in getting paid off   extremely unlikely       number two and more importantly bank savings accounts or pay way more   you can get a bit over 1 apy now many paying 0.90 apy or higher   no money market mutual funds are close to that generally yielding a small fraction of that almost zero for us treasury mmm funds   sure 1.05 ai n't too exciting but you may as well get the most you can if holding cash and fully insured to boot

banks consider investment mortgages and any mortgage where you do n't live in the property as a riskier investment than an owner occupied home collateral mortgage the sources of increased risk range from concerns that you will screw up as a landlord your tenants will destroy the place you wo n't have tenants and ca n't afford to pay the bank and/or you 'll take out several other investment mortgages and over extend yourself all of these risks are compounded by the fact that it is harder for the bank to convince you to pay when they ca n't put you out on the street if you default banks lend and invest in money not real estate so they would much rather have a paying loan than a foreclosed house especially with the modern foreclosure glut the increased risk means the bank will charge higher interest for the loan may require a higher downpayment and will require higher lending standards before issuing the loan a new housing investor can get around these higher prices by living in the home for a few years before renting it out though your lender could possibly require you to renegotiate the loan if you move out too soon

if you do n't have a good knowledge of finance maybe you should not put too much money in individual stocks but if you really want to invest you can just compare the rate of return of the most known stocks available to you like the one from the s&p for the us the rate of return is very simple to compute it 's share price for example a company with a current share price of usd that delivered a dividend of usd last year would have a rate of return of 100 now if you only invest in the most known stocks since they are already covered by nearly all financial institutions and analysts if you are looking for lower risk dividend companies take a sample of companies and invest those with the lowest rates of return but avoid extreme values of course since the stock prices are changing all the time you have to compare them with a price taken at the same time like the closing price of a specific day and for the dividend they can be on several basis yearly etc so you have to be sure to take the same basis you can also find the p e ratio which is the opposite indicator (= share price dividend so an higher p e ratio means a lower risk most of the time you can find the p e ratio or the rate of return already computed on specialized website or brokers

as an addition to chris rea 's excellent answer these tender offers are sometimes made specifically to cast doubt on the current market price for instance a large public company that contracts with a smaller supplier or service company also public might make a tender offer below market price the market will look at this price and the business relationship and wonder what the larger company knows about the smaller one that they do n't now what happens when investors lose confidence in a stock they sell it supply goes up demand goes down and the price drops the company making the tender offer can then get its shares either way directly via the offer or on the open market this is however usually not successful beyond the very short term and typically only works because the company making a tender offer is the gorilla which can dictate its own terms with practically anyone else it meets such offers are also very closely watched by the sec if there 's any hint that the larger company is acting in a predatory manner or that its management is using the power and information of the company to profit themselves the strategy will backfire as the larger company finds itself the target of sec and doj legal proceedings

if you 're willing to do a little more work and bookkeeping than just putting money into the 401(k i would recommend the following i note that you said you chose some funds based on performance since the expense ratios are all high i would recommend against chasing performance because active funds will almost always falter honor the old saw   past performance is no guarantee of future returns assuming the cash in your ally account is an emergency fund i would use it to pay off your credit card debt to avoid the interest payments use free cash flow in the coming months to bring the emergency fund balance back up to an acceptable level if the ally account is not an emergency fund i would make it one with no debt and an emergency fund for 3 12 months of living expenses pick your risk tolerance then you can concentrate on investing your 401(k options are unfortunately pretty poor with those choices i would invest this way once you fill up your choice of ira then you have the tougher decision of where to put any extra money you have to invest if any a brokerage account gives you the freedom of investment choices and the ability to easily pull out money in the case of a dire emergency the 401(k will give you tax benefits but high fund expenses the tax benefits are considerable so if i were at a job where i plan on moving on in a few years i 'd fund the 401(k up to the max with the knowledge that i 'd roll the 401(k into a rollover ira in the relatively short term if i saw myself staying at the employer for a long time 5 + years i 'd probably take the taxable account route since those high fund fees will add up over time one you start building up a solid base then i might look into having a small allocation in one of my accounts for play money to pick individual stocks or start making sector bets

truthfully i do n't know but in actuality a 4 5 billion dollar loss even is n't the big deal it 's more important that they lost almost of market cap   now realistically it 's relatively oversold in my opinion and they will make it back eventually but that has more of an impact on them in the here and now   as far as the offset you are asking about i 'm not sure personally i do n't trust any accounting practices of banks in reality it 's entirely possible that not even the c suite understands their exact financial position at any given time   the reports of this loss actually came out about a month before they were even able to make an educated guess as to how much their losses would be     in any case there are much more qualified knowledgeable people on here that could likely answer your question a bit better

i disagree if nobody got their health insurance through their employer then everyone would go out on the market and acquire them this would create a more dynamic health insurance market which would over time drive down the cost of getting health insurance    i do n't follow your logic about how wages would n't keep up 10 or 20 years down the road if anything not having to worry about benefits in a particular job would give employees more job mobility causing the job market to be more competitive in other words it would be more likely to cause wages to up   also ancillary benefits of getting employers out of the health insurance benefit dynamic would be to create more efficiencies within those businesses reduce staff spent on coordinating plans and such make small businesses more competitive they are at a disadvantage now with regard to big companies with pools of employees and get more people to acquire at least some form of insurance health coverage goes up   i for one welcome a world in which our employers have absolutely nothing to do with our benefits choices and we choose them at our own discretion just as i do with my car insurance

note that to keep an investor from lowering their tax bill is not an explanation well yes it is in fact   it is the only explanation the rule plainly exists to prevent someone from realizing a loss when their economic situation remains unchanged before after a sale now you might say but i have suffered a loss even if it is unrealized but would you want to pay tax on unrealized gains the tax system still caters to reducing the tax impact of investments particularly capital investments part and parcel with the system of taxing gains only when realized is that you can recognize losses only when realized are there other ways to artificially reduce taxable income yes but the goal of a good tax system should be to reduce those opportunities whether you agree that it is fair for the government to prevent this tax saving opportunity when others exist is another question but that is why the rule exists

it might some but i 'd wager it pushes the short term rental pricing down like hotels while pushing the long term rental and housing market prices up     if landlords can make way more in short term rentals they are going to do that and limit the supply of long term   the tourism sector may have increased revenue but by what extent i do n't know   i 'd wager that exploding rent and housing prices will negate any benefits for most residents and may end up costing them much more   this is why i think you should only be able to do it on your primary residence   unless you want to be regulated like a hotel because if you have short term rentals that you do n't reside in that is effectively what you are   not being regulated the same as a hotel at that point only gives you an unfair loophole advantage to other short term rentals

exactly that is paying double the money for no better coverage it makes no sense the paperwork when you file a claim will ask you if there is coverage from another policy making the same claim to two different policies without telling them   would be considered insurance fraud for that kind of money the insurance company would be involved with paying the re builder money periodically obviously only one re builder is involved and they would notice if they were getting paid more than was required while you could decide to take the money and not rebuild but that would n't work if you had a mortgage the lender would want their money or force you to rebuild
