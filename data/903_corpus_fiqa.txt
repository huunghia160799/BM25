nope not deductible it 's true that some investment expenses are deductible mainly as miscellaneous itemized expenses though only the amount that exceeds 2 of your adjusted gross income   but as explained in irs pub 550 which lays out the relevant rules stockholders meetings    you can not deduct transportation and other expenses you pay to attend stockholders meetings of companies in which you have no interest other than owning stock this is true even if your purpose in attending is to get information that would be useful in making further investments

the liquidity of options is really not a problem as the option price is determined by the underlying price and even if there was very little liquidity in the option itself market makers are required to make a market at the price determined by the underlying as long as the underlying has enough liquidity your slippage in trading the options should not be too much of a problem you can read this market making scheme document for more details

title is incorrect $ 1000 every ten years or $ 100 per year    the author puts the calculations in the article and while i think the methodology is dubious it is at least transparent the $ 1000 was the cost over the next decade applied to the number of workers which means the annual cost is one tenth of that or $ 100   edit i said number of households and i should ’ve said number of workers

mission is easily the toughest item on this list to get right and not look like a corporate douchebag especially since office space listening to eight different bosses drone on about mission statements 13 years ago and it really stuck   it seems mission and strategy are somewhat interchangeable and strategy is n't as tainted with either way to me the important point here is clarity of overall vision for the company from the top and communicating that strategy all the way down the chain other points like 1 target 5 expectations and 8 future fall out of that if it 's done right   and plastering some branded version of that strategy on a bunch of trinkets is definitely not right

the new mortgage qualification rules were introduced to cool a hot canadian housing real estate market the rules are a pre measure intended to avoid a bubble and later crash in real estate the government wants to make sure anybody buying a house can handle higher interest rates those rates currently at record lows are expected to go up later this year and into the future the tighter mortgage rules include borrowers will need to qualify against a minimum standard 5-year fixed rate mortgage even if they 'll contract their mortgage at a lower or variable rate   previously the 3-year fixed rate mortgage was used as the minimum qualification standard the amount a homeowner can borrow in a refinanced mortgage drops to 90 of the home value down from 95 of the home value   a home is not meant to be an atm machine anybody wanting to borrow to buy an investment property i.e. a property that wo n't be their principal residence will need a 20 downpayment instead of a 5 downpayment the new rules go into effect april 19th 2010   however according to the see below exceptions would be allowed after    april 19 where they are needed to    satisfy a binding purchase and sale    financing or refinancing agreement    entered into before april 19 2010 definitive information about the new rules can be found at the department of finance of canada   specifically refer to some additional news media sources

the bank will make this even more confusing because they use the terms from their own perspective from the bank 's perspective   printed on your statements credit money into your account   increases the bank 's liabilities debit money out of your account   decrease bank liabilities from your perspective it depends on the nature of the transfer of money but here are the most common for a personal account income into your account credit expenses out of your account debit payment on a loan made for an asset house car credit for the loan account debit for the equity account for the car house etc yes it 's complicated neither credits nor debits are always a + or that 's why i agree with the advice of the others here that double entry accounting is overkill for your personal finances note i simplified the above examples for the purpose of clarity technically every transaction in double entry accounting includes both a credit and a debit hence the double in the name in fact sometimes a transaction involves more than one credit or debit but always at least one of each also this is for each party so any transaction between you and your bank involves at least four debits and/or credits when all involved are considered

generally speaking if the acquiring company buys less than 50 of the target the acquirer would not claim any income until there was a dividend or the equity stock appreciated with a dividend the company would participate in and book earnings on the cash received without a dividend equity stock of the target should theoretically rise to reflect higher retained income and the acquirer would book an unrealized gain to gross profit i think if the acquiring company buys more than 50 of the target it is likely all revenues and would be consolidated and included in the acquiring company 's respective accounts as if it was one whole any residual stake in the target owned by a third party would be reflected in a minority interest expense on the acquiring company 's income statement

what you propose is to convert unsecured debt into secured debt conversion of unsecured debt into secured debt is not generally a good idea several reasons   the debt you currently owe does not have assets securing the debt so the creditor knows they are exposed to risk and may be more willing to negotiate or relax terms on the debt should you encounter problems   when you provide an asset to secure debt you lose freedom to sell that asset   when you incur debt their is usually a spending problem that needs to be corrected which is typically not fixed when a refinance solution is used   you do not mention interest rate which would be one benefit to conversion of unsecured to secured debt so you probably are not gaining adequate benefit from the conversion strategy this strategy is often using cash out refinancing to borrow against a home you already own and the claimed benefit is often to lower the interest rate on the debt   your scenario is more complicated in that you have not purchased the home yet   though it may be a good idea to purchase a home that choice depends on a different set of considerations children job stability rental vs. buy costs lifestyle expected appreciation etc from how to best handle a large debt income vs. expenses how to increase income or reduce expenses lifestyle priorities etc another consideration is that you already have a problem with the large debt owed to one set of and you have a plan which would shift the risk exposure to another set of who may have been less complicit in accruing the original debt   was the debt incurred jointly during the marriage and something you accepted responsibility to repay you mention that you make great income and you specify one expense rent but you neither provided the amount of income total of all your expenses nor your free cash flow amount nor any indication of percentages spent on rent essential expenses lifestyle nor amount available to retire debt   since you did not provide specifics we can take a look at three scenarios scenario 1 $ income scenario 1 $ income scenario 1 $ income depending upon your income and choices you might have < $ 500/month to pay towards debt or as much as $ to pay towards debt and depending upon interest rate which op did not provide this debt could take < 2 years to pay or > 5 years to pay have you accepted the responsibility for the debt   it will be a tough task to repay the debt   and you will learn that debt comes with a cost as you repay it   one problem people often encounter when they refinance debt is they have not changed the habits which produced the debt   so they often continue their spending habits and incur new unsecured debt landing them back in the same problem position but with the increased secured debt combined with additional new unsecured debt   challenge yourself to repay a specific portion of the debt in a specific time and consider ways to reduce your expenses and/or increase your income to provide more money to repay the debt quicker as you also did not disclose your assets it is hard to know whether you could repay a portion of the debt from assets you already own   it makes sense to sell assets that have a low or zero return to repay debt that has a high interest rate   perhaps you have substantial assets that you are reluctant to sell but that you could sell to repay a large part of the debt

let me make sure i understand the point of what adam smith is going on about in discussion of relative poverty he relates the idea that an individual can be considered in poverty if they do not meet the customary amount of goods considered by their society to be the minimum to be polite in public you have thus transferred his meaning of what poor means to be what is considered   basic living you have then taken this concept and tied the cost of basic living which you still have n't actually narrowed down towards the tax rate on income for a citizen of a community this is all in the context that you 're concerned with the community level of price for basic living and whether its too high however you also have n't said what too high is nor why you 're concerned with the literal price which is why i 've said you can only control the price of a good through central authority   i never made the assertion you wanted to invoke a centrally planned economy i simply stated that the only way to control prices across a community is through central authority you 've stated that we collect taxes on local state and federal levels this is true however it does not mean that they control the price they simply modify the price set by the market and only serve to increase the price from the base set by market participants    when i want to buy beer i do n't just pay for the cost of the beer i pay the cost of the beer + the city tax + county tax + state tax + state sales tax on the beer which raises the price also these taxes are not income taxes which is what was being discussed    i still do n't know what your point is because you can not seem to define phrases you 've used that i have stated i do not know if you can not define what you 're talking about how it relates to the actual discussion and why its relevant then please stop as its simply a

since your youtube income is considered self employment income and because you probably already made more than $ 400 in net income after deducting expenses from the $ 4000 you 've received so far you will have to pay self employment tax and file a return   this is according to the irs 's publication 17 2016 your federal income tax so assumes the same rules for 2016 will remain in effect for 2017 you are self employed if you carry on a trade or business as a sole proprietor are an independent contractor are a member of a partnership or are in business for yourself in any other way self employment can include work in addition to your regular full time business activities such as certain part time work you do at home or in addition to your regular job you must file a return if your gross income is at least as much as the filing requirement amount for your filing status and age shown in table 1 1 also you must file form 1040 and schedule se form 1040 self employment tax if your net earnings from self employment excluding church employee income were $ 400 or more or you had church employee income of $ or more see table 1 3 use schedule se form 1040 to figure your self employment tax self employment tax is comparable to the social security and medicare tax withheld from an employee 's wages for more information about this tax see pub 334 tax guide for small business i 'd also note that your predicted income is getting close to the level where you would need to pay estimated taxes which for self employed people work like the withholding taxes employers remove their employees paychecks and pay to the government if you end up owing more than $ 1000 when you file your return you could be assessed penalties for not paying the estimated taxes there is a grace period if you had to pay no taxes in the previous year 2016 in this case that could let you escape those penalties

the advice i have is short and sweet be an investor not a speculator adopt the philosophy of warren buffet which is the buy and hold philosophy avoid individual stocks and buy mutual funds or etfs pick something that pays dividends and reinvest those dividends do n't become a speculator meaning avoid the buy low sell high philosophy   edit for some reason i can not add a comment so i am putting my response here   the buy low sell high approach makes money for the stock broker not necessarily you as we learn in the movie trading places each buy or sell creates a commission for the broker it is those commission expenses that eat away at your just do n't sell if a security is trading at $ 10 a share and pays $ 0.25 a share each quarter then you are getting 10 roi if you buy that security and if it continues to pay $ 0.25 a share each quarter if the price goes up then the roi for new buyers will go down but your roi will still be the same you will continue to get 10 for as long as you hold that security a mutual fund buys the individual stocks for you the value of the fund is only calculated at the end of the day an etf is like a mutual fund but the value of the etf is calculated moment by moment

frequently selling and buying properties is generally not advisable in germany due to the high cost for property purchase tax and land registration fees you can generally assume that ever time you trade homes you pay about 10 extra so it is likely a good idea to keep your property and rent it out while you do n't need it so you can use the rent to pay for your new room that 's especially true if you expect the property to increase in value also due to the low interest rate right now real estate is practically the only good capital investment a 85k asset which makes you each year is a return of investment of any financial asset promising you that kind of dividend at the moment is likely equivalent to gambling yes i ignored maintenance costs but it 's still a really good deal if you want to rent out your flat as stress free as possible give it to a property management company in exchange for a percentage of the monthly rent they will take care of all the small stuff like hiring to fix broken toilets you might still have to pay for really expensive investments though like replacing a leaking roof but when something like that happens you should have no issue to finance it with a loan because you have a real estate as a security   however keep in mind that the german tenancy law might make it difficult but not impossible to get rid of the tenant in case you want to move back into the apartment google for more details should you decide after your study that you do n't want to move back you can always sell the flat with the tenant but rented properties usually get far lower prices on the real estate market than empty ones regarding covering your cost of living besides rent during your studies if you are eligible for state sponsored student loan you should take it because it 's an offer simply too good to refuse it 's literally free money but unfortunately you are not because you own too much real estate wealth you are not living in but you should ask your bank for a loan backed by said property that way you will likely pay far less interest than with a regular private student loan which is n't backed by anything except the hope for a relevant degree

most of the time your tax only reduces by the current marginal rate meaning you would only reduce your tax by 28 to 25 depending on which part of the bracket you 're in however in the area around 100k there are cases where reductions will have more of a marginal effect than that   you 'll never reduce it more than 100 but you can reduce it by 35 40 despite being in the 25 bracket that is because of certain deductions and credits which phase out beginning around things like the ira deduction the child tax credit childcare tax credit and similar   since many of them phase out in this range additional dollars cost you your marginal rate 25 plus the percentage of the credits or deductions which phase out here which might bring you up another 10 or so

if you are looking for a simple formula or buying order strategy to guarantee a lower buying price unfortunately this does not exist   otherwise all investors would employ this strategy and the financial markets would no longer have an validity aka arbitrage   buying any investment contains a certain level of risk other than us treasuries of course having said that there are many option buying strategies that can employed to help increase your ror or hedge an existing position   most of these strategies are based a predicted future direction of a stock on the investor 's part   for example you hold the ford stock and feel they are releasing their earnings report next week   you feel that they will not meet investors expectations   you do n't want to sell your shares but what you can do is buy put options   if the stock does indeed go down then you make money on your put options here is a document on options   it is moderately technical but very good if you want a good introduction on the subject   the strategy that i described above is on pg 33

quickly check the escrow balance with the new lender what was supposed to happen is that the old lender would send the money they were holding in escrow to the new lender with information regarding how it was calculated and what you should be charged each month the new lender would continue servicing the escrow at the same monthly rate until they did a yearly or semi annually re analysis of the escrow account this is how all the mortgage transfers that i have had happened as long as it was n't due to a refinancing of the loan if it was a refinancing the escrow transfer was done at closing he said that they close the escrow account and refunded it and they    start a new escrow with the new lender the new company would not want to have the money sent to you because they would now have to require you to send the money on to them there could be a gap of several weeks they would have to pay any bills that come due during that gap without the cash in the escrow account if the escrow account is either zero or very low expect that the new company will be sending you a notice the old lender could have convinced the new lender to refund the money back to them or the old lender never transferred the funds if a notice comes from the new lender failure to replace the money will put your loan into default if the sum of money is large they may have to increase the monthly escrow amount to make it up in 6 to 12 months after that period the monthly escrow will return to a more reasonable level if the old lender comes after you expect that the request wo n't be over the phone   one thing the old lender could do is to request the loan be transferred back to them the funds would then flow back to their company but your escrow balance would now be zero and they would now up your monthly escrow amount to get back on track

hope springs eternal in the human breast no actively managed fund has beaten the indices over a long period of time but over shorter periods actively managed funds have beaten the indices quite often sometimes quite spectacularly and sometimes even for many years in a row examples from the past include fidelity and mason value trust so people buy actively managed funds hoping to cash in on such   good performance the difficulty is of course that many people do n't even think about investing in a fund until it is listed in some top forty funds of last year compilation and for many funds they have already peaked and new buyers are often disappointed   some   people who invested earlier plan on getting out of the fund before   the fund falls flat on its face and fewer even succeed in doing so as to why 401k plans often have high cost actively managed funds there are several reasons a most important one is that there are numerous companies that act as administrators of 401k programs and these companies put together package deals of 401k programs funds administrative costs etc and small employers have to choose from one of these packages   second there are various rules that have come into existence since the first days of 401k and 403b programs such as the investment choices must include funds of different types and actively managed funds large cap small cap etc are one of the choices that must be offered gone are the days when the only choice was a variable annuity offered by the insurance company administering the 401k program finally program participants also have hopes cf opening sentence and used to demand that the 401k program offer a few actively managed funds not just index funds

you have already indicted in another question titled which risk did i take winning this much that you did not understand 1 why a previous trade made you as much money as it did nor 2 how much you could have lost if things went a different way you were in that other question talking about taking short position without understanding apparently that a short position can create losses exceeding the value of your initial investment can one make money doing day trading yes an educated investor may be able to prudently invest in short term positions making knowledgeable judgments about risk and still make money can you make money doing day trading well maybe you have in the past in what you described in a previous post as winning so even in your own eyes you were effectively gambling and got lucky perhaps the more relevant questions you can ask yourself are can you lose money doing day trading and most importantly are you more likely to lose money day trading or consistently make money by taking on reasonable and educated risks

so this has been bugging me for a while because i am facing a similar dilemma and i do n't think anyone gave a clear answer i bought a 2012 kia soul in 2012 36 months financing at 300/mo will be done with my car loan in 2015 i plan on keeping it while saving the same amount of money 300/mo until i buy my next car but i also have an option of trading it in for the the next car question should i trade it in in 2015 should i keep it for 2 years more 3 years more before i buy the next car what makes most financial sense and savings i tried to dig up some data on edmunds the trade in value and true cost to own calculator the make and model of my car started in 2010 so i do not have historical data as well as cost to own calculator only spans 5 years so this is what i came up with   where numbers in blue are totally made up because i do n't have the data for it granted the trade in values for the future years are based on kia soul 's trade in values from previous years 2010 2011 2012 but this is handy and as it gets closer to 2015 and beyond i can re plug in the data where it is available and have a better understanding of the trade in vs keep it longer decision hope this helps if the analysis is totally off the please let me know i 'll adjust it delete it thank you

does that justify the purpose that is for individual banks to decide no bank would pay for daily expenditure if you are saying primary salary you are spending on so your declaration is right you are looking at funding your via loan and you are earning enough for living and paying of the loan i noticed that a lot of lenders do not lend to applicants whose purpose is to finance the tuition for post secondary education this could be because the lenders have seen larger percentage defaults when people opt for such loans it could be due to mix of factors like the the drag this would cause to an individual who may not benefit enough in terms of higher salary to repay the loan or moves out of country getting a better job if it is education loan have you looked at getting scholarships or student loans

it 's a real pain in the rear to get cash only from a bank teller the end result of cutting the card as suggested there is a self control issue here that like weight loss should ultimately be addressed for a psychologically healthy lifestyle you do n't mention a budget here a budget is one of the first tools necessary for setting spending limits categorizing your money into categories such as   will force you to look at any purchase in context of your other needs and goals note that savings is at the top of the list supporting the to pay yourself first make realistic allowances for each budget category then force yourself to stick to this budget by whatever means necessary cash in several envelopes labeled with each category can physically reinforce your priorities the debit card is usually left at home for now   roll remaining funds from each month over into the next month to cover irregular larger expenses such as auto repairs   what sort of investing are we talking about if you are just talking about retirement savings an automatic deduction of just $ 50 to a roth ira account at a discount brokerage every pay check is a good start an emergency fund of 6 months expenses is also common financial advice and can likewise be built from small automatic deductions in defense of wise use of plastic a debit card can be a great retroactive budgeting tool because it records all spending for you it takes a lot more effort to save and enter receipts for cash and a compulsive spender without a budget is just as likely to run out of money whether or not he uses plastic you could keep receipts in the envelope you take the cash out of when you 're getting started if you are so addicted to spending that you must cut your debit card to enforce your budget at least consider this a temporary measure to get yourself under control when the bank issues you a new card re evaluate this decision and the self control measures you 've implemented to see if you 've grown enough to keep the card

i have a hard time giving them a p e higher than 25 on the absolute top end given current numbers that takes another ~60 off their share price putting them right around $ 10 now that 's my top end estimate i 'd probably be willing to buy right around $ 8   in order to support the ipo price the models i 've seen come in at projecting an average growth rate of 40 yoy for the next 5 years if fb pulled that off they 'd be growing over the next 5 years once compounded as it stands they 've got users doubling that would require a significant number of new people to start coming on line 5x that would be impossible   so next option they figure out how to monetize existing users traffic better it 's possible they do n't do a very good job with this as it stands but they 've got a fine line to walk they need to pull it off without driving users or advertisers away   suppose they were able to double their user base they 'd still need to do better per user to make the numbers this does n't take into account that the next billion users are significantly less valuable as an audience than the first billion not in human terms but in financial marketing terms   i 'm willing to give them a 20 growth rate for the next 5 years that 'd put them at a bit better than 2.5x over that time it 's still a stretch that should put them in the same p e range as goog currently trading at a p e of   any price higher than $ 10/share at this point is gambling on their ability to crack monetization the higher you go the higher you think the odds are   one last thing i 'd keep in mind most of the early employees with options are locked out of selling for the first 6 months after the ipo there 's a fairly large number of shares that will become available when that time is up i 'm curious to see how many of the early employees call in rich and go start new companies think about what happened to paypal after being sold to ebay yelp youtube and others all came out of the early employees i 'd be watching the quarterly reports through the quarter ending 12/31 the numbers at that point will give a better gauge of a proper valuation i absolutely would n't hold shares of fb during the period when employees first have their chance to cash their lottery tickets

my perspective is from the us many employers offer 401(k)s and you can always contribute to an ira for either tax deferred or tax free investment growth if you 're company offers a 401(k match you should always contribute the maximum amount they max or you 're leaving money on the table     companies ca n't always support pensions and it is n't the best idea to rely on one entirely for retirement unless your pension is from the federal government    even states such as illinois are going through extreme financial difficulties due to pension funding issues it 's only going to get worse and if you think pension benefit accrual is n't going to be cut eventually you 'll have another thing coming i 'd be worried if i was a state employee in the middle of my career with no retirement savings outside of my pension    ranting employees pushed hard for some pretty absurd commitments and public officials let the public down by giving in it seems a little crazy to me that someone can work for the state until they 're in their 50 's and then earn 70 of their 6 figure salary for the rest of their life something needs to be done but i 'd be surprised if anyone has the political will to make tough choices now before thee options get much much worse and these states are forced to make a decision

one approach is to control your budget more effectively for example work out your essential living expenses things like food rent and other bills you are committed to and compare this to your regular income   then you can set up a regular automatic payment to a savings account so you limit the disposable income in your current account if you keep a regular check on this balance it should make you feel like you have less spare money and so less temptation to spend on impulse purchases   similarly    it may help to set a savings goal for something you really do want even if this is itself   a bit frivolous it will at least help you to discipline yourself   equally it may be useful to set a fixed budget for luxuries then you have a sense that when it 's gone it 's gone but you do n't have to completely deny yourself

as a sole proprietor the tax liability of your business is calculated based on combining your business income with your personal income together   it is good advice to keep all personal and business financial matters separate this makes it easier to prove to the irs that all your business expenses are actually business related in this case however the two items tax payment for personal income vs tax payment for business income are what you can do however for your own personal records is calculate how much of your tax payment relates to your business i would n't get complicated about this i would simply take the net income of your business as a of your taxable income and multiply that against your tax payment ie if your business net income is $ 10,000 and your total taxable income is $ 50,000 and you paid $ 6,000 in taxes i would record that 20 of the $ 6k was related to business income if you have a separate bank account for your sole proprietorship you could make a transfer to your personal account of $ 1,200 and then make the $ 6k payment from your personal account remember that tax payments for either your sole proprietorship and your personal income will be treated the same federal tax payments are not tax deductible and state tax payments are tax deductible whether they were paid for your sole proprietorship or the rest of your personal income so even though this method is simplistic for example it does n't factor in that different investment income types earned personally will have a lower rate than your sole proprietorship income any difference would n't have an impact on any future tax liability this would only be for your own personal record keeping

my original answer contained a fundamental error it turns out that it is not true that any exchange can create its own product to track any underlying index   if the underlying index is copyrighted such as the s&p indices russell indices dow jones indices etc then the exchange must enter into a licensing agreement usually exclusive with the copyright holder in order to use the index 's formula and name   without such a license the exchange would only be able to approximate the underlying index and i do n't think that happens very much because how would you market such a product the cme offers several futures and other derivatives whose face value is equivalent to some multiple of the s&p500 's value on the date when the product expires   when such a product is actively traded it may serve as a reasonable indicator of the market 's expectation of the s&p500 's future value so you could pay attention to the front month of the cme 's s&p 500 mini future which trades from chicago time sunday night through friday afternoon   but remember that the prices quoted there are as another example if you care about the russell 2000 index until 2017 the ice exchange happened to hold the license for its derivatives   they traded from new york time sunday night through friday afternoon   but in cme bought that license as well so now you 'll want to track it here moral there 's almost always some after hours product out there tracking whatever index you care about but you may have to do some digging to find it and it might not be all that useful for your specific purpose

it is the first time i encounter redemption programme and i would like to know what are my options here you can hold on to the shares and automatically receive 2.25 sek per share some time after depending on how fast the company and its bank process the payouts alternatively you can trade in the said window for whatever the market is offering how is this different from paying the dividend i do n't know much about sweden laws structuring this way may be tax beneficial the other benefit in in company 's books the shareholders capital is reduced can i trade these redemption shares during these 2 weeks in may what is the point of trading them if they have fixed price yes you can if you need money sooner generally the price will be discounted by few cents to cover the interest for the balance days

i do n't think this is curious at all   a large part of bitcoin 's value is based on speculation currently and since it 's both a global currency and a relatively small one global changes can greatly affect it without having a huge impact on the us dollar e.g. the article mentions that much of bitcoin 's trade and therefore its value is coming from japan right now   the you 're looking for can also be deceiving when talking about currencies of dramatically different values   the us m2 money supply is worth over $ 13 trillion measuring in us dollars   the bitcoin money supply is currently worth about $ 66 billion also measuring in us dollars   if bitcoin spiked 10 and the change in value was completely with the us dollar the us dollar would fall in value by only 0.05 i.e. move $ 6.6 billion in market cap from the usd to bitcoin   that 's also greatly exaggerating the impact of changes in value of bitcoin on the us dollar since bitcoin and the usd are n't the only currency pair in existence   far from it in fact   this is why you see for example the venezuelan tank against the us dollar without feeling immensely more wealthy   people in the us also tend to price things in usd including foreign currencies because that 's what they 're used to doing as they 're most familiar with the value of a dollar from everyday experience

what financial instruments are there that are profitable when an underlying assets falls the instrument you are looking for is called an option specifically a put option it allows you within the validity date to sell put the respective shares to the option giver at the predefined strike price for example let 's assume appl trades currently at 100 $ per share and you think they will go down a lot you buy one put option for 100 shares they always come for larger amounts like 100s for a strike price of 90 $ and pay 5 $ for it it would be cheap if nobody believes they will fall that much note the last sentence under 2 it is rather easy and very common when trading options to make complete losses you have been warned are they available for ipos they could be available for ipos even before the ipo however someone has to put them out some large bank typically which is some effort and they would only do that if they expect enough interest and volume in the trade most of the time there will be no such options on the market are they available for foreign but again only selectively only if the stock is well known and interesting enough for a broad audience

the only fair thing to do is to let each of you pay their own loans that way your brother will probably get out of debt faster and starts saving or investing assuming equal down payments while you 'll be stuck with your loan for a while longer if you want to minimize the interests you have to pay you could simply borrow money from your brother that way he 'll contribute towards your loans and you will know exactly how much you owe him your brother may lend you money interest free or you could agree on an interest rate which is lower than what you pay on your loans which will somewhat compensate your brother and still be beneficial to you it still wo n't be fair though because your brother might be able to invest his extra money with better interest rate and lending money to you would prevent that

i 'll chime in and say that my wife and i thought this was a really dumb idea until we tried it i was keeping track of everything in my checkbook ledger but having the physical money in the envelopes really does work we thought it would be more hassle than it 's worth and there were the first month or two but in the end we both agree this is what started our movement towards responsible money management and debt reduction we have the following categories   obviously ymmv but the point is to take any categories in your budget that are hard to budget for as they vary from month to month and just set aside an amount form your paycheck in cash for each one of those categories in an envelope   what i 've noticed is that by putting the money aside up front it 's much easier to stick to the budget we 'll often shuffle money around in the envelopes if priorities change for a particular month as well so rather than taking money away from an extra payment on a debt or our planned savings transfer which would have been our default action pre envelopes we can just move $ xx from date night into groceries if we have to hence planning out how we 'll spend our money budgeting has gotten a lot easier since adopting this system

a bit strange but okay   the way i would think about this is again that you need to determine for what purpose you 're computing this in much the same way you would if you were to build out the model the ipo valuation is not going to be relevant to the accretion dilution analysis unless you 're trying to determine whether the transaction was net accretive at exit but that 's a weird analysis to do for longer holding periods like that you 're more likely to look at irr not eps eps is something investors look at over the short to medium term to get a sense of whether the company is making good acquisition decisions and to do that short to medium term analysis they look at earnings    damodaran would say this is a shitty way of looking at things and that you should probably be looking at some measure of instead and i tend to agree but i do n't get paid to think like an investor i get paid to sell shit to them if only in indirect fashion the short answer to your question is that no you should not incorporate what you are calling liquidation value when determining accretion dilution but only because the market typically computes accretion dilution on a 3-year basis tops i 've never put together a book or seen a press release in my admittedly short time in finance that says the transaction is estimated to be x% accretive within 4 years that just seems like an absurd timeline   final point is just that from an accounting perspective a gain on a sale of an asset is not going to get booked in either ebitda or so just mechanically there 's no way for the ipo value to flow into your accretion dilution analysis there even if you are looking at ebitda shares you could figure the gain on sale into some kind of adjusted ebitda shares version of eps but this is neither something i 've ever seen nor something that really makes sense in the context of using eps as a standardized metric across the market typically we take out non recurring shit in eps we do n't add it in adding something like this in would be much more appropriate to measuring the success of an acquisition investing vehicle like a private equity fund not a standalone operating company that reports operational earnings in addition to cash flow from investing and as i suggest above that 's an analysis for which the irr metric is more ideally situated   and just a semantic thing we typically would n't call the exit value a liquidation value that term is usually reserved for dissolution of a corporate entity and selling off its physical or intangible assets in piecemeal fashion i.e. not accounting for operational synergies across the business ipo value is actually just going to be a measure of market value of equity

i had a joint account at chase and each of us had own on line login and could access the account each of us also had non joint accounts in chase and with the same login we already had we could access the joint accounts but not the other 's non joint accounts it seems like your bank is really backwards on this change the bank by the way in joint accounts you have the option of requiring both partners to sign on every document so that every check or order you write will only be valid with both of your signatures i do n't know if that 's what you need but some may want that it is quite uncomfortable imho

my prediction   they are purposefully suppressing the price   chinese crypto exchanges will be temporarily closed at the end of this month   the communist party leaders and insiders will have access to cheap bitcoin   after they are sufficiently happy with their bitcoin acquisition they release a new statement that says exchanges can re open   the supply has been significantly reduced because of insiders attaining bitcoin behind the scenes during the shut down   because of the low supply the price skyrockets to $ 10k   they all make significant sums of money   so do you want to be on the sidelines during this or do you want to join in on the fun   i know what i 'll be doing

another factor to consider beyond the fact that growth and volatility go together is that the times when many people will need to liquidate their investments will correlate with the times that many other people need to liquidate their investments and such correlation will push down the immediate value of those investments while certificates of deposit have penalties for early withdrawal one can establish up front what the worst case penalty would be for cashing it in at the most inopportune time   by contrast stocks offer no such assurance   stocks sometimes have weird downward spikes that may be short lived but if life circumstances force one to liquidate stocks during such a downward spike the penalty can be much larger than on a cd

my revised bottom line advice offer to send a 2nd payment preferably in the form of money order or cashier 's check for the difference you are agreeing to pay i can not imagine any reason why they would object to this there is no fee to cash a check there 's less risk of error and less work involved alternatively offer to send a new check only once the other has been returned do n't issue one more full amount check while the other is still outstanding there is a good reason not to accept partial payment by them which is that accepting a partial payment of a debt comes with a varieties of strings attached depending on the nature of the debt such as with court processes may need to be etc they likely want to avoid such a situation but this does not provide any support for why they ca n't just take a second payment and then cash it all at once as a single full settlement of the debt in a perfect world you could skip all the non sense by simply having your bank put a stop payment on the old check before sending a new one unfortunately this might not work with 100 accuracy but in your case if the partial payment is a significant amount of money to you i 'd go ahead and spend the $ 20 40 to put in the order now as an extra safety on them not doing what they claim if for some incredibly stupid reason you ca n't handle this with a 2nd payment instead of one single full one it turns out banks have lots of surprising and stupid rules like stop payments on a check expiring in 6 months and they may even cash stale checks over a year old no guarantee of a stop being successful etc the real rule is they might cash the check unless you close the account sigh this is one of many reasons i never ever use checks i am not aware of any law that requires a check to be physically returned if requested or proof or destruction provided or anything like that it 's a large part of the reason why we have the ability to stop payment on a check and so void it through the bank without having any physical access to the check but this process is spotty and imperfect and can not be relied upon you can request them to do whatever you like like void it and send it back or destroy it and they can just refuse or say they 'll do it and then just not do it and you have no real useful recourse the main goal should be to avoid losing money if someone accidentally or intentionally cashes both checks so you can ask or demand refuse to pay until they return the check etc and they can respond more or less any way they want as a final piece of future advice consider no longer using checks for purposes like this switch to using something like a cashier 's check or money order offered by your bank which by their very nature takes the money out of your account immediately all ongoing connection to your bank account and is effectively like cash with the added benefit of a paper trail keep the stub and and receipt from the cashier 's check money order in case it is lost or they claim they did n't get the money

hello reddit friends family amp future guests of the greenhouse inn park 's nj first eco friendly bed and breakfast   i have wonderful news from the small business administration sba and the local community bank as they have agreed to finance 90 of the startup costs to open the greenhouse inn woo they have affirmed their support and are ready to get the ball rolling but i will need to supply 10 of the projects total cost in equity   for instance a bank will usually lend only if you have 10 of the amount you require therefore if we have $ 1,000 getting a bank loan of up to $ 10,000 should be feasible this is oversimplified but in a way it means that every single dollar contributed gives the greenhouse access to ten more if we make $ 20,000 dollars on we might be able to get a loan of $ 200,000 dollars

a good question there are many good tactical points in other answers but i wanted to emphasize two strategic points to think about in your 5-year plan both of which involve around diversification expense allocation you have several potential expenses actually expenses is n't the right word it 's more like applications think of the money you have as a resource that you can pour because money has liquidity into multiple buckets depending on time horizon and risk tolerance an ultra short term cushion for extreme emergencies e.g.   things go really wrong this should be something you can access at a moment 's notice from a bank account for example your car has been and they need cash a short term cushion for emergencies something bad happens and you need the money in a few days or weeks a cd ladder is good for this it pays better interest and you can get the money out quick with a minimal penalty a long term savings cushion you might want to make a down payment on a house or a car but you know it 's some years off for this an investment account is good there are quite a few index funds out there which have very low expenses and will get you a better return than cds savings account with some risk tolerance retirement savings $ 1 now can be worth a huge amount of money to you in 40 years if you invest it wisely here 's where the ira or 401 k if you get a job comes in you need to put these in this order of priority put enough money in your short term to be 99 confident you have enough then with the remainder put most of it in an investment account but some of it in a retirement account the thing to realize is that you need to make the retirement account off limits so you do n't want to put too much money there but the earlier you can get started in a retirement account the better i 'm 38 and i started both an investment and a retirement account at age 24 they 're now to the point where i save more income on average from the returns in my investments than i can save from my salary but i wish i had started a few years earlier income you need to come up with some idea of what your range of net income after living expenses is likely to be over the next five years so that you can make decisions about your savings allocation are you in good health or bad are you single or do you have a family are you working towards law school or medical school and need to borrow money are you planning on getting a job with a dependable salary or do you plan on being self employed where there is more uncertainty in your income these are all factors that will help you decide how important short term and long term savings are to your 5-year plan in short there is no one place you should put your money but be smart about it and you 'll give yourself a good head start in your personal finances good luck

selling one fund and buying another will incur capital gains tax on the sale for the amount of the gain i 'm not aware of any sort of exemption available due to you moving out of the country however long term capital gains for low tax bracket taxpayers is 0 as long as your total income including the gains fits within the 15 regular tax bracket you do n't pay any long term capital gains options for you that i see to avoid taxes are note that even if you do sell it all it 's only the amount of gains that would take your income over the 15 normal tax bracket that would be taxed at the long term rate of 15 which may not end up being that much of a tax hit it may be worth calculating just how bad it would be based on your actual income also note that all i 'm saying here is for us federal income taxes the state you most recently lived in may still charge taxes if you 're still considered a resident there in some fashion and i do n't know if your new home 's government may try to take a cut as well

fundamentally interest rates reflect the time preference people place on money and the things money can buy   if i have a high time preference then i prefer money in my hand versus money promised to me at some date in the future   thus i will only loan my money to someone if they offer me an incentive which would be an amount of money to be received in the future that is larger than the amount of money i ’m giving the debtor in the present i.e. the interest rate many factors go into my time preference determination   my demand for cash i.e. my cash balance the credit rating of the borrower the length of the loan and my expectation of the change in currency value are just a few of the factors that affect what interest rate i will loan money the first loan i make will have a lower interest rate than the last loan ceteris paribus   this is because my supply of cash diminishes with each loan which makes my remaining cash more valuable and a higher interest rate will be needed to entice me to make additional loans   this is the theory behind why interest rates will rise when qe3 or ever stops   qe is where the federal reserve cartel prints new money to purchase bonds from cartel banks   if qe slows or ends the supply of money will stop increasing which will make cash more valuable and higher interest rates will be needed to entice creditors to loan money note that increasing the stock of money does not necessarily result in lower interest rates   as stated earlier the change in value of the currency also affects the interest rate lenders are willing to accept   if the federal reserve cartel deposited $ 1 million everyday into every us citizen ’s bank account it would n’t take long before lenders demanded very high interest rates as compensation for the decrease in the value of the currency does the federal reserve cartel affect interest rates   yes in two ways   first as mentioned before it prints new money that is loaned to the government   it either purchases the bonds directly or purchases the bonds from cartel banks which give them cash to purchase more government bonds   this keeps demand high for government bonds which lowers the yield on government bonds yields move inverse to the price of the bond   the federal reserve cartel also can provide an unlimited amount of funds at the federal funds rate to the cartel member banks   banks can borrow at this rate and then proceed to make loans at a higher rate and pocket the difference remember however that the federal reserve cartel is not the only market participant   other bond holders such as foreign governments and pension funds buy and sell us bonds   at some point they could demand higher rates   the federal reserve cartel which currently holds close to 17 of us public debt could attempt to keep rates low by printing new money to buy all existing us bonds to prevent the yield on bonds from going up   at that point however holding us dollars becomes very dangerous as it is apparent the federal reserve cartel is just a money printing machine for the us government   that ’s when most people begin to dump dollars en masse

puerto rico last i checked the puerto rico banking system was n't materially different than working within the us though some continental us banks exclude us territories like guam and puerto rico or charge more when dealing with them i 'm not certain as to why however most banks do n't see them any differently than a regular us bank   regarding wire transfers wt $ 35 for an ad hoc wt within the us and puerto rico is for the most part average wires cost money for the convenience of quick clearing and guaranteed funds if you have a business commercial account where you are doing this regularly and paying a monthly fee for a wt service $ 10 $ 15 each may be expected i had a business account with us bank where i paid $ 15 a month for a wt transfer service and reoccurring template always went to the same account amex in this case and the transfers were only $ 15 each but a wt as a general rule especially when it 's only a once a month thing from a personal account will cost around $ 25 $ 35 in the us and puerto rico as others have said you can simply mail a personal check just as you would in the us many people choose to use money orders for puerto rico as they can be cashed at the post office i believe there is an amount limit though ach if you want even easier i would use ach banks in puerto rico use this ach automatic clearing house system as we do in the continental us it will take a little longer than wt but as you said this is fine not all us banks offer free ach but a number of them do last i checked citibank and usaa where among them banks like bac charges a small fee much smaller than a wt this post may be useful to you what 's the difference between wire transfer and ach

the reason people like mint is because it allows you to see all of your financial details in one place when you create an account you ’re able to link all of your bank accounts credit cards and investment accounts this linking enables mint to update your transactions automatically the catch is that you have to provide the username and password you use for each one which can certainly make you feel if you ’re worried about a security breach mint is designed to be a read only service which means you ca n’t transfer money back and forth between accounts if someone were to get their hands on your mint login all they ’d be able to do is view your balances and transactions your full account numbers are n’t displayed nor are your bank account or credit card usernames and passwords the only thing that would be visible would be your email address if a hacker was interested in taking things a step further there ’s always the possibility that they could physically steal the information from mint ’s secure servers but that ’s really a long shot that would require knowing where the servers are located bypassing the physical security measures that are in place and cracking the code on how the data is encrypted if that were to happen then your personal information might be at risk but so far there ’s no record of it being attempted i was very skeptical of mint and how secure it truly was i did my fair share of research try looking at

the motley fool suggested a good rule of thumb in one of their articles that may be able to help you determine if the market is overheating determine the entire cost of rent for a piece of property so if rent is $ 300/month total cost over a year is $ 3600 compare that to the cost of buying a similar piece of property by dividing the property price by the rent per year so if a similar property is $ 90,000 the ratio would be $ = 25 if the ratio is < 20 you should consider buying a place if its > 20 there 's a good chance that the market is overheated this method is clearly not foolproof but it helps quantify the irrationality of some individuals who think that buying a place is always better than renting   additionally alex b helped me with two additional sources of information for this real estate is local all the articles here refer to the us housing market bankrate says purchase price annual rate in the us has a long term average of fool says purchase price monthly rent 150 is good buy 200 starts to get expensive this answer is copy pasted from a similar question not the same so i did not vote to merge linked here

currency lives no more then 50 years us currency did not expire in last 100 years but it was few times last one was 2009 note that currency is not just what you hold in your hand currency is system of relations of money supply currency is not money but we forced to use standard terminology banking rules and government policy currency exists as long as government wants it to in 2009 for example us government decided it needs new currency and just printed whole new money supply so us dollar is now counting as partially fresh new currency it was not expired but today 's dollar is totally different from 90s and will it be accepted after 200 years yes probably but most likely at that time there will be totally new us dollars and new euros new pounds and so on currency is method of transfer you can have that physical coins you have but as economic agent it will die very quickly it is not only related to inflation in fact inflation is the least of your worries if you count all currencies in the world which ever existed most of them 99.99 are completely dead by now with governments which supported it not even single one currency which lived more then 100 years us dollar was in 1860 1907 1930 1973 1987 2009 and   in fact it is not single currency but dozen which were allowed to be used for compatibility reasons

a cd is guaranteed to pay its return on maturation   so if you need a certain amount of money at a specific time in the future the cd is a more reliable way of getting it   the stock market might give you more money or less   more is obviously ok   less is not if you 're planning to pay basic expenses with it e.g. food rent etc    most retirement portfolios will have a mix of investments   some securities stocks and bonds some guaranteed returns cds treasuries and some cash equivalents money market savings and checking accounts   cash equivalents are good for short term expenses and an emergency fund   guaranteed returns are good for medium term expenses   securities are good for the long term    once retired the general system is to maintain enough cash equivalents for the next few months of expenses and emergencies   then schedule cds for the next few years so that you have a predictable amount   finally keep the bulk of your wealth in securities   as you get older your potential emergencies increase and your need for savings decreases so the mix shifts more and more to the cash equivalents and guaranteed returns and away from securities    cds have limited use prior to retirement and the couple years right before retirement mainly saving up for a large purchase like a house car or major appliance   even there if you have the option of delaying the purchase that might allow you to use securities instead   perhaps some of your emergency fund in a short term cd that you keep rolling over    note that the problem is n't so much that securities will fall   it 's that they 'll fall right when you need the money   so rather than sell 1 of your securities to meet your needs you have to sell 2   that 's a dead weight loss of 1 that you have to deduct from your returns   that roughly matches the drop from the height of 2007 to the trough of 2009 of the s&p 500   and it was 2012 before it recovered   if in 2007 you had put the 1 of your portfolio in a two year cd you 'd be ahead even at zero interest in 2009

as others have mentioned it 's important that there is a fair assessment of the market value of the items being donated   joel 's point about the government not looking kindly upon overvalued donations also applies in canada the cra does n't look kindly upon donation schemes such as buy low donate high arrangements since nobody has offered up authoritative information for canada yet here 's something to look at excerpts 3 gifts in kind of a taxpayer    include capital property depreciable    property personal use property    6 the fair market value of a gift in    kind as of the date of the donation    the date on which beneficial    ownership is transferred from the    donor to the donee must be determined    before an amount can be recorded on a    receipt for tax purposes   the    person who determines the fair market    value of the property must be    competent and qualified to evaluate    the particular property being    transferred by way of a gift property    of little or only nominal value to the    donor will not qualify as a gift in    kind used clothing of little value    would be an example of a    non qualifying contribution you will need to find a charity that would both value the books you would be donating and be willing to issue you a receipt for your charitable donation   whatever receipt they issue should be in line with fair market value of the goods donated   assume your donation receipt will be challenged and keep both finally reasonable comparables might be prices for similar used goods not a percentage of new   though if you ca n't find a price for a particular title in the used market an estimate consistent with other valuations in the lot would be better than nothing perhaps

most other countries are worse off     your perception of what is a resource intensive lifestyle does not take into consideration future innovation or     government debt is large but not insurmountable   much of it is owned by the government itself social security trust fund and the federal reserve and by domestic banks    the crumbling infrastructure claim is often made but is rarely well so it 's hard to respond to     entitlements is a bit more complicated an issue due to political gridlock but i expect that at least minor changes will be made gradually that will help deal with this problem   if not major reform small things like pushing back the benefit age a year here and a year there repealing benefits for the wealthy reducing the size of cost of living adjustments reducing the amount that is paid out to higher earning recipients increasing the amount of yearly income that is subject to fica   these are piecemeal changes that both sides could agree to even in the current political climate   medicare is the bigger cost but how to deal with that is difficult to determine considering what 's going on with obamacare   municipal and state governments will not fail if they go bankrupt   most municipalities and states are able to balance a budget   it can be done but in some place it is n't because politicians do n't have enough backbone to say no   when they go bankrupt and are unable to borrow money they will have no choice and can blame their cuts on the banks who wo n't loan them money   that is unless the people running the federal government also have no backbone and decide to bail them out in which case we will have an enormous case of moral hazard on our hands   the economic dominoes in europe and china are not damaging the core of their economies   unless europe breaks apart violently and goes to war with itself or china has a civil war the basic aspects of their economy that make them a valuable part of the global economy will not go away   their productive capacities will remain intact and we 'll still want to buy stuff from each other     the beauty of free market capitalism is that it 's so adaptable and the fact that things are changing does not mean that everyone will be worse off   whether or not the us is above everyone else in the end is mostly irrelevant but the fundamental aspects of the us economy that make it among the strongest in the world will not change because of these things   our workforce will remain highly educated very productive and very innovative   we have the best farmland in the world and a lot of it enormous amounts of natural resources a relatively flexible and adaptable economy and a tremendous amount of wealth   there may be troubles related to certain institutions and governing bodies but remember that those things are not the economy   the economy is the people the things they can make the things they know and the things that they can do

gt ever eat paper   yeah of course plenty of times not usually intentionally but sometimes a wrapper will get stuck etc also it 's a good way to get rid of something if you do n't have a lighter   more so when i was a kid and messing around with secret notes and the like but yeah i 've eaten paper     granted i 've probably eaten gold as well and there are some benefits or health values of gold within the alt health crowd not sure i buy into those but it has some value    but nothing like paper obviously there are different materials used for making paper lots of have a value from a health perspective a relative nutritional value growing the tree depending on the type can provide fruit building materials etc with the providing a paper value so multiple benefits can come from paper and that 's just the post harvest aspect well the case of fruit i guess not   but there 's the environmental benefits of trees and such as well habitats for wild life wind breaks carbon soil health etc   multiple benefits and that 's just from tree based paper   if you expand it out to something like say hemp paper well there 's the oil which can be used for fuel production various other uses and most especially the health benefits and consumption from it while the remaining can be used for construction be it compressed bricks which has excellent values in strength durability insulation weight to strength ratio etc   and again the health benefits of hemp oil argued to be the single thing you can consume solely + water and get 100 of the nutrients you need in mixed ratios and obviously it is n't as great as other things in concentrations but it 's extremely nutritious     also the plant is really good for the soil again habitats carbon helps to pull and such out of the soil for is quick to grow grows densely is durable has minimal inputs needed all around a great crop   and again the health benefits of its oil are combined with its paper making capabilities and good strong paper too has a great weight feel durable can will last a really long time if properly handled and has much wider variance in proper handling than tree based paper   solid product you should look into it here i 'll give you some links to help you out   9 health benefits of hemp oil that you should wellness natural benefits of hemp oil that you should know   10 incredible benefits of hemp benefits hemp   12 ways using hemp seed oil will improve your health amp your hemp seed   a bit in the headlines and well as to be expected i suppose but regardless pretty great stuff    and again that 's just the oil the post oil extraction can still go on to be used for the more applicable to conversation paper   but since usd 's seem to be the main focus though other countries are progressively or more progressively i suppose utilizing even more durable plastic in their notes but for usd still paper and as such the more durable cotton paper   now comparing cotton to hemp is really hemp wins nearly every hemp vs   but cotton is cotton and recent headline and social controversy of cotton flower aside cotton is cotton most everything that i 'm wearing right now is made of cotton it 's a nice fabric durable flexible soft etc good stuff not the easiest to work with but clearly not something the world is in short supply of   but that does n't really address your point though exactly like hemp you can get cotton oil or cotton seed oil to be more specific from the plant while also getting the that you 'd need for paper production    it 's a bit of a mixed back and definitely not as straight forward as hemp 's purported health benefits and i did n't even get into the cbd oil stuff that hemp can provide   15 benefits of benefits of cotton seed   7 amazing benefits amp uses of health benefits oils   10 best benefits of cotton seed articles best benefits of cotton seed   but from there things start to turn a little south and were n't necessarily all that great to begin with   is oil diet nutrition nutrition is oil   3 best and worst oils for your trends and worst oils for your health    so i suppose my point is if i even really have a singular one is that paper regardless of source has at least some sort of nutritional value or could anyway   as well the crops used to produce the paper have the capability of ranging from some medicinal qualities all the way up to a seemingly really beneficial quantity of nutrients and compounds at worst the crops provide a for various    the problem with gold and paper currency is that in the end they 're both inherently valued by the civilization that deems them valuable    i mean take the quantity of gold in reserves around the world cross that with the industrial uses of gold of which there are many and in turn cross that with the artistic value of it   it 's price is n't based on its use it 's based on similar principals as fiat paper and increasingly plastic currency society 's perception that it has value   gold has many properties that are excellent for many applications superior to most all in certain cases but that 's not why it 's valued at its current price    again it 's valued at its current price because of perceived value   even from an artistic perspective the amount of gold used in the of for the paint and such was minuscule given how much of the is covered in gold it was something like just a few ounces because the is so thin point if the look of gold was all that people were going for they could easily just use another metal coated in a very thin layer of gold and externally the appearance would be the same effect and the weight could theoretically be even lighter or heavier but people want more than just the look they feel that the gold itself has a value beyond just the look and for all intents amp purposes it    but only because they and other people choose to perceive it as having such   i 've traded gold profitably for over 20 years i understand the arguments very well but vs food in the end the gold is a means not an end

the answer is there are a lot of answers it always seems so daunting to start saving when you 're living paycheck to paycheck and anticipate more bills on the way kids are expensive start small and make it automatic if you can if you can take $ 25 out of every paycheck and put it into a savings account and do this automatically using your bank 's bill pay system that will go a long way it 's about setting up a new habit for yourself and increasing as you can one way i 've heard it phrased is pay yourself first   do n't set unrealistic expectations for yourself either you need to start building a savings account to cover emergencies not just future purchases if something happens and you ca n't get a paycheck for a week a month 2 months how will you pay your bills set up a savings account just for that purpose and do n't touch it unless it 's a true emergency there are several banks out there that will let you set up multiple savings accounts and mark them for specific purposes like capitalone 's 360 accounts set one up for the emergency account that gets your automatic per paycheck deposit then set up another one for fun money or new home fund or whatever else you want to save up for   starting the savings process is hard no doubt about it you need to learn how to budget with the money you have after paying yourself first but the important part is to stick with it consider your savings account as another mandatory utility you have to pay it $ or risk i do n't know a smack on the back of the head if you wait until the end of the month to see what you have left after everything else you 'll find you do n't have anything left if you can set it up through your bank so when you get your paycheck it automatically puts $ 25 into a savings account then you 'll never have that $ 25 burning a hole in your pocket if your paychecks are n't direct deposit and you 're physically cashing them when you receive them then tell the bank teller to put $ 25 into your savings account   you can do it make sure your wife is on board and you communicate the importance of setting up a savings account and work together to make it happen be patient and realize that $ 25 may seem like a trivial amount to put away now but after 24 paychecks 1 year depending on pay schedule that 's $ 600 plus interest but rates are too low now to worth noting that

typically in a developed developing economy if there is high overall inflation then it means everything will rise including property real estate the cost of funds is low too much money chasing too few goods causes inflation which means more companies borrow money cheaply and more business and hence the stock market should also go up    so if you are looking at a situation where industry is doing badly and the inflation is high then it means there are larger issues the best bet would be gold and parking the funds into other currency

i am also neither an attorney nor a tax advisor yes the rent money you pay to your friend is taxable income but suddenly all kinds of expenses around the house including a fraction of the interest paid on the mortgage become tax deductible for example let 's say that the mortgage is $ 1000 month and you pay your friend $ 500 month if you live in 50 of the house then he can deduct 50 plus or minus of the expenses associated with owning the house including all of these things 50 of them anyway become tax deductible   it 'd be quite possible for him to take a loss on the endeavor and actually reduce his taxes every year until it comes time to sell selling a property that has been used as a rental is more taxable than selling a property that has been a personal residence

all other things being equal you might be better off contributing to a ira that is a brokerage account   you will have lots of flexibility in your investments and there would probably not be fees for the account itself   you might incur commissions for trading and/or owning mutual funds that are charged by the funds themselves    you wo n't be able to borrow from an ira as opposed to a 401k.   imho that is a good thing are you suggesting that you would withdraw early from a retirement account   you 'd probably be better off not doing that   assuming a large salary you would be paying 43 to withdraw your money early   would you accept a loan at 43 interest    you are probably better off not putting the money in in the first place to accomplish your goals then withdrawing it early most people opt for a 401 k for two reasons   the company match and ease of investment make a compelling argument   keep in mind if a 401 k is available to you regardless if you you start phasing out your ira deduction at 60 k a year single or 96 k married   given your huge salary comments i imagine an ira would not be an option in your scenario given that if you leave a job you can roll your 401 k balance into a trading account

first my economics professor would kill me if i did n't point out that lowering the price does n't change demand only quantity demanded there 's a pretty big difference between the two   anyway the answer to your question is it depends   you 're hoping that people who do n't buy your sandwich for the original price will start buying it at the lower price you 're also hoping that once you increase the price they 'll continue to buy it the relationship describing how much a change in price affects the quantity demanded is known as elasticity elastic demand means that small changes will have a big affect on buying decisions inelastic demand means that buyers are not very flexible and will continue to purchase even after a significant price increase theoretically at least   the decision to raise or lower a price is a very complex process with a lot of variables so i do n't think anyone can give you a right answer to your question   practically you need to figure out where these extra customers are coming from if they are n't buying your sandwiches now because there 's a cheaper alternative lowering the price might entice them to buy from you instead however this means that when you raise the price back they 'll likely leave again   if they do n't know about your deli or have n't tried your sandwiches yet a change in price is n't likely to do any good without a strong marketing campaign to back it up   the of your product could also have an effect if your product is subway quality at higher prices no one is going to stick around on the other hand if you lace your sandwiches with crack you might get some repeat customers long term loyalty is key   hopefully this rambling helps you it 's late and i need to sleep good luck

i strongly recommend that you talk to an accountant right away because you could save some money by making a tax payment by january 15 2014 you will receive forms 1099-misc from the various entities with whom you are doing business as a contractor detailing how much money they paid you a copy will go to the irs also you file a schedule c with your form 1040 in which you detail how much you received on the 1099-misc forms as well as any other income that your contracting business received e.g. amounts less than $ 600 for which a 1099-misc does not need to be issued or tips say if you are a taxi driver running your own cab and you can deduct various expenses that you incurred in generating this income including tools books or gasoline etc that you bought for doing the job you will need to file a schedule se that will compute how much you owe in social security and medicare taxes on the net income on schedule c. you will pay at twice the rate that employees pay because you get to pay not only the employee 's share but also the employer 's share at least you will not have to pay income tax on the employer 's share your net income on schedule c will transfer onto form 1040 where you will compute how much income tax you owe and then add on the social security tax etc to compute a final amount of tax to be paid you will have to pay a penalty for not making tax payments every quarter during 2013 plus   interest on the tax paid late   send the irs a check for the total if you talk to an accountant right away he she will likely be able to come up with a rough estimate of what you might owe and sending in that amount by january 15 will save some money the accountant can also help you set up for the 2014 tax year during which you could make quarterly payments of estimated tax for 2014 and avoid the penalties and interest referred to above

mcdonalds has some more expensive items but their dollar menu is ridiculously popular and supposedly a huge draw   they 've been trying to get rid of it for years because it 's really hard to get anything decent for $ 1 but it 's just too popular to cut   according to the random articles i 've read about it   other places do n't really have anything like it   at mcdonalds you can get two $ and fill up pretty good for the cost of going to a vending machine     while i very rarely go to any of these places i do not agree that food is bad   tastes are subjective and what you get used to eating tastes good to you    i remember that i used to absolutely love taco bell   then after a few years of not going there i went there and found everything to be absolutely disgusting   but for a time i thought it was the best stuff out there and there are a lot of people who like so called fast food   i do think the overarching point is true customer tastes are fluid   in the past years we 've come to see a lot of gourmet burger places spreading like wildfire for example   but as long as fast food is cheap they will continue to fill the market for cheap food

if you are looking for numerical metrics i think the following are popular price earnings p e you mentioned this very popular one in your question   there are different p e ratios forward essentially an estimate of future earnings by management trailing etc   i think of the p e as a quick way to grade a company 's income statement i.e how much does the stock cost the amount of earnings being generated on a per share basis some caution must be taken when looking at the p e ratio   earnings can be by the company   revenue can be moved between quarters assets can be depreciated at different rates residual value of assets can be adjusted etc   knowing this the p e ratio alone does n't help me determine whether or not a stock is cheap in general i think an affordable stock is one whose p e is under 15 price book i look at the price book as a quick way to grade a company 's balance sheet   the book value of a company is the amount of cash that would be left if everything the company owned was sold and all debts paid i.e. the company 's net worth   the cash is then divided the outstanding shares and the price book can be computed   if a company had a price book under 1.0 then theoretically you could purchase the stock the company could be liquidated and you would end up with more money then what you paid for the stock this ratio attempts to answer how much does the stock cost based on the net worth of the company again this ratio can be by the company   asset values have to be estimated based on current market values think about trying to determine how much a company 's building is worth unless of course mark to market is suspended   this involves some estimating   again i do n't use this value alone in whether or not a stock is cheap i consider a price book value under 10 a good number    cash i look at growth in the cash balance of a company as a way to grade a company 's cash flow statement   is the cash account growing or not as they say cash is king   this is one measurement that can not be which is why i like it   the p e and price book can be tuned but in the end the company can not hide a shrinking cash balance return ratios return on equity is a measure of the amount of earnings being generated for a given amount of equity roe = liabilities   this attempts to measure how effective the company is at generating earnings with a given amount of equity   there is also return on assets which measures earnings returns based on the company 's assets i tend to think an roe over 15 is a good number these measurements rely on a company accurately reporting its financial condition   remember in the us companies are allowed to accounting reports if approved by the government so be careful   there are others who simply do n't follow the rules and report whatever numbers they like without penalty there are many others   these are just a few of the more popular ones   there are many other considerations to take into account as other posters have pointed out

did you get an option contingency this is usually part and parcel with getting a home inspection you negotiate a nominal fee like $ 100 that gives you the option to back out of the deal for any reason at all within x days typically 7 calendar days this is usually the time you schedule the home inspection and figure out what needs repairing if you 're still in your option window then yes you can back out and get your earnest money back from escrow the seller keeps your option fee it can be credited to your portion of closing costs if you were to go forward if you are not in an option period because it 's expired or you did n't get one you can still back out but unless you 're covered by another contract contingency that would apply such as financing or appraisal the bank may not be able to underwrite the property even after agreed repairs you default and typically lose your earnest money technically the seller could hold you to strict performance and force you to the closing table but that requires going to court and it 's almost never heard of just taking the earnest money and putting the house back on the market is the easier route for everyone

yes the de beers group of companies is a diamond cartel that had complete control of the diamond market for most of the 20th century they still control a sizable portion of the market and their effort at marketing particularly with the slogan a diamond is forever has done much to inflate the market for diamonds in our society the intrinsic value of diamonds is much lower than the market prices currently reflect but with the caveat that there is a rarity factor which does drive up the price of larger diamonds the larger the diamond the more likely it is to have flaws so when it comes to diamonds that are 5 or greater you are not as likely to see a new supply of diamonds disrupt the prices of those larger stones some other ways that high end jewelers and suppliers are differentiating themselves is by patenting a specific cut that they design this is another barrier to entry that works to create some artificial price inflation one common example is the cut sometimes referred to as the cut diamonds can also be manufactured the same carbon structure can be grown in a lab these stones have the same carbon structure as natural diamonds but without the flaws and visible impurities most manufactured diamonds are used but processes have improved sufficiently to allow for quality synthetic diamonds they sell at a decent discount so that might be an option to consider if you want a substitute in the years to come you can expect prices for synthetic diamonds to continue to decrease which will probably put some further downward pressure on jewelers prices

i 'd refer you to is it true that 90 of investors lose their money the answer there is no not true and much of the discussion applies to this question   the stock market rises over time even after adjusting for inflation a positive return those who try to beat the market choosing individual stocks on average lag the market quite a bit even in a year of great returns as is this year 13 is up nearly 25 as measured by the s&p there are stocks that are up and stocks that are down simply look at a dozen stock funds and see the variety of returns i do n't even look anymore because i 'm sure that of 12 2 or three will be ahead 3 4 well behind and the rest clustered near 25   still if you wish to on individual stock purchases i recommend starting when you can invest in 20 different stocks spread over different industries and be willing to commit time to follow them so each year you might be selling 3 5 and replacing with stocks you prefer it 's the etf i recommend for most along with a buy and hold strategy buying in over time will show decent returns over the long run and the etf strategy will keep costs low

i 'm not so sure the insider outsider distinction is the best one although it does have its uses for example if an organization has stagnated you might not want business as usual someone stuck in and a of the stagnant religion on the other hand bringing in an outsider does n't necessarily mean change they may be just as much of a of the same religion that made the organization stagnant in the first place   personally i would n't say there was a definitive ballmer era though people regularly change their own tactics and approaches and i think ballmer saw the light towards the end of his term with respect to one microsoft or at least it was one major conversion among a series of as yet ones i think satya continued much of that in his own way much like two restaurants can both be french but still be quite distinct from one another   but if even early ballmer can be different from late ballmer the important thing is probably more about how much change is happening and whether it is the right change

many people have provided very good answers to this question and all the answers provide sound advice and justification below are some of my thoughts on the questions that you have put forward 1 the investment manager question the returns on your capital for a half year has been quite low having said that some investments do take more than half year to show some growth you could try talking to your investment manager and ask where your money has been deployed and why the returns are low if there are no real explanation given forth which would be more likely as you have mentioned your investment manager does not like to discuss your money with you you should pete 's advice and take all your money from investment manager and park it in the bank till you figure out what to do next with it 2 finances are not my forte at 22 finance is forte it takes longer than that however having said that how do you know finance is actually not your forte being a computer science graduate you would be more than comfortable with the mathematics required for finance you may not have looked seriously at finance till now i assume by your statement once way to be certain about this would be self learning some good books have been above and there are online information courses and articles on the internet for example here you could give some spare time and explore if finance interests you or not 3 if finance interests you then consider the 30 k as your seed fund and take a small portion of it say 2 k and try out your hand at investing on your own in the instruments that you feel most comfortable and see how you fare you are young enough to take the risk rest of the money you could put in other low risk instruments that you have identified through self study 4 if finance does not interest you the probably you are better off with an investment manager as observed above it will take some time for you to identify him her 5 on returns as mentioned above different instruments produce returns differently however one question that is universally asked is how much return on an one expect you were expecting more than $ 12 on your investment it is a difficult question to answer as returns and investment needs depend on a persons financial goals and risk taking profile one way to have some measure is to take 15 20 years cagr of the stock index return and reduce it by 2 3 that is in many cases not all a reasonable return expectation in medium long term

can i pay $ 12,000 extra once a year or $ 1000 every month which option is better depends when if you mean 12 k now vs 1 k a month over the next 12 months repeating this each year now wins if you mean saving 1 k a month for 12 months then doing a the 1 k a month wins basically a sooner payment saves you more money than a later payment the first option does sound better but for a 30 year mortgage is it that significant your number one issue is that you have a thirty year mortgage the interest you pay on it is monstrous for the 30 year term you pay around 500 k in interest a 15-year mortgage is 300 k cheaper only 200 k in interest will be paid the monthly payment would be 1250 more how much money and years on a mortgage can i save when is the best time to pay at the end of each year you can knock off about a dozen years save i think you can find mortgage calculators online or talk to your mortgage advisor to play around with the numbers

if you are careful you do n't need to spend much more than the cruise price   the cruises i 've been on they biggest extra was soda and alcohol mainly wine with dinner   if you are fine drinking water or iced tea there is no need for that food extras like ice cream at the pool may be an extra charge as well the way it works is that your room key acts like a credit card and gets charged to your room   its easy to run up a big bill if you are n't paying attention so you may want to keep track of it as you go along   you can also go to the office at any time and find out your current account generally the cruise automatically charges a certain amount per day for tips for your room and dining room attendants   you are expected to tip for spa services another extra charge and shore excursion guides   shore excursions vary greatly depending on what you are doing   maybe $ 50-$100 per person for a bus tour to much more than that for things like diving or fishing   you can also either book tours yourself or just get off and wander around   it depends where you are going   many times the ships dock far away from anything you might want to see   there are generally taxis or to the tourist places but that is another charge   internet is generally charged by hour and quite expensive several dollars per hour   part of the attraction for me is completely so i generally do n't bother   on older ships you probably are limited to the internet lounge   some of the newer ships have wi fi in the state rooms as well the drinks on board are n't cheap but not outrageous either   probably similar to an upscale club   they also have a daily drink special which is cheaper   technically you are n't allowed to bring your own alcohol on board   if you buy something in a port you need to check it with them   this policy may vary by cruise line but has been true on the princess and costa cruises i 've been on   that said as long as you are low key they probably wo n't know or care

look at price book value and there are more than a few stocks that may have a p b under 1 so this does happen there are at least a couple of other factors you are n't considering here current liabilities how much money is the company losing each quarter that may cause it to sell repeatedly if the company is burning through $ 100 million quarter that asset is only going to keep the lights on for another 2.5 years so consider what assumptions you make about the company 's cash flow here the asset itself is the price really fixed or could it be flexible could the asset seen as being worth $ 1 billion today be worth much less in another year or two as an example suppose the asset was a building and then real estate values drop by 40 in that area now what was worth $ 1 billion may now be worth only $ 600 million as something of a final note you do n't state where the $ 100 million went that the company received as if that was burned for operations now the company 's position on the asset is $ 900 million as it only holds a 90 stake though i 'd argue my 2 previous points are really worth noting the following 6 stocks are trading at or below 0.5 x book value sep 2013 has a half dozen examples of how this is possible if the $ 100 million was used to pay off debt then the company does n't have that cash and thus its assets are reduced by the cash that is gone depending on what the plant is producing the value may or may not stay where it is if you want an example to consider how would you price automobile plants these days if the company experiences a reduction in demand the plant may have to be sold off at a reduced price for a cynic 's view here

is it common in the us not to pay medical bills certainly not   what some might do however is not pay them immediately with the intent to negotiate them down or get them written off   you can also see if there 's a discount for paying immediately i 've had moderate success with this but it was during a time where we could n't pay them all immediately so i was more trying to figure out which ones to pay first rather than just haggling    the obvious risk is that they go to a collections agency and get reported as unpaid debt to your credit   i 'm with you however it 's a service that you received and it should be paid i must precise that they are wealthy upscale members who can afford paying these bills are you certain that they have large medical bills   i suppose it 's possible that they have resources that   can negotiate these on their behalf or they do n't care about the impact to their credit score but to say no one is doing it here seems ludicrous

there are not always capital efficient ways for a company to reinvest its own profits this is why dividends exist   imagine a company will reinvest 80 of its profits into a project with a huge projected return but the other 20 of the company 's profits can not be reinvested efficiently because there are zero projects in which to reinvest the profits into that would return a better profit than what the company 's shareholders could make by reinvesting those profits in their own way ie a benchmark market index like an s&amp;p 500 index fund   since the shareholders could make a better return with this than the company could with any company project it would be irresponsible technically maybe even illegal for the company to reinvest that 20 of the profits   this reason for companies sometimes paying out profits to shareholders in the form of dividends is a market efficient part of the economic system and it really is great   if a ceo cfo anyone is paying out so much profit from a company that it is irresponsible to the company 's investors then that would also technically be illegal since the company is evading efficient project that would benefit its shareholders more than they could benefit themselves elsewhere in the market   these legalities with shareholder laws are not explicitly put into action very often but their effects are always there    it 's also worth noting payout strategy is very important for the strategy and financing of a company particularly for public investments

the professional financial advisors do have tools which will take a general description of a portfolio and run monte carlo simulations based on the stock market 's historical behavior after about 100 simulation passes they can give a statistical statement about the probable returns the risk involved in that strategy and their confidence in these numbers   note that they do not just use the historical data or individual stocks there 's no way to guarantee that the same historical accidents would have occurred that made one company more successful than another or that they will again past performance is no guarantee of future results but general trends and patterns can be roughly modelled which makes that a good fit for those of us buying index funds less good for those who want to play at a greater level of detail in the hope of doing better but that 's sorta the point to beat market rate of return with the same kind of statistical confidence takes a lot more work

try using technical analysis look at the charts and look for stocks that are uptrending the of an uptrend being higher highs and higher lows use a stochastic indicator and buy on the dips down when the stochastic is in the oversold position below 20 and and crossing over about to turn back upwards or you can also use the stochastic to trade shares that have been ranging between two prices say between $ 10 and $ 12 for a while as the price approaches the $ 10 support and the stochastic is in oversold you would buy as the price rebounds off the $ 10 support and the stochastic crosses and starts back up as the price starts reaching the resistance at $ 12 with in overbought at above 80 you would look to sell and take profits if you were able to do short selling in the competition you could short sell at this point in time and make profits on the way up as well as on the way down there are many more techniques you could use to set up trade opportunities using technical analysis so it may be a subject you could research further before the begins good luck

this is largely dependent on your overall investment goals gic 's provide protection of the invested capital and a guaranteed return at the end of the term however in real terms 1.4 over 18 months results in a loss of capital in real terms this is because inflation in canada is just about at or higher than 1.4 per year in other words at best you are inflation and gaining nothing in those 18 months if their typical rate is 1.2 over 12 months you are only gaining an additional 0.2 for the additional 6 months you know as well as i do 0.2 for 6 months is abysmal if you have no use for the money in the medium to long term you should look in to an index fund that is balanced and diversified and more likely to get you a higher real return over the time period of a few years look in to if you want to preserve the capital over the short term because you might need it after the 18 months period the gic is the safer and recommended option

it might not be for first time payers but they do have programs some federal some local that help the poor and elderly complete their tax forms there are also programs that allow the poor to file electronically for free for most people the first time they file their taxes they are using the ez form which is rather easy to do even without the use of either web based or pc based software the software tools all ask enough questions on the ez forms to allow the user to know with confidence when their life choices have made it advantageous to use the more complex forms the web versions of the software allow the taxpayer to start for free thus reducing their initial investment for the software to zero because the first time filer is frequently a teenager the parents are generally responsible for proving that initial guidance   the biggest risk for a young taxpayer might be that the first year that itemizing deductions might be advantageous they might never consider it so they over pay or they discover in april that if they had only kept a receipt from a charity six months ago they could deduct the donation so they are tempted to   claim the donation without proof regarding and assistance there is an interesting tax credit the earned income tax credit it gives a tax credit to the working poor they alert people that they need to check your eligibility for the earned income tax credit they know that significant numbers of taxpayers fail to claim it eitc can be a boost for workers who earned $ or less in 2012    yet the irs estimates that one out of five eligible taxpayers fails to    claim their eitc each year the irs wants everyone who is eligible for    the credit to get the credit that they ’ve earned the rules for getting the credit are simple all the information needed to claim it is already on the basic tax forms but you have to know that you need a separate form to get the credit but instead of making the credit automatic they say if you use irs e file to prepare and file your tax return the    software will guide you and not let you forget this important step    e file does the work and figures your eitc for you and then   with irs free file you can claim eitc by using brand name tax    preparation software to prepare and e file your tax return for free    it 's available exclusively at irs.gov free help preparing    your return to claim your eitc is also available at one of thousands    of volunteer income tax assistance sites around the country to find    the volunteer site nearest to you use the locator tool on    irs.gov but if you do n't use free file you might never know about the form apparently it escapes 20 of the people who could claim it

as a lefty mixed emotions i guess on the one hand i think the criminal justice system is far more harsh on minor crime like some poor guy stealing $ 500 than crime that really impacts a lot of people and involves much larger sums for a variety of reasons so it 's sort of interesting to see a white collar criminal actually being taken seriously for once   on the other hand i 'm not a fan of the united states 's ridiculous obsession with people for long periods of time in some other countries sentences do n't even in most of scandinavia 15-year sentences are the maximum for any crime with a very rarely exception that allows the police to petition for someone 's release to be delayed if they would pose an imminent threat of violence upon release so in general i 'm against locking lots of people up just as revenge as opposed to because they would pose a real threat if they were not locked up i would also prefer to look first for alternative arrangements such as house arrest and monitoring and reserve prison only for really dangerous people where there is absolutely no possible alternative i 'm not sure stanford really counts in that category   so it basically boils down to by the standards of american criminal justice white collar crime is greatly under prosecuted relative to other crime but the standards of american criminal justice are bullshit and i 'm not sure locking up a bunch of white collar criminals is a good way to make up for the fact that we lock up too many petty criminals or even people doing things that should n't be crimes at all   the other somewhat different issue is that i think we need to go after systemic problems more than random individuals the system of finance is the real problem

first of all i agree with both the conclusion in the question and ’s answer avoid funds or stockmarket based instruments given the short timescale and need to draw an income however i think looking at savings accounts only is missing a trick at the moment there are several current accounts that pay > 2 interest on balances the size of which you ’re proposing the list of which accounts are offering which rates conditions at which point in time will vary so here is a link to a good source of regularly   updated information   there are some conditions but the best interest rate on offer that is n't limited to one year appears to be 3 much better than the leading instant access savings account

i do n't like reits because they are more closely correlated to the movement of the stock market they do n't really do the job of diversifying a portfolio because of that correlation   when the stock market dropped in 2008 reits were hammered as well because the housing bubble burst bonds went up and if you rebalanced sold the bonds to buy more stock then you came out much further ahead when the stock market recovered the point of adding bonds for diversification is that they move in the opposite direction of equities the major drops and providing buying opportunities reits do n't fit that bill reits are not undergoing a correction like bonds because the price of real estate is a function of housing supply and buyer demand rising interest rates only make it a little harder for buyers to buy so the effect of rising interest rates on real estate prices is muted the other effects on real estate prices more wealth in the economy for buyers pushes in the opposite direction of the rising interest rates

i am not going to argue the merits of investing in real estate i am a fan i think it is a great idea when done right   i will assume you have done your due diligence and your numbers are correct so let 's go through your questions point by point what would be the type of taxes i should expect   none you are a real estate investor and the us government loves you everything is tax deductible and odds are your investment properties will actually manage to shelter some of your job income and you will pay less taxes on that too   obviously i am exaggerating slightly find a cpa certified public accountant that is familiar with real estate but here are a few examples i am not a tax professional but hopefully this gives you an idea of what sort of tax you can expect    how is insurance cost calculated   best advice i have call a few insurance firms and ask them   you will need landlord insurance make sure you are covered if a tenant gets hurt or burns down your property you can expect to pay more for landlord insurance than regular insurance is not a bad number to just plug in when running numbers its probably high   also your lease should require tenants to have renters insurance to help protect you have a liability conversation with a lawyer and think about llcs    how is the house price increase going to act as another source of income   appreciation can be another source of income but it is not really that useful in your scenario   it is not liquid you will not realize it until you sell the property and then you have to pay capital gains and depreciation recapture on it   there are methods to get access to the gains on the property without paying taxes   this is done by leveraging the property you get the equity but it is not counted as capital gains since you have to pay it back a mortgage or home equity lines of credit heloc are examples of this   i am not recommending these just making sure you are aware of your options please let me know if i am calculating anything wrong but my projection for one year is about $ per house assuming no maintenance is needed i would say you estimated profit is on the high side   not being involved in your market it will be a wild guess but i would expect you to realize cash flow per house per year of closer to $ 7,000   maybe even lower given your inexperience   some costs you need to remember to account for taxes insurance vacancy repairs capex property management utilities lawn care snow removal hoa fees all in all expect 50 or your rental income to be spent on the property   if you do well you can be surprised

when buying investment properties there are different levels of passive investment involved   at one end you have those that will buy an investment property and give it to a real estate agent to manage and do n't want to think of it again apart from watching the rent come in every week at the other end there are those that will do everything themselves including knocking on the door to collect the rent where is the best place to be well somewhere in the middle the most successful property investors treat their investment properties like a business they handle the overall management of the properties and then have a team taking care of the day to day nitty gritty of the properties regarding the brand new or 5 to 10 year old property you are going to pay a premium for the brand new a property that is 5 years old will be like new but without the premium i once bought a unit which was 2 to 3 years old for less than the original buyer bought it at brand new also you will still get the majority of the depreciation benefits on a 5 year old property you also should not expect too much maintenance on a 5 to 10 year old property another option you may want to look at is defence housing they are managed by the department of defence and you can be guaranteed rent for 10 years or more whether they have a tenant in the property or not they also carry out all the maintenance on the property and restore it to original condition once their contract is over the pitfall is that you will pay a lot more for the management of these properties up to 15 or more personally i would not go for a defence housing property as i consider the fees too high and would not agree with some of their terms and conditions however considering your emphasis on a passive investment this may be an option for you

the best way to save on clothes is up to you   i have friends who save all year for two yearly shopping trips to update anything that may need updating at the time   by allowing themselves only two trips they control the money spent   bring it in cash and stop buying when you run out on the other hand in my family we shop sales   when we determine that we need something we wait until we find a sale   when we see an exceptionally good sale on something we know we will need basic work dress shoes for example we 'll purchase it and save it until the existing item it is replacing has worn out   our strategy is to know what we need and buy it when the price is right   we tend to wait on anything that is n't on sale until we can find the right item at a price we like which sometimes means stretching the existing piece of clothing it is replacing until well after its prime if you 've got a list you 're shopping from you know what you need   the question becomes how will you control your spending best   carefully shopping sales and using coupons or budgeting for a spree within limits

you should also consider what the cost of the put is especially if the strike price is set at the current price vs the average price delta of the security during the period between when you buy the put and the expiration date   also note the prices for puts on stocks with a lot of price volatility there are a good number of situations where you may come out behind if the stock stays the same price you are out the premium you paid for the put if the stock price rises less than the premium you are out the difference between the two if the stock price falls less than the premium you are out the difference between the two in order to be in the money when writing a protective put the stock has to either rise more than the premium you paid for the put and you must sell or hold and write off the expense of the put or the stock price has to fall below the strike price to a level lower   than the premium you paid and you must sell via the exercising the option and you 've protected yourself from a loss presuming you were going to sell and not hold and see if the stock recovers   and since selling is required in both cases if you 've held the stock less than a year then pay on any profits at short term rates taxed as regular income and if the price went down you ca n't claim any loss unless strike price was below your buy price and would still need to pay if you had a net gain and you likely ca n't deduct the price you paid for the put

first lets understand what convexity means convexity   convexity refers to non in a financial model in other    words if the price of an underlying variable changes the price of an    output does not change linearly but depends on the second derivative    or loosely speaking higher order terms of the modeling function    geometrically the model is no longer flat but curved and the degree    of is called the convexity okay so for us idiots this means if the price of abc we will call p is determined by x and y. then if x decreases by 5 then the value of p might not necessarily decrease by 5 but instead is also dependent on y is y who cares its not important for us to know we can understand what convexity is without knowing the math behind it so if we chart this the line would look like a curve clearly this is an over simplification of the math involved but it gives us an idea so now in terms of options convexity is also known as gamma it will probably be easier to talk about gamma instead of using a confusing word like is the convexity of options so lets define gamma gamma the rate of change for delta with respect to the underlying asset 's price so the gamma of an option indicates how the delta of an option will change relative to a 1 point move in the underlying asset in other words the gamma shows the option delta 's sensitivity to market price changes or gamma shows how volatile an option is relative to movements in the underlying asset so the answer is if we are long gamma convexity of an option it simply means we are betting on higher volatility in the underlying your case the vix really that simple well kinda to fully understand how this works you really need to understand the math behind it but yes being long gamma means being long volatility an example of being long gamma is a long straddle side note i personally do trade the vix and it can be very volatile you can make or lose lots of money very quickly trading vix options some resources what does it mean to be long gamma in options trading long gamma how to make a long gamma position work for you delta investopedia straddles strangles further reading if your interested even more reading

intrinsic value is a myth   there is no such thing   subjective human demand is the only thing that gives anything value   this subjectivity is different person to person and can change very quickly historically there are two main uses for gold jewelry and money   how can you tell when a particular type of money is undervalued   it disappears from circulation since people prefer to use money that is overvalued   this phenomenon is paraphrased in 's law bad money drives out good money the coinage act of established the us dollar as grains of silver or grains of gold   this established a government ratio of 15 ounces of silver to 1 ounce of gold   in the late 18th century there was a large production of silver from mexico and the market ratio of silver to gold increased to to 1 by   the government ratio however was still 15 to 1   this was enough incentive for people to exchange their silver coins for gold coins at the government ratio melt the gold and sell the gold bullion overseas at the market value   thus gold coins disappeared from circulation as people either hoarded the gold or sent it abroad   people used the overvalued silver coins i.e. the bad money domestically and gold coins disappeared from the market in an attempt to correct the problem of disappearing gold coins the coinage act of was enacted   it kept the us dollar at grains of silver but changed the definition to grains of gold which established a government ratio of 16 to 1   this was close to the market ratio of gold to silver at the time so both gold and silver coins appeared in circulation again   the gold rush of produced a lot of gold and the market ratio of silver to gold became to 1   now gold was overvalued so people began exchanging their gold coins for silver coins at the government ratio melt the silver and sell the silver bullion overseas at the market value   people used the overvalued gold coins i.e. the bad money domestically and silver coins disappeared from the market when you see gold circulating everywhere you will know it is overvalued compared to other types of money   paper money always drives gold out of circulation since the market ratio of paper to gold severely under values gold source here

is investing more money into a stock that you already have a stake in which has gone up in price a good idea what you describe here is a good idea when the stock keeps up trending the way to do it is say you have originally bought $ 1000 worth of shares then the next purchase you buy $ 500 worth then $ 250 worth it is called into your trades however this system would not be the best with simply a buy and hold when you keep holding even if the price starts you would need to have a trailing stop loss on your initial trade and then as you buy each additional trade your trailing stop loss would incorporate the additional trade and move to a level where if you get stopped out you will make an overall profit with each additional trade your trailing stop will move higher and higher for higher protected profits the whole point behind pyramid trading is to keep buying more of a stock that keeps performing well to increase your profits however each additional purchase is half the previous one so that you do n't eat too much into existing profits in the case of the uptrend reversing and so as to not on the one stock so you are using part of your existing profits in an attempt to make more profits

if by can we trust the analyst recommendations you mean are they right 100 of the time the answer is absolutely no   analysts are human and make mistakes some more than others   there are many stories of superstar managers that make for several straight years then have a few bad years and lose it all back however do n't take you ca n't trust them to mean that they are nefarious in some way while there may be some that recommend stocks for selfish purposes i suspect that the vast majority are just going off what information they have and ca n't predict market behavior or future performance with perfect accuracy   look at many analysts recommendations   do your own analysis if you 're still not comfortable buying individual stocks then do n't buy them   buy index funds if you are satisfied with market returns or other mutual funds if you want to invest in specific sectors   or at the very least make sure you are sufficiently diversified so that you do n't lose your entire investment by one bad decision   one rule of thumb is to not have more than 10 of your entire portfolio in any one company

i think this is off topic but here is a stab so these are cashless   it could be a way to smooth out the harsh reality of capitalism i my product i have more capacity than i can sell and i can trade those good to other capitalists who similarly poorly planned production or capacity therefore the market for a system like is limited to businesses that do not plan well   business that plan production or capacity to levels they can already sell for cash do not need a private system to offload goods alternatives to such a system include i do n't know how many businesses are really in this over production over capacity state   if my assumption that it is n't many is wrong my answer is garbage this is a bartering system with a brokerage   i think we have historically found that common currencies create more trade and economic activity because the value of the note in your pocket which is the same type of note in my pocket is common and understood   exchange rates typically slow down trade   there are many other reasons to have different currency or notes on a global sale but the exchange certainly is a hurdle to clear this brokerage is essentially adding a new currency in a grand metaphor   and that new currency is only spendable on their brokerage which is of limited use to society as a whole assuming that society as a whole is n't a participating member of that brokerage i ca n't really think of why this type of exchange is better than the current system we have now   i would n't invest in this as a business or invest in this as a person looking for opportunity

this answer is based on the us banking system if that is n't where you are please edit appropriately there are probably two places the thief could go to cash the check your bank the issuer 's bank third party banks are unlikely to want to cash a check drawn on a different bank for a payee who is n't their customer   so notifying both of these banks would be a good start also hopefully the thief does not look like you and wo n't be able to pass using your id   the thief will also have to forge your endorsement on the check if he goes to your bank they can check it against your signature which they have on file and hopefully it wo n't match   the issuer 's bank would n't notice that of course so read on even if the check is cashed you should ultimately be okay as i understand it   the issuer of the check still owes you the money he ca n't prove he 's paid you until he has the cancelled check or its image showing your valid endorsement   so he needs to give you another check eventually   this assumes the check was payment for a debt of some kind if it was a gift or some other sort of voluntary payment he could at this point change his mind and decide not to pay you after all the issuer should be okay too   if the check is cashed and debited from his account he should go to his bank and tell them the endorsement is forged   they may ask you to sign something where you state under penalty of perjury that the signature is n't yours   then they will re credit his account so that he can pay you again normally the bank   that cashed the check will be on the hook for the loss it was their responsibility to make sure they were paying the rightful payee and they failed in that responsibility   various procedural issues can shift that liability between banks but ultimately it should n't be either customer who suffers unless someone did something really negligent like not reporting the theft for months obviously this would all be much simpler if the issuer can call his bank right away and stop payment   this can be done over the phone or online so out of town should n't be an issue unless he is out in the woods or something   if he can talk to you he can talk to them

so here are some of the risks of renting a property plus the normal risk of losing your job health etc but those are going to be bad whether you had the rental or not so those are n't really a factor can you beat the average gain of the s&p 500 over 10 years   probably but there 's significant risk that something bad will happen that could cause the whole thing to come crashing down how many months can you go without the rental income before you ca n't pay all three mortgages is that a risk you 're willing to take for $ 5,000 per year or less    if the second home was paid for with cash and you could pay the first mortgage with your income then you 'd be in a much better situation to have a rental property   the fact that the property is significantly leveraged means that any unfortunate event could put you in a serious financial bind and makes me say that you should sell the rental get your first mortgage paid down as soon as possible and start saving cash to buy rental property if that 's what you want to invest in i think we could go at least 24 months with no rental income well that means that you have about $ 36k in an emergency fund which makes me a little more comfortable with a rental but that 's still a lot of debt spread across two houses    another way to think about it   if you just had your main house with a $ 600k mortgage and no heloc would you take out a $ heloc and buy the second house with a $ 200k mortgage

to answer the first part of your question yes i 've done that   i did even a bit more   i once had a job that i was n't sure i 'd keep and the economy was n't great either   in case my next employer would n't let me contribute to a 401(k from day one and because i did n't want to my retirement and be stuck with a higher tax bill i front loaded my 401(k contributions to be maxed out before the end of the year   the contribution limits were lower than $ back then as for the reduced cash flow you need of course a buffer account containing several months worth of living expenses to afford maxing out or front loading 401(k contributions   you should be paying your bills out of such buffer account and not out of each paycheck   as for the reduced cash flow i think large scale contributions can crowd out other long term saving   priorities such as saving for a house down payment and the trade off between them is a real concern   if they 're out basic and discretionary consumer expenses that 's a totally different kind of problem which you do n't seem to have which is great so about the trade off between large scale 401(k contributions and saving for the down payment   i 'd say maxing out 401(k can foster the savings culture that will eventually pay its dividends   if after several years of maxing out your 401(k you decide that saving for the house is the top priority you 'll see money flow to the money market account marked for the down payment at a substantial monthly rate thanks to that savings culture as for the increasing future earnings no   most people i 've known for a long time if they saved 20 when they made $ 20k year they continued to save 20 or more when they later made $ 100k year   people who spent the entire paycheck while making $ 50k year always say if only i got a raise to $ 60k year i 'd save a few thousand   but they eventually graduate to $ 100k year and still spend the entire paycheck   it 's all about your savings culture on the second part of your question yes roth is a great tool especially if you believe that the future tax rates will be higher to fix the long term budget deficits   so contributing to 401(k to maximize the match then max out roth as others suggested is a great advice   after you 've done that see what else you can do more 401(k saving for the house etc

for cross border transactions like this you should really take advice from an accountant or lawyer who specialises in them because there may be tax treaties between the two that complicate the situation however in general borrowing money does n't have tax implications in itself and there 's no limit as such you do need to consider the following points if this is zero or less than you could plausibly get commercially your friend is effectively giving you the difference between the interest rates if your friend in korea has a connection to the us she or he may be subject to the gift tax in practice this only matters if the total amount of gifts they give to anyone over their lifetime plus the size of their estate over their lifetime is large non us persons are exempt though if the amounts are large enough they may need to be reported financial institutions are generally required to report large international transactions typical thresholds are around $ 10,000 for scrutiny by the government in case the transaction is related to something illegal this should n't be a problem in itself but you should be aware it 'll happen it should n't make any difference how you transfer the money but it would be wise to get as much documentation as possible in case of later questions the best place to get further advice would be the us bank you 'll be transferring the money into initially this is really a question for a lawyer given the cross border nature of the transaction but you and your friend should sign a contract specifying how and when the loan will be repaid your friend should also consider setting up the loan as a mortgage and taking a charge on your home even if your friend trusts you a charge on the home will protect him or her in the event of you having financial problems and another creditor laying claim to the home

first note that cibc issued these bonds with a zero coupon so they do not pay any interest   they were purchased by the market participants at a small premium paying an average of for a nominal value of 100   this equates to a negative annual redemption yield of i.e. if held until maturity then the holder will witness a negative annual return of you ask why does this make sense   clearly it makes no sense for a private individual to purchase these bonds since they will be better off simply holding cash   to understand why there is a demand for these bonds we need to look elsewhere the european bond market is currently suffering a dwindling supply owing to the bond buying programme i.e. quantitative easing   the ecb is purchasing eur 80 billion per month of eurozone sovereign debt   this means that the quantity of high grade bonds available for purchase is shrinking fast against this we have all of those european institutions and financial corporations who are legally obliged to purchase bonds to be held as assets against their obligations   these are mostly national and private pension funds as well as insurance companies and fund managers    in this sort of environment the price of high quality bonds is quickly bid up to the point where we see negative yields in this environment companies like cibc can borrow by issuing bonds with a zero coupon and the market is willing to pay a small premium over their nominal value tl dr the situation is further complicated by the inflation outlook for the eurozone with a very real possibility of deflation   should a prolonged period of deflation then negative redemption yield bonds may provide a positive real return

i 'm hopeful that opinion based answers are acceptable in this context i 've been using ynab classic for some years i 've tried to keep all possible options open in the manner of individual items for budget allocation there does seem to be a number of emergency situations for which one would prefer to not dig into regular scheduled expenses having a large number of smaller funds give you flexibility in terms of categorizing your past emergencies this gives you a better view of future allocation of your funds perhaps freeing up money you might not have otherwise identified if you are using a program such as ynab classic i 'm not familiar with the current version you can easily transfer funds from one category to another as needed after all it 's merely numbers in a file not real money that would be otherwise inaccessible to summarize i think the smaller fund concept provides a better picture the big picture of the small stuff means greater flexibility and forecasting prior to the world of personal computers i had a piece of paper in my wallet it had every category i could devise representing every penny in my checking account and eventually grew into ynab but the concept remained the same all these decades

no even if you do n't need the additional salary income now you might be able to contribute the incremental amount over the roth max to either of the other two types of iras or maybe even something else you never want to take a lower salary especially not in exchange for something that is conditional e.g. benefits your salary is the only thing that is guaranteed as a condition of employment other things can be changed by the employer at a future point in time if you have two different job offers and the salaries are different that is a separate scenario you should make the decision based on overall comparison not just using roth limit contribution criteria

why do you keep going on about test results you do realise that the drug does n't last very long in the system and as explained by the testimonies there were techniques to delay blood testing until it was clear from the system such as ringing each other up telling them that testers are here and to say out on the track for longer or to dope more often at night when testers were n't around or to simply not answer your door when testers came around   and yes there were was a test result i do n't remember which year exactly that when tested at the time was found to have no drugs but that s because the drug he used was n't by any method the blood was later on when they did have a method to test for it and they did find it in his system   let 's say i have a gun which disappears into thin air after firing i use it to kill a person in a room full of people nobody sees me directly firing the gun but i do manage to use it to kill someone and the gun disappears police search everyone including me for a gun but find no gun they find that i had motive but again no gun now a week later 26 of my one of them who was the person who manufactured this magical gun own up to the police and confess how i was able to do what i did would n't it be stupid of me to argue you never found a gun on me after the murder therefore i 'm innocent   the gun is like the drug it disappears after use with the drug it 's not so instant but still disappears fairly quickly with regards to the blood testing frequency therefore do you not see how it is stupid to say no positive test results therefore it 's evidence he never used drugs again i 'll reiterate it incase you still do n't understand it of the drug disappears quickly from the blood

if you are able to buy a 150 k home for 50 k now that would be a good deal   however you ca n't you have to borrow 100 k in order to make this deal happen   this dramatically increases the risk of any investment and i would no longer classify it as passive income    the mortgage on a 150 k place would be about 30 year fixed   reasonably i would expect no more than in rent or   a good rule of thumb is to assume that half of rental revenue can be counted as profit before debt service   so in your case 7200 but you would have a mortgage payment of   leaving you a profit of after debt service   this is like 2 k per year   things in the financial world tend to move toward an equilibrium the benefit of rental property you can make a lot more than the numbers suggest   for example the home could increase in value and you can have fewer than expected repairs   so you have two ways to profit   rental revenue and asset appreciation however you said that you needed passive income   what happens if you have a vacancy or the tenant does not pay   what happens if you have greater than expected repairs   what happens if you get a fine from the hoa or a special assessment   not only will you have dip into your pocket to cover the payment you might also have to dip into your pocket to cover the actual event in a way this would be no different than if you borrowed 100 k to buy dividend paying stocks   if the fund company does not pay out that month you would still have to make the loan payment   where does the money come from   your pocket   at least dividend paying companies do n't collect money from their shareholders yes you can make more money but you can also lose more   leverage is a two edged sword and rental properties can be great if you are financial able to absorb the shocks that are normal with ownership

my problem with your argument is the idea that we make a decision and reap the benefits sometime in the near and measurable future   where as the actual outcome of our decision may not be realized until many other decisions are made afterwards thus making the number of permutations very high   while i agree there tend to be people who can make better or more informed decisions given a situation i think you give them entirely too much credit given the long run possibilities of outcomes   my ultimate point being no matter who you are you are limited to being able to consider so many steps ahead or combinations at a single time   and there are certainly people who make bad choices but get good outcomes and vice versus   since we do n't see one person or a specific model for making decisions i have to believe that one simply does not exist   so call it luck or informed decisions i think at a certain point people make decisions and reap the rewards of those decisions independently   maybe more often than not the informed win but there have been plenty of smart people out there with brilliant models and ideas that go down in flames   likewise i 've meet some pretty dumb people who happen to be at the right place at the right time and turn the right knob   not sure i was clear in explaining my point its been a long day

paying off your mortgage early being good is a myth   it is great for the chronic to have their mortgage paid off so when they rack up credit card bills and get behind well they still a place to stay but for those who are more logical with their money paying off your mortgage early in current conditions makes no sense   you can get a 30 year loan well below 4   discounting taxes for your average family you would have a rate floating below 3    so reasons that paying off your mortgage should be almost last given current low long term interest rates the first thing you should do is take care of any high interest debt   i would say that anything more than 7 8 including all credit card debt should be focus 1 putting money into your retirement savings is 1   you will earn way more than 3 over the long run   you can earn a higher return in the market   even with a very conservative portfolio you can clear 5 6 which will still clear more than 3 after taxes for those who say you ca n't be sure about the market well if the market did bad for 30 years in a row no one will have money and the house will also be worthless if a disaster happens to your house and you own it your money is gone   in many cases you would be able to declare bankruptcy and let the bank take the property as is    there are just too many examples but if you are paying off your house early you lose the flexible liquid money that you now have tied up in the house now the reasons for paying down your mortgage are really easy too you do n't trust your spending habits you want to move up in houses and you want to make sure that you have at least 20 down on future house to skip pmi

because so many businesses make some money through some form of compound interest like a business that saves its earnings in a business account that pays interest it heavily depends on how strict you interpret this law   some muslims i know interpret it to mean directly and indirectly while for some it 's just direct interest earned what i would suggest is either a direct investment in agriculture or a share in agriculture where you are directly paid from your share in the investment and not through money that comes from a bank account earning interest   if you do a direct investment in agriculture like owning livestock you will be paid money in the form of food which compounds through reproduction and can sell the offspring to others and collect the money   year to date agriculture is crushing the s&p 500 and many places around the world are facing shortages in food like sugar and corn if you do n't have enough money for a direct investment you can try the share route where you own a share of a direct investment   rather than go through stock exchanges where many of these companies make money indirectly through interest also you can negotiate directly with farmers livestock owners etc   some of these individuals are looking to diversify their money so they may be willing to let you own a fraction of what they produce and pay you directly all of this comes with risk of course   livestock and plants die for a variety of reasons but none of it will be interest from lending whether to individuals or through a bank   in addition if we experience very high inflation in the future livestock and plants do very well in this environment

i will solely address your fear because from what i read you fear investing in something that could possibly go down in the future   this is almost identical to market timing so let 's use the spy as an example   look at the spy on yahoo finance specifically in 2011   the market experienced a little bit of a pull back during the year and some analysts claimed that it would fall below 600 read this   in fact a co worker of mine said that he feared buying the s&p 500 in 2011 as well as in 2010 so he bought gold compare the two from 2011 to now to put it bluntly he experienced 50 less gain than i did did the s&p 500 ever fall below 600 in that timeframe or according to the linked analyst there were plenty of similar predictions then   no   if you avoid doing something because you 're afraid it could drop technically you should be just as afraid of it rising fear of losing everything vs. fear of missing out both are real   that 's not to say invest out of fear but that fear cuts both ways and generally we only look at it from one side retirement investing should be a boring automated process where ideally we do n't try and time the market though some will try and like in 2011 fail   if you ca n't help your fear you can always approach retirement investing with automated re balancing where you hold some money in less risky forms and others in higher risk forms and automate a rebalance every month or quarter

i think it 's worth pointing out explicitly that the biggest difference between a credit card us canada and a debit card like your french carte de is that with a credit card it 's entirely possible to not pay the bill or to pay only the minimum payment when asked this results in you owing significantly more money due to interest which can snowball into higher and higher levels of debt and end up getting rapidly out of control this is the reason why you should always pay off the entire balance every month as to in the other answers it 's not uncommon to find people in the us with thousands of dollars of debt they ca n't pay off from misuse of credit cards

how is the money the fdic has collected fees collected from the banks the fdic receives no congressional it is funded by premiums that banks and thrift institutions pay for deposit insurance coverage and from earnings on investments in u.s. treasury securities they also use the proceeds from liquidating the assets of failed banks to make payouts are there country specific agencies with a similar mission canada deposit insurance corporation para la al mexico financial services compensation scheme uk not quite like the fdic you 'll have to search for others yourself most importantly are there any examples of a similar system that has failed as the say failure is always an option    there is a statement on fdic 's website to the effect that they are backed by the full faith and credit of the u.s. government that said the fdic maintains its own fund to make insurance payouts granted in the of the 2008 2009 financial crisis they did start waving a red flag about their realistic ability to cover their obligation practically speaking the government will likely step in if necessary this 2008 article regarding a revamp of the uk 's fscs should be of general interest to you on this topic though it does not answer the question of failed systems   well as far as i know   i have only skimmed the article

aiui this is not terribly abnormal there are sometimes to as pending charges or holds and actual charges an authorisation reserves money but does n't actually take it normally what happens when you pay by card is that the merchant gets an authorisation immediately then some time later the authorisation is converted into an actual charge when the merchant takes the money sometimes merchants are slow in taking the actual charge either deliberately some merchants wo n't charge your card until they actually supply the goods to reduce the chance of having to process a refund or because of administrative somewhere when this happens the authorisation can time out before the actual charge is taken so you get the pattern you see first the authorisation appears then it times out and and finally the actual charge shows up

during world war ii the united states us instituted wage and price controls   to attract better employees companies would offer benefits to get around salary limits   health insurance was one of the more successful benefits    at that time income taxes were newer and there were many ways to evade them   companies could generally deduct expenses   so at that time health care was deductible because everything was   and at that time only wages were taxable compensation from employer to employee    since that time many other benefits have become non deductible for employers e.g. housing or the reduced deduction for meals and entertainment   but health care is generally regarded as different as a necessity   while everyone needs to eat not everyone needs to eat at a $ 100 a meal restaurant   people who need expensive health care really need it   people who eat expensive food just prefer it    and of course health care is more intermittent where food is relatively consistent   you do n't need ten thousand calories one day and zero the next   but some families have no health care expenses in a year while another might have cancer or a pregnancy   note that medical care expenses can be deducted for individuals if they are large enough in aggregate and you itemize    and of course both businesses and workers have incentives to maintain the current system with deductibility   health insurance is a common benefit   housing is not although it 's worth noting that travel housing and meals are deductible   so there have been few people impacted by making housing taxable while many people would be impacted by taxable health insurance    you can deduct health insurance costs if self employed   it 's also not true that health insurance is the only benefit with preferential tax treatment   retirement and child care are also deductible   even meals and housing can be deducted in certain circumstances   the complex rules about what and how much is deductible    there have been about the tax treatment of health insurance and medical care but there is a lot of opposition   insurance companies oppose making all healthcare expenses deductible as that reduces their effective benefit   they would prefer only insurance premiums be deductible   traditionally employed individuals oppose making health insurance taxable as that would increase their taxes   so the situation persists   there is n't quite enough support to move in either direction although the current compromise is economically silly

i just linked some studies i did n't want to waste my time to go through everything when you 're so brainwashed you 'll never agree   truth is you have no studies that say otherwise that are peer reviewed there is n't much data on it but here 's some more   there is now a large body of evidence to support the persistence of neurocognitive impairment lasting from hours to weeks it is important to note that in repeated studies subjects who reported a marijuana high were most likely or most profoundly affected by the drug this supports the link between thc concentration and neurocognitive dysfunction residual effects however continued in subjects who no longer felt the drug 's effect thus subjective return to baseline mental status may not ensure full return of neurocognitive    considerable research into the functional and judgment effects of marijuana smoking has been conducted in the context of transportation safety research demonstrates that acute cannabis consumption is associated with an increased risk of a motor vehicle crash and especially for fatal

you can be sued if some random stranger that you never had any interaction with gets in an accident there is really no barrier to people suing you if they get it in their head that they want to winning that lawsuit is another matter entirely   whether you would be held liable and lose the lawsuit depends on whether someone can convince a court that you are partially responsible for a financial loss not sure how anyone could possibly successfully argue that in this situation

i was involved with them a couple years back it seemed like a utopia but i could n't seem to get it off the ground i just recently found some disturbing info on the top tier of leaders that let me breath a sigh of relief that i am no longer involved although i would n't straight up tell you no i would ask that you really use some due diligence and make a very informed decision look up in google and browse there quite a few people that were successful had and do n't have very good things to say so it 's not shallow criticism they 're out quite a few of them were high enough up the ladder that i had even seen them do open meetings and seminars

i was in that same situation years ago with my parents one way she could apply for a loan in her name without her parents is if she is not currently living with them she should n't need them to cosign if she does n't have bad credit but if she is n't living with them and they are n't financing her room and board they ca n't claim her as a dependent so if she really wants to stick it to them she can go and try to politely explain how the loans work and tell them if they do n't cosign for her then she will apply on her own which she can only do while not living with them i believe but not sure and they will have to stop claiming her as a dependent on their taxes if they do n't agree she can put her foot down and force them to stop claiming her and tell them she will file her own application anyway and if they continue claiming her and get in trouble for it it 's their own fault cause she warned them to stop first they may agree to cosign rather than lose her as a dependent if it makes that big of a difference on their taxes if they do n't then she can forcefully punish them financially and their taxes will go up those were my choices when my parents refused to cosign for me to live at school but that was back in 1999 2000 and things may have changed since then things also change state by state and i live in pa

communicate i would recommend taking a course together on effective communications and i would also suggest taking a course on budgeting and family financial planning you need to be able to effectively communicate your financial plans and goals your financial actions and learn to both be honest and open with your partner   you also need to be certain that you come to an agreement the first step is to draft a budget that you both agree to follow   the following is a rough outline that you could use to begin   there are online budgeting tools and a spreadsheet where you can track planned versus may better inform your decisions depending upon your agreed priorities you may adjust the following percentages essentials < 50 of net income financial > 20 lifestyle < 30 this is your discretionary income where you spend on the things you want certain expense categories are large and deserve special advice try to limit your housing costs to 25 of your income unless you live in a high cost rent area where you might budget as high as 35 limit your expenses for vehicles below 10 of income and expensive vehicle might be budgeted partly from lifestyle limiting your auto payment to 5 of your income may be a wise choice when possible some families spend $ 200 300/month on cable tv and $ 200 300/month on cellphones these are lifestyle decisions and those on constrained budgets might examine the value from those expenses against the benefit dining out can be a budget and those on constrained budgets might consider paying less for convenience and preparing more meals at home an average family might spend 8 10 of their income on food once you have a budget you want to handle the following steps many of the steps are choices based upon your specific priorities

well not over 50 i would want a very very simple flat rate tax say around 25 30 with a high personal allowance say around $ 25k and no tax breaks etc this seems to be the fairest low incomes pay the least and the rich are taxed fairly but not to the extent they feel the need to avoid it

a large number of bond holders decide to sell their bonds   if they all decide to do this at the same time then there will be a large supply of bonds being sold in the market   this will drive down the price of the bonds which will increase yields why do bond yields move inversely to bond prices you purchase a $ 100 bond today that yields 5   you spent $ 100   the very next day the same bonds are being sold with a yield of 10   if you wanted to sell your bond to someone you would have to sell it so it competed with the new bonds being sold   you could not sell it for $ 100 which is what you paid for it   you would have to sell it for less than the $ 100 you paid for it in order for it to have the equivalent yield of the new bonds being sold with a 10 yield   this is why bond yields move inversely to bond prices why does rising yields increase the cost of borrowing if someone is trying to sell new bonds they will have to sell bonds that compete with the yields of the current bonds already in the market if yields are rising on the existing bonds then the issuer of the new bonds will have to pay higher interest rates to offer equivalent yields on the new bonds the issuer is now paying more in interest making it more expensive to borrow money what are the incentives for the bond to sell his her bonds one reason a bond holder will sell his her bonds is they believe inflation will outpace the yield on the bond they are holding   if a bond yields 3 and inflation is at 5 then the bond holder is essentially losing purchasing power if they continue to hold onto the bond   another reason to sell would be if the bond holder has doubts in the ability of the issuer to repay the interest and/or principal of the bond

i 've had a mf stock advisor for 7 or 8 years now and i 've belong to for a couple of years i also have money in one of their mutual funds the fool has a lot of very good educational information available especially for people who are new to investing many people do not understand that wall street is in the business of making money for wall street not making money for investors   i have stayed with the fool because their philosophy aligns with my personal investment philosophy i look at the stock advisor picks sometimes i buy them sometimes i do n't but the analysis is very good they also have been good at tracking their picks over time and writing updates when specific stocks drop a certain amount with their help i 've assembled a portfolio that i do n't have to spend too much time managing and have done pretty well from a return perspective stock advisor also has a good set of forums where you can interact with other investors   in summary the view from the inside has been pretty good from the outside i think their marketing is a reflection of the fact that most people are n't very interested in a rational conservative approach to investing in the stock market so mf chooses to go for an approach that gets more traffic i 'm not particularly excited about it but i 'm sure they 've done ab testing and have figured out what way works the best i think that they have had money back guarantees on some of their programs in the past so you could try them out risk free not sure if those are still around

there are at least a couple problems    your friend may not manage money well and so may not have enough money in the account   check bounces   they get charged a fee   you get charged a fee   you have to chase after the friend to get the fee paid   the friend was cheap about the regular fees and does n't want to pay this much higher fee    your friend may really be a crook   the check is no good   perhaps it 's written under a false identity such that you are attempting to cash a stolen forged check   you cash it   they take the money and disappear   you get charged with participating in the crime go to jail and now have a criminal record worst case    my quick thought is that if you do n't know the person well enough to know the home address you do n't know the person well enough to cash checks    in general i would view this the same as a loan   when loaning to a friend you should never loan more than you are willing to lose   note that an actual loan would be safer   if you loan $ 50 to a friend at worst you 're out $ 50   if you deposit a fraudulent check you did something illegal   you will have to be convincing when you tell your story to the police   if they do n't believe you they could charge you   a couple bad breaks and you could go to jail

watch out for po financing a lot of those contracts have nasty terms like i agree that scam capital will be my sole source of credit for the next 2 years that can get in the way of using bank debt or credit cards they may even tell you otherwise to get you to sign but they are the payday lenders of the business world    it can be great when it works but there are a lot of shark men while you can grow your company on po financing understand that those companies exist to suck all the profit out of small non innovative companies who needed a hand and their terms reflect that    if your business is that good maybe you can get someone to buy in instead the second benefit to this is that if things go tits up then you do n't have any personal guarantee you will likely have to guarantee po financing in most parts of the country
