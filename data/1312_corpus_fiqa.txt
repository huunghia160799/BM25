risk is the capital you have in pursuit of profit the danger is that you lose what you have risked   for some bets risks you can get insurance to cover for losses   now the game of landlord and tenant requires you to play fully by the rules set forth by your legislators in your case that is the legislators of the state of texas without knowing those rules you could be liable open to civil prosecution for violating those rules tenants could be savvy to those rules or savvy enough to hire someone a lawyer who knows those rules as well in the game of landlord and tenant you must ascertain the creditworthiness of your would be tenant if the tenant fails to pay rent that tenant can the residence you will incur additional outlays to gain possession of your property ownership in your rental now the game of landlord vs landlord is different you ca n't pick up houses easily enough and even if you could likely the expense of doing so could wipe out any would profits from having the house as a rental so in landlord vs landlord you get constrained by where your rental sits thus you must forecast what will the neighborhood look like in five ten fifteen years

rather than thinking of becoming a landlord as a passive investment like a bank account or mutual fund it may be useful to think of it as starting a small part time business while certainly many people can and do start their own businesses and there are many success stories there are many cases where things do n't work out quite as they hoped i would n't call starting any new business low risk even one that is n't expected to be one 's main full time job though some may be acceptable risk for your particular circumstances but if you 're going to start a part time business is there any particular reason you 'd do so in real estate as opposed to some other activity it sounds like you 'd be completely new to real estate so perhaps for your first business you 're starting you 'd want it to be something you 're more familiar with or if you do want to enter the real estate world or any other new business be sure to do a lot of research come up with a business plan and be prepared for the possibility of losing money as with any investment or new business

based on what you 've said i think buying a rental is risky for you it looks like you heard that renting a house is profitable and zillow supported that idea vague advice + a website designed for selling + large amounts of money = risky at the very least that does n't mean that rental property is super risky it just means that you have n't invested any time into learning the risks and how you can manage them once you learn that your risk reduces dramatically in general though i feel that rental property has a good risk reward ratio if you 're willing to put in the time and energy to learn the business then i 'd encourage you to buy property if you 're not willing to do that then rentals will always be a crap shoot one thing about investing in rental property is you have the ability to have more impact on your investment than you do dropping money in the stock market which is good and bad

if you are able to buy a 150 k home for 50 k now that would be a good deal   however you ca n't you have to borrow 100 k in order to make this deal happen   this dramatically increases the risk of any investment and i would no longer classify it as passive income    the mortgage on a 150 k place would be about 30 year fixed   reasonably i would expect no more than in rent or   a good rule of thumb is to assume that half of rental revenue can be counted as profit before debt service   so in your case 7200 but you would have a mortgage payment of   leaving you a profit of after debt service   this is like 2 k per year   things in the financial world tend to move toward an equilibrium the benefit of rental property you can make a lot more than the numbers suggest   for example the home could increase in value and you can have fewer than expected repairs   so you have two ways to profit   rental revenue and asset appreciation however you said that you needed passive income   what happens if you have a vacancy or the tenant does not pay   what happens if you have greater than expected repairs   what happens if you get a fine from the hoa or a special assessment   not only will you have dip into your pocket to cover the payment you might also have to dip into your pocket to cover the actual event in a way this would be no different than if you borrowed 100 k to buy dividend paying stocks   if the fund company does not pay out that month you would still have to make the loan payment   where does the money come from   your pocket   at least dividend paying companies do n't collect money from their shareholders yes you can make more money but you can also lose more   leverage is a two edged sword and rental properties can be great if you are financial able to absorb the shocks that are normal with ownership

buying a property and renting it out can be a good investment if it matches your long term goals   buying an investment property is a long term investment   a large chunk of your money will be tied up with the property and difficult to access   if you put your money into dividend producing stocks you can always sell the stock and have your money back in a matter of days this is not so with a property but you can always do a home equity line of credit heloc i would also like to point out landlording is not a passive endeavor as johnfx stated dealing with a tenant can be a lot of work   this is not work you necessarily have to deal with it is possible to contract with a property management company that would place tenants and take care of those late night calls   property management companies often charge 10 of your monthly rent and will eat a large portion of your profits   it could be worth the time and headache of tenant relations   you should build property management into you expenses anyway in case you decide to go that route in the future there are good things about owning an investment property   it can produce returns in a couple of ways if you choose this route it can be lucrative but be sure to do your homework   you must know the area you are investing very well   know the rent and vacancy rates for single family homes look at multifamily homes as a way of mitigating one unit is vacant the others are still paying

i have been a landlord in texas for just over 3 years now i still feel like a novice but i will give you the benefit of my experience if you are relying on rental properties for current income versus a long term return you are going to have to do a good job at shopping for bargains to get monthly cash flow versus equity growth that is locked up in the property until you sell it   if you want to pull a lot of cash out of a property on a regular basis you probably are going to have to get into flipping them which is decidedly not passive investing also it is easy to underestimate the expenses associated with rental properties texas is pretty landlord friendly legally however it does have higher than usual property taxes which will eat into your return also you need to factor in maintenance vacancy tenant turnover costs etc it can add up to a lot more than you would expect if you are handy and can do a lot of repairs yourself you can increase your return but that makes it less of a passive investment the two most common rules i have heard for initially evaluating whether an investment property is likely to be cash flow positive are the 1 and 50 rules the 1 rule says the expected monthly rent needs to be 1 or greater of the purchase price of the house so your hypothetical $ k scenario does n't pass that test some people say this rule is 2 for new landlords but in my experience you 'd have to get lucky in texas to find a house priced that competitively that did n't need a lot of work to get rents that high the 50 rule says that the rent needs to be double your mortgage payment to account for expenses you also have to factor in the hassle of dealing with tenants the following are not going to happen when you own a mutual fund but are almost inevitable if you are a landlord long enough for whatever reason you have to go to court and evict a tenant a tenant that probably lost their job or had major medical issues the tenant you ever met with the kids in the world that you are threatening to make homeless every fiber of your being wants to cut them some slack but you have a mortgage to pay and ca n't set an expectation that paying the rent on time is a suggestion not a rule or the tenant who seemed nice at first but now considers you the man decides to fight the eviction and wo n't move out you have to go through a court process then eventually get the sheriff to come out and forcibly remove them from the property which they are treating like crap because they are mad at you all the while not paying rent or letting you re let the place the tenant is n't maintaining the lawn and the hoa is getting on your butt about it do you pay someone to mow the grass for them and then try to squeeze the money out of the tenant who never agreed to pay for that   you rent to a college kid who has never lived on their own and has adopted you as their new parent figure the light in the closet went out can you come replace the bulb tenants flat out lying to your face of course i do n't have any pets that i did n't pay the deposit for pics all over facebook of their kids playing with a dog in the pet free house

in a well managed company employees bring more dollars to their employers than the employers pay the employees salary and benefits   employees trade potential reward for security a regular paycheck   employers take on the risk of needing to meet payroll and profit from the company 's income minus expenses the potential rewards are much higher as an employer self or otherwise so the ones that do make it do quite well   but this is also consistent with your other statement that the reverse is not true the risk of self employment is high and many self employed people do n't become millionaires

property sold at profit is taxed at capital gains rate if you held it for more than a year which you have based on your previous question thus deferring salary wo n't change the taxable amount or the tax rate on the property it may save you the 3 difference on the salary but i do n't know how significant can that be the 25 depreciation recapture rate or whatever the current percentage is is preset by your depreciation and can not be changed so you 'll have to pay that first whatever is left above it is capital gains and will be taxed at discounted rates 20 iirc you need to make sure that you deduct everything and capitalize everything else all the non deductible expenses and losses with regards to the property for example if you remodeled its added to your basis reduces the gains if you did significant improvements and changes the same if you installed new appliances and carpets they 're depreciated faster you can appropriate part of the sale proceeds to these and thus reduce the actual property related gain also you need to see what gain you have on the land the land can not be depreciated so all the gain on it is capital gain your cpa will help you investigating these and maybe other ways to reduce your tax bill do make sure to have proper documentation and proofs for all your claims do n't make things up and do n't allow your cpa cut corners it may cost you dearly on audit

regardless of what the credit reporting agencies or brokerages say the fact is that brokerage margin is not reported to the credit reporting agencies i have borrowed hundreds of thousands of dollars on margin from dozens of brokerages over the years and have never seen a dime of it reported nor have i ever heard of it ever being reported for someone else   and it 's easy to see why this would be so because borrowing on margin is n't really borrowing at all because you always must have positive equity in the account at all times so you are n't borrowing anything you just have an investment contract that determines your gains losses as if you had borrowed in other words it 's simulated

i am a believer in stocks for the long term i sat on the s&p right though the last crash and am 15 below the high before the crash   for individual stocks you need to look more closely and often ask yourself about its valuation the trick is to buy right and not be afraid to sell when the stock appears to be too high for the underlying fundamentals before the dotcom bubble i bought motorola at $ 40 sold some at $ 80 $ 100 and out at $ 120 coworkers who bought in were laughing as it went to $ 160 but soon after the high tech bubble burst and my sales at $ 100 looked good in hindsight the stock you are looking at would you buy more at today 's price if not it may be time to sell at least some of that position

yes quite easily in fact   you left a lot of numbers out so lets start with some assumptions if you are at the median of middle income families in the us that might mean $ 15 of that is an investment of $ per month if you invest that amount monthly and assume a 6 return then you will have a million dollars at approximately 57 years old 6 is a very conservative number and as ben miller points out the s&p 500 has historically returned closer to 11 if you assumed an aggressive 9 return and continued with that $ for 40 years until you turn 65 that becomes $ 4 million start with a much more conservative $ 9/hr for $ per year 40 hours 52 weeks no overtime if that person saved 14 of his her income or about $ per month from 25 to 65 years old with the same 9 they would still achieve $ 1 million for retirement is it much harder for a poor person certainly but hopefully these numbers illustrate that it is better to save and invest even a small amount if that 's all that can be done high income earners have the most to gain if they save and the most to lose if they do n't let 's just assume an even $ salary and modest 401(k match of 3 even married filing jointly a good portion of that salary is going to be taxed at the 25 rate if single you 'll be hitting the 28 income tax rate   if you can max out the $ 18,000 2017 contribution limit and get an additional $ 3,000 from an employer match for a total monthly contribution of $ 40 years of contributions would become $ million with the 9 rate of return   if you withdrew that money at 4 per year you would have a residual income of $ 300k throughout your retirement

think about it this way if the strike price is $ 200 and cost of the option is $ 0.05 $ 200 + $ 0.05 is $ that does not mean that the price of buying the option is more neither is the option writer going to pay you $ 70 to buy the contract   when you are buying options you can only have a limited downside and that is the premium that you pay for it   in case of the $ 115 contract your total loss could be a maximum of $   in case of the $ 130 contract your total loss could be a maximum of $ this is due to the fact that the chances of aapl going to hit $ 130 is less than the chance of aapl hitting $ 115 therefore option writers offer the lower probability contracts at a lower price   long story short you do not pay for the strike price you only pay the premium and that premium keeps getting lower with and increase in strike decrease if it is a put option strike price is just a number that you expect the stock or index to break i would suggest you to read up a little more on pricing from here

start the process by contacting the company that services the mortgage they can answer all your questions they should have a form that needs to be submitted you will want to get from them the most up to date payoff amount x days from now the amount changes each day they will be sending you a document that the debt has been met they will also be filing paperwork with the county city releasing the property from the mortgage obligation   because all my mortgage payoffs have either been or refinancing or i have sold the property the balance due was significant and the lender required a cashiers check contact them to ask if it only a few thousand left they might take a regular check sending the checks via overnight delivery speeds up the process and cuts down on the uncertainty of the delivery date ask for a return receipt so that you have proof of the date it was received overpay by a couple of days they will refund the overage if you let the mortgage run its course you will still get a document back from them they will still file the documents with the local government and they will refund any overage if you look at the coupon book or the paperwork they gave you at settlement the last payment is usually a different amount due to rounding of the monthly payments   of course if you have been making extra payments or larger than required payments the numbers on the original coupon book are moot so contact the company for the last payment amount

yes eligibility for contributing to a roth ira is determined by your modified adjusted gross income magi which is based on your adjusted gross income agi now agi includes the net capital gains from your transactions and magi adds back in things that were subtracted off e.g. tuition deductions foreign earned income exclusion in arriving at the agi there is a worksheet in publication 590 that has the details you are always entitled to contribute to a traditional ira the magi affects how much of your contribution is tax deductible on that year 's tax return but not your eligibility to contribute   both the above paragraphs assume that you have enough compensation wages salary self employment income to contribute to an ira the contribution limit is $ 5500 or total compensation whichever is smaller if you earned only $ 2 k as wages you can contribute all of it not just your take home pay which is what is left after social security and medicare taxes federal taxes etc have been withheld from that $ 2 k if your entire income is from capital gains and stock dividends you can not contribute to any kind of ira at all

the answer to your question is no your credit rating is the way creditors let each other know whether you are in a good position and have a strong tendency to repay your debts not whether you are an easy target for making money on interest and penalties associated with failing to repay debts in full   the fact that you make your payments on time will definitely not lower your credit rating while the banks are not making as much money on you as they would if you carried a balance they are also not spending a lot of money on you nor losing a lot of money on people like you failing to repay debts   the transactions charged to the retailers cover the costs of operating your card and then a little bit   that is enough to make you worth keeping as a customer   they are happy with your arrangement the formula for credit rating computation is proprietary but we know what the factors are overall   making payments on time consistently is a positive not a negative factor   however they do look at the number of cards and overall mix of cards and other types of debt   for example if you have a very large amount of credit capacity in your cards and no mortgage that could possibly be a negative   if you have opened some of those accounts recently it could be a negative   if you have a larger number credit cards than they think is good that could be a negative there are other things as well that could be bringing your score down   probably worth it to take a look if you want to get an idea of what factors are adding positively and negatively to your credit score i 'd encourage you to visit creditkarma.com or another source intended to help you understand and improve your credit rating

kid you need to start thinking in thresholds there are several monetary thresholds that separate your class from a more well funded class 1 you can not use margin with less than $ 2000 dollars brokers require that you have at least $ 2000 before they will lend to you 2 in 2010 congress banned under 21 year olds from getting access to credit unless they get cosigned this means that even if you have $ 2000 no broker will give you margin unless you have a good credit history already there was a good reason for this but its based on the assumption that everyone is stupid not the assumption that some people are objective thinkers 3 the brokers that will open an account for you have high commissions the commissions are so high that it will destroy any capital gains you may make with your $ 1000 for the most part 4 the pattern day trader rule you can not employ sophisticated risk management while being subject to the pattern day trader rule it basically limits you from trading 3 times a day its more complicated than that read it yourself if you have less than $ 25,000 in one account 5 non trade or stock related investments buy municipal or treasury bonds they will give you more than a savings account would and are tax free this is n't exactly what i would call liquid though ie if you wanted to access your money to invest in something else on a whim 6 what are you studying if its anything technical then you might get a good idea that you could risk your money on to create value but i would stick to high growth stocks before blowing your $ 1000 on an idea that s not exactly what i would call access to capital 7 arbitrage lets say you know a friend that buys the trendy collectors shoes at discount and sells them for a profit he might do this with one $ 200 pair of tennis shoes and then use the $ 60 profit different to go buy video games for himself if he wanted to scale up he could n't because he never has more than $ 200 to play with in comparison you could do 5 pairs $ 200 x 5 and immediately have a larger operation than him making a larger profit $ 60 x 5 = $ 300 now you have $ 1300 and could do it again with 6 pairs to make an even great er profit not because you are better or worked at it but solely because you have more capital to start with keep an eye out for arbitrage opportunities usually there is a good reason they exist if you notice it the market is too small and illiquid to scale up with or the entire market will be saturated the next day efficient market theory learn about it 8) take everything i just taught you and make a small investor newsletter website with subscribers online sites have low overhead costs

to avoid having it become overly complicated i suggest it be run as would a mutual fund mutual funds transact each evening to set a price transactions for purchases or sales are done at that price each evening   initially you have a dollar amount invested for each person you can calculate the percent of the fund each has and assuming the total is under $ 10 k 7 digits after the decimal accuracy is enough to track each share to the 1/10 cent   when new money is added that night you calculate the exact value of investments and add the new funds so each person now has a smaller share of the larger fund   if you wish you can normalize this to share value so my initial investment of $ 1000 is 100 shares regardless of the total amount invested then when new money comes in the shares increase as well this may feel better as a declining percent may just seem awkward even though that 's the case

using fundamental and technical analysis together is actually a good idea for longer term trading of up to 6 months or longer   the whole idea behind trading with technical analysis is to increase the probabilities of a trade going in the desired direction by using uncorrelated indicators that produce the same signal to buy or sell at the same time for example you might use a moving average ma as a buy signal when the price falls for a few days hits the ma and then reverses and starts moving back up if however you also include a stochastic oscillator so to indicate when the stock is oversold under 20 and if the price rebounds from the ma average at the same time as the stochastic is crossing over in the oversold position then this may be a higher probability trade if you also only trade stocks that are fundamentally healthy as fundamentally good stocks are more likely to go up than fundamentally bad stocks then this might increase the probabilities again then if you only buy when the market as a whole is moving up then this will increase your chances again a few weeks ago at a seminar the the men in the room to be 76 and the women in the room to be 8 he then asked what will most likely be the next person to walk in the room a man or a woman the statistics are on the side of a wan walking in next this is what we try to do with technical analysis increase our chances when we take a trade of course a woman could be the next person to walk in the room just like any trade can go against you and this is why we use money management and risk management and take a small loss when a trade does go against you lets look at an example where you could incorporate fa with ta to increase your chances of profits   above is a candlestick chart of select harvest the green line above the price is the perceived value the pink line is the 40 day ma the blue line is the eps and the white lines is the stochastic oscillator above 80 being overbought and below 20 is oversold from feb 2015 to start of aug 2015 the stock was uptrending since then the price reversed and started to downtrend the stock was determined to be fundamentally good early in 2015 with the perceived value gradually increasing and greater than the share price and the eps starting to increase regularly from mid april thus as the stock is seen as fundamentally healthy any price reversal in the vicinity of the ma could be seen as a buy opportunity in fact there where 2 such opportunities on 31st march and 11th june where price had reversed and rebounded off the ma the so crossed over in or near the oversold area the price did reverse and then rebounded off the ma again on 9th july however the so was not in or near the oversold area on this occasion so not as high in probability terms the price still rebounded and went up again however another momentum indicator not shown here shows some bearish divergence in this case so another reason to possibly keep away at this point in time a good signal to get out of the trade that is your stop loss has not already taken you out is when the price breaks and closes below the ma line this occurred on 7th august so if we had bought on the first signal on 31st march for $ and sold when the priced broke through the ma on 7th august for $ we would have made a profit of approx 59 in just over 4 months if bought on the second signal on 11th june for $ 9.98 and again sold on 7th august for $ we would have made about 18 in under 2 months so the fundamentals the price in relation to ma and the so where all lining up to provide two high probability trades of course you would need to incorporate you risk management including stops in case the price did not continue upwards after you bought if the market is also moving up on the day of the signal this will further increase your chances   unless you day trade which i would avoid a good way to enter your trades after a signal is to enter a stop buy order after market close to buy if the price moves above the high of the signal day that way if the market and the stock open and move lower during the day after the signal you avoid entering the trade altogether this can be incorporated as part of your risk management and trading rules after the price broke down through the ma we can see that a downtrend which is still current today in fact i just took a short trade on this stock yesterday we can also see that the perceived value whilst still above the price has reached a peak and is currently moving downwards and the eps after being flat for a few months has just moved down for the first time in 10 months so maybe the fundamentals are starting to a bit on this stock it may be a good stock to continue shorting into the future so basically you can continue using fundamental analysis to select which stocks to buy place them in a watch list and then use technical analysis to determine when these stocks are starting to uptrend and use a combination of uncorrelated indicators to produce higher probability signals for when to enter your trades

whether an investment is pre tax is determined by the type of account i.e. tax advantaged vs ordinary taxable account but whether you can invest in individual stocks is determined by the provider i.e. the particular bank where you have the account   these are choices   if you want to invest in individual stocks you need to look for a bank that offers an ira/401k other tax advantaged account and allows you to invest in individual stocks with it   for example this page suggests that fidelity would let you do that   obviously you should look into various providers yourself to find one that offers the mix of features you want

cheapest is one thing   you can absolutely shop in the market and find the lowest possible price   i can think of three places to shop each with an up and downside i would think that what you really mean is the best price for the service   just like shopping for a car you have to decide what you need vs what is nice to have decide what features you need   do you need long distance   do you need caller i d   do you need to call friends and family find out what you have available to you through associations   often schools work or a club you belong to have deals for service discounts   look at your insurance plan or aaa membership for the crazy discounts decide what kinds of service will meet your needs buy the cheapest service do not enter a contract   even if the price is slightly lower   at least not at first   if you try out your service and love it enter the contract if and only if the total price measured over length of the contract is less   with cell phones especially it is absolutely possible to save money buying month to month vs a 2 year contract   even when you buy equipment for full price up front ask for the bare minimum service from your local phone company because phone companies are often regulated monopolies they might have a bare minimum level of service they are required to offer by the municipality   they probably do n't advertise it or push it but it might exist if you call and ask   you basically get a dial tone price is dictated by a government board so you do n't have to worry about shopping for deals not the cheapest possible solution this is popular plan the youth oriented market but more and more people of all demographics are using their cellphones only   there are downsides 911 etc and shopping for the best cell phone plan can be a full time job but it does offer a way to save money by simply not having home phone service might be possible to score organizational discounts through work or groups you belong to cellphones require batteries and can go dead not good for emergencies voice over internet protocol uses your existing internet connection   you can buy a cheap regular phone and plug it into the voip box and use it like any other phone   voip can either be very inexpensive for all the features you get or just plain inexpensive   there are providers who sell a monthly service yearly service or no service plan at all you buy a device and get service as long as you own the device   taxes to the government are always due so nothing is ever free sometimes the provider is just computer software so a minimalist would like that emergency services are more reliable than cellular if you follow extra steps to set them up can be confusing to buy   some require contracts some special devices some require a bit of technical know how to setup   be sure to evaluate the total cost of ownership when comparing prices

i would undoubtedly sell the investments if they are positive maybe even a little negative   that 's what non retirement investments are for building wealth to spend give etc flipping things may put it in perspective   would you borrow money or liquidate your emergency fund in order to invest in mutual funds if you can completely ignore risk then this may make sense let 's say if you could borrow money at 3.75 and had a guaranteed investment return of 7.5 and a guaranteed source of income job but mutual funds stocks bonds are n't even guaranteed to make money and they most definitely can lose and lose big also i hope your job is n't in any way tied to the oil industry on the other hand if you take a loan and fall on hard times you can liquidate your mutual funds to get out of the bind but you are at the mercy of the market and the worth of your investments at that point   so it may come down to whether you want to choose when to spend your investments when they are up or at some future date when they may be worth much less or much more

you should check the details of those balance transfers they typically have a 3 to 5 one time fee which means you pay nearly a year 's interest right away and then every time you transfer the total on again also this fee gets added to the credit card total and it is possibly considered paid last after you paid off the completed transferred balance so it cost interest for the whole time and that interest is different maybe 19.99 or worse it is probably a better idea to refinance for 5 years at < 3 and they pay off as fast as possible

no there are additional factors involved note that the shares on issue of a company can change for various reasons such as conversion redemption of convertible securities vesting of restricted employee shares conversion of employee options employee stock purchase programs share placements buybacks mergers rights issues etc so it is always worthwhile checking sec announcements for the company if you want an exact figure   there may also be multiple classes of shares and preferred securities that have different levels of dividends present for they filed a 10q on 22 april 2015 and noted they had shares outstanding of their common stock   they also noted for the three months ended march 31 2014 that dividends were paid to both common stockholders and preferred stockholders and that there were series a preferred stock 3 million and series b preferred stock 10 million plus a statement in february 2015 our board of directors authorized a share repurchase program of up to $ million of our outstanding common stock shares repurchased under these programs are accounted for as treasury stock carried at cost and reflected as a reduction to equity therefore the exact amount of dividend paid out will not be known until the next quarterly report which will state the exact amount of dividend paid out to common and preferred shareholders for the quarter

they are basically asking for the name of the legal entity that they should write on the check you as a person are a legal entity and so you can have them pay you directly by name this is in effect a sole proprietorship arrangement and it is the situation of most independent contractors you 're working for yourself and you get all the money but you also have all the responsibility you can also set up a legal alias or a doing business as dba name the only thing that changes versus using your own name is well that you are n't using your own name to be honest you pay some trivial fee for the paperwork to the county clerk or other office of record and you 're now not only john doe you 're enterprises and your business checks can be written out to that name and the bank who will want a copy of the dba paperwork to file when you set the name up as a payable entity on the account will cash them for you an llc since it was mentioned is a limited liability company it is a legal entity that is your in the business world it not you is the entity that primarily faces anyone else in that world you become for legal purposes an agent of that company authorized to make decisions on its behalf you can do all the same things make all the same money but if things go pear shaped the company is the one liable not you sounds great right well there 's a downside and that 's taxes and the increased complexity thereof depending on the exact structure of the company the irs will treat the llc either as a corporation a partnership or as a disregarded entity most one man llcs are typically disregarded meaning that for tax purposes all the money the company makes is treated as if it were made by you as a sole proprietor as in the above cases and with the associated increased fica and lack of tax deductions that an employee would get nothing can be retained by the company because as far as the irs is concerned it does n't exist so whether the money from the profits of the company actually made it into your personal checking account or not it has to be reported by you on the schedule c. you can elect if you wish to have the llc treated as a corporation this allows the corporation to retain earnings and thus to own liquid assets like cash as opposed to only fixed assets like land cars etc it also allows you to be an employee of your own company and pay yourself a true salary with all the applicable tax rules including pre tax healthcare employer paid fica etc however the downside here is that some money is subject to double taxation any monies retained by the company or paid out to members as dividends is profit of the company for which the company is taxed at the corporate rate then the money from that dividend you receive from the company is taxed again at the capital gains rate on your own 1040 return this also means that you have to file taxes twice once for the corporation once for you as the individual you ca n't of course have it both ways with an llc you ca n't pay yourself a true salary and get the associated tax breaks then receive leftover profits as a distribution and avoid double taxation it takes multiple members owners to have the llc treated like a partnership and there are specific types of llcs set up to handle investments where some of what i 've said above does n't apply i wo n't get into that because the question inferred a single owner situation but the tax rules in these additional situations are again different

a home actually is a terrible investment it has all the traits of something you would never want to plunge your hard earned money into the only way that buying a house makes good money sense is if you pay cash for it and get a really good deal it should also be a house you can see yourself keeping for decades or until you 're older and want something easier to take care of of course nothing can replace sense of ownership or sense of pride other than owning a house and your local realtor is banking really laughing all the way to the bank on your emotions overcoming your smart money savvy this post really goes to work listing all the reasons why a house is a horrible investment should be required reading for everyone about to buy a house why your house is a terrible investment tldr you must decide what is more important the money or the feelings but you ca n't have both if you read the article linked and still want to buy a house then you probably should

like you said it 's important to keep your personal assets and company assets completely separate to maintain the liability protection of the llc i 'd recommend getting the business bank account right from the beginning my wife formed an llc last year also as a pass through sole proprietorship for tax purposes and we were able to get a small business checking account from savings institute and trust that has no fees at least for the relatively low quantity of transactions we 'll be doing we wrote it a personal check for startup capital and since then the llc has paid all of its own bills out of its checking account with associated debit card getting the account opened took less than an hour of sitting at the bank without knowing exactly where you are in kentucky i note that googling kentucky small business checking and visiting a few banks web sites provided several promising options for no fee business checking

as a rule of thumb go in the order of proximity to the transaction this would typically mean side note i own a website that provides an online service that accepts paypal and credit cards via paypal and i personally have experience with all 3 of the above options i can tell you from the merchant 's point of view that i would also prefer the same order i 've had people contact my customer service department asking for a refund and we always immediately comply some people never contact us and just file a dispute directly with paypal and although refunding through the paypal dispute is just as easy as refunding directly it always makes me ask why did n't they just contact us first one time we had a customer skip us and paypal and filed a dispute directly with their credit card the cc company contacted paypal and paypal contacted us the process was the same from my point of view i just clicked a button saying issue refund but my $ 5 refund cost me an additional $ 20 due to the cc dispute now that i know this i will never approve a cc dispute again anytime one happens i would just issue a refund directly and then notify the dispute that their cc has already been refunded which should end the dispute

from a theoretical pov it 's in part due to beta beta is a measure of volatility compared to the market if the market returns 10 and the risk free is 5 then a company that has a beta 2 will have + 5 = 15 return usually it 's not that great a measure for individual stocks because of the lack of diversification eg if a company has a beta of 1 ie same expected returns as the market and then it has a really bad earnings report obviously is still going to go down even if the market is going up   fixed equation forgot to add rf back in

private companies often make the market for their own stock so they may offer to buy back so many shares a year give staff the option to sell stock back after so many years etc   but private companies can have their own restrictions they can for instance forbid secondary trading or explicitly limit voting stock to family members   ostensibly someone could sell a big chunk of a company for whatever price they wanted unless it was prohibited   for tax purposes irs will come after you if you get a bunch of value for less than you paid for   it is not an unheard of way to transfer wealth but a dollar probably just gift it but i 'm not a tax attorney    but is absolutely not the same kind of price transparency or price movement that you see in public stock you are correct larger private companies may have secondary markets that are still less transparent

first of all i 've raised vc money before so i have experience in this area the other commenter who said they 'll only cause trouble is wrong as a general statement some may but that just means you 've chosen your investors poorly choosing an investor is a very important decision and you should choose someone who you think will be able truly add value to your business rather than just someone who is willing to write a check cultural alignment is important and having a shared set of goals and timelines for the business is important    that said no one here is going to be able to tell you how to structure your deal because it varies so much based on the business in general i think it 's a good idea to only take money when you need it and have a solid plan for how you 're going to use it every time you take money you 're diluting your ownership and reducing your long term upside keep in mind that as the other commenter said if you take a deal now that means that you maintain 51 and then you take more money in the future that 51 will be diluted further that said with more investors in the mix you still are likely to be the largest shareholder but again that depends on how the deals are structured    my advice seek out as much advice from as many sources as you can and hire a good law firm to handle your financing transaction because their advice is invaluable as you negotiate terms finally you should have more conditions than just retaining 51 ownership there are a lot of terms that get baked into these deals that have an impact on the long term upside learn those terms do a bunch of googling and a bunch of reading and ask for more advice

depending on the size of the donation you may be able to reduce taxes further by donating appreciated assets such as stock or fund shares that have gone up a lot that lets you dodge the capital gains tax on redeeming the shares and if you 're donating to a tax exempt organization they do n't have to pay that tax either   and as @joetaxpayer has confirmed you still get to deduct the current value of the donation not just the basis value of those shares so if you 're donating anyway this comes close to being free money in exchange for some slightly annoying paperwork yet another benefit of long term investing of course folks in the top brackets sometimes set up their own tax exempt foundations so they can decouple taking the tax break from deciding what to do with the donation

if i am interpreting the information in your post correctly then you are completely correct that nycers is by no means worth it there is no dilemma here   in fact i think nycers a worse deal than you are giving it credit for nycers contribution costs you 6.2 of your total income because of the tax implication   the value of contributing to it is only the difference between what you can earn there and what you would earn in your 403(b   it 's not clear whether that is even a positive number   even if it is it is only some small percentage times your contribution amount which is 4.5 of your total income   the benefit of contributing to nycers is minuscule or even nonexistent   there is no way on earth that it makes up for your tax loss remember the 5 interest you get in nycers is that annually or total is compensation for the time value of money   it 's not as valuable as an immediate 5 gain on your contributions and nothing near as valuable as a 5 increase in your income   if you keep your money out of nycers then you can earn capital gains on it elsewhere like in your 403(b or in an ira when it comes to investing legally avoiding taxes is pretty much always top priority   choosing among investments is also important but not nearly as much   in your case the answer seems quite clear   stop contributing to nycers immediately

if you want an account statement from the irs listing the taxes due and paid and confirming a zero balance remaining you want what they call a tax account transcript it sounds like you tried to submit this online but yes it would require the actual taxpayer to submit it the other option would be to fill out form requesting the form 1040 tax account transcript have the taxpayer sign it and mail it in presumably whatever method you used to have her sign the form 1040 you prepared for her you could also use to have her sign the another option could be to try to request the transcript over the phone i do n't know what authentication they require or if you would need to have been listed on the 1040 as an authorized third party according to the irs transcript faq page what if i ’m unable to use get transcript by mail if you are unable to use get transcript by mail you may try our automated phone transcript service at 800 and also receive your transcript by mail please allow 5 to 10 calendar days for delivery but unless there 's a reason to think that the tax account was n't credited properly or the irs is sending another bill or the like i do n't think there 's a lot of point in doing so in general the fact that the check cleared the bank should be sufficient documentation that the amount was paid

historically the advice was to buy the best policy possible not cheapest at the lowest price with the highest benefit   the cost relative to the benefit is very cheap and your much more likely to use disability than life insurance for instance   it is usually cheaper to pay for it with after tax dollars than to buy more insurance in theory you want to buy enough disability to replace 100 of your after tax income or more since there is no inflation protection built into most policies   insurance companies often will not sell this due to moral hazard although you may be able to combine policies to reach 80 or so    keep in mind that you will need to continue to save invest if you are on long term disability since most policies cease payment at 65 or when your eligible for social security   in addition your expenses often rise due to the increased medical expenditures possibly needing cobra private health insurance etc

for it looks something like this   to make it a bit clearer let 's also plot the difference in net income for self employment and a single person company compared to employment   self employment is slightly worse between £ and about £ 10,500 because class 2 ni kicks in before the employed person starts paying any tax after that self employment is better because you pay 9 class 4 ni rather than 12 class 1 ni once higher rate tax kicks in the saving stops growing the single person company is most tax efficient at all points ignoring any accountancy costs it incurs strange things happen between £ 100k and about £ because the withdrawal of the personal allowance kicks in at a different point when receiving dividends we can also plot the percentage of income paid as tax for each case   the strange for self employment below £ 10k is caused by class 2 ni again employment and self employment both gradually tend towards paying 47 reaching for £ 2 m gross income the company tends towards reaching for £ 2 m gross income

what is the best way that i can invest money so that i can always get    returns if you want something that does n't require any work on your end consider having a fee only financial planner make a plan so that your investments can be automated to generate a cash flow for you or get an annuity as the other classic choices here as most other choices will require some time commitment in one form or other note that for stock investments there could be rare instances like what happened for a week in september in 2001 where the markets were closed for 5 days straight that can be the hiccup in having stocks bonds can carry a risk of default where there have been municipalities that defaulted on debt as well as federal governments like russia in the 1990s real estate may be subject to natural disasters or other market forces that may prevent there always being a monthly payment coming as if you own a rental property then what happens if there are n't tenants because there was an evacuation of the area there may be some insurance products to cover some of these cases though what if there are exceptionally high claims all at once that may have an insurance company go under would it be to set up an fd in a bank to buy land to buy a rental    house to buy a field or maybe to purchase gold   what investment of your own time do you plan on making here both in terms of understanding what your long term strategy is and then the maintenance of the plan if you put the money in the bank are you expecting that the interest rate will always be high enough to give you sufficient cash to live as well as having no financial crisis with the bank or currency you are using are there any better investments you may want to reconsider what assumptions you want to make and what risks you want to accept as there is n't likely to be a single solution here that would be perfect

couple quick s to help understand your situation a bit better are you currently in school and if so grad or undergrad undergrad opens up a whole different world of formal recruiting than you would get otherwise it sounds like you already graduated if so how many years out are you further out the much harder it 's going to be without going back to get an mba or msf your other option is being in the top 1 5 of your career but like has been said you still ca n't get into financial consulting it do companies like pwc cognizant and accenture would be better    if you 're more than 5 years out of undergrad without an mba it is going to be extremely difficult i break in no less with the firms you mentioned mckinsey is a lot like goldman in some cases the acceptance   rate from recruiting can be more difficult than harvard you 're going up against extremely intelligent hard working individuals who are trained in strategy consulting through degrees be prepared for this and no matter what you 're doing networking is going to be key to getting in so start now people you meet at these companies can help you more with that    also what in particular you about consulting also what kind of consulting ie biz dev strategy financial it due diligence govt etc you need to understand that before doing a search there are major differences between each of them    not trying to he a just a realist if say for example i did a basic programming course and really enjoyed it i would n't immediately apply to google and google would expect me to be formally trained by more than just reading programming books it 's not much different with very high end consulting and easily just as competitive as getting into a google i hope this helps    hopefully with a reply i can help a little more not saying it ca n't be done just difficult depending on where you are in your career path

i 'm just trying to visualize the costs of trading say i set up an account to trade something forex stock even bitcoin and i was going to let a random generator determine when i should buy or sell it if i do this i would assume i have an equal probability to make a profit or a loss your question is what a would call an ill posed problem   it makes it a challenge to answer   the short answer is no   we will have to consider three broad cases for types of assets and two time intervals let us start with a very short time interval   the bid ask spread covers the anticipated cost to the market maker of holding an asset bought in the market equal to the opportunity costs over the half life of the holding period   a consequence of this is that you are nearly guaranteed to lose money if your time interval between trades is less than the half life of the actual portfolio of the market maker   to use a dice analogy imagine having to pay a fee per roll before you can gamble   you can win but it will be biased toward losing now let us go to the extreme opposite time period which is that you will buy now and sell one minute before you die   for stocks you would have received the dividends plus any stocks you sold from mergers   conversely you would have had to pay the dividends on your short sales and received a gain on every short stock that went bankrupt   because you have to pay interest on short sales and dividends passed you will lose money on a net basis to the market maker   maybe you are seeing a pattern here   the phrase market maker will come up a lot now let us look at currencies   in the long run if the current fiat money policy regime holds you will lose a lot of money   deflation is not a big deal under a commodity money regime but it is a problem under fiat money so central banks avoid it   so your long currency holdings will depreciate   your short would appreciate except you have to pay interest on them at a rate greater than the rate of inflation to the market maker finally for commodities no one will allow perpetual holding of short positions in commodities because people want them delivered   because insider knowledge is presumed under the commodities trading laws a random investor would be at a giant disadvantage similar to what a chess player who played randomly would face against a grand master chess player   there is a very strong information asymmetry in commodity contracts   there are people who actually do know how much cotton there is in the world how much is planted in the ground and what the demand will be and that knowledge is not shared with the world at large   you would be fleeced can i also assume that probabilistically speaking a trader can not do    worst than random say if i had to guess the roll of a dice my    chance of being correct ca n't be less than a physicist a con man a and a statistician would tell you that dice rolls and coin are not random   while we teach fair coins and fair dice in introductory college classes to simplify many complex ideas they also do not exist   if you want to see a funny version of the dice roll game watch the 1962 japanese movie   it is an action movie but it begins with a dice game    consider adopting a bayesian perspective on probability as it would be a healthier perspective based on how you are thinking about this problem   a frequency approach always assumes the null model is true which is what you are doing   had you tried this will real money your model would have been falsified but you still would n't know the true model yes you can do much worse than of the time   even if you are trying to be fair you have not accounted for the variance extending that logic then for an inexperienced trader is it right to    say then that it 's equally difficult to purposely make a loss then it    is to purposely make a profit because if i can purposely make a loss    i would purposely just do the opposite of what i 'm doing to make a    profit so in the dice example if i can somehow lower my chances of    winning below it means i would simply need to bet on the    other 5 numbers to give myself a better than 83 chance of winning if the game were fair but for things like forex the rules of the game are purposefully changed by the market maker to maximize long run profitability   under us law forex is not regulated by anything other than common law   as a result the market maker can state any price including prices far from the market with the intent to make a system used by actors losing systems such as to trigger margin calls   the prices quoted by forex dealers in the us move loosely with the global rates but vary enough that only the dealer should make money systematically   a fixed strategy would promote loss you are assuming that only you know the odds and they would let you profit from your percentage chance of winning so then is the costs of trading from a purely probabilistic point of    view simply the transaction costs no matter what my chances can not    be worse than random and if my trading system has an edge that is    greater than the percentage of the transaction that is transaction    cost then i am probabilistically likely to make a profit no the cost of trading is the opportunity cost of the money   the transaction costs are explicit costs but you have ignored the implicit costs of foregone interest and foregone happiness using the money for other things you will want to be careful here in understanding probability because the distribution of returns for all of these assets lack a first moment and so there can not be a mean return   a modal return would be an intellectually more consistent perspective implying you should use an all or nothing cost function to evaluate your methodology

while there certainly are many specific predictions that have proven completely wrong the fundamental complaint is that the structure of our economy is unsustainable with the prediction that this will eventually be revealed in a terrible way   simply pointing out that the day of reckoning has been off for the immediate future does nothing to address or the actual complaint   for example we 've been some 40 years now without a catastrophe attributable to global warming should that be taken as indicative that the fundamental logic that predicts an eventual catastrophe is a load of bunk   should the reasonable advance prediction requirement be harder for economics than for a hard science

primerica 's primary value proposition is that switching from whole or universal life to term life and investing the difference is a good idea for most people however there are a number of other important factors to consider when purchasing life insurance and i would also be wary of anyone claiming that one product will be the best for you under all circumstances best insurance without getting into a much larger discussion on how to pick insurance companies or products here are a few things that concern me about primerica they have a captive sales force meaning their agents sell only primerica products this means that they are not shopping around for the best deal for you given how much prices on term life have changed in recent years i would highly recommend taking the time to get alternate quotes online or from an independent broker who will shop around for you their staff are primarily part time employees i am not saying they are incompetent or do n't care just that you are more likely to be working with someone for whom insurance is not their primary line of work if you have substantial reason to believe that you may someday need whole life their products may not suit you well primerica does not offer whole life as far as i am aware which also means that you can not convert your term life policy through them to whole life should you need to do so for example if you experience an accident are disabled or have a significant change in your health status in the future and do not have access to a group life policy you may be unable to renew your individual policy above average returns i am also highly skeptical about this claim the only possible context in which i could find this valid would be if they mean that your returns on average will be better if you invest in the stock market directly as compared to the returns you would get from the cash value portion of a life insurance product such as universal life as those types of products generally have very high fees can you clarify if this is the claim that was made or if they are promising returns above those of the general stock market if it is the latter run only a handful of superstar investors think warren buffet peter lynch and bill gross have ever consistently outperformed the stock market as a whole and typically only for a limited period of time in either case i would have the same concerns here as stated in reasons 1 and 2 above even more so than with insurance if you need investment advice i 'd recommend working with someone who is fully dedicated to that type of work such as a fee only financial planner is a good place to find one once you know how you want to invest i would again recommend shopping around for a reputable but inexpensive broker and compare their fees with primerica 's kudos on having a healthy level of skepticism and listening to your gut also remember that if you are not interested in their offer you do n't have to prove them wrong you can simply say no thank you best of luck

the ponzi madoff schemes were closed loops so the only source of the so called interest on the money was the contributions of future investors the economy is more like a living thing and the availability of capital allows people to develop new ways to do things in a more productive way agriculture is a great example for most of human history the overwhelming majority of human labor was dedicated to producing food now that proportion is dramatically smaller the descendants of farmers 100 years ago are doctors and computer programmers professions that could not exist fractional reserve banking makes the economy more efficient by putting capital that would otherwise be hoarded in circulation money is a medium of exchange so the more it turns over the better it is and britain pioneered this concept centuries ago and were able to defeat larger rivals in large part because of the economic advantages that the practice brought to bear   that 's not to say that banking does n't come with its as well i 'd suggest reading a free nation deep in debt which does a good job of explaining how we got to where we are today

in general billed amounts do n't mean a whole lot since if the provider has a contract with the insurance company usually called in network the insurance company picks what the rates are that the treatment should cost and how that cost gets allocated between what the insurance company pays and what the patient pays due to that contract the insurance company and provider should agree on how much the patient owes and one should n't pay a provider more than what the insurance company says you should on the other hand some insurance plans have a level of out of network coverage in that case the insurance company has its same sense of what the treatment should cost but is really only concerned with paying its share the then should show how much they pay but will generally show the full billed amount minus their payment as the amount the patient owes that is since there 's no contract between the provider and the insurance company the insurance company has no way to stop the provider from balance billing you for whatever they want beyond the amount that the insurance is paying since any payment amount is purely a transaction between you and the provider in general as with anything involving large amounts of money it 's best to get all you can in writing the provider should be able to provide you with a statement showing zero remaining due and including both any payment you 've made to them and any payments made by the insurance company it may take a while for the payment from the insurance company to be processed and until it does there may be something on the statement showing estimated amount to be paid by insurance which is n't as comforting as one showing actual amount paid by insurance and zero due

if you buy a long term bond with long term fixed interest rate and then the interest rates increase your bond is worth less that 's not a problem because over the years the value of the bond will go back to its nominal value if you have a bond that does n't pay out annually but increases its value every year you will get exactly the amount of cash when it pays out that you expected   the problem is that if for 20 years interest rates were 8 while your bond only paid 4 then you will have such an amount of inflation that the cash you get is worth much less than you hoped you may have hoped that your bond would be worth one year average salary but it may be only worth six months of average salary even if the dollar amount is exactly what you expected

the main disadvantage is that interest rates are higher for the interest only loan it 's higher risk to the bank since the principal outstanding is higher for longer   according to the new york times interest rates are usually an to a half percentage point higher than on fully amortized jumbo loans they 're also tougher to qualify for and fewer lenders offer them again due to the risk to the bank since you can always put extra towards the principal strictly speaking these are the only   downsides the upside of course is that you can make a lower payment each month the question is what are you doing with this if this is the only way you can afford the payments there 's a good chance the house is too expensive for you you 're not building equity in the home and you have the risk of being underwater if the house price goes down if you 're using the money for other things or you have variable income it might be a different story for the former reinvesting in a business you own might be a reason if you 're cognizant of the risks for the latter salespeople on commission or financial industry types who get most of their income in bonuses can benefit from the flexibility

what is the point of this ca n't i achieve the exact same effect and    outcome by exchanging currency now and put that amount of usd in a    bank account to gain some interest then make the payment from one    year from now this is for companies not individuals companies usually take loans because they think they can make more money e.g. 10 than the interest on the loan e.g. 5 putting money on a bank account to earn interest there would give them even less e.g. 1 so with your option instead of earning 10 interest they 'd earn 1 interest if the cost of the currency forward is less than these 9 difference the forward saves them money if they have excess cash and they do n't know how to invest that money your option may be preferable simple numbers chosen for simplicity not accuracy

what your are talking about is price controls   the us of a has used price controls several times in the past   there was a maximum wage you could pay workers   so employers offered extra benefits such as medical and paid leave   to 1973 the nixon administration set the price of gas   this helped cause an oil shortage   we see lots of price controls in the form of rent control   not allowing rent prices to go up does n't give incentive to housing developers to build more housing   the problem with prices controls is they do n't tell consumers to stop consuming   say if there is a war and the military need all the metal it can get   by allowing the price of cars and other metal products to go up in price   the people will not buy as many cars and fix up what they have freeing up metal to be used on tanks also the metal producers will make more money from higher prices and re invest their profits to make more metal for tanks and a very few expensive cars   but if prices did not increase the people will buy cars like normal and the government will try to used up the metal on tanks   the price of metal is the same so metal producers wo n't make much extra profit as such wo n't be able to re invest in expanding their production   the biggest example of price fixing was the soviet union   but if we look just under the hood there was long lines and shortages all throughout the soviet union   as soviet planners tried to make prices correct for each product based on many number of variables such as man hours and needs   but no mathematical equation seemed to work   the gave up and used the prices out of the sears catalog for some products like shoes   if you want to good read on the subject this is a really good article

note that the series you are showing is the historical spot index what you would pay to be long the index today not the history of the futures quotes it 's like looking at the current price of a stock or commodity like oil versus the futures price   the prompt futures quote will be different that the spot quote if you the history of the prompt future you might notice the more how do you determine when to roll from one contract to the other many data providers will give you a time series for the prompt contract history which will automatically roll to the next expiring contract for you   some even provide 2nd prompt etc time series   if that is not available you 'd have to query multiple futures contracts and them based on the expiry rules which should be publicly available also is there not a price difference from the contract which is expiring and the one that is being rolled forward to yes since the time to delivery is extended by ~30 days when you roll to the next contract but yet there are no sudden price in the charts well there are but it could be indistinguishable from the normal volatility of the time series

i work at a mid market investment bank and while we do n't usually use required rates of return when we do it 's typically in ranges based on previous experience in the market e.g. pe firms will look at irr of on deals etc i can offer some insight into how you can think about it    required rate of return is a fairly arbitrary concept and literally is whatever you define it to be typically the required rate of return is a function of risk i.e. the higher the riskiness of a project the higher the return must be to compensate you for taking on that risk this view is as per markowitz 's modern portfolio theory this is easier said than done however as risk is tricky to define the general though somewhat outdated rule is that risk = variability of returns   to your questions   1 how is rate of return determined in my field of work fairly niche required rate of returns are n't usually an exact science and are typically based on i financial leverage in the business ii operating risk seasonality management team strength etc iii type of security e.g. for debt deals what is the investment secured by   2 am i correct in thinking a firm will just choose a rate of return that they are already receiving no you are not correct unless the risk profile of the investment opportunity matches your current business e.g. if you 're a shoe manufacturer earning 15 on your capital and are looking to acquire another manufacturer in the same business with the same risk profile then you can use your current rate of return as the requirement if for e.g. you 're a shoe manufacturer contemplating opening a new fully automated plant which will cost half your current net worth but allow you to triple your production you will need to use a different higher required rate of return to compensate your firm for the additional risk it 's taking on e.g. if your shiny new plant only gets you a 15 return you might as well deploy your capital in your current business at a much lower risk and earn the same amount of money    disclaimer i have simplified significantly

there 's many concrete answers but there 's something circular about your question the only thing i can think of is that phone service providers ask for credit report when you want to start a new account but i am sure that could be worked around if you just put down a cash deposit in some cases so now the situation is flipped you are relying on your phone company 's credit   who is to say they do n't just walk away from their end of the deal now that you have paid in full    the amount of credit in this situation is you just have to eat the risk and rely on their credit because you have no credit it does n't matter how much money you have $ 10 or $ 10000 can be out of you equally well if you must always pay for future goods up front you also ca n't use that money month by month now even in low risk investments although they will do exactly that and keep the interest and i challenge your assumption that you will never default you are not a being you live on planet earth ever had to pay $ 125,000 for a treatment because you got a rare form of cancer well you wo n't be able to default on your phone plan and pay for your drug or food if you bankrupt yourself on the drug because your money is already gone i know you asked a simpler question but i ca n't write a good answer without pointing out that no default is a bad model it 's like doing math without a zero element by the way this is realistic it applies to renting in say new york city it 's better to be a tenant with credit who can withhold rent in issue of neglected maintenance or gross unfair treatment than a tenant who has already paid full rent and has left the landlord with little market incentive to do their part

the answer depends on this if you had to hire someone to do what you are doing in the s corp what would you pay them   if you are doing semi unskilled work part time then $ 20k might be reasonable   if you are a professional working full time it 's too low   do n't forget that in addition to billable work you are also doing office tasks such as invoicing and bookkeeping that the irs will also want to see you getting paid for there was an important court ruling on this subject recently watson v. commissioner   watson owned an s corp where he was the sole employee   the s corp itself was a 25 owner in a very successful accounting firm that watson worked through   all of the revenue that watson generated at the accounting firm was paid to the s corp which then paid watson through salary and distributions   watson was paying himself $ 24k a year in salary and taking over $ a year in distributions   for comparison even first year accountants at the firm were making more than $ 24k a year in salary   the irs determined that this salary amount was too low   to determine an appropriate amount for watson 's salary the irs did a study of the salaries of peers in firms of the same size as the firm watson was working with taking into account that owners of firms earn a higher salary than non owners   the number that the irs arrived at was $   watson was allowed to take the rest $ each year as distributions again this number was based on a study of the salaries of peers   it was far short of the $ 200k+ that the s corp was pulling in from the accounting firm   clearly watson was paying himself far too low of a salary   but even at this extreme example where watson 's s corp was directly getting all of its revenue from one accounting firm in which watson was an owner the irs still did not conclude that all of the revenue should have been salary and subject to payroll taxes you should ask an accountant or attorney for advice   they can help you determine an appropriate amount for your salary   do n't be afraid of an audit but make sure that you can defend your choices if you do get audited if your choices are based on professional advice that will help your case   see these articles for more information

a roth ira is simply a tax sheltered account that you deposit funds into and then invest however you choose within the limits of the firm you deposit the funds with for example you could open a roth ira account with vanguard   you could then invest the $ 3000 by purchasing shares of voo which tracks the s&p 500 index and has a very low expense ratio 0.04 as of last time i checked   fidelity has a similar option or schwab or whatever brokerage firm you prefer iras are basically just normal investment accounts except they do n't owe taxes until you withdraw them and roth do n't even owe them then though you paid taxes on the funds you deposit   they have some limitations regarding options trading and such but if you 're a novice investor just looking to do basic investments you 'll not notice    then your ira would go up or down in value as the market went up or down in value you do have some restrictions on when you can withdraw the funds roth ira has fewer than a normal ira as you can withdraw the capital the amount you deposited without penalty but the profits can not be withdrawn until you 're retirement age i wo n't put an actual year as i suspect that actual year will change by the time you 're that old but think 60s the reason not to invest in an ira is if you plan on using the money in the near future even as an emergency fund   you should have some money that is not invested aggressively that is in something very safe and very accessible for your emergency fund and if you plan to buy a house or whatever with the funds do n't start an ira   but if this is truly money you want to save for retirement that 's the best place to start note this is not investment advice and you should do your own homework prior to making any investment   you can lose some or all of the value of your account while investing

not illegal with respect to littleadv response the printing of a check is n't illegal i can order checks from cheap check printers and they have no relationship to any bank so long as they have my routing number and checking account number they print   years ago 25 + i wrote my account details on a shirt in protest to owing the irs money and my bank cashed it they charged a penalty of some nominal amount $ 20 or so for non standard check format or something like that but in fact stupid young person rants aside you may write a check out by hand on a piece of paper and it should clear the missing factor is the magnetic ink but i often see a regular check with a strip to the bottom when the mag strip fails proving that bad ink will not prevent a check from clearing   so long as the person trying to send you the funds is n't going to dispute the transaction and the check is made out to you so i suppose they could n't even do that this process should be simple i see little to no risk so long as the image is n't intercepted along the way

there are two ways to handle this the first is that the better brokers such as charles schwab will produce summaries of your gains and losses using historical cost information as well as your trades on a monthly and annual basis these summaries are ready made for the irs more brokers will provide these summaries come 2011 the second is that if you are a frequent trader see irs rulings for what constitutes one then they 'll allow you to use the net worth method of accounting that is you take the account balance at the end of the year subtract the beginning balance adjust the value up for withdrawals and down for and the summary is your gain or loss a third way is to do all your trading in say an ira which is taxed on distribution not on stock sales

a market crash wo n't affect your cash held with your broker however if the broker defaults goes bankrupt you may lose some or all of that cash if you read the customer agreement that you signed when opening the account it 's very likely that there 's a clause that stipulates that under certain circumstances the broker has the right to use your cash and/or your positions without notice if the broker default you may not be able to recover the assets they 've been using as an example look at clause 14 of the interactive brokers us customer agreement this is a fairly standard clause depending on your jurisdiction you may have a partial or full legal protection against such an event e.g. the sipc protection for us based brokers which would apply to you if your broker is ib llc even if you are not a us resident citizen

this is my disclaimer that this is not financial advice but i would imagine a decent amount of high growth tech will go into the toilet also that are heavily reliant on the low cost of short term capital but really these are just some intuitive guesses it would really depend on what the mechanism and impact of a future recession would be    curious though why do you personally think a recession is looming i know there 's been a lot of talk but per the vix investors worries do n't appear to be affecting their behavior too much at least in equities    i think the big risk is the fed not being able to control the yield curve i.e if short term rates increase but the fed ca n't or wo n't shrink the balance sheet enough to impact long term rates just an idea

tax questions require that you specify a jurisdiction   assuming that this is the us you owe federal income tax at the special long term capital gains tax rate on the net long term capital gains total long term capital gains minus total long term capital losses and so yes if these two were your only transactions involving long term holdings you would pay long term capital gains tax on $ = $   many states in the us do n't tax long term capital gains at special rates the way the federal government does but you still pay taxes on the net long term capital gains i suspect that other countries have similar rules

so one approach would be purely mathematical look at whichever has the higher interest rate and pay it first another approach is to ignore the math since the interest savings difference between a mortgage and student loan is likely small anyways and think about what your goals are   do you like having a student loan payment   would you prefer to get rid of it as quickly as possible   how would it feel to cut the balance in half in one shot if it were me i would pay the student loan as fast as possible student loans are not or and once you get it paid off you can put that payment amount toward your house to get it paid off

is it difficult to ask the credit card issuer for two cards even if the account belongs to one person you can most definitely get two cards for one account people do it all the time you just have to add her on as an authorized user   would it be better for me to apply for the card on my own or would there be an advantage to having her co sign it depends if she co signed then that means she is also responsible for the credit card payments which can help her credit score if its is just you applying then you are the only one responsible if you do n't want her lower credit score to impact what you could be approved for then only you should apply however if you are the sole account holder then you are responsible for the payments which means if in the event you guys break up and she maxes out the card before you cancel it then you are on the hook for what she spend   as for improving her credit score i do know that some banks report to the credit bureaus for the authorized user as well so that could help her out too

i 've done this in az it 's important to know which lender is foreclosing because if it 's not the most senior one then your purchase can later be foreclosed a foreclosure all junior interests but can itself be extinguished by a more senior interest i may not have the correct terms here but you get the idea you should also check to be sure property taxes are current they are probably being paid by the original lender but it would n't hurt to check make sure you understand the requirements for participation in the auction in my case they required that i bring a $ 10 k cashier 's check made out to myself on winning the auction i endorsed the check over to the auction company and had to come up with the remaining funds in cash the property i bought had been previously sold at a sheriff 's sale to satisfy a judgment in favor of the homeowner 's association for delinquent dues the hoa bought the property at the auction and received a sheriff 's deed at this point the original owner 's interest in the property was extinguished nevertheless the original mortgage and deed of trust were still in place being senior to the hoa 's interest about a year later the lender foreclosed on the property and i bought it at auction at the courthouse this had the effect of the hoa 's interest a fact that took some explaining to the water utility to get the account in my name

there are two ways that mortgages are sold the loan is collateralized and sold to investors this allows the bank to free up money for more loans of course sometime the loan may be treated like in the game of hot potato nobody want s to be holding a shaky loan when it goes into default the second way that a loan is sold is through the servicing of the loan this is the company or bank that collects your monthly payments and handles the disbursement of escrow funds some banks lenders never sell servicing others never do the servicing themselves once the servicing is sold the first time there is no telling how many times it will be sold   the servicing of the loan is separate from the of the loan when you applied for the loan you should have been given a servicing disclosure statement servicing disclosure statement requires the lender or mortgage    broker to tell you in writing when you apply for a loan or within the    next three business days whether it expects that someone else will be    servicing your loan collecting your payments the language is set by the us government we may assign sell or transfer the servicing of your loan while the    loan is outstanding or we do not service mortgage loans of the    type for which you applied we intend to assign sell or transfer the    servicing of your mortgage loan before the first payment is due or    the loan for which you have applied will be serviced at this    financial institution and we do not intend to sell transfer or    assign the servicing of the loan instructions to preparer insert    the date and select the appropriate language under servicing transfer    information the model format may be with further    information that clarifies or enhances the model language

this would clear out a lot more 1 leverage is the act of taking on debt in lieu of the equity you hold not always related to firms it applies to personal situations too when you take a loan you get a certain age of the loan the bank establishes your equity by looking at your past financial records and then decides the amount it is going to lend deciding on the safest leverage in the current action leverage is the whole act of borrowing yen and profiting from it the leverage factor mentions the amount of leverage happening 10000 yen being borrowed with an equity of 1000 yen 2 commercial banks 10 to 1 > they do n't deal in complicated investments derivatives except for hedging and are under stricter controls of the government they have to have certain amount of liquidity and can loan out the rest for business investment banks 30 to 1 > their main idea is making money and trade heavily their deposits are limited by the amount clients have deposited and as their main motive is to get maximum returns from the available amount they trade heavily derivatives one of the instruments are structured on underlyings and sometimes in multiple layers which build up quite a bit of leverage and all of the trades happen on margins you do n't invest $ 10k to buy $ 10k of a traded stock you put in maybe $ 500 to take up the position and borrow the rest of the amount per se it improves liquidity in the markets and increases efficiency else you could do only with what you have so these margins add up to the leverage the bank is taking on

collective bargaining existed before the government officially granted people that right since collective bargaining would still be legal without the understand that essentially what you 're saying is that you think there should be a law that bars people from negotiating contract as a group in the process making it near impossible have the same resources to help them that the other side has like lawyers analysts economists pr people etc    this would go against of right to freedom of association   i do understand your argument though someone 's private company is their own to do with what they 'd like however we 've been through that in this country and child labor unsafe working conditions and 80 hour weeks having labor laws has proven beneficial for everyone even very weak laws compared with the rest of the industrial world   and raised living standards for millions you may not realize it but you have the labor movement to thank for many of the things that are just expected from employers today benefits holidays weekends safety overtime without the labor movement raising standards in the private sector and pushing for govt regulations our working lives would look very different today   like all laws there is a balance to be struck between individual rights and the common good and what can be seen as a right for one can often be seen as a right to violate another 's rights for someone else do n't people have the right to withhold their work when they feel like their dignity is on not everyone can own a business of their own so are the vast majority of us who will spend our lives working for someone else expected to have as little influence in our working lives as an indentured servant you probably tow the libertarian line however good this sounds on paper it ignores the child of who has to work to feed his her siblings     gt the mighty is those who use the force of government or the threat of violence e.g. violent strikes to prevent another party from exercising their contract liberty and firing them   this is some pretty extreme hyperbole and hard to take seriously as someone who was recently involved in organizing their workplace i can assure you that the deck is definitely stacked in favor of ownership modern anti union strategies are sophisticated and implemented by highly paid experts skilled in using psychological tactics that your average worker just is n't ready for union membership in this country has dwindled to around 10 down from around 50 during the middle of the century and the erosion of the middle class has been the undeniable result    use the force of government you know we may have the right to strike in this country but there 's no law that says a company ca n't hire replacement workers indefinitely plus striking is not a risk free action for someone barely getting by especially when up against people who have enough money for 20 lifetimes   threat of violence violent strikes this is a straw man if i 've ever seen one who is threatening violence here   objectively when you look at the wealth disparity in this country it 's pretty hard to argue that the right to collective bargaining has resulted in an unfair advantage for workers

i have found a good explanation here financing is calculated by taking the overall position size and multiplying it by libor + say 2 and then dividing by 365 x the amount of days the position is open for instance the interest rate applicable for overnight long positions may be 6 or 0.06 to calculate how much it would cost you to hold a long position for x number of days you would need to make this pro rata meaning that you would need to divide the 0.06 by 365 and multiply it by x days and then multiply this by the trade size so for example for a trade size of $ 20,000 held for 30 days the interest cost would be about $ it is important to note that due to financing long positions held for extended periods can reduce returns

this makes no sense because if those people did not eat those carbs they would have converted the fat into energy instead of storing it    both contribute to your calorie intake and unfortunately in western cuisine carbs also happen to generally come with a high amount of fat to flavour it eg chips mash pasta certain sandwiches and burgers etc

funds which track the same index may have different nominal prices   from an investors point of view this is not important   what is important is that when the underlying index moves by a given percentage the price of the tracking funds also move by an equal percentage   in other words if the s&p500 rises by 5 then the price of those funds tracking the s&p500 will also rise by 5   therefore investing a given amount in any of the tracking funds will produce the same profit or loss regardless of the nominal prices at which the individual funds are trading to see this use the compare function available on the popular online charting services for example in google finance call up a chart of the s&p500 index then use the compare to enter the codes for the various etfs tracking the s&p500   you will see that they all track the s&p500 equally so that your relative returns will be equal from each of the tracking funds   any small difference in total returns will be attributable to management fees and expenses which is why low fees are so important in passive investing

great it 's the old no true capitalist argument it 's hilarious how you keep seeing this yet when you see the exact opposite version of the same argument namely that all communist countries have been authoritarian and that this does not necessarily reflect the true ideology of communism then suddenly you 're a commie bastard   if we agree that there are no state bailouts in pure capitalism then please never again in your life disregard this argument when you hear it from a socialist

keep in mind that by fully paying off one of your loans you will reduce your minimum repayments this will make you feel richer than you actually are this will make you buy stuff that it seems like you can afford probably putting some of it on credit as you ca n't actually afford this this will leave you in a years time with the same amount of debt you have now or more but with a slightly bigger tv assuming your home loan has no penalties for paying off extra then put all 11k into there to keep your monthly repayments as high as possible

i am a firm believer in the idea of limiting debt as much as possible   i would not recommend borrowing money for anything other than a reasonably sized mortgage   as a result my recommendations are going to be geared toward that goal the top priorities for me then would be to make sure first that we do n't have to go further into debt and second that we eliminate the debt that we already have as soon as possible here is how i would rate your list a small emergency fund perhaps $ 1000 usd is going to ensure that while you are funding other things you do n't end up so cash poor that if something unexpected and urgent comes up you are forced to add to your credit card debt   make this small fund your top priority and it should n't take much more than a month or two to do it getting out of debt is important but if your employer hands out free money you have to take it   it is just too good of a deal get rid of this debt as fast as possible   when you are done you 'll have more income available to you than you 've ever had before now that you have just gotten done eliminating your debt as fast as possible do n't stop there   take the income you had been throwing at your debt and build up your emergency fund to a few months worth of your expenses   finishing this fund up will enable you to withstand a small crisis without borrowing anything you are now in a very strong position financially and can confidently invest   deciding which type of retirement account is best for you depends on the details of your situation once you are contributing a healthy amount to your retirement funds you may want to consider paying off your mortgage early as i said before i recommend getting down to the last step as quickly as possible   depending on how much debt you actually have if you sacrifice for a year or two you could be debt free and in a position to keep all of your investment gains   if you take your time paying off debt like many people do you could find yourself 10 years from now still making payments on your loans still making car payments and still needlessly sending interest to the banks eating away at the gains you are making in your investments if you are n't committed to eliminating your debt quickly and plan on having payments for a long time then skip this advice and put retirement savings at the top

probably a big fat no update re this edit note i 'm not suggesting that i melt the coins i 'm just suggesting that i hold onto the nickels and sell them later when they are worth more than 5 cents for example you can sell coins with silver in them for far above their face value this is silly as an investment   right up there with stockpiling cars    the increase in value will likely never be enough to make the cost hassle of storage worth it   as mrchrister states it is a fine idea as a collection but not as a stockpile edit from the comments i am surprised i did not onto this in the previous update   silver is considered a previous metal nickel and copper are not   btw the u.s. nickel is 25 nickel and 75 copper also how in the world do you plan on actually selling a stockpile of nickels

cosigning is explicitly a promise that you will make the payments if the primary signer can not do n't do it unless you are able to handle the cost and trust the other party will make you whole when they can which means do n't do it for anyone you would not lend your money to since it comes out to about the same level of risk having agreed you 're sorta stuck with your ex friend 's problem i recommend talking to a lawyer about the safest way get out of this it is n't clear you can even sue the ex friend at this point

well the problem with putting a group of people in charge of something so substantial is that man is corruptible   the individuals in charge will change over time and eventually corrupt people will be in charge   it 's inevitable   gt if you were in charge what action would you take   if i were in charge of the fed or if i were in charge of designing a brand new monetary system   if i were in charge of the fed i would immediately stop the creation of this funny money make all of the fed 's account books publications meeting minutes and all other info public information   i would invite a full audit of the entire organization   i would then hold the people accountable for any fraud that turns up   then i would simply abolish the organization   i believe local banks can better set lending rates just as local store owners can set better prices than a single federal organization   interest rates would reflect actual demand for loans not reflect the secret personal agenda of some arrogant elitist bureaucrat   if i were designing a new monetary system i would combine the obvious benefits of a gold silver standard with the and decentralized nature of a currency like bitcoin   i would create a published and predictable increase to the money supply that could not be changed and would grow just enough to avoid constant deflation as economies expanded   most importantly i would advocate and encourage the creation of alternate currencies to allow honest competition

you said all terrorists are muslims which is not true at all because most acts of terror comes from right population most common are the burning down a house and personal attacks on looking guys at least in germany do nt know about other countries but i can not imagine it much different   cause and effect and quantity is a terror attack more harmful if more people heard of it effect on who i can imagine you talking in public is pretty scary for foreigners which is the point of the hate speech topic lets not drag the topic in here too because its very complicated just for your information i m very much in favour of fighting the cause of immigration and helping where it is needed and not letting millions walk thousands of miles to get to safety of to make a living funny how your mind works criminal immigrants are not accepted in germany by the way and if they get criminal here they get deported the crime rate of the refugees is actually a bit lower then the rate of the rest of the population so not big a problem which makes sense if you think about it it was hard to get here and they do nt want to go back    do you think a rightwing would attack muslims if they did not attack westerners do you think rightwing attacks are more than muslim attacks are they even 1 of all attacks and harm      this is the core problem i am talking about this is why millions of germans slaughtered the jewish population this is the result of hate speech and hard right propaganda the difference between now and then swap jew with muslim the muslims are to blame for the crime attacking our women the bad economy it is exactly the same mindset people then were no different then people now they did think they help germany by getting rid of those pests most of them did nothing at all and after the war they said they did n't know about any attacks or of jews needles to say that the actual crime rate if jews in germany was no different then the non jew crime rate just as it is now with muslims the overall crime rate rise significantly though since the start of the refugees crisis as a result of massive right wing activity you said you hate nazis a while back i do n't think you know what a nazi is and sure enough i called you one and you did not deny my friend i was wrong about you you are a helpless cause with terrible arguments based on prejudice and hate i still did enjoy this conversation because it was a mostly civil and b gave me a very good look into the mindset of a nazi you may be happy to here that i realized while researching the topic that the problem of nazis is much bigger then i have thought and i can not ignore it anymore and have to join the fight good day to you and may reason catch up to you in your future life

i would encourage you to read the warren buffett way   its a short read and available from most libraries as an audio book   it should address most of the ignorance that your post displays    short term prices offered in the market do not necessarily reflect the future value of a company   in the short term the market is a popularity contest in the long run prices increases based on the performance of the company   how much free cash flow and related metrics does the company generate   you seem way overly concerned with short term price fluctuations and as such you are more speculating expecting a 10 in 2 3 years is unrealistic   has it happened sure but it is a rare thing   most would be happy to have a 2 in that time frame if i was in your shoes i 'd buy the stock and watch it   provided management meet my expectations and made good business decisions i would hold it and add to my position as i was able and the market was willing to sell me the company at a good price    it is good to look at index funds as a diversification    assuming everything goes perfectly in 2 3 years you would have an extra 1 k dollars   big deal   how much money could you earn during that time period   simply by working at a fairly humble job you should be able to earn between 60 k and 90 k during that time   if you stuck 10 of that income into a savings account you would be far better off 6 k to 9 k then if this stock actually does double   hopefully that gets you thinking staring out is about earning and saving investing   start building funds that can compound   very early on the rate of return provided it is not negative is very unimportant   the key is to get money to compound

it is n't just fox news even liberal leaning sources like the washington post abc and the seattle times are using titles like a very new study on seattle ’s $ 15 minimum wage has bad news for liberals and new study of seattle 's $ 15 minimum wage says it costs jobs     now here are some citations from the actual study which you obviously did n't read or you would n't have made the asinine comment above importantly the lost income associated with the hours reductions exceeds the gain associated with the net wage increase of 3.1 using data in table 3 we compute that the average low wage employee was paid $ per month the reduction in hours would cost the average employee $ 179 per month while the wage increase would recoup only $ 54 of this loss leaving a net loss of $ 125 per month 6.6 which is sizable for a low wage worker   our preferred estimates suggest that the seattle minimum wage ordinance caused hours worked by low skilled workers i.e. those earning under $ 19 per hour to fall by during the three quarters when the minimum wage was $ 13 per hour resulting in a loss of 3.5 million hours worked per calendar quarter alternative estimates show the number of low wage jobs declined by 6.8 which represents a loss of more than 5,000 jobs these estimates are robust to other than $ a 3.1 increase in wages in jobs that paid less than $ 19 coupled with a loss in hours yields a labor demand elasticity of roughly   i understand if you wo n't respond it is scary having your liberal narrative

most of your arguments are actually bullshit assumptions that can be easily refuted   you know what hedge funds do to pensions they fleece the pensions with fees and performance bonuses but take no downside even that commie warren buffet bets against sites fund vs index fund a a simple indexed fund will outperform almost any hedge fund just left on its own and they wo n't be exposed to those great aaa rated cds 's that screwed over so many pension funds during the gfc oh and who put those together investment bankers   as for the company in distress it really seems like you have no idea how these things work if a private equity jumps into a company it is because of one of two things either they can realise a quick buck by the company and selling off it 's assets or it 's a company that has good revenue but too many costs in which they just trim down by everyone they can get away with they help no one and the very few that get to keep their job   to say that due to their long hours investment banking analysts make salaries is just a horrible misguided joke even assuming they log in a week for 52 weeks in a year an average intern in is of $ which as you see from the article is well above any salary of any of the social workers not just first years and these go up by around 20 a year then of course you should add into the equation the fact that anybody working a a week is going to be very prone to making mistakes   as for that fantastic skill set you say you learn on the job i would really love to see a study of some sort in which they compare the value added of an ivy league genius against that of a good student from a public university maybe then all of these bold assertions of how fantastic they are will fall to the ground    the article does not have a lot of quality to it but it does speak of an important matter the amount of skilled workers that go into finance and investment banking is disastrous for the economy if those minds could be applied to actually building things inventing life improving services or generally society better the whole world would be much better off than using those minds to try and outsmart in ways to get investors money into the pockets of the hedge fund managers and private bankers

i think you came up with a worthy masters phd research project it is a great question this is in australia so it is difficult for me to have complete perspective   however i can speak about the us of a. to your first point relatively few people inherit their wealth   according to a brief web search about 38 of billionaires and 20 of millionaires inherited their wealth   the rest are self made again in the us income mobility is very common   some act like high level earners are just born that way but studies have shown that a great deal of income mobility exists   i personally know people that have grown up without indoor plumbing and extremely poor but now earn in the top 5 of wage earners    quid 's points are valid   for example a starbucks new i phone and a brake job on your car are somewhat catastrophic if your income is 50k year hurts if your income is 100 k and an inconvenience if you make 250k year   these situations are normal and happen regularly   the first person may have to take a pay day loan to pay for these items the second credit card interest the third probably has the money in the bank   all of this the effect of an emergency on one 's net worth     to me there is also a chicken and egg effect in wealth building and income   how does one build wealth   by investing wisely planning ahead budgeting delaying gratification finding opportunities etc   now if you take those same skills to your workplace is n't it likely you will receive more responsibility promotions and raises   i believe so   and this too the effect on one 's net worth   if investing helps you to earn more then you will have more to invest to me one of the untold stories of this graph is not just investing but first building a stable financial base   having a sufficient emergency fund having enough and the right kind of insurance keeping loans to a minimum   without doing those things first investments might need to be withdrawn often at an inopportune time for emergency purposes thanks for asking this

i would also be getting out of the stock market if i noticed prices starting to fall and a crash possibly on the way there are some good and quite simple techniques i would use to time the markets over the medium to long term i have described some of them in the answer to this question of mine what are some simple techniques used for timing the stock market over the long term you could use similar techniques in your investing and in regards to back testing dca to timing the markets i have done that too in my answer to the following question investing in low cost index fund does the timing matter timing the markets wins hand down in regards to back testing and the concerns kent anderson has brought up when i back test a trading strategy if that strategy is successful i then forward test it over a year or two to confirm the results as with back testing you can sometimes curve fit your criteria too much by forward testing you are confirming that the strategy is robust over different market conditions one strategy you can take when the market does start to fall is short selling as mentioned by some already i am now short selling using cfds over the short to medium term as one of my more aggressive strategies i have a longer term strategy where i do not short but tighten my stop losses when the market starts to tank sometimes my positions will keep going up even though the market as a whole is heading down and i can make an extra 5 to 10 on these positions before i get taken out the rare position even continues going up during the whole downturn and when the market starts to recover so i let the market decide when i get out and when i stay in i leave my emotions out of it the best thing you can do is have a written trading plan with all your criteria for getting into the market your criteria for getting out of the market and your position sizing and risk management incorporated in the plan

you ca n't get started investing there are preliminary steps that must be taken prior to beginning to invest only once these things are complete can you think about investing   doing so before hand will only likely lose money in the long run   figure these steps will take about 2.5 years   so you are 2.5 years from investing read now   the total money makeover   it is full of inspiring stories of people that were able to turn things around financially   this is good because it is easy to get discouraged and believe all kind of toxic beliefs about money   the little guy ca n't get ahead i always will have a car payment its too late etc   they are all false   part of the book 's resources are budgeting forms and hints on budgeting read later   john bogle on investing and bogle on mutual funds one additional item   about you calling yourself a dummy   building personal wealth is less about knowledge and more about behavior   the reason you do n't have a positive net worth is because of how you behaved not knowledge   even sticking a small amount in a savings account each paycheck and not spending it would have allowed you to have a positive net worth at this point in your life only by changing behavior can you start to build wealth investing is only a small component

if markets were perfectly efficient the price should reflect everything that is currently known about the future of a commodity   if it is known that silver is currently under valued then investors would be buying it driving the price up   conversely if silver is currently over valued then investors would be selling and the price would be going down   added to that is emotion   if the price is currently trending up then people expect it to keep going up and the price continues to rise   until enough people think it ca n't go any higher and start selling which drives the price down   since this is driven by emotion it can not be predicted when this will happen

with a normal cd you ca n't but some banks do seem to offer cds where you can   for instance the variable rate cd at usaa allows ongoing deposits   i also found a united bank saver cd which requires you to set up automatic monthly deposits   you would have to check each individual bank 's cd offerings to see if they have such a product however if you make ongoing deposits to it a cd becomes less from a savings account   even if a given bank does offer a cd you might conceivably be able to find a higher rate on a plain savings account at another bank especially an online bank offering high savings account rates   for instance the usaa cd i mentioned above has an apy of but the high yield savings accounts on this nerdwallet list have higher than that   so even if you can find the kind of cd you describe it might be better to just use a savings account anyway

in general i think you 're conflating a lot of ideas    the stock market is not like a supermarket   with the exception of a direct issue you 're not buying your shares from the company or from the new york stock exchange you 're buying from an owner of stock joe sally a pension fund a hedge fund etc it 's not sitting on a shelf at the stock market when you buy an apple stock you do n't own $ 10 of apple you own of apple because apple has shares outstanding   when a the board gets together to vote on and approve a dividend the approved dividend is then divided by billion to determine how much each owner receives   the company does n't pay dividends out to owners from a pot of money it received from new owners it sold iphones at a profit and is sending a portion of that profit to the owners of the company    when you buy stock it is claimed that you own a small portion of the    company this statement has no backing as you can not exchange your    stock for the company 's assets the statement does have backing   it 's backed by the us judicial system   but there 's a difference between owning a company and owning the assets of the company   you own of the company and the company owns the company 's assets   nevermind how disruptive it would be if any shareholder could unilaterally decide to sell a company 's buildings or other assets this is not a ponzi scheme because when you buy or sell your apple stock it has no impact on apple you 're simply transacting with another random shareholder barring a share repurchase or direct issue   apple does n't receive the proceeds of your private transaction you do as far as value goes yes the stock market provides tons of value and is a staple of capitalism   the stock market provides an avenue of financing for companies   rather than taking a loan a company 's board can choose to some control and take on additional owners who will share in the of the enterprise    additionally the exchanges deliver value via an unbelievable level of liquidity   you do n't have to go seek out joe or sally when you want to sell your apple stock   you do n't need to put your shares on craigslist in the hope of finding a buyer   you do n't have to negotiate a price with someone who knows you want to sell   you just place an order at an exchange and you 're aligned with a buyer    also understand that anything can move up or down in value without any money actually changing hands   say you get your hands on a pair of shoes or whatever they 're hot on the market very rare and sought after   you think you can sell them for $ 1,000 on tonight 's news it turns out that the leather is actually from humans and the ceo of the company is being indicted the company is falling apart etc   your shoes just went from $ 1,000 to $ 0 with no money changing hands or from $ 1,000 to $ 100,000 depending on how cynical you are

as joetaxpayer notes in his comment answers to this are really just opinions so here 's mine for what it 's worth if your risk tolerance is 5 out of 5 you should n't have anything in treasuries   those are basically the most conservative of all investments   this would probably mean no tips as well   if you 're more like 4.5 out of 5 you could have some but just a little a 30 allocation to government securities is quite conservative   if you want to diversify across different asset classes you could consider a bond fund like for instance vbmfx the vanguard total bond market index fund   your portfolio does n't currently contain any non government bonds which is something to consider 20 seems like quite a large allocation to reits   most sample portfolios i 've seen allocate no more than 10 to reits often no more than 5   there are some that have more like the 20 you 're but you might want to ponder that a bit more especially in light of your concerns about reits being at an all time high as for your question about all time highs it 's reasonable to think about but i think waiting for 30 50 off all time highs is unrealistic   looking at a chart of vfinx essentially the s&p 500 i see that at the of the recent downturn in early 2009 the market was at about 50 of its pre crash all time high   at the of the dot com bust the market was about 45 off its pre crash high   if you 're waiting for it to be 50 off it 's all time high you 're not just waiting for a good time to invest you 're waiting for a major crash it could certainly make sense not to immediately put everything into us stocks but that does n't mean you should put nothing in   as commented you could put some of the money in and then gradually add the rest over time reducing the risk of buying at the peak   this can also reduce the psychological of worrying about whether you 're doing the right thing which is worth taking into account   also note that if you get rid of the treasuries you eliminate a good chunk of the stuff that you thought was too close to the peak anyway your two basic points asset allocation and low cost funds have a strong boglehead flavor   you may already have looked at the bogleheads wiki if not you should take a look   if you are comfortable with that philosophy and i think it 's a sound one you should remember that part of that philosophy is not worrying about timing the market   you pursue a buy and hold strategy if you believe the market will go up in the long term and do n't care much about what it does in the short term   that said as mentioned above you might want to ease in your investment over time rather than buying all at once if only to avoid tearing your hair out if the market goes down in the short term incidentally your proposed portfolio is similar to this one that they mention although as i said above i think this is too conservative if you are 30 years old and consider yourself a 5 out of 5 in terms of risk tolerance   i 'm not sure if you already saw that in your research but since that portfolio apparently has a name and is known you might be able to find information about its risks and benefits by searching for discussion of it by name

i was i a similar position as you and sometimes credit bureaus might be difficult to deal with especially when high amounts of money are involved to make the long story short someone opened a store credit card under my name and made a charge of around 3k after reporting this to the bureaus they did not want to remove the account from my credit report citing that the claim was frivolous after filing a police report the police officer gave me the phone number for the fraud department of this store credit card and after they investigated they removed the account from my credit i would suggest to do the following communicating with creditors and debt collectors you have the right to   stop creditors and debt collectors from    reporting fraudulent accounts after you give them a copy of a valid    identity theft report they may not report fraudulent accounts to the    credit reporting companies get copies of documents related to the    theft of your identity like transaction records or applications for    new accounts write to the company that has the documents and include    a copy of your identity theft report you also can tell the company to    give the documents to a specific law enforcement agency stop a debt    collector from contacting you in most cases debt collectors must    stop contacting you after you send them a letter telling them to stop    get written information from a debt collector about a debt including    the name of the creditor and the amount you supposedly owe if a debt    collector contacts you about a debt request this information in    writing i know that you said that the main problem was that your credit account was combined with another but there might be a chance that identity theft was involved if this is the case and you can prove it then you might have access to more tools to help you for example you can file a report with the ftc and along with a police report this can be a powerful tool in stopping these charges feel free to go to the website for more information

the other answers have touched on amortization early payment computation of interest etc which are all very important but i think there 's another way to understand the importance of knowing the p i breakdown the question mentions the loan payment as cash outflow that is true but from an accounting perspective disclaimer i am not an accountant but i know enough of the basics to be dangerous the outflow needs to be directed to different accounts the loan principal appears as a liability on your personal balance sheet which you could use for example in determining net worth the principal amount in your payment should be applied to reduce the liability account the interest payment goes into the expense account   another way to look at it is that the principal while it does reduce your cash account can be thought of as an internal transfer to the liability account thus reducing the size of the liability the interest payment can not aside from this perspective the value of the home is an asset and the difference between the asset account and the loan liability account is the equity in the house as pointed out in different language by the accepted answer of course precisely determining the value of an illiquid asset like a house at any given moment pretty much requires you to actually sell it so those accounts are hard to maintain in real time the liability of the loan is much easier to track

for a company the size of amazon a 1 increase in prices is substantial   many of their products are in competitive price sensitive markets   there are some products that people would notice a 1 difference from competitors   so the actual increase would have to be concentrated on a smaller subset of products that are not as price sensitive   however that would still mean reduced sales   in short i do n't think amazon is foregoing a 50 bump in profits if they could get it   also a 5 sga cut is absolutely enormous for a lean organization   in any one year that would mean an effective ~10 cut once you factor in inflation

options have legitimate uses as a way of hedging a bet but in the hands of anyone but an expert they 're gambling not investing they are extremely volatile compared to normal stocks and are one of the best ways to lose your shirt in the stock market yet invented how options actually work is that you 're negotiating a promise that at some future date or range of dates they will let you purchase some specific number of shares call or they will let you sell them that number of shares put at a price specified in the option contract the price you pay or are paid to obtain that contract depends on what the option 's seller thinks the stock is likely to be worth when it reaches that date note that if you do n't already own the shares needed to back up a put option you 're promising to pay whatever it takes to buy those shares so you can sell them at the agreed upon price note that by definition you 're betting directly against experts as opposed to a normal investment where you 're usually trying to ride along with the experts you are claiming that you can predict the future value of the stock better than they can and that you will make a profit on the difference between the value locked in by the option and the actual value at that time which exceeds the cost of purchasing the option in the first place   let me say that again the option 's price will have been set based on an expert 's opinion of what the stock is likely to do in that time if they think that it 's really likely to be up $ 10 per share when the option comes due really unlikely for a $ 20 stock they will try to charge you almost $ 10 per share to purchase the option at the current price almost because you 're giving them a guaranteed profit now and assuming all the risk if they 're less sure it will go up that much you 'll pay less for the option but again you 're giving them hard money now and betting that you can predict the probabilities better than they can unless you have information that the experts do n't have in which case you 're probably committing insider trading this is a very hard bet to win and it can be extremely misleading since the price during the option period may cross back and forth over the enough that you 'll make a profit line many times until you actually commit to exercising the option or not that 's all imaginary money which may vanish the next minute unless you are willing and able to invest pro level resources in this you 'd probably get better odds in atlantic city and definitely get better odds in las vegas if you do n't see the sucker at the poker table he 's sitting in your seat and betting against the guy who designed and is running the game is usually not a good idea

the assumption that bonds have been issued with a negative coupon is not correct or at least is has not occurred thus far   we 'll look at this future possibility in the final paragraph for now lets look at the current bond market the issuance of government bonds which carry a negative gross redemption yield is the result of governments issuing bonds at an issue price which exceed the nominal redemption price and any coupon yield receivable over the life of the bond   i can find no instances of bonds with a negative coupon though many have tiny positive coupon yields the short seller of a bond with a negative gross redemption yield will be liable to pay the buyer the interest amount determined by the coupon   if the short seller has borrowed the bonds in order to sell them then the short seller will receive the interest due from the lender to offset the interest paid to the buyer   if the short seller has not borrowed the bonds but has sold them using some sort of synthetic contract such as a contract for difference then the short seller will pay the coupon without receiving any offsetting payment i thought this was an interesting question and it will be interesting to see if at some time in the future governments do ever issue bonds with a negative coupon   to date this does not appear to have happened so what would happen if we assume that a government issues a bond with a negative coupon   the buyer of the bond would be required to pay the equivalent yield to the government according to the bond contract specification   if an investor sells short such a bond they would then become entitled to receive the interest from the buyer   if they have borrowed the bonds in order to sell them short then they would pay any interest received back to the lender this chain should eventually end with the ultimate owner lender paying the government their dues   if they have sold short using a synthetic contract then presumably they would keep the interest from themselves

sure it 's irresponsible for an executor to take actions which endanger the estate   but what about or inaction   put it another way   is it the obligation of the executor to avoid making revenue for the estate   think about it what a silly idea    consider a apartment building full of rent paying tenants   a tenant gives notice and leaves   so do 4 more   with only tenants the building stops being a revenue center and becomes a massive money pit   is that acceptable   heck no   realistically this will be managed by a property management company and of course they 'll seek new tenants not stopping merely because the owner died   this situation is not different the same fiscal logic applies   the counter argument is usually along the lines of stuff might happen if you rent it out true but the stuff that happens to abandoned houses is much worse and much more likely teen urban explorers pot growers copper thieves winter pipe freeze flooding and wrecking interiors etc   do n't take my word on it ask your insurer for the cost of insuring an abandoned house vs. a rented one   renting brings a chunk of cash that comes in from tenants $ on a $ 1000/mo rental and that will barely pay the bills if you have a young mortgage on a freshly purchased house at recent market rates   but on an old mortgage renting is like printing money   that money first to the estate presumably it is holding back a fix the roof emergency fund and then to the beneficiaries   it means getting annual checks from the estate instead of constantly being for another repair   but i do n't care about making revenue outside of putting back a kitty to replace the roof   even if it was net zero it means the maintenance is being done   this being the point   it is keeping the house in good repair occupied insured and professionally managed fit and ready for the bequest 's purpose occupancy of an aunt   what 's the alternative   move an aunt into a house that 's been 10 years abandoned   realistically the heirs are going to get tired bored of maintaining the place at a total cash loss maintenance will slip and you 'll be moving them into a neglected house with some serious issues   that the bequest and it 's not fair to the rental is a very responsible thing to do   the executor should n't fail to do it merely out of   if you decide not to do it there needs to be a viable alternative to funding the home 's decent upkeep   i do n't think there is one   excluding a revenue producing asset from the economy is an expensive thing to do

there are not as many options here as you fear if you have no other investments outside this 401 k it is even easier outside accounts include ira roth ira taxable investments mutual funds etf individual stocks employee stock purchase plans amount make sure you put enough in to get all the company match i assume that in your case the 9 will do so but check your documents the company match will be with pre tax funds   roth vs regular 401 k most people in their lifetime will need a mix of roth and regular retirement accounts you need to determine if it is better for you to pay the tax on your contributions now or later which accounts if you are going to invest in a target date fund you can ignore the rest of the options the target date fund is a mixture of investments that will change over the decades calculate which one fits your expected retirement date and go with it if you want to be able to control the mix then you will need to pick several funds the selection depends on what k investments you have now here is what i considered the best advice   decide roth or regular and just put the money into the most appropriate target date fund with the roth regular split you want then after the money starts flowing into your account research the funds involved the fees for those funds and how you want to invest then move the money into the funds you want do n't waste another day deciding how to invest just get started the best part of a 401 k besides the match is that you can move money between funds without worrying about taxes if you realize that you want to put extra emphasis on the foreign stocks or mid cap just move the funds and redirect future contributions

we generally speak of the elasticity of demand cards are expensive because they can be we buy them in a weakened state and we do not buy them by the tonne there is also the concept of market segmentation but not so much essentially the price is determined by finding the point of pain and winding it back a little so people will pay $ 5 for a card   they will not generally pay $ 5,000 unless there is a good reason vanity why sell them for $ 2 the customers who at $ 5 tend not to even have $ 2 market segmentation again   in short the price is always going to need to be set before the point where demand rolls off sharply to maximise profit

central banks are essentially a cartel designed to let banks in general borrow money from depositors at relatively low interest rates   they do this in two ways   by reassuring depositors that momentary cash flow problems at banks will not result in banks failing they lower the interest rates that depositors demand   and by imposing strict regulations on banks that are borrowing from depositors at high interest rates   people who move money to the banks offering the highest interest rates are especially likely to participate in bank runs borrowing too much from the central bank is considered to be a sign of a bank that is too weak to attract deposits from depositors at reasonable interest rates if a bank borrows too much as a percentage of the bank 's assets from the central bank the bank regulators will subject the bank to heavy scrutiny   if the bank fails to find ways to reduce its borrowing from the central bank the bank regulators are likely to steal the bank from its shareholders and sell the bank to a stronger bank that pays lower interest rates

the number one difference is that bank savings accounts or money market accounts allow limited checking six non atm withdrawals per month max else possible fees have fdic insurance up to $ 250,000   however do n't put that much in allow some room for interest so you never go over the $ 250,000   money market mutual funds do not enjoy fdic insurance   there may be some insurance generally against brokerage failure though but its coverage is questionable search out those details and if they apply to anything besides actual cash held at the brokerage   if the money market mutual fund is strictly invested in us treasury securities like t bills or other short term us treasury instruments it enjoys the full faith and credit of the us government fwiw but many invest in corporate instruments   if the fund has any pricing issues there might be a delay in getting paid off   extremely unlikely       number two and more importantly bank savings accounts or pay way more   you can get a bit over 1 apy now many paying 0.90 apy or higher   no money market mutual funds are close to that generally yielding a small fraction of that almost zero for us treasury mmm funds   sure 1.05 ai n't too exciting but you may as well get the most you can if holding cash and fully insured to boot

generically interest rates being charged are driven in large part by the central bank 's rate and competition tends to keep similar loans priced fairly close to each other interest rates being paid are driven by what 's needed to get folks to lend you their money deposit in bank purchase bonds so it 's again related there certainly is n't very direct coupling but in general interest rates of all sorts do tend to swing very roughly in the same direction at very roughly the same time so the concept that interest rates of all types are rising or falling at any given moment is a simplification but not wholly unreasonable if you want to know which interest rates a particular person is citing to back up their claim you really need to ask them

it 's amusing that despite all the evidence that you ca n't time the market everyone still wants to try   of course i understand your fear   if you invest all your money in the stock market today and it suddenly falls tomorrow you will feel very bad   there are a few things you can do to reduce your risk with respect to timing however do n't all your money down on the same day   invest in the market over time perhaps a few hundred dollars per month worth depending on your appetite   this averages your purchase cost to ensure you are n't buying at the time when prices are highest   the down side is of course that if you leave cash sitting around you might also not be buying when the prices are lowest either and will probably miss out on some gains   still if risk is your concern this is a sound strategy invest in various markets overseas   this will expose you to some currency risk but lower your timing risk as even with globalization markets do n't rise and fall in tandem    even with both of the above you can still be just plain unlucky or lucky   i would recommend that you invest only money that you do n't need to take out in the near future in order to reduce the chance that the money will have lost value since you put it in and that you do n't watch the markets since it makes a lot of people nervous and tends to prod them into doing exactly the wrong thing at exactly the wrong time

first consider what causes taxes to apply to a mutual fund index or actively managed   dividends and capital gains are generally what will be distributed to shareholders given the nature of a mutual fund since the fund itself does n't pay taxes   for funds held in iras or other tax advantaged accounts this is n't a concern and thus people may not have this concern for those situations which can account for a lot of investing situations as people may have 401(k)s and iras that hold their investments rather than taxable accounts second there can be tax managed funds so there can be cases where a fund is managed with taxes in mind that is worth noting here as what is referenced is a dummies link that is making a generalization   for taxable accounts it may make more sense to have a tax managed fund rather than an index fund though i 'd also argue to be careful of asset allocation as to maintain a purity of style can require selling of stocks that grow too big and thus trigger capital gains e.g small cap and mid cap funds that ca n't hold onto the winners as they would become mid cap and large cap instead of representing the proper asset class a fund that played it safe and was sorry would be a businessweek story from 1998 of an actively managed fund that went mostly to cash and missed the rise of the stock market at that time if you want a specific example of what an actively managed fund can do that an index fund often can not do   the index fund is to track the index and stay nearly all invested all the time

does a good job of summarizing things   tracking the index yourself is expensive transaction costs and tedious number of transactions keeping up with the changes etc   one of the points of using an index fund is to reduce your workload   diversification is another point though that depends on the indexes that you decide to use   that said even with a relatively narrow index you diversify in that segment of the market a point i 'd like to add is that the management which occurs for an index fund is not exactly active   the decisions on which stocks to select are already made by the of the index   thus the only management that has to occur involves the trades required to mimic the index

what financial instruments are there that are profitable when an underlying assets falls the instrument you are looking for is called an option specifically a put option it allows you within the validity date to sell put the respective shares to the option giver at the predefined strike price for example let 's assume appl trades currently at 100 $ per share and you think they will go down a lot you buy one put option for 100 shares they always come for larger amounts like 100s for a strike price of 90 $ and pay 5 $ for it it would be cheap if nobody believes they will fall that much note the last sentence under 2 it is rather easy and very common when trading options to make complete losses you have been warned are they available for ipos they could be available for ipos even before the ipo however someone has to put them out some large bank typically which is some effort and they would only do that if they expect enough interest and volume in the trade most of the time there will be no such options on the market are they available for foreign but again only selectively only if the stock is well known and interesting enough for a broad audience

if you can make enough roi from the capital you retain by not paying off your mortgage then why not i do i could pay off a significant chunk of mortgage if i wanted but whilst interest rates are low there 's little incentive as for another crash well there 's no reason to expect a crash would result in high interest rates more the opposite but you should consider what you would or could do if interest rates did jump to 15 for whatever reason as long as your investments are n't too risky or difficult to liquidate etc you could always consider paying off a big chunk then when it makes sense

lets imagine two scenarios 1 you make 40 of total income yearly contributions to a savings account that earns 1 interest for 10 years in this scenario you put in and earned in interest for a total of 2 you make the same yearly contribution to an index fund that earns 7 on average for 10 years in this scenario you put in the same but earned in interest for a total of the main advantage is option 1 has more liquidity you can get the money out faster option 2 requires time to divest any stocks bonds so you need enough savings to get you through that period imagine another two scenarios where you stop earning income you stop working and have only your principal amount in a 1 savings account if you withdraw yearly for your current cost of living you will run through your savings in 7 years you stop working and have only 20k 2 years of savings in savings that earns 1 with in stocks that earns 7 if you withdraw your cost of living currently at you will run through your investments in 15 years and your savings in 2 years for a total of 17 years the two years of income in savings is extremely generous for how long it starts the process   in summary invest your money it was n't specified what currency we are talking about but you can easily find access to an investment company no matter where you are in the world keep a small amount for a rainy day

as i stated in my comment options are futures but with the twist that you 're allowed to say no to the agreed on transaction if the market offers you a better deal on whatever you had contracted to buy or sell you have the option of simply letting it expire options therefore are the insurance policy of the free market you negotiate a future price actually you usually take what you can get if you 're an individual investor the institutional fund managers get to negotiate because they 're moving billions around every day then you pay the other guy up front for the right of refusal later how much you pay depends on how likely the person giving you this option is to have to make good on it if your position looks like a sure thing an option 's going to be very expensive and if it 's such a sure thing you should just make your move on the spot market it 's thus useful to track futures prices to see where the various big players are predicting that your portfolio will move a put option which is an option for you to sell something at a future price is a hedge against loss of value of your portfolio you can take one out on any single item in your portfolio or against a portion or even your entire portfolio if the stock loses value such that the contract price is better than the market price as of the delivery date of the contract you execute the option otherwise you let it expire a call option which is an option to buy something at a future price is a hedge against rising costs the rough analog is a pre order in retail but more like a holding fee they 're unusual in portfolio management but can be useful when moving money around in more complex ways basically if you need to guarantee that you will not pay more than a certain per share price to buy something in the future you buy a call option if the spot price as of the delivery date is less than the contract price you buy from the market and ignore the contract while if prices have soared you exercise it and get the lower contract price stock options offered as benefits in many companies are a specific form of call option with very generous terms for whomever holds them a swaption basically a put and a call rolled into one allows you to trade something for something else call it the free market 's exchange policy for a price if a security you currently hold loses value you can exchange it for something else that you predicted would become more valuable at the same time one example might be airline stocks and crude oil when crude spikes airline stocks generally suffer and you can take advantage of this if it happens with a swaption to sell your airline stocks for crude oil certificates there are many such closely related inverse positions in the market such as between various currencies between stocks and commodities gold is inversely related to pretty much everything else and even straight up cash for bad debt arrangements credit default swaps which we heard so much about in 2008

yikes not always is this the case for example you purchased a new car with an interest rate of 5 even higher why pay that much interest throughout the loan sometimes trading in the vehicle at a lower rate will get you a lower or sometimes the same payment even with an upgraded newer safer technology design the trade off when going from new to new the car may depreciate faster than what you would save from the interest savings on a new loan sometimes the tactics used to get you back to the dealership could be a little harsh but if you do your research long before you inquire you may come out on the winning end look at what you 're paying in interest and consider it a re finance of your car but taking advantage of the manufacturer 's low apr special to off set the costs

i agree with all that was said here but i have to add something another point i will add is stimulus while you still can at some point you can no longer take on more debt even if you wanted to if global and domestic investors think you are going to be a risky investment then they cut you off the people who argue that greece should n't be implementing austerity do n't seem to understand the situation they are in far fewer wanted to lend money to them even before they started their haircut people think the government should spend more but how are they supposed to do that if no one wants to lend more money they also criticize germany and co. for insisting on austerity what they sometimes seem to forget is that germany does n't have an infinite supply of money to bail out greece they have their own bills to pay and any politician who was dumping ever larger amounts of money into greece would be looking at being voted out or even if they let things get too bad for the german people i am being a little hyperbole here to make a point but i honestly feel it is a very real possibility in this kind of economic climate at this point there is no reason to discuss whether greece should choose to spend more money because that choice is no longer even available to them   we are not as bad off as greece right now we should spend more money but we need results we need to identify the structural problems ailing our economy and get them fixed with the money we have direct spending is n't always a great idea if it is done in a nonsensical way people defending the bike paths and other shit argue that all spending is good in a depression i am not against bike paths and roads because they can certainly create jobs and generate value to the economy but every dollar you spend on them is one dollar that ca n't be spent on the biggest problems assuming of course that kind of infrastructure is n't one of those   after spending trillions of dollars on spending our gdp is still growing at only 2 it was increasing about 3.5 every year from 2012 our jobs creation rate is still less than half the 250,000 jobs a month we created in the last 10 20 years ca n't remember the exact number we definitely need to spend differently to address the problems and get people back to work as said we need middle class jobs we particularly need those among america 's youth so they can move out of their parents houses and buy their own which could really help the housing economy and create jobs for the lower class in turn and get us out of this depression my thoughts are that we should use stimulus in new new industries such as those in high tech i intentionally stated that very broadly because we have many millenials who need to get to work   investing in different high growth industries could create jobs for people in any number of occupations but if we do n't do that while people still want to lend us money then we are going to be fucked in a few years when we are out of options and land in the same position as greece   edit let me clarify the infrastructure thing there was a town that spent millions rebuilding a sidewalk that was five years old that no one in the community wanted everyone there thought it was a nonsensical way of spending tax dollars and would have thought that money could have been better spent in another community that really needed problems resolved would n't it have made more sense to spend money somewhere where it was needed then you could have created jobs and created lasting value to an economy by fixing a structural problem that was holding the economy back why do n't our politicians realize this

the government wants money and is n't particularly interested in you getting your deductions right doing the worksheet on the back of the w-4 will give you a much better idea of how many deductions you can take while many people are excited to get a tax refund a refund means you loaned the government money all year long without getting paid interest for your generosity the irs will penalize you for underpaying your taxes in amounts larger than $ 1000 or 10 of your income but a good ballpark estimate aiming for about ~$100 in payment at tax time is a relatively safe way to get all your money sooner than later

the problem with your math is that your assumptions are all sorts of fucked up you have him living in a 700 sqft apartment in but paying $ 1400 in indianapolis i live here $ 1400 in indy is enough to rent a 3 bedroom house or a 3 bedroom luxury apartment downtown and a front end dev is n't going to be making 70 k in indy with 5 years experience that 's the average of salaried employees in indy web developers make more my friend 's starting job out of a no name local college here was with 5 years experience you can find a job paying a lot more than that your salary scale is automatically going to be skewed since tech pays more and a greater percentage of the population is going to be in tech in sf than indy the dude would probably be making more like 90k if he was competent and paying $ 500 a month for a 700 sqft apartment if he had some money for a down payment for $ 1400 a month he could afford the mortgage of like a 300 k house and could actually be putting that money into an investment rather than sinking that money into rent good luck buying a house in sf for less than 1m. but for sport let 's assume he does n't buy a home and is renting a small apartment so he is now paying only $ 6000 a year for housing and is making 20 k more than your estimate which after taxes is like what at least 16 k in take home money plus the 11 k he is paying less in rent than you assumed so he is actually making 27 k more than you are assuming in your math and now instead of making 20 k less a year than he would in sf he is making 7 k more again if he was smart and bought a house which is n't possible for 99 of people in sf the monetary gain is n't even close   and do n't get me started on the perks of california people from cali all seem to be under the assumption that things like nature restaurants and entertainment only exist in california

this is excellent advice i would make sure that you arm yourself with some solid questions about the company including some of the questions that they ask you interviews should be a two way conversation the more you get them talking the more comfortable they 'll be to recommend you some questions to ask 1 tell me a bit about your interviewer background this gets them talking a bit and allows you to relate with them 2 where do you see the company moving in the next 5 years 3 why is this job opening available 4 can you tell me a bit about the corporate culture 5 how can the company invest in me 6 what are the qualities that will make me successful in this job 7 tell me a bit about our competitors you should know some of them and what sets this company apart make sure you 're armed with as much information about the company as possible one of the things that set me apart when i interviewed at the company i 'm working at now was i came into the interview with the company 's financial report and started asking specific questions about details on that report also make sure to get a business card or contact information before you leave thank you letters are an annoying formality but it is necessary do n't rely on the recruiter to give you that information

as a non resident you need to file a form 1040nr in any year that you have a distribution withdrawal from your hsa from the instructions for form 1040nr who must file you also must file a return if you received hsa archer or medicare advantage distributions you file a form 8889 with your 1040nr and on that form you report how much money you took out of the hsa and how much of that was used for qualified medical expenses   if these distributions are used for qualified medical expenses even in your home country they are tax free   any part of the distribution that is not used for medical expenses is taxable and you would need to send in a tax payment with your 1040nr if you just cash out your hsa with no medical expenses you will pay tax on the amount plus a 20 penalty   if you have no other u.s. connected income your tax rate will be based solely on the amount of your distribution probably 10 15 so you are looking at a total tax of 30 35 it may be worth your while to leave the hsa in place and just withdraw it as you have medical expenses   you 'll need to file a tax return each year you take money out until the hsa is gone but you wo n't pay any tax

assuming no debt as you 've specified in the comments to your question the assets should generally be distributed proportional to ownership share   but without any sort of agreement there might be contention on what each investor 's share is and that might get fought out in court   with a corporation issuing shares the corporate charter probably defines the relationship between different classes of shares or specifies only one class   for a partnership though you could conceivable have people making claims of ownership stake based on labor in addition to any cash that they put up   messy if there 's no up front agreement

that would imply that a 30y us treasury bond only yields 2.78 which is low those are annualized yields   it would be more precise to say that a 30y us treasury bond yields 2.78 per year annualized over 30 years but that terminology is implied in bond markets so if you invest $ 1,000 in a 30-year t bond you will earn roughly 2.78 in interest per year also note that yield is calculated as if it compounded meaning that investing in a 30-year t bind will give you a return that is equivalent to putting it in a savings account that earns 1.39 interest half of 2.78 every 6 months and compounds meaning you earn interest on top of interest the trade off for these low yields is you have virtually no default risk   unlike a company that could go bankrupt and not pay back the bond the us government is virtually certain to pay off these bonds because it can print or borrow more money to pay off the debts in addition bonds in general and especially treasuries have very low market risk meaning that their value fluctuates much less that equities even   s&p 500 indices may move anywhere between and 50 in any given year while t bonds range of movement is much lower between -10 and 30 historically

do n't put money in things that you do n't understand etfs wo n't kill you ignorance will the leveraged ultra long short etfs hold swaps that are essentially bets on the daily performance of the market there is no guarantee that they will perform as designed at all and they frequently do not iirc in most cases you should n't even be holding these things overnight there are n't any hidden fees but derivative risk can wipe out portions of the portfolio and since the main asset in an ultra long short etf are swaps you 're also subject to counterparty risk if the investment bank the fund made its bet with can not meet it 's obligation you 're   may lost alot of money you need to read the prospectus carefully the re strategy the fund seeks daily investment results before fees and expenses that correspond to twice the inverse of the daily performance of the index the fund does not seek to achieve its stated investment objective over a period of time greater than a single day the prospectus re risk because of daily rebalancing and the compounding of each day ’s return over time the return of the fund for periods longer than a single day will be the result of each day ’s returns compounded over the period which will very likely differ from twice the inverse of the return of the index over the same period a fund will lose money if the index performance is flat over time and it is possible that the fund will lose money over time even if the index ’s performance decreases as a result of daily rebalancing the index ’s volatility and the effects of compounding see principal risks if you want to hedge your investments over a longer period of time you should look at more traditional strategies like options if you do n't have the money to make an option strategy work you probably ca n't afford to speculate with leveraged etfs either

i would go with the family route if i was you and i think many other people would if they were fortunate to have such a great option   this will allow you to move faster when your trying to buy a new house because you can easily get a mortage if you see a stellar deal also you can establish credit in much cheaper ways than paying the 4 or so on a mortgage finance a car that you have the money to buy because the interest rates are much lower and you build the credit while paying less interest or even better try and make most of your purchases on a 0 fee credit card and every 6 8 months get a new credit card to have multiple lines of ongoing credit   to use the mortage to establish credit is nt worth the 4 hit in wealth that it offers now mind you if your options were to buy the house with your own money outright or get a mortgage i would say get the mortgage because the added leverage would help your investments beat the market most years figure if you get 6 an average portfolio each year and you can write off the taxes on your mortgage you will be ahead by more than 2

if a company is valued correctly then paying dividends should lower the share price and buying back shares should leave the share price unchanged   if the share price is $ 100 and the company pays a $ 10 dividend then either its cash goes down by $ 10 per share it is has to borrow money for the same amount or some mixture either way the value of the company has gone down by $ 10 per share   if the share price is $ 100 and the company buys back 10 percent of its shares then it also has to find the money just as for the dividend and the value of the company goes down by 10 percent however the number of shares also goes down by 10 percent so the amount of value per share is the same and the share price should stay unchanged   now there are psychological effects many people like getting paid dividends so they will want to own shares of a company paying dividends so the share price goes up similar with a share buyback the fact that someone buys huge amounts of shares drives the price up both effects are purely psychological   a buyback has another effect if the shares are not valued correctly if the company is worth $ 100 per share but for some reason the is down to $ 50 then after the buyback the value per share has even gone up basically the company buys from stupid investors which increases the value for clever investors holding on to their shares if the were $ 200 then buying back shares would be a stupid move for the company

off the top of my head i do n't know of any publicly traded companies that routinely earmark distributions as return of capital but theoretically it 's certainly applicable to any publicly traded company the wikipedia article gives one situation in which a publicly traded company may use return of capital public business may return capital as a means to increase the debt equity ratio and increase their leverage risk profile since return of capital is a distribution it shrinks the firm 's equity thus increasing its leverage investopedia also has an article dividend facts you may not know that gives an example of when return of capital might be used sometimes especially in the case of a special large dividend part of the dividend is actually declared by the company to be a return of capital in this case instead of being taxed at the time of distribution the return of capital is used to reduce the basis of the stock making for a larger capital gain down the road assuming the selling price is higher than the basis for instance if you buy shares with a basis of $ 10 each and you get a $ 1 special dividend 55 cents of which is return of capital the taxable dividend is 45 cents the new basis is $ and you will pay capital gains tax on that 55 cents when you sell your shares sometime in the future a company may choose to earmark some or all of its distribution as return of capital in order to provide shareholders with a more beneficial tax treatment the irs describes this different tax treatment distributions that qualify as a return of capital are not dividends a return of capital is a return of some or all of your investment in the stock of the company a return of capital reduces the basis of your stock these distributions do n't necessarily count as taxable income except in some instances once the basis of your stock has been reduced to zero any further non dividend distribution is capital gain the irs also states a distribution generally qualifies as a return of capital if the corporation making the distribution does not have any accumulated or current year earnings and profits in this case the firm is lowering its equity because it 's paying distributions out of that equity instead of accumulated earnings profits a company may use return of capital to maintain a distribution even in times of financial difficulty   in the context of closed end funds however return of capital can be much more complicated and can affect the fund 's performance and reputation in numerous ways also jb king is correct in you that return of capital is not the same thing as return on the latter is a method for valuing a company and determining how efficient a company is where it comes to using its resources to quote jb king 's comment again

i love john 's answer but i just ca n't help myself from adding my 2 cents even though it 's over 5 years later i sold cars for a while in the late 90s and i mostly agree with john 's answer where i disagree though is that where i worked the salesperson did not have any authority to make a sale a sales manager was required to sign off on every sale that does n't mean that the manager had to interact with the buyer that could all be handled behind the scenes but the pricing and even much of the negotiating strategies were dictated by the sales managers some of the seasoned salespeople would estimate numbers on their own but occasionally you 'd hear the managers still chew them out with i wish you would n't have said that of course every dealership is different additional purchase advice there is a strategy that can work well for the buyer but only in scenarios where the salesperson is trying to prevent you from leaving they may start you as you are packing up or blocking your path to the door or even begging if this happens they are obviously desperate for whatever reason in this case if you came prepared with research on a good price that you are comfortable with then shoot lower and hold firm to the point of near exhaustion not so low that that they realize you 're too far they will let you leave at that point it needs to be within a reasonable amount perhaps at most 1 2 of the purchase price once you detect the salesperson is desperate you finally move up to your goal number or possibly a little lower typically the salesperson will be so happy to have gotten you to move at all that they 'll accept and if the managers are fed up too like 45 minutes after close they 'll accept too i saw this happen multiple times in a high pressure scenario i also used it once myself as a buyer if you are planning to purchase options that can be added at the dealer rather than from the factory keep them up your sleeve at first get your negotiations down to where you are a little further apart than the invoice price of the option then make your move for example suppose the option you want for $ 350 with an invoice of $ 300 get within about $ 400 of the dealer then offer to pay their price but only if they throw in the option you want this will throw them completely off guard because they did n't expect it and all of their calculations were based on without it if they say yes you effectively moved $ 100 and they moved $ 300 it 's much more likely that they 'll agree to this than taking $ 300 off the price of the car i 'm guessing the reason for this is partially due to how their accounting works with sticker price vs aftermarket price and partially psychological note this works best with new cars and make sure you only do this if it 's for items they can add after the fact even if they do n't have the part in stock it 's ok they can give you an iou but if the option requires a car change to something they do n't have on the lot it will probably just make them mad

yet the underlying truth is the same bid fixing we know it was done on a wide scale and we know it illegal it does n't matter what you think of the author you can verify that yourself and the court agreed   you can make all the excuse you want but if all you want to do is quibble about why he shot out one number for the total bond market instead of muni bonds from 2007 2008 actually one of the least relevant points to the story no matter which number you use then you 're missing the forest for the trees or your going out of your way to excuse widespread illegal business activity bid fixing is bid fixing that it only impacted the smaller mini bond market is n't something that negates the larger story here

the blue line is illustrating the net profit or loss the investor will realise according to how the price of the underlying asset settles at expiry the x axis represents the underlying asset price   the y axis represents the profit or loss in the first case the investor has a naked put write position having sold a put option   the strike price of the put is marked as a on the x axis   the maximum profit possible is equal to the total premium received when the option contract was sold   this is represented by that portion of the blue line that is horizontal and extending from the point above that point marked a on the x axis   this corresponds to the case that the price of the underlying asset settles at or above the strike price on the day of expiry   if the underlying asset settles at a price less than the strike price on the day of expiry then the option with be in the money   therefore the net settlement value will move from a profit to a loss depending on how far in the money the option is upon expiry   this is represented by the diagonal line moving from above the a point on the x axis and moving from a profit to a loss on the y axis   the diagonal line crosses the x axis at the point where the underlying asset price is equal to a minus the original premium rate at which the option was written i.e. net profit = zero   in the second case the investor has sold a put option with a strike price of b and purchase a put option with a strike price a where a is less than b.   here the reasoning is similar to the first example however since a put option has been purchase this will limit the potential losses should the underlying asset move down strongly in value the horizontal line above the x axis marks the maximum profit while the horizontal line below the x axis marks the maximum loss note that the horizontal line above the x axis is closer to the x axis that is the horizontal line below the x axis   this is because the maximum profit is equal to the premium received for selling the put option minus the premium payed for buying the put option at a lower strike price   losses are limited since any loss in excess of the strike price a plus the premium payed for the put purchased at a strike price of a is covered by the profit made on the purchased put option at a strike price of a

not sure what your point is but not all journalists are trying to predict the future some just report existing trends and let the readers make their own conclusions the trend the article talked about was work and therefore capital flowing to cities you said this trend would reverse over the next few years because trump i 'm not sure what you think that means i would that if america were to double down on trump we will lose the subsequent trade war we will fail to invest in or heed science we will fail to invest in national infrastructure yes i know trump promised this but the republicans only understand how to cut things and our healthcare system will be away to something worse than it already is    in that case talented workers would not only stop going to cities they would leave the country entirely

yep most 401k options suck you 'll have access to a couple dozen funds that have been blessed by the organization that manages your account i recently rolled my 401k over into a self directed ira at fidelity and i have access to the entire mutual fund market and can trade stocks bonds if i wish   as for a practical solution for your situation the options you 've given us are vague hopefully you 're able to do research on what positions these funds hold and make your own determination quick overview energy utilities doing good right now because they are low risk generally high dividends these will underperform in the short term as the market recovers health care riskier and many firms are facing a sizable patent cliff i am avoiding this sector emerging markets i 'm also avoiding this due to the volatility and accounting issues but it 's up to you most large us companies have emerging markets exposure so not necessary for to invest in a dedicated fund in my unprofessional opinion bonds avoid bonds are at their highest levels in decades short term they might be ok but medium term the only place to go is down all of this depends on your age and your own particular investment objectives do n't listen to me or anyone else without doing your own research
