even selling is n't riskless sure your house has gained but unless that 's due to improvements you made to it every other house in the neighborhood you might buy has gained value too so moving might not result in extracting any net value this is one of the reasons i keep reminding folks that a house is not an investment it can be a business if you 're renting it out but if you 're occupying it it is simply housing if you are lucky you 'll make a profit if and when you sell it but do n't count on that   it does store value but except for taking loans against that it 's had to access that value and lower loan rates than you 'd otherwise pay are not a huge value when you 'd save more if you do n't borrow at all the only use i 'm making of my house 's value is that by taking a very low rate mortgage when i could have paid cash i was able to leave more money in my investments arguably the safest leveraged investment possible

assuming take advantage means continue to build wealth as opposed to blow it all on a fancy holiday   downgrade as you already note you could downgrade downsize this could happen via moving to a smaller house in the same area or moving to an area where the cost of buying is less   heloc take out a home equity line of credit you could use the line of credit to do home improvements further boosting the asset value forced appreciation assuming the appreciation to date is simply market based caution is required if the house has already appreciated considerably you want to keep the home value within tolerance levels for the area best not to have the only $ 300 k house on a street of $ home equity loan assuming you have built up equity in the house you could leverage that equity to purchase another property for most people this would form part of the for getting the financing to purchase again

there are basically two ways to get value out of an appreciating asset such as a home a sell it and take the profit in the case of a home you presumably still have to live somewhere so unless you buy a cheaper home to replace it this does n't get you anywhere if you can get another house that is just as nice and in just as nice a location whatever you consider nice to be than this sounds like a winning option if it means moving to a less desirable home then you are getting the cash but losing the nice home you 'll have to decide if it 's worth it b use it as collateral for a loan in this case that means a second mortgage home equity loan or a home equity line of credit but this can be dangerous house prices are very volatile these days if the value of the house falls you could be stuck with debts greater than your assets in my humble opinion you should be very careful about doing this borrowing against your house to send the kids to college or pay for your spouse 's life saving operation may be reasonable borrowing against your house to go on a fancy vacation is almost surely a bad idea the vacation will be over within a couple of weeks but you could be paying off the debt for decades

there might just not be anything useful for you to do with that value as others mentioned helocs have their risks and issues too there is no risk less way to take advantage of the value outside of selling it is similar to owning a rare stamp that is worth a million what good does it do you if you do n't sell it nothing it is just a number on a sheet of paper or even only on some people 's minds

there are some important thing you need to understand about bonds and how they work   a bond does n't need an active market like a stock for example to have value     nonetheless there exist active markets for all of these bonds     the purpose of buying these bonds was not to step in due to the absence of a market   rather the purpose was to deliberately bid up the price of these bonds ahead of the market causing their price to rise and yields interest rates to drop   the fed can hold any and all of these bonds to maturity while receiving contractual payments all the while and never sell a single bond back to the market

basically you 'd take all the companies in a given universe like the s&amp;p 500 or the russell 3000 and instead of weighting them by market cap as they are currently done you would weight by an alternative measure   right now if you 're invested in an index that is market cap weighted you 're effectively momentum chasing if a stock runs up you 're going to have a higher weight in your portfolio because of it but only after the increase   an alternative that has come up with is using revenue weighting that way you 're using company fundamentals and only when the fundamentals are improving do you increase the weight in your portfolio   i have n't yet seen any research that explores weighting by other fundamentals i would think that revenues are n't perfect either and that you might want to weight by net income or to go several steps further by year over year free cash flow growth    it could be a seminal paper if you are the one who empirically identifies a better weighting methodology and then have everyone else fight over the theoretical underpinnings   this is effectively what goes into smart beta investing

if you are looking for an advisor to just build a portfolio and then manage it a robo advisor can be beneficial especially if the alternative is doing it your self assuming that you are not well versed in the markets the primary risk with one is that it does not build a portfolio that accurately represents your needs and risk tolerance some firms base the number of questions they ask you on sign up based not on what is needed to get a good profile but on how many before people decide that it is too much hassle and bail that usually results in poorer profiles also a live advisor may be better at really getting at your risk tolerance many of day our risk tolerance is one thing but in reality we are not so risk tolerant   once the profile is built the algorithms maintain your portfolio on a day by day basis if rebalancing opportunities occur they take advantage of it   the primary benefit of a robo advisor is lower fees or smaller minimum account balances the downside is the lack of human interaction and financial advise outside of putting together a portfolio

as a self employed handyman i can tell you this   any work that is done be it professional part time hobby or whatever else has to answer to two primary criteria   as you asked it has to be worthwhile in financial terms and more importantly in personal terms   in the long term charging low rates will her   not worth it someone once said i have no with he who charges cheaply because who better then he knows the value of his services   obviously one has to remain reasonable   then there is an factor in working for yourself   i call it losses since they are extremely difficult to calculate as noted above here already   in the first place they are extremely difficult to detect anyway   micro management will not tell you the losses you can only do it at the end of a period on a balance sheet   then you have to calculate a fair price in terms of lessons given and monies received the trick is to gain a fair assessment of worth to her without her needing to go into the books just as a simple gut feel   she needs to really feel good about it to maintain motivation for the future   otherwise i did it it does not work the other consideration is that when money changes hands it places a benchmark on the tuition and the relationship   one   it locks her into delivering professional work as she already is one   two   the students will be locked into giving fair and excellent commitment in being taught a simple calculation goes like this use the time span of a month as it is easier to break down available time per week   also remember that there will be extra hours spent in consultation with parents   this is a cost it has be calculated difficult at the start but keep track of it   one other thing   i do not give discounts of extend favours but i keep my prices reasonable i was told i am some 25 more expensive than the latest quotes but i kept on getting work with a high execution to quotation rate   floating prices are   impossible to track manage and justify   people talk to each other whether you like it or not   do proper reasonable calculations and be up front to all about how you work   in contract on paper   it just may be necessary to scale prices from beginner to advanced classes ok $ 50 seems a fair price i do n't live in the states but about three four big mac 's would compare about right   you are not selling time you are selling expertise decide how much she wants out of it per month forget retirement you live now   this income will also cover other invisible extraneous work determine how much time will be spent in giving lessons   you can only charge for visible work done basic hourly rate = monthly income lesson hours then there 's a catch   research has shown that owners of one man and small businesses spend about 55 of their time in getting new business   so now charged hourly rate = basic hourly rate divided by 45 this could you but these are hard commercial facts   things could appear to be extremely expensive   you will however have a solid base from which to decide as you go further   the accounting is a good place to start but she you both rather have to feel good about the rewards and the counter performances great success to you both

if you 've got shares in a company that 's filed for u.s. chapter 11 bankruptcy that sucks it really does   i 've been there before and you may lose your entire investment   if there 's still a market for your shares and you can sell them you may want to just accept the loss and get out with what you can however shares of bankrupt companies are often delisted once bankrupt since the company no longer meets minimum exchange listing requirements   if you 're stuck holding shares with no market you could lose everything but that 's not always the case chapter 11 is n't total and final bankruptcy where the company ceases to exist after liquidation of its assets to pay off its debts   rather chapter 11 is a section of the u.s. bankruptcy code that permits a company to attempt to reorganize or renegotiate its debt obligations during chapter 11 reorganization a company can negotiate with its creditors for a better arrangement   they typically need to demonstrate to creditors that without the burden of the heavy debt they could achieve profitability   such reorganization often involves creditors taking complete or majority ownership of the company when it emerges from chapter 11 through a debt for equity swap that 's why you as an investor before the bankruptcy are very likely to get nothing or just pennies on the dollar any equity you may be left holding will be considerably diluted in value   it 's rare that shareholders before a chapter 11 bankruptcy still retain any equity after the company emerges from chapter 11 but it is possible but it varies from bankruptcy to bankruptcy and it can be complex as pointed out investopedia has a great article an overview of corporate bankruptcy   here 's an excerpt if a company you 've got a stake in    files for bankruptcy chances are    you 'll get back pennies to the dollar    different bankruptcy proceedings or    filings generally give some idea as to    whether the average investor will get    back all or a portion of his    investment but even that is    determined on a case by case basis    there is also a order of    creditors and investors of who get    paid back first second and last in    this article we 'll explain what    happens when a public company files    for protection under u.s. bankruptcy    laws and how it affects investors       how it affects investors       when your company goes bankrupt there    is a very good chance you will not get    back the full value of your    investment in fact there is a chance    you wo n't get anything back wikipedia has a good article on chapter 11 bankruptcy at chapter 11 title 11 united states code

your plan sounds quite sound to me   i think that between the choices of $ 800 for loans $ 300 for retirement and $ 1100 for loans both are good choices and you are n't going to go wrong either way    some of the factors you might want to consider i like your retirement savings choices i myself use the admiral version of voo plus a slightly specialized but still large etf that allows me to do a bit of shifting   having something that 's at least a bit counter market can be helpful for balancing so something that will be going up some when the market overall is down some i would n't necessarily do bonds at your age but international markets are good for that or a stock etf that 's more stable than the overall market   if you 're using vanguard look at the minimums for buying admiral shares usually a few grand and aim to get those if possible as they have significantly lower fees though voo seems to pretty much tie the admiral version vfiax so in that case it may not matter so much as far as the target retirement funds you can certainly do those but i prefer not to they have somewhat higher though for vanguard not crazy high expense ratios   realistically you can do the same yourself quite easily

yes it is possible to withdraw money from your roth ira before retirement but i would n't necessarily advise you to do so   here 's the good news and the bad news the good news unlike a traditional ira money contributed to a roth ira is done so on an after tax basis meaning you do n't benefit from a tax deduction on contributions so the money you withdraw from your roth ira will not be taxed entirely as ordinary income in fact you are allowed to withdraw the amount of your original contributions also known as basis without any taxes or penalties let 's imagine you originally deposited $ 9000 of that current $ 10 k total value then in such a case $ 9000 could be withdrawn tax and penalty free the bad news when it comes to the investment earnings the other $ 1000 in my example   it 's a different story   since you would n't be age 59 1/2 at the time of withdrawal any money taken out beyond your original contributions would be considered a non qualified withdrawal and subject to both ordinary income taxes plus a 10 early withdrawal penalty   ouch perhaps you might want to restrict your withdrawal to your original contributions   i would imagine if you 've had the account for such a short period of time that much or all of your account value is original contributions anyway a good article about the rules for early ira withdrawals is about.com 's tax penalty for early distribution of retirement funds note if your roth ira funds were the result of a rollover from another account type other rules may apply see roth ira wikipedia for more detail search for rollover regarding the withdrawal process itself and the timing you should check with your account custodian on how to proceed

real estate has historically been the most sound investment of all times not only does property increase in value which is what you want every investment to do it does so at the highest rate with the lowest risk most return on investment like a stock in the market the potential rate of gain is to the potential loss the more secure an investment the lower the potential gain but with real estate property typically doubles in value every 10 years our overall economy is on an upward turn recovering from a time   where values tanked to jump in now is probably better than waiting for any amount of time be it 1 month or 1 year you concern about being tied in to this investment is a valid concern however since the market is in an upward turn you should be more and more able to turn around and sell it later on the best thing that you could potentially do would be to invest in a rental property where your cost of investment your mortgage note is paid by the renters however being a landlord is always a risky business hence the higher rate of return which considering your investment is ultimately zero the return rate is huge    the trick would be to take the payments to you and keep it in an account that you use to pay for any repairs upgrades or marketing in between when the unit is vacant but with your parents losing their house this may not be possible unless you take their home and then keep the living the same as they are now one possibility to help you get your foot in the door of being a property owner not necessarily investor and help your parents keep their house if that is what they would like to do is re finance with them if you ca n't afford the entire mortgage but they are capable of filling the gap between what you can afford and what their property costs then you become partnered with them and when if their circumstances change they can always buy you out

first what structure does your index fund have   if it is an open end mutual fund there are no bid ask spread as the structure of this security is that it is priced once a day and transactions are done with that price   if it is an exchange traded fund then the question becomes how well are authorized participants taking advantage of the spread to make the fund track the index well   this is where you have to get into the creation and redemption unit construct of the exchange traded fund where there are in kind transactions done to either create new shares of the fund or redeem out shares of the fund   in either case you are making some serious assumptions about the structure of the fund that do n't make sense given how these are built index funds have lower expense ratios and are thus cheaper than other mutual funds that may take on more costs   if you want suggested reading on this look at the investing books of john c. bogle who studied some of this rather extensively in addition to being one of the first to create an index fund that became known as bogle 's where a couple of key ones would be common sense on mutual funds new for the intelligent investor and bogle on mutual funds new perspectives for the intelligent investor in the case of an open end fund there has to be a portion of the fund in cash to handle transaction costs of running the fund as there are management fees to come from running the fund in addition to dividends from the stocks that have to be carefully re invested and other matters that make this quite easy to note   vanguard 500 index investor has in cash as an example here where you could look at any open end mutual fund 's portfolio and notice that there may well be some in cash as part of how the fund is managed   it ’s the execution stupid would be one of a few articles that looks at the idea of tracking error or how well does an index fund actually track the index where it can be noted that in some cases there can be a little bit of active management in the fund just as a minor side note when i lived in the us i did invest in index funds and found them to be a good investment   i 'd still recommend them though i 'd argue that while some want to see these as really simple investments there can be details that make them quite interesting to my mind how is its price set then the price is computed by taking the sum value of all the assets of the fund minus the liabilities and divided by the number of outstanding shares   the price of the assets would include the closing price on the stock rather than a bid or ask similar pricing for bonds held by the fund derivatives and cash equivalents   similarly the liabilities would be costs a fund has to pay that may not have been paid yet such as management fees brokerage costs etc is it a weighted average of all the underlying stock spreads or does    it stand on its own and stems from the usual supply demand laws there is n't any spread used in determining the net asset value for the fund   the fund prices are determined after the market is closed and so a closing price can be used for stocks the liabilities could include the costs to run the fund as part of the accounting in the fund that most items have to come down to either being an asset something with a positive value or a liability something with a negative value something to consider also is the size of the fund   with over $ in assets a .01 amount is still $ 700,000 which is quite a large amount in some ways

gt the fact remains that the very wealthy and very large corporations are structured so that they do n't pay that particular type of tax   going to have to stop you right there most fortune 500 companies pay a lot of tax additionally they get targeted for audits quite a bit because of their size and complexity but at the end of the day if it shows a net profit on their income statement they 're generally paying tax   individual tax law is quite a bit different and not my current area of expertise though i did prepare individual tax returns before i started working for the government and i can say that there are quite a few more provisions for avoiding tax for an individual regardless if you 're playing by the rules there can be a variety of reasons why your effective rate is lower    a progressive scale for capital gains will just lead to high income individuals transferring the form of income to something else

how much taxes would i pay on my income from the rent they would pay me the same as on any other income california does n't have any special taxes for rental passive income ca and the federal tax laws do have special treatment but it is for losses from rental income is considered unearned regular income and is taxed at regular brackets would i be able to deduct the cost of the mortgage from the rental income the cost of mortgage yes i.e. the interest you pay similarly you can deduct any other expense needed to maintain the property this is assuming you 're renting it out at fmv if not would i pay the ordinary income tax on that income in particular would i pay ca income tax on it even though the property would be in wa yes do n't know how wa taxes rental income but since you are a california tax resident you will definitely be taxed by california on this as part of your worldwide income

so i see that you replied again despite i am done with you thanks we will resolve this debate one day   gt when you say something is maybe it is factual but when i say something is maybe it 's fiction i had assumed something else   you really try very hard to not understand simple things and it seems that you succeed in that   again my maybe is about how trump will reduce drug prices as he said and says he would your maybe"(s are about how trump does not want and will not reduce drug prices despite him saying he would so you have a maybe facts that trump will not reduce drug prices while i have a maybe on how he would do it    any additional questions objections or misunderstanding on your side in regards to this subject    gt i did give you a possibility which is a maybe so that means i am wrong and global warming is no risk at all yes what you say is starting to make sense   if there are clear proofs that global warming very slight rise in temperature is or will cause instability or expenses then i ca n't argue back   so all you can come up with are possibilities and more maybe"(s to tell us about and expenses and you think this will convince anyone except members of the church of    for god sake i even asks for specifics and you did not and can not name any will we have wars will we have diseases and will we have hunger    of course not wars will not start because it 's slightly more hot disease will not spread because it 's a bit more hot hunger will not occur because warmer weather and more rain is just even more food   what on earth are you talking about what are the terrible things that will happen if it 's a bit hotter    are you going to be al gore again who in his an inconvenient truth truth movie in 2006 predicted there will be no more and other catastrophes well an inconvenient truth the will come out and sorry we have and nothing from the first movie became true nothing i loved how he said in the first movie stronger storms will kill and destroy the last few years had less storms than ever   gt;&gt how could a person like you who seek truth vote for democrats   gt it can only be because i have serious mental health problems there is no other explanation   yes i believe you   blind belief in a religion far left liberalism and/or make any person blind to truth logic facts and even moderate views   gt;&gt you are trying to convince me that russia knew he trump would win the gop debate against 13 others and colluded with him between july until the elections november to make him win   gt that is totally it i am so impressed that even though i never mentioned russia at all you were able to see through my facade an my actual goal in this discussion   yes you did not mention russians but you see i easily figure out people like you   you actually also believe that russians are responsible for trump in addition to all the terrible things you believe about trump    but the dnc and hillary oh no they are fine despite hillary selling and getting for selling 20 of usa uranium to russia making $ 500,000 for a speech to russian bankers etc   so i will not stop and demand if you can to tell me about one action by trump you oppose to   also tell me why i it would be better if voted hillary dnc what would they do better for us that trump does not do

some places banks credit unions will allow you to refinance a auto loan my credit union only does this if the original loan was with another lender they will send the money to the old lender then give you a loan under the new terms they are trying to get your business not necessarily looking for a way make less money for themselves   you will have to see how much you will save which will be based on the delta of the length of the loan or the change in interest rate or both my credit union has a calculator to show you the numbers based on keeping the size of the payments the same or keeping the number of payments the same   make sure you understand any limitations regarding the refinance based on the age of the car and if you are underwater

what you 're describing is called timing the market   that is if you correctly predict when the market will drop you can sell before the drop wait for the drop then buy after the drop has occurred   sell high buy low the fundamental problem with that though is what ends up happening on average is you end up slightly behind   there 's quite a lot of literature on this see betterment 's explanation for example   forbes click through ad first also has a detailed piece on the matter now we 're not really talking hft issues here and there are some structural things that some argue you can take advantage of restrictions on some organizational investors for example similar to a blackjack dealer who has to hit on 16   however everyone else knows about these too so it 's hard to gain much of an edge plenty of people say they can time the market right and even yourself perhaps you timed a particular drop accurately   this tends to lead to false confidence though how many drops that you timed badly do you remember ultimately most investors end up slightly down when they attempt to time the market because of the transaction costs if you guess two drops one right and one wrong and they have exactly opposite gains losses before commissions you will lose a bit on each due to commission and because of the overall upward trend in the market ie if you picked at random one month a year to be out of the market you 'd lose around 10 annualized gains from doing that same applies here all of that aside there is one major caveat risk tolerance   if you are highly risk tolerant say a 30 year old investing your 401(k then you should stay in no matter what   if you 're not say you 're 58 and retiring in a few years then knowledge that there 's a higher risk time period coming up might suggest moving to a less risky portfolio even at the known cost of some gains

when you set up a short sale for equities you are borrowing stock from someone else typically another client at the broker   the broker usually an agreement to let your shares be borrowed for short sales in your account details   so if client a wants to short a stock he borrows stock from client b to do the short sale it 's usually not this direct as they can borrow from many clients   if client b then wants to sell his shares if the broker ca n't shift around assets to find another client 's shares to let client a borrow then he has to close the short position out because he does n't have the shares in the brokerage to let client a borrow to short anymore

a bid is an offer to buy something on an order book so for example you may post an offer to buy one share at $ 5 an ask is an offer to sell something on an order book at a set price for example you may post an offer to sell shares at $ 6 a trade happens when there are bids asks that overlap each other or are at the same price so there is always a spread of at least one of the smallest currency unit the exchange allows betting that the price of an asset will go down traditionally by borrowing some of that asset and then selling it hoping to buy it back at a lower price and pocket the difference minus interest so let 's say as per your example you borrow 100 shares of company x expecting the price of them to go down you take your shares to the market and sell them you make a market sell order a market ask this matches against a bid and you receive a price of $ 5 per share now let 's pretend that you change your mind and you think the price is going to go up you instantly regret your decision in order to pay back the shares you now need to buy back your shares as $ 6 which is the price off the ask offers on the order book because of this spread you have lost money you sold at a low price and bought at a high price meaning it costs you more money to repay your borrowed shares so when you are shorting you need the spread to be as tight as possible

you will tend to find as options get closer to expiry within 2 months of expiry they tend to be traded more also the closer they are to being in the money they more they are traded so there tends to be more demand for these options than long dated ones that are far out of the money when there is this higher demand there is less need for a market maker to step in to assure liquidity thus there should be no effect on the underlying stock price due to the high demand for options i would say that market makers would mainly get involved in providing liquidity for options way out of the money and with long periods until expiry 6 + months where there is little demand to start with and open interest is usually quite low

while the other answers are good i wanted to expand a little on why i feel a roth is a bad way to go unless you are young first let 's pretend you have a 25 tax rate and your investments will go up 5 per year for 10 years you contribute 6 of income for one year you can do a traditional or a roth 401k ira here 's the math traditional 6 of income invested grows at 5 for 10 years taxed at 25 on withdrawl = income 6 1.05 ^ 10 100 25 = income 6 .75 = of your original income but this is after taxes roth taxes taken out of income then 6 of that goes into the fund(s still grows at 5 for 10 years not taxed at withdrawl = income 100 25 6 1.05 ^ 10 = income 75 6 = of your original income again this is after taxes look familiar they are the same it 's the simple property of mathematics so why do a traditional vs. a roth the reason is that your tax bracket changes this changes because your income changes say when you retire you plan to have your home or vehicle paid for you expect to be able to live on $ 50,000 per year this means when you make more than $ 50,000 you should do a traditional plan and when you make less than this you should do a roth plan example you make $ 100,000 and your upper bracket is now 30 you save 30 by doing a traditional and then pay back 10 20 and 30 as you withdraw a salary of $ 50,000 traditional = better example you make $ 30,000 annually your upper bracket is 20 you pay 20 on a roth then you withdraw funds to get to $ 50,000 and never pay the higher bracket roth = better roth advocates typically bring up tax rates of course they will go up they insist so you always should do a roth not so fast taxes have gone down in recent years no one please start a political debate with me some went up some went down but overall federal income rates dropped even if taxes rose 5 a traditional will still be better than a roth in many cases

that number may be based on a long term historical view of the stock market   if you look at some long term charts for the dow   or the s&p500 you 'll see that overall the upward trend is pretty good   however there are some pretty huge flat spots in those charts and if the majority of your have been made during one of those periods you may not have seen a lot of growth if you look at periods between 10 17 years or so you can find places where it would have really sucked to be you look at the s&p chart and imagine 66 to 83 ouch and places where things were stellar    if you expand to about say 30 years or so then it 's hard to find a period without at least some good growth in there somewhere   if you panicked during a downturn and sold on the low things of course get much worse   how your own portfolio has done will depend a lot on how the funds you chose have done how much you put into equity vs fixed income and if the fixed income was in actual bonds or a bond fund    bond funds are subject to a lot more as interest rates rise or fall than something like a t bill or i bond that you own outright and plan to hold to maturity

mary who has a column on money in the nz herald had this to say on the matter research shows that over and over again the top dogs in one decade can be bottom dogs the next decade and vice versa past performance really is no guide to the future fees are much less likely than returns to change over time and low fees make a big difference to the long term growth of your account so just how low are your fund 's fees perhaps that means the most sensible bet would be to pick a fund with good but not necessarily best historical returns but also with low fees personally i 've also included ethics as a factor in the decision and i chose the ethical investment option offered by hoping that it makes a small difference as explained here i have no affiliation with

from what i understand i never had an resp but would consider one for a future child with the right type of withdrawal you can use the resp money for anything education related basically know that the resp is considered to have three within it 1 your contributions 2 contributions from the government through the canada education savings grant cesg and 3 the return on the investment or accumulated earnings the government contributes an extra 20 on top of your contributions annually by way of the cesg up to a $ 500 max tuition as you noted official tuition fees reported on a fee slip is where one large chunk of the resp will go this will be pulled out of your original contributions and is known as a post secondary education withdrawal different resp administrators bank discount brokerage etc determine what sort of proof of would be required but it ought to be similar between them and different educational institutions this withdrawal is not taxable by either you or the student since the contributions were made with after tax dollars educational assistance payments are for other expenses that the student would incur by being at university in the first 13 weeks of studies you can request up to $ 5000 in withdrawals full time studies $ 2500 for par time after which there is no limit each payment is made up of the cesg and accumulated earnings portions of the resp whose proportions are determined based on the amount this is considered taxable income for the student or beneficiary in the year the withdrawal is made it gets a bit fuzzy here from my understanding the student would ostensibly be able to purchase anything that they could rationalize as education related and i 'm not sure what sort of proof different banks would need maybe just the confirmation of is enough this is the part of my post that should directly answer your question which using this terminology boils down to what sorts of expenses can i use the withdrawals for to this from what i 've read out there i would say that you could probably purchase anything from the student 's point of view they are enrolled in a qualifying education institution and if they do n't spend the money on education related purchases money required for those purchases will have to come from somewhere else anyway   other withdrawals any other type of withdrawal is like walking through a you can withdraw the original contributions without paying tax on them but you would need to pay back the corresponding cesg back to the government other types of withdrawals would be taxable and may incur a 20 penalty i do n't have any more details on that as i mentioned this is from what i 've read and looked into for future resp purposes a new concept that has popped up is resp vs tfsa the tfsa provides the same tax shelter after tax dollar contributions no tax on the gains but also allows for no tax on the withdrawals to add to that the tfsa withdrawals are tax free as well the main benefit that the resp offers that the tfsa does n't is the cesg my current opinion and i could be wrong is that you should contribute $ 2500 annually to the resp in order to get the $ 500 max cesg and anything else that you 'd like to contribute should go in a tfsa but i digress hopefully my long winded response makes some sense enjoy

you almost never want to repay a student loan early as you 've realised you can put the money in an isa instead and earn more interest than you 're paying on the loan if you withdrew money from the isa each month to replace the repayments being taken from your salary there 'd be money left in the isa when you finished repaying the loan this is also the cheapest debt you 'll ever have so if you repay it now and then end up borrowing money elsewhere in the future you 'll probably be worse off in particular if you expect to have a mortgage at some point you 'll probably be better off keeping the money to add to a deposit rather than repaying it now and then borrowing more on the mortgage you should also consider how long it 'll take you to repay the loan normally if you do n't expect to finish repaying within 25 years you 'd be throwing money away by repaying early this is more of an issue for the larger loans

the following advice assumes that you have a significant amount already in the account in cash equivalents if you are only talking a few hundred bucks or so then just jump in at the next dip like today 's if you have a larger amount to move into equities the safest approach is to gradually move it into investments over some period of time at regular intervals regardless of what is going on in the market this mitigates the risk of investing it all into an fund that is peaking at the exact moment you buy   so for example you might invest 20 of the total amount each month for 5 months to gradually get into the market the larger the amount you are investing the more you probably want to spread it out but do n't spread it out much further than a year or you are losing opportunity cost by leaving your money in cash type investments with likely a very poor rate of return this strategy is called dollar cost averaging if you want to research it more

i live in the uk so it 's a little different but generally you 'd have one account a current account which would have a visa mastercard debit card associated before working and any high street bank do n't know what the us equivalent would be but big banks such as hsbc santander will offer you a savings account which pays a v small amount of interest as well as bonds as all sorts from what i know most people have their salary paid into their current account which would be the spending account with a card associated and would transfer a set amount to a savings account personally i have a current account and a few different saving accounts which do not have cards associated one savings account has incoming transfers money received and i can use online banking to transfer that to my current account instantly at least i 've done it standing at atm 's and the money is there seconds later but again this is the uk not us this way my primary current account never has more than £ 10 15 in it whenever i know i need money i 'll transfer it from the instant access account this has saved me before when i 've been called by my bank for transactions a few £ 100 each which would have been authorised i kept all my money in my current account if you do n't have money and do nt have an overdraft what are they meant to do with it the other savings account i had setup so that i could not transfer money out without going into a branch with id etc less to stop someone stealing my money and more to be physically unable to waste money on a friday if i do n't arrive at the bank before so saves a lot of time us banking is a nightmare i do n't imagine any of this will translate well and i think if you had your salary paid into your savings on a friday and missed the bank with no online banking facilities transfers that are n't instant you 'd be in a lot of trouble if the whole current + instant access savings account thing does n't work to well i 'm sure a credit charge card will work instead of a separate current account spend everything on that within reason and what you can pay back afford to pay stupid interest on on a card with a 0 purchase rate and pay it back using an account you 're paid into but is never used for expenses some credit cards might even reward you for this type of thing but again credit can be dangerous a older retired relative of mine has all of his money in one account refuses a debit card from the bank every time he is offered he has a card but it is n't a visa mastercard it 's purely used for authentication in branch and keeps that in a safe spends everything he needs on his credit card and writes them a sort of cheque goes into the bank with id and signs it for the full balance when his statement arrives no online banking no chance of him getting key logged any time soon tldr the idea of separating the accounts your money goes in salary wise and goes out spending is n't a bad idea that is if wire transfers do n't take 3 5 days where you are

when interest rates rise the price of bonds fall because bonds have a fixed coupon rate and since the interest rate has risen the bond 's rate is now lower than what you can get on the market so it 's price falls because it 's now less valuable bonds diversify your portfolio as they are considered safer than stocks and less volatile however they also provide less potential for gains although diversification is a good idea for the individual investor it is far too complicated and incurs too much transaction costs not to mention that rebalancing would have to be done on a regular basis in your case where you have mutual funds already it is probably a good idea to keep investing in mutual funds with a theme which you understand the industry 's role in the economy today rather than investing in some special bonds which you can not relate to the benefit of having a mutual fund is to have a professional manage your money and that includes diversification as well so that you do n't have to do that

the broker that is issuing the moneys after vesting is more than likely deducting a notional amount of tax and ni based on uk income tax laws if you are not a uk resident then you should pay income tax on those stock options based on your own tax residency best thing to do is speak directly with the broker to explain the situation ask them to not deduct anything from your stock options but keep in mind that you will need to declare these earnings yourself and pay the correct rate of tax from my own personal experience the uk employer more than likely receives the net value after the notional tax and ni have been deducted and in usual circumstances create a tax liability on your payslip if you were working and had earnings if of course this deduction is being made by the employer then you can simply ask them to correct this most uk payroll software will automatically deduct tax and ni for payments after leaving unless manually so they probably are n't aware if it is them doing so

if you really believe in the particular stocks then do n't worry about their daily price   overall if the company is sound and presumably paying a dividend then you 're in it for the long haul notwithstanding that it is reasonable to look for a way out   the two you describe are quite different in their specifics selling sounds like the simpler of the two but the trigger event and if it is automatic or manual matters   if you are happy to put in a sell order at some time in the future then just go ahead with that many brokers can place a stop order that will trigger on a certain price threshold being hit   do note however that by default this would place a market order and depending on the price that breaks through in the event of a flash crash depending on how fast the brokers systems were you could find yourself selling quite cheaply a stop limit order will place a limit order at a triggered price   this would limit your overall downside loss but you might not sell at all if the market is really running away options are another reasonable way to deal with the situation sort of like insurance   in this case you would likely buy a put which would give you the right but not the obligation to sell the stock at the price the that was specified in the option   in this case no matter what you are out the price of the option itself hence my to insurance but if the event never happens then that was the price you paid to have that peace of mind i can not recommend a specific course of action but hopefully that fleshed out the options you have

i appreciate having an attorney ’s thoughts   clearly we have different optics   mine is as a consumer who has never actively sought out being a member of a class in a class action suit but have had it on me in each case the settlement was either a very nominal amount e.g. $ or a coupon or credit for future services from the company that allegedly had wronged me   in virtually each settlement the attorneys got handsome fees and the firms were protected from future similar suits from anyone who had not gone through the process of opting out    in one case however i and all other members of the class except the lead plaintiffs i presume were to get nothing while the attorneys were to get literally a half a dollars   the notion was that members of the class had eaten the evidence the same evidence that somehow justified $ compensation to the lawyers   of course you recognize that as the subway foot long sub case where subway was guilty of the monumental crime of selling foot long subs that were not necessarily 12 inches long oh the horror so let me ask you from your optic how do we protect rights while eliminating the incentives for frivolous suits or suits in which the consumer gets nothing of value   and i include the coupon as consumers getting nothing of value as they require the consumer to further patronize the perpetrator of the alleged wrong doing

value averaging has you shift the balance of your portfolio over time not the amount of contributions   so you can only do it if you have a portfolio holding both risky assets shares etc and some cash you start out by making a plan about how much you will contribute every month and at what rate you expect the share part of the portfolio to grow   perhaps based on 20th century data you think an 8 growth rate is reasonable   or alternatively if you know your desired final amount obviously you can work backwards to a desired rate from that if in any month the share part is falling below its expected growth path you would put more money into it possibly your whole paycheck contribution plus some from the savings cash account   on the other hand if the share component is growing too fast you would put all your additional savings into cash   so if your investments are doing well you 're not supposed to spend the excess money but rather to put it aside into a dedicated cash account to top up your share component when prices fall in theory this has the auto benefit of dollar cost averaging but even better when prices are high you 'll automatically buy fewer shares or even sell some conversely when prices are low you 'll buy extra shares from your reserve account if it turns out your estimate was unreasonably optimistic and over your lifetime shares only ever average 3 you 'll end up with an entirely share portfolio and a ride than you might have liked   if you have horrible luck and over your entire investing life shares return less than cash which has happened though not yet in the usa then this will be worse than a standard balanced portfolio the original book value averaging by has a pretty good explanation of various cases though i would say some of the examples are worked in excessive detail i have not implemented this myself one reason being that the amount i 'm able to save from year to year varies as it probably does for you and so predicting a path is not quite so simple as he assumes   you could still do it i suppose i think you could get a very crude approximation to this by simply directing your savings into cash when the share market 's rate of growth over the last several years is above what you think is the long term average

auto correlation is a statistical concept for measuring repeating patterns in series   in stocks it is of particular interest as if future prices can be reliably guessed from past prices a lot of money could be made    note even in cases where auto correlations are high and persistent near 1 there is still some possibility that the next time period would be down even if the previous period was up   now the important part here is that high and persistent auto correlation also means once the price falls the next period the price is also more likely to fall once one period was down the next period is more likely to be down so the price does not need to go to infinity   instead it generally would display up and down trends now the key word above for investing is persistence for stocks auto correlations are at best persistent at reasonable time scales   so even if a stock was highly auto correlated during a previous period it is tough to make consistent money off of trading on these past trending patterns   this does not mean some people do n't try

there is no catch you 've been a good customer and your bank wants to reward you for it one of the ways you build credit is by having more credit available so by increasing your credit limit its lowering your credit utilization rate one of the factors that go into your credit score which is a good thing so your bank trusts you with more credit which again is a good thing you can also request a line of credit increase yourself without waiting for the bank to do so but there 's a 6 month wait between each increase assuming you get one i always ask every 6 months and have gotten approved each time and it 's helped my credit score tremendously

the long and short of it is the mortgage company has a significant interest in the resale value of the home in the event of a default   imagine a scenario where you say to yourselves that you 're not going to repair the deck just yet meh we 'll do that next summer and something happens that causes a default on the mortgage the resale value of the home may be harmed by the deck even though you 're willing to live with it   that being the case the mortgage company has every right to insist that you carry out the repairs in order to maintain the property in salable condition so the essence of it is you do n't have much choice but to do the repairs keep in mind too that the insurance company paid for the roof and the deck to be repaired   if they were to learn that you now have no intention of using the money to repair the property you could end up in legal hot water with them   after all you did accept the check for repairs that you 're now not carrying out

in the netherlands its cheaper in some cases to have a mortgage then to own a house    example if you own a house you pay more taxes because you own something expensive you have to pay < owners tax so if you instead of owning the house   keep the mortgage low and only pay the mortgage interest the interest will be much lower then the tax you would have to pay the sweet spot for lowest interest and not having to pay the owners tax is different for any mortgage but by grandparents use this method and they pay a really small amount for a rather large house

no insult detroit was to cars what glasgow was to ships it happened all over the west during the last 30 years   is funny though i live in a small town really a few miles out of glasgow is technically more accessible to me to the north   glasgow has been pretty much rebuilt from it 's and fame   still issues but they are getting there detroit will too   in south west we had a massive industry of lace and mining once   some of the best in the world apparently that all disappeared to the far east during the 50s during the we had a massive plant and even dec had production here   guess what as those could be automated that was all too   further north we had silicon i believe the pun was intended   ibm had a massive site of many thousand workers lenovo took them over and within a few years that was all gone too   the original ibm workers had great benefits they originally sold the site and off the staff and then re leased the site and took all the staff back on via an agency   the only difference being all the benefits of working for ibm were gone   that went on for a few years or so and then lenovo took over consumer hardware side     this being the side of things built for silicon and then hardly used     to be fair there is still a huge site at and we are supposedly getting another 3k workers back a bit like the cat story   this area will be very grateful for the work just like your southern states   the trend i interpreted is that as soon as things could be automated that was when things went away and when margins started to fall out of electronics that was just the excuse they needed   in theory a production line that had 100 staff might be doable with just 10 these days maybe with all the horrific horror stories of abroad companies are now being able to justify 10 plebs over here   it starts to sound like i 'm being slightly anti globalist here i 've no problem with globalism but the same thing that helps companies should allow me to buy shit from abroad at the cost i can find rather than being forced to buy region locked or crap   if it costs you £ 5 to make a shirt in india you should be selling it to me for £ 15 not £ 35   what you talk of does represent more what happened across europe rather than just the uk poland and the previous eastern bloc being your southern states   thatcher for good or bad the unions in the uk a new one when she was in power hence the only 1 time the natural gas powered plant was fired up   we have rights in the uk that are now being legislated from europe but to be honest they hardly seem worth the paper they are written on the unions like yours just do n't have the anymore   on thinking about it do you think the earthquake had anything to do with the migration of that cat site back to the us

most brokers have a margin maintenance requirement of 30   in your example it would depend on how much money you 're borrowing from your broker on margin consider this you have $ 250 and short aapl at $ 500 on margin this would be a common scenario federal law requires investors to have at least 50 of their margin equity when opening a transaction if your broker had a requirement of 30 they would require that for your $ 500 position you have at least $ 500 .3 = $ 150 equity since you are currently above that number at $ 250 you will not be hit with a margin call say the price of aapl doubles and now your position is worth $ 1000 $ 1000 .3 = $ 300 which is $ 50 above your initial equity your broker will now consider you eligible for a margin call most will not execute the call right away you will often have some time to either sell cover stock or add funds to your account but not all brokers will warn you if you are breaking margin requirements and sometimes margin calls can take you by surprise if you are not paying attention also many will charge interest on extra margin borrowed

mortgage is a secured debt a combination of a promissory note and a security interest providing the mortage holder a secured interest in the property yes you are in debt but that depends upon whether you define the term in debt as a debt appearing on the balance sheet or the net of assets liabilities is less than zero whether you have a debt expense on the income statement budget or whether the net of income expenses is less than zero one person might look at their budget find the monthly mortgage payment listed and judge that they have a debt payment and thus are in debt or they might look at their expenses find they exceed their income and judge that they are in debt another person might look at their balance sheet compare assets to liabilities and only say they were in debt when their liabilities exceeded their assets some people view mortgage debt as good debt as they view certain debts as good and others as bad trust me having a high mortgage payment higher 30 of your net income is hard and over 40 is bad consider you balance sheet and your income statement   on your balance sheet the house appears on the asset side with an estimated value while the mortgage really the promissory note part of the mortgage appears on the liability side on your income statement your house does not appear on the income side but the mortgage promissory note payment appears on the expense side so you clearly have both a liability with a clearly defined value and an expense with a clearly defined payment but do you have an asset according to an accountant you have an asset and a liability but you do not have a business asset that is producing revenue income nor do you have a business asset that can be amortized and expensed to reduce taxable income when we think about an asset does the word have the connotation of some thing with value something that produces income   well by that measure a house only provides income when we rent it out and only has value when we consider selling it as millions of families discovered during the housing price collapse when the market price of your asset falls substantially your personal financial status can fall negative and you can be broke

you do n't need to submit a k-1 form to anyone but you will need to various entries on the k-1 form that you will receive onto the appropriate lines on your tax return   broadly speaking assets received as a bequest from someone are not taxable income to you but any money that was received by your grandmother 's estate between the time of death and the time of distribution of the assets e.g. interest mutual fund distributions paid in cash etc might be passed on to you in full instead of the estate paying income tax on this income and sending you only the remainder if so this other money would be taxable income to you   the good news is that if the estate trust distributions include stock your basis for the stock is the value as of the date of death i am aware that the estate is allowed to pick a different date for the valuation but i am trying to keep it simple here   that is if the stock has appreciated your grandmother never paid capital gains on those unrealized capital gains and you do n't have to pay tax on those capital gains either your basis is the appreciated value and if and when you sell the stock you pay tax only on the gain if any between the day that grandma passed away and the day you sell the stock

what are the incentives to that person to actually pay off his her debt as opposed to just walking away from it and relying on the cash s)he has for the future spending needs as opposed to borrowing well you ca n't just walk away from debt you still owe it eventually your creditors would end up suing you in court for the money plus interest owed   i suppose you could try to continually duck the authorities but you 'd still owe the money legally

where is the money coming from if you already have the money inheritance gifts or similar sitting in your account you can just buy e.g. index funds from vanguard robinhood or other low cost brokerages but first you should estimate how much money you need for your studies it is a bit of a gamble to invest money that you 'll need to withdraw in a few years time even though the average return may be quite high 12 sounds like an overestimate more commonly quoted figure is 7 over short your stocks will go up and down randomly once you actually have a job and have income from it then the 401k and ira and similar retirement accounts start to make sense there is no need to have all your savings in the same account so you can start saving now already

the purpose of the emergency fund is to enable you to pay for unplanned necessary expenses without going into debt   you know that cars do n't last forever and eventually need to be replaced ideally you would have a car replacement fund which you contribute to a little every month essentially it is a car payment to yourself   then when it comes time to get a replacement car you have money set aside for this purpose and know exactly how much you can spend   however in your case it seems that you do n't have enough money in your car replacement fund for the car that you want   there are a few different causes that might have led to this situation due to unforeseen circumstances you need a replacement car before you thought you would need it   you find that your planning was not quite right and you were n't saving as much as you need   you are trying to buy a more expensive car than you need   if a replacement car is a necessity two of these are emergencies one is not   if you do n't have enough cash set aside for a car it is certainly better to spend your emergency fund and pay cash than to borrow money to buy the car only you can decide if the car you are looking at is appropriate for you or if you should be looking at a less expensive car after you purchase the car build your emergency fund back up first then start saving for your next car

the equity you have is an asset locked away until you sell and sometimes pledged as a loan if you wish the idea that it 's dead money is nonsense it 's a pretty illiquid asset that has the potential for growth at the rate of inflation or slightly higher long term and provides you an annual dividend in the form of free rent   in this country most people who own homes have a disproportionate amount of their wealth in their house this is more a testament to the poor saving rate than anything else for me a high equity position means that i can sell my home and buy a lesser sized house for cash i am older and my own goal with the mrs is to have the house paid and college for the kid fully funded before we think of retiring for others it 's cash they can use to rent after they retire i hope that helped there 's nothing magic about this just a lot of opinions

fixed   you are confirming the amount you are going t pay over the term of the loan variable over the total difference over the life of the loan comes to around $ 1200 that is the wrong way to calculate the variable portion the variable is primarily set with a margin over a certain benchmark i.e. fed rate assuming the fed rate does n't change over or only goes lower the variable rate is the one to go if it rises then your payment will increase and the margin they take over the benchmark rate may increase so the total amount you pay might increase too   i would assume a read through the t&cs should clarify that for you is it ever a good idea to choose a variable rate loan only if you think we are in a low interest rate environment i.e. the economy is in and the feds are trying to simulate the economy by decreasing the benchmark rates and you are sure that the lender is n't going to increase his margins if the rate remains low for quite a substantial amount of time and i might assume there will be penalties for paying off a loan quicker

the largest problem and source of anxiety ruin for homeowners during the housing market collapse was caused by the inability to refinance many people had bought homes which they were stretched to afford by using variable rate mortgages   these would typically offer a very attractive initial rate with an annual cap on the potential increase of rate   many of these people intended to refinance their variable rate to a fixed rate once terms were more favorable   if their house wo n't appraise for the value needed to obtain a new loan they are stuck in their current contract with potentially unfavorable rates in the later years above prime was not unheard of also many people especially those in areas of high inflation in the housing market used a financial device known as a balloon mortgage which essentially forced you to get a new loan after some number of years 2 5 10 when the entire note became due   some of those loans offered payments less than principal + interest so say you move near los angeles and ca n't afford the $ 1.2 m for the ranch in which you wish to live   you might work out a deal with your mortgage broker banker in which you agree contractually to only pay $ 500/month with a balloon payment of $ 1.4 m due in 5 years which seemed like a good deal since you and everyone else actually expect the house to be worth $ 1.5 m in 5 years this type of thing was done all the time back in the day   now imagine the housing bubble bursts and your $ 1.2 m home is suddenly only valued at perhaps $ 750k   you still owe $ 1.4 m sometime in the next several years maybe very soon depending on timing and can only get approved financing for the current $ 750k value so you 're basically anticipating becoming homeless and bankrupt within the same year that is a source of much anxiety about being upside down on a loan see this question for an unfortunate example

in addition to what quid said i think your risk tolerance should depend on how likely you are to need the funds in the near future say that you have $ 100k saved up and you want to decide how to invest it then you should ask yourself the idea here is that if you invest say in stocks high risk then the value of your position could drop significantly and you 'd potentially have to wait for a long time before it recovers if you are forced to sell you could make a substantial loss if you do n't urgently need this cash however then you can feel relaxed and just wait for the market to reverse again this is viewing risk through the lens of how likely it is that you 'll have to wait a long time to get a substantial amount of your money back which itself is a function of how likely it is for a substantial downturn to occur in a certain market

what do you want to do with your degree   corporate finance investment banking wealth management   it all depends on that having said that here are some ideas that are useful in a wide variety of scenarios   1 accounting accounting accounting whether you are at an i bank or a mid cap consumer goods company knowing as much accounting as possible can be hugely helpful i ve interviewed for jobs at all kinds of companies and one thing that always works on interviewers is showing them you have intimate knowledge of accounting rules   2 excel information system courses knowing excel inside and out and/or some of the more widely used information systems out there can give you a nice little bump in interviews   3 statistics statistics teaches you how to think even if you never run a regression again in your life some of the general principles you learn in stats are absolutely priceless not just for work but for knowing why you need to control for variables why samples work etc can be a hugely helpful thing not just at work but in dealing with life decisions and sorting through information   some people here are telling you to learn how to program that 's useful if you want to be a quant or if you want to keep the door open to potentially moving into a quant data analytics job in the future and that 's about it companies hire software engineers to do the coding if you intend to work as an investment banker or a wealth manager for example java wo nt help you a lick let the engineers worry about writing the code focus on the stuff that actually moves your career forward and do nt try to be everything if you absolutely want to do something software related then learn sql at least in some shops particularly corporate finance jobs you might from time to time be able to use it to query some database or another although again at most companies there are entire armies of well paid people providing the necessary interfaces and tools to prevent you from having to do that

depending on your income you may owe amt instead of the taxes from the regular code   even if you do n't do that you may hit the place where you have to at least check if you owe amt as you probably know amt was established early on to catch the wealthiest of tax payers who were able to use various loop holes in the code to pay much less tax than one would expect   over time the limits on amt have not risen with the rising wage gap and amt catches an increasing number of tax payers each year   if the limit is not raised at all for 2010 then it will catch even more people this year    amt has worked it 's way into the upper middle class fairly solidly especially if you exercise stock options whose strike price is significantly different than the current sale price

how is that possible the mutual fund does n't pay taxes and passes along the tax bill to shareholders via distributions would be the short answer your basis likely changed as now you have bought more shares but i gained absolutely nothing from my dividend so how is it    taxable the fund has either realized capital gains dividends interest or some other form of income that it has to pass along to shareholders as the fund does n't pay taxes itself did i get screwed the first year because i bought into the fund too    late in the year perhaps if you do n't notice that your cost basis has changed here so that you 'll have lower taxes when you sell your shares   is anyone familiar with what causes this kind of situation of    receiving a taxable dividend that does n't actually increase the    account balance yes i am rather familiar with this the point to understand is that the fund does n't pay taxes itself but passes this along the shareholders that hold funds in tax advantaged accounts like 401ks and iras still get the distribution but are shielded from paying taxes on those gains at that point at time is it because i bought too late in the year   no it is because you did n't know the fund would have a distribution of that size that year some funds can have negative returns yet still have a capital gains distribution if the fund experiences enough redemptions that the fund had to sell appreciated shares in a security this is part of the risk in having stock funds in taxable accounts or is it because the fund had a negative return that year   no it is because you do n't understand how mutual funds and taxes work along with what distribution schedule the fund had do i wait until after the distribution date this year to buy i 'd likely consider it for taxable accounts yes however if you are buying in a tax advantaged account then there is n't that same issue

unfortunately you ca n't use your hsa to pay for expenses in year a. qualified medical expenses for an hsa must occur after the date the hsa account was established established typically means the date the account was opened in your name the other answers already mostly answered your other questions but i want to really hit home some particular points that many people may not realize the most important thing to do when you are eligible to have an hsa account is to open an hsa account asap this is true even if you do n't put any money in it and you leave it empty for years the reason is that once the account is established all qualified medical expenses that occur after that date are eligible for distributions even if you wait years before you fund your hsa account the second most important thing to do is to keep track of all out of pocket medical expenses you incur after you open the hsa account all you need is a simple spreadsheet and a place to store your receipts once you have the account and are tracking expenses now you can put money into your hsa and take it out whenever you 'd like with you ca n't put in more than the contribution limit for a single tax year and you ca n't take out more than your eligible expenses to date helpful tip many people do n't fund their hsa because they ca n't afford to set aside extra money to do so fortunately you do n't have to for example suppose you have some dental work and it costs you $ 500 once you get the bill before you pay it put the $ 500 into your hsa account the next day take the $ 500 back out and pay your dental bill with it most hsa accounts will give you a debit card to make this even easier to pay the bill by putting the money into your hsa for 1 day you just received a $ 500 tax deduction alternatively you can always pay out of pocket like you normally would track your receipts and wait until the end of the year or up until april 15 of the next year i like this option because i can pay all of my medical bills with a credit card and get cash back then at the end of the year i add up the expenses deposit that much into my hsa and if i 'd rather put that money somewhere else i just pull it out the next day if you decide you do n't need the money right away that 's even better since you can leave it in the hsa account and invest it like a roth account you do n't pay tax on the growth you achieve inside of an hsa another tip if your employer offers the service of automatically making deposits into your hsa by reducing your paycheck you should definitely try to do that if you can afford it rather than manually making contributions as i described in the previous tip when your employer makes the contributions for you your wages are reduced by that amount on your w2 so you end up saving an additional 7 in fica taxes

besides the long term concern about which is cheaper which has already been addressed by other answers consider your risk exposure owning property has financial risks associated with it just like owning stocks or bonds the risk related downsides of owning a home as an asset include the risk related upsides of owning a home as an asset include taking on some risk can save you or earn you money in the long run that 's why people buy risky stocks after all but consider how well you 're equipped to handle that risk before you rush out to buy on a naive analysis of what 's cheaper

a reason not to split your stock is that the value of the company might fall back again and if its stock price falls below $ 1 it will be delisted from the nyse so if the value of your company grows so the shares go from $ 5 to $ 50 you do a ten for one split and then its value shrinks back to where it started you 're off the stock exchange

as many other posters have pointed out unless you know and your insurer does n't that because of any reason you are more likely than the average to damage your computer insuring it does n't really make a lot of sense if you can comfortably replace it should the worst happen in this particular case of a laptop insurance is especially unattractive because computers depreciate fairly quickly if you break it and you 're insured you will get the very same laptop you bought more than a year ago and you 're not insured you can choose to either find the same laptop at a substantially lower price apple does not really lower prices that much but you can probably get a unit just like you could get with applecare or spend the original amount in a newer and more powerful laptop

nobel laureate economist paul krugman wrote a piece many ago about economic expansion and money supply   as an illustration of how money supply affects the economy he used the example of a baby sitting co op   while simplistic it provides an easy to grasp notion of how printing money and restricting it e.g. by pegging the currency to gold reserves can affect the economy here is an excerpt from his webpage with the decline of the traditional extended family in which relatives were available to take care of children at need many parents in the united states have sought alternative arrangements a popular scheme is the baby sitting coop in which a group of parents agree to help each other out on a reciprocal basis with each parent serving both as baby sitter and baby any such coop requires rules that ensure that all members do their fair share one natural answer at least to people accustomed to a market economy is to use some kind of token or marker system parents earn tokens by babysitting then in turn hand over these tokens when their own children are minded by others for example a recently formed coop in western massachusetts uses sticks each representing one hour of babysitting when a new parent enters the coop he or she receives an initial allocation of ten sticks   this system is self regulating in the sense that it automatically ensures that over any length of time a parent will put in more or less the same amount of time that he or she receives it turns out however that establishing such a token system is not enough to make a coop work properly it is also necessary to get the number of tokens per member more or less right to see why suppose that there were very few tokens in circulation parents will want on average to hold some reserve of tokens enough to deal with the possibility that they may want to go out a few times before they have a chance to babysit themselves and earn more tokens any individual parent can of course try to accumulate more tokens by babysitting more and going out less but what happens if almost everyone is trying to accumulate tokens as they will be if there are very few in circulation one parent 's decision to go out is another 's opportunity to babysit so if everyone in the coop is trying to add to his or her reserve of tokens there will be very few opportunities to babysit this in turn will make people even more reluctant to go out and use up their precious token reserves and the level of activity in the coop may decline to a low level   the solution to this problem is of course simply to issue more sticks but not too many because an excess of sticks can pose an equally severe problem suppose that almost everyone in the coop has more sticks than they need then they will be eager to go out but reluctant to babysit it will therefore become hard to find and since opportunities to use sticks will become rare people will become even less willing to spend time and effort earning them too many tokens in circulation then can be just as destructive as too few paul krugman 1997 accessed webpage 2010

the focus of this article is n't on tax revenue the author is discussing income disparity    the laffer curve does n't tell the whole story you are correct a higher tax rate does not imply higher tax revenue and a lower tax rate does not imply less revenue changing tax rates is n't going to significantly affect tax revenue however there are a broad range of other effects when changing tax rates in evaluating adjustments to tax rates our focus needs to be on these secondary effects    we are taxed on income not   when i sell you a $ 10 widget that i paid a worker $ 2 to produce from $ 5 of materials i pay taxes on the $ 3 net income not the $ 10 revenue i received from you     the main way businesses avoid high marginal tax rates is by increasing deductible expenses such that their net income after these expenses keeps them below their desired tax bracket   it is far better to spend that money on something that can benefit the business than simply give it to the government any businessman would rather keep his earnings if possible if that is not possible he 'd prefer to spend them on something that can help him rather than squandering it on junk or giving it away to the government    for most businesses the largest deductible expense is payroll any decent employer would prefer to pay out a christmas bonus instead of giving that same amount to uncle sam any businessman would prefer to pay for additional advertising or a charitable donation to a worthy cause rather than paying the irs    run up the top tier tax rate and suddenly businessmen feel a compelling need to lower their prices and pay their workers more run up the tax rate and income disparity shrinks   run up the tax rate and you put more money in the hands of consumers

yeah the biggest problem with this is that it far more heavily taxes the poor than the rich   poor people spend all of their income   month to month living paycheck to paycheck poor people have no choice but to spend their entire incomes on basic necessities utilities etc   rich people on the other hand spend very little of their incomes   most of it gets stashed in and overseas holdings and does n't really change hands in a way that allows it to be taxed under this style of tax structure   so your tax continuously hits 100 of the wealth of the bottom of households while largely bypassing the rich folks who have more money than they can   in short this kind of tax structure is really bad for anyone who does n't make $ a year and store most of their wealth in stocks and so forth   if you want to help the general public households making less than $ 300k year you need to generate more tax revenue from investments and capital   a 2 tax say on stock trades valued over $ 10,000 obviously would n't hurt poor people at all and also would n't really hurt the rich   cuz if you 've got 10 grand or a hundred or thousand or whatever to stash in shares of amazon or whatever you 're really not gon na miss the $ 200 that comes off the top of your trade   but this would generate huge tax revenue as there are thousands of such transfers a day

before i answer you should know a few things about me i 've paid to get into a couple of network marketing multi level marketing franchises and i made a little money in it i have worked in financial services sales i later went on to get my masters in business administration i 've been there and i know mlms and business in theory and practice there 's room for some nuance here but for the most part do n't do it there 's no snake oil out there that people ca n't get on their own if you can sell it to them then here 's the simple case against it if you 're a good enough salesman to get other people to buy products or franchises from you and really you do n't care about product sales you care about franchise sales because that 's how they sold it to you right you can make far more money selling business to business   if you 're a good enough sales manager that you can get good salespeople to buy franchises from you and sell more franchises you 'll make far more money managing salespeople selling business to business   for the most part people are n't good at sales and that likely includes you most mlm 's are sales groups with bad salespeople leading bad salespeople it 's the blind leading the blind and as your friends get burned and your family gets burned and you start losing everyone who got burned you 'll start to wish you had never done this stuff in the first place the main reason the above holds true is that the people involved in mlm do n't really create any value they 're looking to get a free ride on everyone else in the pyramid beneath them   there are exceptions the main ones that come to mind are like mary kay where ok mostly women makeup artists teach women how to apply makeup without looking like a clown and it 's a skill and it 's part of how they create value and it may well be the best option for someone whose chosen career is a makeup artist i 'm not particularly an exception but at the age of 17 i sold books door to door in southern mississippi mostly to teach myself how to talk to people since i had grown up with my nose in a book it turned out that the business was structured like a mlm to encourage the salespeople to become managers but i had no interest in that i just wanted to learn people skills i also blew a couple hundred bucks on franchise fees on other mlms mostly because friends were in it never did i see that money ever again   sales is hard work teaching people how to sell is even harder and impossible if you do n't know how if you 're good at it you 'll do so much better in a business to business setting think about the economics of it salespeople get paid on volume of sales businesses have a lot more money than consumers you have to sell to an awful lot more consumers than businesses to make the same amount of money think about competition too considering amway you 're competing with everyone from walmart to the corner convenience store and you will be asking everyone and their brother to join up and many of them have already been pitched it if they 've been around long enough the bargaining strength of your customers they have lots of alternatives and suppliers their over priced pricing structure is set in stone is pretty strong you have immense direct competition and product substitutes and anyone else can go into the same business as you your competitive position is extremely weak it 's almost guaranteed to fail you probably do n't have the skills you 'll burn your relationships and you 'll make more money doing almost anything else

cue the wall o text   so here ya go i 'm the son of a commercial industrial plumber who has been in the business for the past 28 years and does yr in sales first of all you need to determine your target market if he 's planning on primarily doing residential work i.e. fixing toilets drains et cetera he may want to re think things residential plumbers are typically not very well paid nor are they really well liked people assume that you 're automatically an idiot or that you are trying to screw them in regards to your pricing commercial and industrial plumbing is where any money is at if he does n't want to have a crew of 30 50 plumbers on call 24/7 including holidays and weekends    if he 's interested in making a lot of money he 's got to first determine if he wants to be an open or closed shop union status having a unionized company can sometimes grant you the ability to be awarded specific contracts for governmental bids on various buildings and schools but these contracts are typically pretty difficult to get also even if you do get the job you 're contractually obligated to use only unionized labor on the project which can be to your benefit or to your detriment depending on the worker they send you the other issue is that if you go for these types of contracts there are plenty of other companies that you 'll be competing against that have been in the business a long time and who already have pretty well set up contacts for receiving that type of work also as an aside your truck putting a on the side or anything more than your plumbing license number is typically union only this act typically unionized companies from non union companies    next he must decide what area of plumbing he wants to specialize in there is process plumbing fire medical gas piping et cetera that he can choose to do that can focus his company into more of a niche market granting him more work and higher prices for his work this is your cash cow milk that bitch for all its worth    as far as getting leads for work you 're going to want to sign up for blue book for construction leads this may seem like a lot of money a few hundred a month or so but the leads it provides you with in terms of bidding for work is invaluable if you want you can set up a website but honestly i would say that it is n't worth your time in this field we 've had a website for a few years and get hits month on it even with google adwords just because this is not the type of industry where people at least commercial and industrial owners go to in order to find their subcontractors also sign up with the subcontractor 's association in your area they provide you with leads and refer you out to other members and can provide you with new business on a regular basis     you 're going to want to keep track of everything larger jobs are best kept in 4 6 where they are off via tabs for quick reference this will assist in keeping the jobs straight keeping plans together correspondence quotes materials hours and everything else it 's taken us years to figure out a good method and this has been the best one we 've come up with to this point typically if a job is then it gets its own otherwise it just gets a typical file folder    one thing to also keep in mind as you grow is to keep your shop as locked up as humanly possible you may think that joe from down the street will be the one who is most likely to steal from you but you 'd be dead wrong it 's your employees tools have a way of walking out of your shop and getting lost on job sites or just simply are not returned and it can get out of hand very quickly a camera system is a very very good investment for this purpose    and since i 'm dead tired at this point i 'm going to leave this for now but i 'll be back to edit it to add in some more points if you 're interested

ianal but i had heard and would appreciate someone more qualified commenting on this that one reason these things were often found unenforceable is that there is no consideration   the contract is to bind you for your work each day but once you stop working they you have a continued obligation that your time at the company   claiming that your day to day compensation covers this is as if to say some part of that compensation is not for your work but to pay you for not going elsewhere   it would be nice to see at minimum a requirement to separate these two concepts into separate contracts as bundling them creates a blur and most importantly does n't allow you to negotiate or walk away from the terms of one part without the other   at the heart of any market which the job market purports to be is a sense that a fair price is reached when both parties can walk away from a bad deal this is not so in the case of employment because as said a hungry man is not a free man so someone who needs to eat or feed a family has a need to take an offer that is already their acceptance of work and this quasi duress is compounded when a company can attach additional pressures that work that person 's ability to fairly negotiate possible improvements of what may already have been a bad situation   i 'm of the impression that duress itself has been argued to be a reason to hold a contract invalid   but more and generally any time two parties are bargaining i 'm not sure the legal definition but intuitively i 'd say where one party has the ability to force a contract change and the other party is not then those terms have to be suspect   also for the special case the pay is anything near minimum wage i would suggest asking the question of whether the part of the compensation that is salary not keeping you from working for the competition is the wage paid consistent with minimum wage or does it have to draw from the pool of money that is not about wage but is about incentivizing you to not move   and finally if they stop paying you and each day you 've been paid a little to work and a little to incentivize you to leave then are you getting a continued revenue stream to continue to incentivize you not to work for the competition if not there would seem again not to be consideration   as i said i 'm not an expert in this i just follow such matters sometimes in the news but i do n't see these issues getting discussed here and i hope we 'll see some useful responses from the crowd here and also the smart folks at reddit can help through their discussions to form some useful political and legal to help individuals overcome what is really a moral outrage on this matter   capitalism is an often cruel engine   i worked at a company where one of the bosses said to me after contributing really great things that added structurally in fundamental ways to the company do n't tell me what you 've done tell me what you 've done lately capitalism makes people scrap every day to prove their worth so it 's morally an outrage to see it also trying even as it beats down the price of someone and tells them they are n't entitled to better to tell them that they may not go somewhere else that thinks they are better that is not competition and it is not fair     indentured servitude not slavery is more technically correct and yet it is a push to treat people like capital so slavery is not inappropriate   the topic is non competes but really it 's about businesses not wanting to have to compete for employees that is about businesses not wanting capitalism to prevail in hiring   sorry for the length

this is a wonderful comprehensive answer as it relates to transferring goods and evaluating profitability i would like to add to your post and comment about a few other costs that are transferred   first though i disagree with your comment about transfer pricing being about opportunity cost i think transfer pricing is first and primarily about the matching principal properly matching expenses incurred to the revenues generated from those expenditures or in the case of period expenses to those entities that received a benefit in the proper period i do n't work in tax so i 'm by no means an expert in this subject but i am a cpa and i feel i have a solid understanding of the subject   some additional items going through tp might be interest shared corporate services the amortization of intellectual property technology fees and depreciation charges this is not a comprehensive list and please do n't take it as such    none of these need apply to every company and certain industries and even individual companies will have exceptions for example for various reasons a multi national conglomerate may choose to maintain separate treasury functions for it 's vastly different businesses so you may not see much interest tp    interest is pretty straight forward and is the interest a company is paying on a debt not all interest is transferable but a classic example might be borrowed funds used for an acquisition the interest cost associated with that should be transferred in part back to the original entity short term borrowing costs used for operating capital is another classic example    shared corporate services are centralized functions like a legal department accounting department executive offices and the like this can also be an it department or in the instance of an international website maybe google an operations team monitoring the server loads and up times   ip could just be patents that have definite lives that a number of businesses are benefiting from ip is a bit of a mess to get into for various reasons and i 'm trying to stay focused in this post some reasons for complexity include the valuation life of the asset benefit of use is the entity even really using it etc i would imagine this is where companies get away with a lot    technology fees can be software licenses windows ai n't free   depreciation can be capitalized proprietary software   i 'm running out of gas and wanted to comment about op 's question    i do n't think sla 's and internal billing services are a matter of directly increasing efficiency more a matter of not creating inefficiencies going anecdotal anywhere i 've worked the best person to do the job has been whoever 's closest to the work it would n't make much sense to me   to have accounting gather up internal support during the very time sensitive month end close for something like one division 's trade magazine that another division placed an ad in on the other hand i think the allocation of copy expenses on an activity basis is an absolute waste of time it all depends on the specific transaction in question   great post do n't mean to detract just looking to help others understand

you avoid pattern day trader status by trading e mini futures through a futures broker the rules do not apply in the futures markets some of the markets that are available include representatives covering the major indices i.e the djia es s&p 500 and nq nasdaq 100 and many more markets   you can take as many round turn trades as you care to as many or as few times a day   as you like e mini futures contracts trade in sessions with transition times between sessions sessions begin sunday evenings at 6 pm est and are open through monday evening at 5 pm est the next session begins at 6 pm monday night running through tuesday at 5 pm est etc until friday 's session close at 5 pm est just as with stocks you can either buy first then sell open and close a position or short sell sell first then cover by buying you profit or lose on a round turn trade in the same manor as you would if trading stocks options etfs etc the e mini futures are different than the main futures markets that you may have seen traders working in the pits in chicago e mini futures are totally electronic no floor traders and do not involve any potential delivery of the they just require the closing of positions to end a transaction   a main difference is you need to maintain very little cash in your account in order to trade or less per trade per e mini contract you can trade just 1 contract at a time or as many contracts as you have the cash in your account to cover    settlement is immediate upon closing out any position that you may have put on no waiting for clearing before your next trade   if you want to hold an e mini contract position over 2 or more sessions you need to have about $ 5000 per contract in your account to cover the minimum margin requirement that comes into play during the transition between sessions with the e you are speculating on gaining from the difference between when you put on and close out a position in order to profit for example if you think the djia is about to rise 20 points you can buy 1 contract if you were correct in your assessment and sold your contract after the e mini rose 20 points you profited $ 100 for the djia e mini each 1 point tick is valued at $ 5.00

in principle the stock price should see no change in the days leading up to an earnings announcement and then at the moment of the announcement the stock price should move in the direction of the earnings surprise relative to the market 's belief of what earnings were going to be in practice stock prices tend to drift a little in the direction of the surprise shortly before the announcement and the associated price jump this could be because smart investors were able to replicate the computations to predict the announcement or because information gets illegally leaked ahead of the announcement   so i guess your bullet point b is a likely scenario note that hedging activity in the options market will not affect stock price one way or another   options transfer risk from one party to another but net to zero   intense hedging activity may be able to push up the price of options increasing the implied volatility but it should n't affect the price of a stock one way or the other for this reason bullet point a is not the case note that price behavior after the announcement is also interesting it seems to take some time to reach the correct price instead of jumping directly to it as economists would predict    this phenomenon is known as post earnings announcement drift

easier said than done   take a movie theater for example the vast majority of the employees are high school and college students most of the staff get through at a rapid pace usually no more than 6 months and they 've moved on to somewhere else   but a significant portion of them will stay for extended periods someone who starts working in their junior year of high school and keeps working there straight through college for example   it 's not an apprenticeship it 's also not the kind of job that you can support yourself on time limits would severely impact people like the one i described making them ineligible to keep working while simultaneously doing nothing to impact the employer because they churn through most people in 6 months anyway and wo n't trigger the apprenticeship time limits

in my opinion you should pay off the student loans as soon as possible before you start saving for the house downpayment $ is a big number but you have a great salary   nice   up until now you have been a poor college student accustomed to a relatively low standard of living   your $ 800 per month plan would have you pay off the loan in 3 years but i would challenge you to pay off this entire student loan in 1 year or less   a monthly loan payment of $ will pay off your loan in 12 months after that is done if you take the same amount you had been paying toward your student loans and save it for your condo in less than two years you 'll have a 10 down payment saved $ 50k   the whole thing will take less than three years there are three reasons why i recommend paying off the loan first before saving for the condo one is practical and two are philosophical practical you will save money on interest   paying off the loan in 1 year vs. 3 years will save you $   you wo n't find a short term safe investment that will beat 5 in interest philosophical the loan is something current and concrete that you can focus on   your condo is a dream at this point and there is lots of time to change your mind   if the $ per month amount is at all a sacrifice for you then in a few months you might be tempted to say to yourself this month i really want a vacation so i 'll just skip this month of saving   for the loan however if you establish a concrete goal of 12 months to pay off the loan it will hopefully help motivate you to allocate this money and stick to your plan philosophical getting used to borrowing money making payments to a bank and paying interest is not a great way to live   it is better in my opinion to eliminate your debt as fast as possible and start getting accustomed to saving cash for what you want   clean up your debt and resolve not to borrow any more money except for a reasonably sized mortgage on your home

they can go to an atm and deposit it in to their account the atm does not care to read the name and the bank does not care to verify anything if the check goes through meaning the bank it is drawn on pays so if nobody complains that 's it he has your money you would need to go to the check writer 's bank and ask for help or look at the check writer 's cancelled check copy if you get to it that bank can find out where it was deposited to and then you have to go after the guy and get your money back if it is still recoverable if it is a poor and he already blew your 5 grand you can sue his pants off but there are no 5 grand in them anywhere so bad luck for you technically the bank is not supposed to accept the check if the name does n't match at the counter that might get a question but as said above there are deposit atms and he could also just endorse the check to himself and sign the endorsement with some and claim that this is your signature how would joe the teller know either way he gets the check in his account and then he can take it out and blow it it is legally clearly theft or fraud and probably a federal crime but if the guy is bankrupt that does n't help you much depending on that bank 's fine print they might or might not cover your loss but i would n't hold my breath better do n't lose a check

presumably the existing house has some value if you the existing house you are destroying that value if the value of the new house is significantly more than the value of the old house like if you 're talking about replacing a small run down old house worth $ 50,000 with a big new mansion worth $ 10,000,000 then the value of the old house that is destroyed might just get lost in the rounding errors for all practical purposes but otherwise i do n't see how you would do this without bringing cash to the table basically equal to what you still owe on the old house presumably the new house is worth more than the old so the value of the property when you 're done will be more than it was before but will the value of the property be more than the old mortgage plus the new mortgage unless the old mortgage was almost paid off or you bring a bunch of cash the answer is almost certainly no note that from the lienholder 's point of view you are not temporarily reducing the value of the property you are permanently reducing it the bank that makes the new loan will have a lien on the new house i do n't know what the law says about this but you would have to either a deliberately destroy property that someone else has a lien on while giving them no compensation or b give two banks a lien on the same property i would n't think either option would be legal   normally when people tear down a building to put up a new building it 's because the value of the old building is so low as to be negligible compared to the value of the new building either the old building is run down and getting it into decent shape would cost more than tearing it down and putting up a new building or at least there is some benefit real or perceived to the new building that makes this worth it

@victor above has provided a very good answer i shall try and highlight some differences the differences are specific to a country however it does offer some insight regarding the difference between investing in retirement fund vis a vis investing in stock directly in many countries the retirement fund is mandated by the govt and has to be invested in in form of direct deduction from salary ~ investing in stock is up to the individual in many cases if not most capital gain interest accrual in retirement funds are not taxable ~ depending upon current laws capital gain long term short term from stocks are taxable retirement funds are managed and are in general more stable in their returns ~ returns from direct stock investments are dependent on investment decisions of the investor retirement funds tend to though this is very country specific return somewhat less than market as an example in india public provident fund provident fund epf return tax free ~ as for direct investment on stocks nifty has returned approx 17 cagr over 15 20 years given the above if you can invest in stock by taking informed calls and you have a good understanding of the financial markets and their and probably looking at long term investment then investing directly in stock could fetch returns that might not be by retirement funds if on the other hand if you feel investing in stock is not for you then it probably is better to stick with retirement funds and other low risk investments either way you probably have to and may be you should carry some portion of your portfolio as retirement funds

i can do better i can show you policy docs   gt religious organization exception under title vii religious organizations are permitted to give employment preference to members of their own religion the exception applies only to those institutions whose purpose and character are primarily religious factors to consider that would indicate whether an entity is religious include whether its articles of incorporation state a religious purpose whether its day to day operations are religious e.g. are the services the entity performs the product it produces or the educational curriculum it provides directed toward of the religion whether it is not for profit and whether it affiliated with or supported by a church or other religious organization   looks like my plumbing example may have been extreme because it does n't necessarily have a religious purpose under those terms but to be fair neither does the fortune 500 christian insurance company whose primary purpose is to sell insurance i was referring to earlier whose large legal department said we were legally safe to hire only christian salesmen and board members

the argument you are making here is similar to the problem i have with the stronger forms of the efficient market hypothesis   that is if the market already has incorporated all of the information about the correct prices then there 's no reason to question any prices and then the prices never change   however the mechanism through which the market incorporates this information is via the actors buying an selling based on what they see as the market being incorrect the most basic concept of this problem i think starts with the idea that every investor is passive and they simply buy the market as one basket   so every paycheck the index fund buys some more stock in the market in a completely static way   this means the demand for each stock is the same   no one is paying attention to the actual companies performance so a poor performer 's stock price never moves   the same for the high performer   the only thing moving prices is demand but that 's always up at a more or less constant rate this is a topic that has a lot of discussion lately in financial circles   here are two articles about this topic but i 'm not convinced the author is completely serious hence the worst case scenario title these are interesting reads but again take this with a grain of salt   you should follow the links in the articles because they give a more nuanced understanding of each potential issue   one thing that 's important is that the reality is nothing like what i outline above one of the links in these articles that is interesting is the one that talks about how we now have more indexes than stocks on the us markets   the writer points to this as a problem in the first article but think for a moment why that is   there are many different types of strategies that active managers follow in how they determine what goes in a fund based on different stock metrics   if a stocks p e ratio drops below a critical level for example a number of indexes are going to sell it   some might buy it   it 's up to the investors you and me to pick which of these strategies we believe in another thing to consider is that active managers are losing their clients to the passive funds   they have a vested interest in attacking passive management

for most banks this is not the case   transfers within the bank are usually instantaneous it is not uncommon for banks to draw out the length of transactions because while the money is transferring or settling it is actually sitting on the bank 's balance sheet being lent out but not earning any interest   a good deal for them when you aggregate over the millions of customers they have   your bank may be trying to squeeze a few pennies of interest out of you delays in transactions also allow their fraud team the flexibility to investigate transactions if they want to normally they probably do n't but if the bank delays all transactions then those being investigated will not be aware of it

you could conceivably open a few accounts   for example a bank account and a credit card account   then the accounts will be older when evaluated for credit when you return   this would look better than opening fresh accounts later   but do n't expect a big difference in score   and you 'll be stuck with those accounts in the future otherwise you lose the benefit   i would n't worry about maintaining balances now   you can wait until you come back   occasional purchases may be helpful    what they really want to see is a regular and sustained use of accounts without missing payments or   but if you 're not going to be here you ca n't really do that   note that good credit scores are based on seven years of data preferably a lot of it   opening a few accounts ca n't substitute for that even if you put balances on them    if you 're not here you wo n't be paying rent or utilities   you wo n't have a proven payment history on the most common accounts    if money were no object you could do something like purchase a house or condo that you could rent out utilities included   that would build up a payment history   but if money were no object you probably would n't be worried about your credit score   it 's more practical to just live normally and be sure that you always live within your means so that you do n't experience negative credit events    you might think about why you want a good credit score   is it to borrow a lot of money   you might be able to spend money to achieve that   is it to save money on future borrowing   if it costs money now how much will you save total    opening accounts now that you wo n't really use until you return is about the only thing that you can do that wo n't cost you money   perhaps put a balance on the bank account at least you 'll get that money back some day   maintaining a balance on the credit cards would cost you money in interest charges and you do n't really benefit from an improved credit score until you use your credit   so the interest fees are n't really buying you anything

when one says that corporations are people in a legal sense they are saying that they have the ability to enter into binding legal agreements in a manner similar to people this allows corporations to do things like own a building or a car or enter into a contract this is so that an individual does not have to do so this keeps individuals from being liable for the activities of the corporation it also keeps the individual from running off the the corporation 's car or selling the corporation 's building   if they are using it in any sense other than the legal sense it 's either hyperbole ignorance or pandering   now if you set yourself up as inc then you would very well be able to get all the same tax deductions and benefits as a corporation but you would also be liable for everything that a corporation is liable for namely a higher standard of reporting and different accounting methods

this answer refers to the us investment landscape i 'm not sure your classification of funds as direct and regular accurately reflects the nature of the mutual fund industry   it 's not the funds themselves that are direct or regular   rather it 's the way an investor chooses to invest in them   if you make the investment yourself through your brokerage account you may say it 's a direct investment   if you pay a financial advisor to do this for you it 's regular for a given fund you could make the investment yourself or you could use an advisor note that many funds have various share classes   share classes may be accessed in different ways   the institutional class may be accessible through your 401(k or perhaps not even there for example   the premium class may require a certain minimum investment   some classes will have a front end load or back end load   each of these will have a different expense ratio and fees even though the money ends up in the same portfolio   these expenses are by law publicly available in the prospectus and in numerous other places   share classes with higher fees will earn less each year after fees just as you suggest   your intuition is correct on this point now there is one fee to be aware of that funds either have or do not have   that 's a 12b-1 fee   this fee is a kickback to financial advisors who funnel your money into their fund   if you use a financial advisor he or she will likely put your money into these funds because they have a financial incentive to do so   that way they get paid twice once by you and once by the mutual fund   it has been shown in the finance academic literature that funds without this fee dominate are better in some ways and in no ways worse than funds with this fee i suppose you could say that funds and share classes with a 12b-1 fee were designed for regular investment and those without were designed for direct but that does n't mean you ca n't invest in a 12b-1 fee fund directly nor that you ca n't twist your advisor 's arm into getting you into a good fund without a 12b-1   unfortunately if you have this level of knowledge then you probably do n't need a financial advisor

your experience is anecdotal outside australia things are different there are many companies and real estate investment trusts reits that own residential properties as well as commercial in many cases to have a balanced portfolio they are probably more common in higher density housing like condos apartment buildings flats or whatever you like to call them but they are certainly part of the market for single family units in the suburbs as well what follows is all my own opinion i have managed and rented a couple of properties that i had lived in but was n't ready to sell yet when i moved out in most cases i wish i would have sold sooner rather than renting them out i think that there are easier less risky ways to get a good return on your money sometimes the market is n't robust enough to quickly sell when it 's time to move and some people like the flexibility of having a property that a child could occupy instead of moving back in at home i understand those points of view even if i disagree with them

fixed rate mortgage is supposed to give you security you are not going to get the best possible rate but it is safe and predictable your argument is the same as complaining that you are paying for home insurance and your home has n't burnt down   switching to a variable rate mortgage right now seems a bad idea because there is some expectations that rates are going up if you can overpay that is probably what you should do unless you can invest with better return after tax than your mortgage interest it does n't just shorten the time of your mortgage every time you overpay £ 500 your mortgage principal is down by £ 500 and you pay interest on £ 500 less   and if the interest rate goes up over the next five years as you seem to hope that just means you will pay higher interest when your mortgage needs renewing   you ca n't hope to always make the optimal decision you made a decision with very low risk as with any decision you do n't know what 's in the future a decision that is low risk if the risk could lead to fatal results is not unwise you could have picked a variable rate mortgage and could be paying twice as much interest today

in answer to your last formulation no in a perfectly efficient market different investors still have different risk tolerances or utility functions they 're maximizing expected utility not expected value   the portfolios that maximize expected utility for different risk preferences are different and thus generally have different expected values look up mean variance utility for a simple ish example   suppose you have log utility for money = and your choice is to invest all of your money in either the risk free bond or in the risky bond in the risky bond you have a positive probability of losing everything achieving utility = your expected utility after purchase of the risky bond is   +   since your expected utility is also negative infinity and you would never make this investment instead you would purchase the risk free bond   but another person might have linear utility = x and he would be indifferent between the risk free and risky bonds at the prices you mention above and might therefore purchase some in fact you probably would have bid up the price of the risk free bond so that the other investor strictly prefers the risky one so two different investors portfolios will have different expected returns in general because of their different risk preferences risk averse investors get lower expected value this should be very intuitive from portfolio theory in general stocks have higher expected returns but more variance risk tolerant people can accept more stocks and more variance risk averse people purchase less stocks and more bonds the more general question about risk premia requires an equilibrium price analysis which requires assumptions about the distribution of risk preferences among other things maybe john cochrane 's book would help with that i do n't know anything about financial economics i would think that in the setup above if you have positive quantities of these two investor types the risk free bond will become more expensive so that the risky one offers a higher expected return this is the general thing that happens in portfolio theory anyway i 'm not a financial economist or anything   here 's a standard introduction to expected utility theory

some history in the us this is very tightly controlled and regulated although stock market securities insider trading is a relatively new crime around the world 20 30 year old the united states   is exceptional for offering the longest sentences for it although it is still far more lucrative than and carries lower sentences than something like petty the perception of illegal insider trading has changed in the us over the years although it is based on much older fraud statutes the regulators and the courts have only really developed modern case law against insider trading in the past 20 30 years the us relies on its vast network of registered broker dealers to detect and report abnormal trading activity and the regulator sec can quickly obtain emergency court orders from rent a judges administrative law judges to freeze trader 's assets to prevent them from withdrawing or quickly enacting sanctions so this reality helps deter trading on material inside information so for someone that needs to get an information advantage on the market it is simply necessary for them to rationalize how this information could be inferred from public sources   similarly there is a thin line between non public information and public information the lab experiment example would be material insider information but the fact that there will be litigation over a company 's key patents may be public as soon as the lawyer submits the complaint to the court system it is also worth noting that there are a lot of financial products trading in the capital markets and illegal insider trading laws only applies to trading of shares of a company so if a major holder in gold is about to liquidate all their holdings being short gold futures is not subject to civil and criminal sanctions hope this helps the above examples should help you understand what kind of information is material inside information and what kind is not and how it is relevant to trading decisions

large businesses are in every model considered to be less likely to default and lehman brothers etc notwithstanding this is historically correct     however this is still stupid since the diversification of lending money to many small businesses is way better   this in turn is not mapped properly by the regulations on reserve capital     tl;dr   banks get punished by regulations if they lend money to small institutions instead of large ones

simply you should put your money into whatever has the higher interest rate savings or repayment of debt let 's say at the beginning of month a you put $ 1000 into each account in the case of the savings at the end of month a you will have $ $ 1000 + 1000 x 2 annual interest 12 in the case of a loan at the end of month a you will have $ $ plus 6.8 interest for one month is on $ the new value is   the difference between these is $ 5.7 1.6 = therefore using your money to repay your loan nets you a return about 3.5 times greater

this is wrong   it should be   or   now to get back to self employment tax   self employment tax is weird   it 's a business tax   from the irs perspective any self employed person is a business   so take your income x and divide by 6.2 social security and 1.45 medicare   this gives your personal income   now to calculate the tax that you have to pay multiply that by since you have to pay both the worker and employer shares of the tax    so new calculation   or they actually let you do   which is better for you smaller    and your other calculations change    and like i said you can simplify to   and your payment would be   now to get to the second quarter   like i said i 'd calculate the income through the second quarter   so recalculate a based on your new numbers and use that to calculate    or   note that this includes income from both the first and second quarters   we 'll reduce to just the second quarter later   this also has you paying for all of june even though you may not have been paid when you make the withholding payment   that 's what they want you to do    but we are n't done yet   your actual payment should be   or   because q2 ft and are what you owe for the year so far   q1 ft + is what you 've already paid   so you subtract those from what you need to pay in the second quarter   in future quarters this would be   all that said do n't stress about it   as a practical matter so long as you do n't owe $ 1000 or more when you file your actual tax return they are n't going to care   so just make sure that your total payments match by the payment you make january 15th    i 'm not going to try to calculate for the state   for one thing i do n't know if your state uses or as its base   different states may have different rules on that   if you ca n't figure it out just use as that 's the bigger one   fix it when you file your annual return   the difference in withholding is going to be relatively small anyway less than 1 of your income

most of the answers here reflect a misunderstanding of what gold actually is from a financial perspective   i 'll answer your question by asking two questions and i do challenge you to stop and think about what we mean when we say cash or unit of exchange because without understanding those you will completely miss this answer in 1971 the dxy was 110   for people who do n't know the dxy is the us dollar index it weighs the strength of the us dollar relative to other currencies   hey look it 's a pretty graph of the dxy 's history in 1971 gold was $ 35 an ounce the dxy is 97 today gold is $ an ounce today now the questions if shares of company a in 1971 were $ 10 a share but now are $ 100 a share and some of this is because the company has grown but some of it is because of inflation and the dxy losing value what would the value of the company be if it was held in grams of gold and not dollars benjamin graham who influenced warren buffett is a supposed critic of gold yet what percent of his life were we not on a gold standard   in his day the dollar was backed by gold why would you buy gold if every dollar represented gold finally consider how many us dollars exist and how few metric tonnes of gold exist   even paul volcker admitted that a new gold standard would be impossible because the value of gold if we did it today would put gold in the $ range which is absurd to get on a gold standard technically now an old fashioned gold    standard and you had to replace all the dollars out there in foreign    hands with gold god the price you buy gold because the price of    gold would have to be enormous so you 're all left hoping the federal reserve figures how to get us all out of this mess without causing trouble otherwise let me just kindly say you will realize the value of gold then as the old saying goes a fool and his money are soon   i could be wrong but i 'd say that those who 've been buying gold since 1971 for their cash holdings not index funds are n't the suckers

when you add points a break even date comes into play that date varies depending on the rate and number of points as an approximate example having one point at those rates would have a break even point of about 5 years at that time the amount you save with the lower rate makes up for the extra cash you paid for points after that you are saving money if you do n't plan on having the loan that long the points are not worth it also you need to calculate the break even date based on your own parameters i suggest searching for an online calculator or spreadsheet that supports point calculations you may also be able to deduct of your points every year ask you accountant about that

i thought the finance buff made a pretty solid argument for a financial advisor the other day but 1.5 is too expensive the blog post at finance buff suggests several alternatives he also has the great suggestion to use vanguard 's cheap financial planning service if you go with vanguard a lot of investing advice fails to consider the human factor sure it 'd be great to rebalance exactly every 6 months and take precisely the amount of risk to theoretically maximize returns but yeah right it 's well known that in the aggregate individual investors go to cash near market bottoms and then buy near market tops it 's not that they do n't know the right thing to do necessarily it 's just that the emotional aspect is stronger than any of us expect you should n't rely on sticking to your investments any more than you rely on sticking to your diet and exercise program the theoretically optimal solution is not the real world people are involved optimal solution my own blog post on this suggests a balanced fund rather than a financial advisor but i think the right financial advisor could well be a better approach http://blog.ometer.com/2010/11/10/take-risks-in-life-for-savings-choose-a-balanced-fund/ anyway i think people are too quick to think of the main risk as volatility and to think of investing as simple sure in theory it is simple but the main risk is yourself fear at market bottoms greed at market tops laziness the rest of the time so there 's potential value in taking yourself out of the picture the human part is the part that is n't simple on whether to get a financial advisor in general not just for investments see also what exactly can a financial advisor do for me and is it worth the money

for insight on what will happen i suggest looking at the situation from the lender 's perspective if your setbacks are temporary and you are likely to get back on your feet again they will protect their investment by making accommodations and probably charging you extra fees along the way if your financial hardship seems they probably try to squeeze you for as much as possible and then eventually take your house protecting their investment as best they can if they are going to foreclose they may be reluctant to do it quickly as foreclosure is expensive takes man power and looks bad on their books   so it may get pushed off for a quarter or a fiscal year but if you are asking if they 'll help you out from the goodness of their heart well a bank has no heart and creditors are interested in roi   they 'll take the easiest path to profit or failing that the path to minimum financial losses    the personal consequences to you are not their concern once you realize this it may change your thinking about your own situation    if you think you have a path to financial recovery then you need to make that clear to them in writing with details   make a business case that working with you is in their own best interests if you can not make such a case recognize that they 'll likely squeeze you for as much as possible in penalties fees interest payments etc before eventually foreclosing on you anyway   do n't play that game if your home is a lost cause financially plan how to get out from it with the smallest losses possible   do n't pay more than you need to and do n't throw good money after bad

mostly ditto to sarwate let me just add i do n't know how you 're making your payments whether through the biller 's web site your bank 's web site by mail in person etc but whatever the mechanism if there is a chance that waiting until the due date to pay may mean that you will miss the due date do n't the cost of a late payment charge is likely to far exceed any interest you would collect on your savings bear in mind that we are talking pennies here i do n't know how much the monthly bills that we are discussing here come to say it 's $ 3,000 i think that would be a lot for most people you say you 're getting 3.6 on your savings so if on the average you pay a bill 2 weeks later than you might have you 're getting an extra 2 52 x 3.6 x $ 3,000 in interest or $ 4 per month i think the last time i paid a late fee on a credit card it was $ 35 so if you make one mistake every 8 months and end up getting a late fee it will outweigh any savings   personally i pay most of my bills through either my bank 's web site or the biller 's web site i schedule all payments when i get a paycheck and i generally try to schedule them for 1 week before the due date so there 's plenty of breathing room

generically like noted in the other answer you will only come ahead in dollar terms when you are significantly riskier than the average otherwise the insurance company would have higher rates to make a profit in the case of apple care there can arguably be other factors involved if you did not insure your $ 2000 laptop and it broke just after the warranty period would you replace it with a new apple product maybe not so apple could lose a customer that means they have an incentive to keep you happy if your product breaks but insurance replaces it you are a happier customer and more likely to buy other apple products this is not an incentive for traditional insurance companies that only do business in insurance now with the profit margins apple likes in general i do n't know if they 've underpriced their insurance i sort of doubt it even but their margins on it are probably not high meaning it 's a closer call even if you are only risky

moving your text out of order for i hope clarity   gt because it is a violation of the social contract i 'm quite sure i explained this already multiple times   you 've not explained you just keep repeating your assertion   you say the social contract is x and i ask why must it be x and you respond because the social contract is x.   let me try a different approach   gt because the only modern justification for the existence of a nation is the social contract   i disagree   i think a nation can exist for whatever reason it 's populace decides and today more often than not it includes providing for the welfare of it 's citizens   what do you think prevents a social contract from being so   gt exactly that 's why we have the social contract   great it sounds like you now agree that a modern government is required for capitalism to exist   gt please elaborate as to why that is a problem in the first place   because it makes for an unstable system which will hurt the welfare of the people which is opposed to my definition of the social contract

there is a difference between an owner and a signer an owner is the legal owner of the funds a signer has access to withdraw the funds in most cases when a new personal account is opened the name is added as an however that is not always the case a person could be an owner but not a signer in a custodial arrangement for example a minor child may be an owner only on their account with a custodial parent listed as a signer the minor could not withdraw from the account a person could be a signer but not an owner in a business or estate trust account the business or estate would be the owner with individuals listed as signers only the business employees do not own the funds they are only allowed to withdraw and disburse the funds on behalf of the company the creditor can only garnish withhold funds that are owned by the indebted if the second person on the account is only a signer those funds can not be withheld as part of a judgment against the second person they do n't own those funds however simply the second person as a signer only is not sufficient if you share access with the second person and allow them to spend the money for their own benefit they are no longer just a signer they have become an owner because you are sharing your funds with them think of the business relationship as an example the employee is a signer so they can withdraw funds and pay business expenses like the electric bill if the employee withdrew funds and bought herself a new dress she is stealing because she does not own those funds if the second person on the account buys things for themselves or transfers some of the money into their own account they are demonstrating that more than a signer only relationship exists a true signer only relationship is where the individual can only withdraw funds on the owner 's behalf for example the owner is out of town and needs a bill paid the signer can write a check and pay the bill for the owner a limited power of attorney may be worth looking into with a limited poa the owner can define the scope and expiration of the power of attorney with this arrangement the second person becomes an executor of the owner under certain circumstances for example you could write a power of attorney that states something like john smith is hereby granted the limited power to withdraw funds from account on deposit at bank for the purpose of paying debts and obligations and otherwise maintain my estate in the event of my or inability to attend to my own affairs this power of attorney shall expire on it 's fifth anniversary unless renewed if the person you have granted the power of attorney abuses their access you could sue them and you would only have to demonstrate that they the scope of their power

the problem with short would be that even if the stock eventually falls it might raise a lot in the meantime and unless you have enough collateral you may not survive till it happens   to sell shares short you first need to borrow them as naked short is currently prohibited in us as far as i know now to borrow you need some collateral which is supposed to be worth more that the asset you are borrowing and usually substantially more otherwise the risk for the creditor is too high suppose you borrowed 10 k worth of shares and gave 15 k collateral numbers are totally imaginary of course suppose the shares rose so that total cost is now at this moment you will probably be demanded to either raise more collateral or close the position if you can not thus generating you a 4 k loss little use it would be to you if next day it fell to 1 k you already lost your money   as keynes once said markets can remain irrational longer than you can remain solvent see also another answer which other issues with short selling as noted by options may be a safer way to do it or a short etf like lists of those are easy to find online

in practice it would not work if you put a bid in that was really out of line even if it got filled the exchange would reverse it   other than that it really depends on what the current bid ask spread it and what volume its trading as well as how the market feels say the current bid is 11 and you put an order in with bid 11.5 it would soak up all the orders on the market up to the volume your buying but once your order is filled the market will be determined by what the next order 's bid ask is it might stay where you moved it too if others feels that s a fair price but if every other order on the market is still at 11 then the price is nt gon na move   unless your a market maker you could not realistically affect the price

also keep note some companies have a combined ceo chairman of the board role while he she would not be allowed to negotiate contracts or stock plans some corporate governance analysts advocate for the separation of the roles to remove any opportunity for the ceo to unduly influence the board   this could be the case for dysfunctional boards however the alternate camps will say that the combined role has no negative effect on shareholder returns    sec regulations require companies to disclose negotiations between the board and ceo as well as other named executives for contracts employee stock plans and related information sometimes reading the proxy statement to find out for example how many times the board meets a year how many other boards a director serves on and if the ceo sits on any other board usually discouraged to serve on more than 2 will provide some insight into a well run or not well run board

what i think warren means is that people like him are really good at making money and setting things up to continue being rich in warren 's case he 's very good at evaluating businesses and if they would be good investments in the micro this is n't really a problem instead the problem is on the macro level when enough potential market participants i.e. people businesses are n't enabled to participate in the economy in the same way this feeds into a growing wealth inequality the people who have the resources to continue playing the game can also continue with more chances it 's a principle situation no opportunity to play little to improve and a continually disadvantaged population add time into the soup rich get richer the poor poorer the gap widens more add inflationary mechanics and the fact that being poor is more expensive add debt and an inability to purchase for long term solutions you get a situation where 99 of the money is cycling around in the top 1 of players   the other 99 of potential market participants are poorly utilized up to the point where their wealth is something they have trouble spending for things like healthcare   the idea of poorly utilized market participants is key a growing economy wants more bandwidth it wants more agents or market participants contributing to the flow get rich enough and you 'll find you ca n't spend more than the interest on investments on the contrary if you do n't have very much money it 's easy as hell to spend it quickly it 's straightforward to say that if more of the global population were n't in debt if they were n't in a state where they ca n't participate in economic growth then maybe the economic growth of human society would n't be so bottle

my view is from the netherlands a eu country con credit cards are more risky if someone finds your card they can use it for online purchases without knowing any pin just by entering the card number expiration date and security code on the back worse sometimes that information is stored in databases and those get stolen by hackers also you can have agreed to do periodic payments on some website and forgot about them stopped using the service and be surprised about the charge later debit cards usually need some kind of device that requires your pin to do online payments the ones i have in the netherlands do anyway and automated periodic payments are authorized at your bank where you can get an overview of the currently active ones con banks get a percentage of each credit card payment unlike debit cards where companies usually pay a tiny fixed fee for each transaction of say half a cent credit card payments usually cost them a percentage and it comes to much more a significant part of the profit margin i feel this is just wrong con automatic monthly payment can come at an unexpected moment with debit cards the amount is withdrawn immediately and if the money is n't there you get an error message allowing you to pay some other way credit card after all other bank account cash etc when a recent monthly payment from my credit card was due to be charged from my bank account recently someone else had been paid from it earlier that day and the money was n't there so i had to pay interest on something i bought weeks ago pro credit cards apparently have some kind of insurance i 've never used this and do n't know how it works but apparently you can get your money back easily after fraudulent charges pro credit cards can be more easily used internationally for online purchases i do n't know how it is with visa or mc issued debit cards but many us sites accept only cards that have number expiration date security code and thus my normal bank account debit card is n't conclusion definitely have one but only use it when absolutely necessary

diversification is spreading your investments around so that one point of risk does n't sink your whole portfolio the effect of having a diversified portfolio is that you 've always got something that 's going up though the corollary is that you 've also always got something going down winning overall comes by picking investments worth investing in not to state the obvious or anything it 's worth looking at the different types of risk you can mitigate with diversification   company risk this is the risk that the company you bought actually sucks for instance you thought gold was going to go up and so you bought a gold miner   say there are only two abc and xyz   you buy xyz then the ceo reveals their gold mine is played out and the stock goes you 're wiped out but gold does go up and abc does especially now they 've got no competition   if you 'd bought both xyz and abc you would have diversified your company risk and you would have been much better off say you invested $ 10 k $ 5 k in each xyz goes to zero and you lose that $ 5k. abc goes up 120 and is now worth $ 11k. so despite xyz bankrupting you 're up 10 on your overall position   sector risk you can categorize stocks by what sector they 're in we 've already talked about one gold miners but there are many more like utilities bio tech transportation banks etc stocks in a sector will tend to move together so you can be right about the company but if the sector is out of favor it 's going to have a hard time going up     lets extend the above example what if you were wrong about gold going up then xyz would still be bankrupt and abc would be making less money so they went down as well say 20 at that point you 've only got $ 4 k left but say that besides gold you also thought that banks were cheap so you split your investment between the gold miners and a couple of banks lets call them and op for $ 2500 each in xyz abc and op say you were wrong about gold but right about banks goes up 15 and op goes up 40   at that point your portfolio looks like this xyz start $ 2500 -100 end $ 0 abc start $ 2500 + 120 end $ 5500 start $ 2500 + 15 end $ op start $ 2500 + 40 end $ 3500 for a portfolio total of $ or a total gain of   see how that works   region country currency risk so now what if everything 's been going up in the usa and everything seems so overpriced well odds are some area of the world is not over bought like brazil or england so you can buy some brazilian or english companies and diversify away from the usa that way if the market tanks here those foreign companies are n't caught in it and could still go up this is the same idea as the sector risk except it 's location based instead of business type based   there is an additional twist to this currencies   the use the pound and the use the real most small investors do n't think about this much but the value of currencies including our dollar fluctuates if the dollar has been strong and the pound weak as it has been lately then what happens if that changes say you own a british bank and the dollar weakens and the pound strengthens even if that bank does n't move at all you would still make a gain   example you buy british bank bbb for 40 pounds a share when each pound costs $ 1.20 say after a while bbb is still 40 pounds share but the dollar weakened and the pound strengthened such that each pound is now worth $ 1.50 you could sell bbb and because of the currency exchange once you 've got it converted back to dollars you 'd have a 25 gain    market cap risk sometimes big companies do well sometimes it 's small companies the small caps are riskier but higher returning when you think about it small and mid cap stocks have much more room to run than large caps do it 's much easier to double a company worth $ 1 billion than it is to double a company worth $ 100 billion   investment types stocks are n't the only thing you can invest in there 's also bonds convertible bonds cds preferred stocks options and futures it can get pretty complicated especially the last two but each of these investment behaves differently and again the idea is to have something going up all the time   the classical mix is stocks and bonds the idea here is that when times are good the stocks go up when times are bad the bonds go up because they 're safer so more people want them but mostly they 're there to providing steady income and help keep your portfolio from along with the stocks currently this may not work out so well stocks and bonds have been moving in sync for several years and with interest rates so low they do n't provide much income   so what does this mean to you i 'm going make some assumptions here based on your post you said single index self managed and do n't lower overall risk and return i 'm going to assume you 're a small investor young you invest in etfs and the single index is the s&p 500 index etf spy   s&p 500 is roughly the 500 biggest companies in the usa further it 's weighted how much of each stock is in the index such that the bigger the company is the bigger a percentage of the index it is   if is right the top 5 companies combined are already 11 of the index apple microsoft exxon amazon and johnson johnson the smallest news corp is a measly of the index   in other words if all you 're invested in is spy you 're invested in a of giant american companies and a little bit of other stuff besides   to diversify company risk and sector risk are n't really relevant to you since you want broad market etfs they 've already got that covered the first thing i would do is add some smaller companies get some etfs for mid cap and small cap value not small cap growth it sucks for structural reasons examples are for mid cap and for small cap value    after you 've done that and are comfortable with what you have it may be time to branch out internationally you can get etfs for regions such as the eu check out or countries like japan see but you 'd probably want to start with one that 's all major countries that are n't the usa check out efa   in any case do n't go too crazy with it as index investing goes the s&p 500 is not a bad way to go feed in anything else a little bit at a time and take the time to really understand what it is you 're investing in   so for example using the etfs i mentioned add in 10 each and then after you 're comfortable maybe add 10 efa and raise to 20 what the ultimate percentages are of course is something you have to decide for yourself   or you could just chuck it all and buy a single target date retirement fund from say vanguard or t. rowe price and just not worry about it

have to do a presentation for an international business and cultures class in about a month and the assigned wsj article is n't quite clicking with me and looking for a kind soul here to put it into layman 's terms i guess   if i am violating any policy or breaking a rule by posting the text from the article please delete   thank you for any reply   washington finance officials trying to avert the next global economic crisis found time at a summit here to worry about something besides brexit and european banks china 's mounting debts and its economic   the country 's surging credit growth in its steel and metals industries and its bloated housing market drew widespread complaints from finance officials and central bankers attending semiannual meetings of the international monetary fund and world bank   officials china for its efforts to get the yuan included in the imf 's international basket of currencies known as special drawing rights starting oct. 1 and despite a couple of scares in the past year or so the country 's markets and economic growth have appeared to stabilize in recent months   but in a sign of how important the world 's second biggest economy is to global growth china is increasingly being called out   u.s. treasury secretary warned beijing in unusually candid language about china 's overproduction and which he suggested could become the biggest u.s. complaint about the country as their earlier disputes over the country 's exchange rate become less divisive   i 'm talking about steel i 'm talking about aluminum i 'm talking about real estate when you do n't have market forces driving investment when you do n't have bad investments allowed to fail you end up with resources allocated in a way that ultimately the future of economic growth mr. said at the institute for international economics on thursday   the imf zeroed in on a measure called current credit a widely followed international indicator of potential crises the deviation of china 's credit growth from its long term trend has surged from zero during the financial crisis to up to 27 last year banks balance sheets grew to of gross domestic product   more is needed especially to curb excess credit growth reduce the opacity of credit products and ensure sound interbank funding structures said peter deputy director of the fund 's monetary and capital markets department   china 's policy makers are caught in a trap economists say dealing with the debt problem would require the country to start deleveraging but slower credit growth is bound to hamper the overall economy that could backfire by making it harder for companies to repay existing debt   down on credit would also raise the prospect of political unrest in a country that has grown accustomed to very rapid growth faced with such prospects the country 's leaders have largely credit restraint in the hope that they will be able to deal with its economic problems over time   part of the problem is the complicated and poorly disclosed structure of the country 's banking system economists say   the increasing complexity of the shadow banking both on the asset side but even more on the funding side where a lot of the funding is short term is not stable markus the imf 's asia pacific deputy director told reporters on thursday it 's still of a size that is manageable but the trajectory is dangerous and needs to be contained   china 's appetite for steel and aluminum which abruptly in the past year or so is of vital interest to commodity exporting economies such as russia and brazil for now exporters appear to be confident that demand wo n't drop off again in the short term   china 's growth is stabilized at a lower level brazilian finance minister said in an interview i do n't see a further collapse coming   still much will depend on china 's economic transition   they are trying to alter their priority from manufacturing to services from export oriented to domestic consumption said indian finance minister in an interview in the transformational stage there will be   chinese officials in washington touted the country 's annual gdp of between 6 and 7 and said growth has remained stable as economy transitions   if that transformation is successful china will continue to have a stable share of global growth people 's bank of china deputy governor gang said on thursday   ian and bob davis contributed to this article   credit by william

you ca n't short a stock unless there is someone willing and able to lend shares to you and there are several reasons why that might not be the case first is a new stock which means that no one has held it very long it 's much easier to short ibm or exxon mobil where there are some long term holders who would like to earn a little extra money lending you their shares but if everyone involved is busy buying or selling the stock there wo n't be many people to lend it that 's not manipulation that 's just the market another reason may be a large short interest that is many others have shorted it before you that 's dangerous for you because if some lenders want to pull their shares off the market they can cause a short squeeze that will drive the price much higher   and stock shortages can be orchestrated by the company or large investors to artificially drive the price higher unless you have a lot of experience do n't try shorting small cap stocks try to gain some experience with large caps like ibm or exxon mobil first those are stocks that people at least ca n't play games with you will win or lose based on the market itself

i can see why you are feeling financial stress   if i understand right you have put yourself in a very uncomfortable and unsustainable situation and one that should indeed be very stressful for a person of your age   i feel a lot of stress just reading over your question i 'm going to be very frank   your financial situation suggests that you have very aggressively taken wealth from your future self in order to consume and to make inefficient investments   well look in the mirror and say to yourself i am now my future self and it is time to pay for my past decisions   do n't take money out of your ira   that would be continuing the behavior as it is a very inefficient use of your resources that will lead to yet more extreme poverty down the line ok you ca n't take back what you have done in the past   what to do now   major life restructuring   if i were you i 'd sell my house if i had one   move in with one of your kids if you have any nearby   if not move into the cheapest trailer you can find   take a second job   very seriously look to see if you can get a job that pays more for your primary job i know you love your current job but you simply can not continue as you are now   start eating really cheap food and buying clothes at thrift stores   throw everything you can at your debts starting with the ones with the highest interest rate   plan now to continue working long after your peers have retired early in life is the time to be borrowing   middle age is when you should be finishing paying off any remaining debts and away like crazy for retirement   now is not an ok time to be taking on additional debt to fund consumption i know changing your life is going to be very uncomfortable but i think you will find that there is more peace of mind in having some amount of financial security which for you will require a lot of changes than in borrowing ever more to fund a lifestyle you can not sustain

has a great answer about dividends generally but to answer your question specifically about yield traps here are a few things that i look for as with everything if it looks too good to be true it probably is   a 17 yield is pretty out of this world even for a reit   and i would n't bet on it holding up   compare a company 's yield to that of others in the same industry different industries have different standards for what is considered a high or low yield dividends have to come from somewhere and that somewhere is cash flow   look at the company 's financial statements   do they have sufficient cash flow to pay the dividend   have there been any recent changes in their cash flow situation   how are earnings holding up   debt levels cash on hand sudden moves in stock price   a sudden drop in the stock price will cause the yield to rise   sometimes this indicates a bargain but if the drop is due to a real worry about the company 's financial health see 2 it 's probably an indication that a dividend cut is coming what does their dividend history look like   do they have a consistent track record of paying out good dividends for years and years   companies with a track record of paying dividends consistently and/or increasing their dividend regularly are likely to continue to do so

how can i correctly account for having money in different currencies without currency transfers or currency fluctuations ending up as gains or losses in my view your spreadsheet should be in multiple currencies i.e. if you have gained some in specific currency make a note of it in that specific currency if you have spent something in a specific currency then make a note accordingly you can use an additional column for reporting this in a neutral currency say gbp if you are transferring the money from account of one currency to account of another change the balances as appropriate with the actual conversion rate if you need this record keeping for tax purposes then get a proper advise from accountant

do you get cash or a deposit into your bank account of your phd stipend and then you immediately send the university a check to pay the tuition fee which might be more than the cash you get from the university or does the university simply keep the stipend money transferring it from one pocket to another in essence and say ok you have paid your tuition except for $ x that you still owe us or does the university grant you a tuition waiver as part of your and reports this as income on form 1099-misc in all of these cases the money reported on form 1099-misc is not taxable income to you and it is neither subject to self employment tax basically social security and medicare tax both the employee 's share and the employer 's share nor to federal income tax

so obviously realtors are not economists and have a strong bias here   a lot of actual features the tax deductions economists think the mortgage deduction is nonsense and does n't actually promote home ownership countries without the deduction have about the same ownership rates as the u.s.   worth noting that this proposal does n't actually scrap the mortgage deduction it just makes the standard deduction bigger some people will end up better off with the new standard deduction and those with more expensive homes can keep using the mortgage deduction   this is one of the few proposals coming out of the republican congress that actually helps poor people more than rich people

theoretically when a company issues more shares it does not affect the value of your shares   the reason is that when a company issues and sells more shares the proceeds from the sale of those shares goes back into the company using your example you have 10 out of 100 shares of the company for a 10 stake   let 's say that the shares are valued at $ 1,000 each meaning that the market value of the company is $ 100,000 and your stake is worth $ 10,000 now the company issues 100 more shares at $ 1,000 each   the company receives $ 100,000 from new investors and now the company is worth $ 200,000   your stake is now only 5 of the company but it is still worth $ 10,000 the authorized share capital is the amount of shares that a company has already planned on selling   when you buy stock in a company you can look up how many shares exist so you know what your percent stake in the company is   when a company wants to sell more shares this is called an increase of authorized share capital   in order to do this the company generally needs the approval of a majority of the existing shareholders

i think a lot of this goes to the short of the government that was in place at the time of the first default they caused it and their attempt at cleaning things up just kicked the can down the road if they would have added in a class action clause that most bonds now have what they settled with a majority would apply to all bond holders    what they did was the opposite added in a clause in which the low water mark was set by the deal that was least favourable for them it was probably a misguided attempt at the markets with the consequences we now see

yes you can have a buy to let mortgage on a rental property at the same time as a residential mortgage on your own property a lot of landlords do this i would n't go expecting your rental property to contribute much to paying off your residential mortgage most of it will go on the various costs and fees of renting out a property not least the buy to let mortgage the main financial benefit in the uk of owning a rental property with a substantial mortgage on it is that the value of the property goes up in a rising market which it normally seems to be

i would imagine that it goes beyond purpose and also addresses the demographic as a poor credit risk those seeking a post secondary education are a poor credit risk   they are at the beginning of their careers so tend to have low income a short credit history and a very short time of managing money on their own   also many do n't know how to work   this later fact to me is a great predictor of financial success reading into the financial data surrounding student loans it pretty easy to see that this demographic makes poor money decisions   i live near a state university   a large percentage of students drive late model luxury cars frequent expensive bars and restaurants and wear pretty nice clothes   they also graduate with on average 60 k in student loans   keep in mind a 4 year degree could be had for about 30 k and could be paid for working a part time job   and that to me is the wisdom in bank 's decision   sure they will loan you all the money you want with a government guarantee   however once that disappears they will not you money for unnecessary purposes

in addition to the already good answers you also want to consider your time horizon unless you are looking out 10 + years building your down payment in an account that is invested in the market is probably subject to too much market risk are you willing to delay purchasing a home by five years if the market turns down at the wrong time a better option is to just use a savings accounts to avoid spending the money you can open a dedicated account separate savings account for a special purpose are s common feature at credit unions and probably are available at many regular banks as well then for funding the account many employers allow you to split direct deposits amongst multiple accounts so you will just need to provide the routing number and fractional amount of your paycheck for that account

how will k end up in your pocket   are you selling your home   where are you going to live   you talk about moving to arizona what is so magical about that place congratulations on making a wise purchase   some people with new found money use it to correct past mistakes   however if they do not change their behavior they end up in the same situation just less them money they once had while 50 k income is respectable at your age it is below the national average for households   one factor in having a college education is those with them tend to experience shorter and fewer periods of unemployment especially for males   nothing will ever replace hustle however   i 'd ask you to have a plan to raise your income   can you double it in 5 years    you need to get rid of the revolving debt   do that out of current income   no need to touch the house proceeds for something so small   shoot for 9 months then you need to get rid of the speeding fines and the vehicle loan   that is a lot of vehicle for your income   again i would do that out of current income or by selling the vehicle and moving to something more inline with your income    as far as to moving or flipping foreclosures that is more of a question that has to do with your hopes and dreams   do you want to move your children every 3 years   what if you move to arizona and it turns out to be quite horrible   you and your wife need to sit down and discuss what is best for your family
