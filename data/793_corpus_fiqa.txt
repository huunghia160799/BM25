an annuity makes sense in a few different scenarios in general they are not the best deal around and are often and will almost certainly be a bad deal if pitched by a tax preparer insurance salesman etc   keep in mind that any guarantees offered are guarantees made by an insurance company the only backing up of that claim in the event of a company failing is protection from your state 's guaranty association ie not the feds

there is always some fine print read it i doubt there is any product out there that can guarantee an 8 return   as a counter example a 70 yr old can get 6 in a fixed immediate annuity on death the original premium is retained by the insurance company   whenever i read the prospectus of a va i find the actual math a salesman who misrepresented the product i 'd be really curious to read the details for this one

i wrote a detailed answer about variable annuities on another question but i want to include one specific situation where a variable annuity may be the right course of action for the sake of simplicity i 'm quoting directly from that answer three quarters of us states protect variable annuity assets from creditors regular ira 's do n't benefit from protection under the employee retirement income security act erisa and may therefore be more vulnerable to creditors if you 're a potential target for lawsuits e.g. a doctor worried about medical malpractice suits variable annuities may be an option for you as always you should consult a legal tax professional to see if this might be a good option for you to consider the sec also has a fantastic publication on variable annuities that provides a great deal of information it 's not directly related to this question because it does n't necessarily focus on the circumstances in which they might be a good fit for you but it 's educational nevertheless and should give you more than enough information to properly evaluate any policy you 're looking to buy

again you 're welcome   it 's also important to note it really can not be is that the taxes that were increased were are virtually all the regressive ones   the rate of fica taxation for example on rents interest and other capital gains i.e. non payroll income were initially 0 then later became 0 and currently are 0   meanwhile the fica rate on average amp median payroll wages salaries of workers and mid level managers etc increased from 1 to 15 that 's a increase or put another way it is an increase of 1,500 during less than a single working career the cost of absolutely nothing else in the history of our society increased at anything like that rate not even education and health care costs nor even housing at the peak of the bubble and in actuality just about everything else including the notorious gasoline sold by those evil petroleum companies actually decreased during the same time frame   and then during virtually the same time period those other taxes increased in a similar if less egregious fashion for example in my state there was no sales tax at all circa 1950   a bit over a decade later when it was first instituted it was initially set at 3 but applied only to a select category of goods subsequently the rate was increased to 4 then 5 then with the addition of various county and municipal sales taxes to 6 and higher and more critically the goods and services that are subject to the tax has increased as well many of them already with hidden buried excise taxes so a large portion of the sales tax is actually a tax on a tax   when you realize that as wealth increases the average expenditure on taxable goods tends does not tend increase in anything like a directly proportional manner i.e. while a person making $ 50k a year may pay more than 2x the total sales tax than someone making $ 25k a year simply because a big part of the $ 25k a year goes to basic necessities of food rent etc and it is even possible that the person making $ 100k a year pays a simple 2x in sales tax of the $ 50k person but the $ 1 m a year is highly unlikely to be paying 10x the sales tax as the $ 100k a year person then you begin to realize the way that the regressive form of those taxes work basically the middle class and preventing it from reaching upper middle class status   now to be blatantly it is not simply a matter of blaming the rich because the lion 's share of those taxes were and are being used to redistribute money to an ever increasing number of non working people either retirees or disabled former workers etc the vast majority of which were things demanded by the general population   hence the reality   the means that the rich elites have used to milk amp the system may be indirectly linked to those taxes but in general are actually much more likely to be based on other things access to leverage credit amp the socialization of bad bets losses avoidance of wages and emphasis on capital gains etc   does n't mean the elites wealthy gaming scamming the system indeed many of them are but at least a significant part of the blame for the burdensome tax system lies with the people themselves   as another example of the same thing take healthcare insurance people want their insurance to not only cover the rare large expenses cancer treatment major accident trauma etc but also to cover their annual checkups etc and then are shocked shocked i say when their insurance premiums go up   well what do people expect if virtually everyone goes for an annual checkup and that checkup costs per policy are say $ 300 a year then how can premiums not go up by approximately $ 300 + administration costs   did they expect the money to pay those things to magically appear out of nowhere   seriously you demand something and eventually one way or another you are going to pay for it     so in your father and they were able to support a larger family in no small part because they were not paying for all of those safety net things   in addition for what little safety net did exist at the time the people collecting on it were tiny versus the larger working paying history i.e. in 1940 each retiree on social security was supported by nearly 160 workers by 1950 the ratio was a tenth of that 1 retiree supported by 16 workers by 1965 it was a quarter of that of the 1940 ratio 1 retiree to 4 workers and currently 2009 it is a 1 to 3 ratio and set to get a lot worse as the baby boomer bulge retires en masse in the coming   so basically your single income job still is supporting a large family you just are n't supporting them directly any more instead you pay the government and they get checks from the government and the family you are supporting is probably not biologically related to you i.e. they are someone else 's kids parents etc   and then just as importantly since you are no longer directly supporting a large family you have essentially zero control over the of how the money gets spent whereas your father and grandfather did get to decide instead the monies are being tossed as entitlements to the recipients who since they have been told and certainly want to believe that they are just getting what they are due do n't feel that anyone has any right to tell them how to spend it   sorta like as if when your father and grandfather were working as if their wife and each of their kids as well as great grandpa joe in the back bedroom and maybe the disabled neighbor dave was legally granted a government mandated allowance of 1/10th of your dad 's paycheck and instead of your dad getting his full paycheck the government required his employer to cut several paychecks paying those allowances directly to the wife kids whose checks would go directly to their schools grandpa joe neighbor dave etc and they other than the kids were then able to spend it on whatever they wanted and your dad would n't have been able to say boo about it   because when it comes right down to it that 's what has happened there 's just multiple layers of official bureaucratic obfuscation in the middle that hide the transfers under various

i agree with all that was said here but i have to add something another point i will add is stimulus while you still can at some point you can no longer take on more debt even if you wanted to if global and domestic investors think you are going to be a risky investment then they cut you off the people who argue that greece should n't be implementing austerity do n't seem to understand the situation they are in far fewer wanted to lend money to them even before they started their haircut people think the government should spend more but how are they supposed to do that if no one wants to lend more money they also criticize germany and co. for insisting on austerity what they sometimes seem to forget is that germany does n't have an infinite supply of money to bail out greece they have their own bills to pay and any politician who was dumping ever larger amounts of money into greece would be looking at being voted out or even if they let things get too bad for the german people i am being a little hyperbole here to make a point but i honestly feel it is a very real possibility in this kind of economic climate at this point there is no reason to discuss whether greece should choose to spend more money because that choice is no longer even available to them   we are not as bad off as greece right now we should spend more money but we need results we need to identify the structural problems ailing our economy and get them fixed with the money we have direct spending is n't always a great idea if it is done in a nonsensical way people defending the bike paths and other shit argue that all spending is good in a depression i am not against bike paths and roads because they can certainly create jobs and generate value to the economy but every dollar you spend on them is one dollar that ca n't be spent on the biggest problems assuming of course that kind of infrastructure is n't one of those   after spending trillions of dollars on spending our gdp is still growing at only 2 it was increasing about 3.5 every year from 2012 our jobs creation rate is still less than half the 250,000 jobs a month we created in the last 10 20 years ca n't remember the exact number we definitely need to spend differently to address the problems and get people back to work as said we need middle class jobs we particularly need those among america 's youth so they can move out of their parents houses and buy their own which could really help the housing economy and create jobs for the lower class in turn and get us out of this depression my thoughts are that we should use stimulus in new new industries such as those in high tech i intentionally stated that very broadly because we have many millenials who need to get to work   investing in different high growth industries could create jobs for people in any number of occupations but if we do n't do that while people still want to lend us money then we are going to be fucked in a few years when we are out of options and land in the same position as greece   edit let me clarify the infrastructure thing there was a town that spent millions rebuilding a sidewalk that was five years old that no one in the community wanted everyone there thought it was a nonsensical way of spending tax dollars and would have thought that money could have been better spent in another community that really needed problems resolved would n't it have made more sense to spend money somewhere where it was needed then you could have created jobs and created lasting value to an economy by fixing a structural problem that was holding the economy back why do n't our politicians realize this

i do n't have a formula for anything like this but it is important to note that the current value of any asset is really theoretical until you actually sell it for example let 's consider a house   you can get an appraisal done on your house where your home is inspected and the sales of similar houses in your area are compared   however this value is only theoretical   if you found yourself in a situation where you absolutely had to sell your house in one week you would most likely have to settle for much less than the appraised value the same hold true for collectibles   if i have something rare that i need cash for immediately i can take it to a pawn shop and get cash   however if i take my time and locate a genuinely interested collector i can get more for it this is comparable to someone who holds a significant percentage of shares in a publicly held corporation   if the current market value of your shares is $ 10 million but you absolutely need to sell your entire stake today you are n't going to get $ 10 million   but if you take your time selling a little at a time you are more likely to get much closer to this $ 10 million number a motivated seller means that the price will drop

i 'm on this part   gt   i say jeez i 'd love to but i really need all the cash i can get for every deer right now my kid is out growing shoes like crazy   tell you what if you can write me a promise to pay twelve loddars in october i can give that to the shoe maker you about the interest rate but agree gt a lightbulb just go off you and i have once again created twelve loddars now exist in the town economy that have not been printed by the central counting all the money trading hands in the village there are now a all the loddars that have ever been printed plus b twelve more that you have promised to produce    if we switch out of story mode and into real world mode i 'm the apple guy equivalent you are a bank that just made me a loan you 've given me $ 10 and charged me $ 2 interest and you 've gone and spent that promise of $ 12 on something why are you able to spend that promise i would have thought you 'd just not be able to buy anything for now because you 're making a short term sacrifice of giving out your stuff and being without it in order to get more from me later than you could have right now i 'm guessing this is something to do with fractional reserve but i was never clear on that   gt now what happens if another wildfire hits your orchard those twelve loddars are destroyed they are gone the shoe maker is twelve loddars poorer without spending it and without anyone else getting twelve loddars richer    why do i not still owe you $ 12 my value engine is gone but would n't you keep my debt on the books and still hold me to it would n't i have to pick myself up work somewhere else for a wage or make and sell something else and pay you money i made over time until the $ 12 or more with more interest was paid off and has any new money really been created if i work for that money get it from someone else and then pay it to you there 's no new money there yet that i can see seems like you created new money when somebody else agreed to let you buy things with the promise i wrote you that sounds like new money but if my orchard is destroyed and for reasons i 'm not clear on see above the $ 12 of value i could have gotten out of it is destroyed but you already spent the new money how are you out anything seems like you 're still up $ 2 i feel like there is either one too many pieces on the board or one too few and i ca n't get my head around it i feel like i have one foot still in the eli5 example and not all the way out in the real world

for whatever reason americans gave up on learning about the world or caring whatsoever about how they are governed most people around me have some working knowledge of current events but are n't interested or passionate enough to do anything about and the 2 party system this behavior as does the media we consume a lot of us do n't vote because we do n't believe at all in the system   as for military spending vs. social programs well it 's hard to disagree over facts so i 'll just link to this images proposed total military at 16 vs. social programs at 50 combined i 'll never defend how large our military is frankly i think it 's a joke at how much we spend today but there are too many spending issues to count and the social programs are a larger part of that than anything else   i 'm no republican or democrat whether they believe it or not both political party participants are for bigger government and more centralized control of the economy and our daily lives

just to clarify things the net working capital is the funds the capital that will finance the everyday the short term operations of a company like buying raw materials paying wages so net working capital does n't have a negative impact and you should not see the liabilities as beneficial per se it 's rather the fact that with smaller capital to finance the short term operations the company is able to make this ebit you can see it as the efficiency of the company the smaller the net working capital the more efficient the company is given the ebit i hope you find it helpful it 's my first here edit why do you say the net working capital has a negative impact

adam davis 's answer is pretty good however i think he misses something with regard to the costs of a funeral according to a traditional funeral can cost upwards of $ 15,000 having just planned and paid for a funeral for an adult i can assure you that this figure is low i 've heard $ 10,000 $ 30,000 and that seems a reasonable ball park given my experience additionally grief affects people differently if your child died would you be able to continue work afterwards most people can but some people have to take extended leave generally with no income because of the emotional impact combined these expenses can easily outstrip the savings for an average family almost by definition insurance is not cost effective insurance companies profit by selling it to you after all but you may decide that it is appropriate to mitigate your risk by buying insurance i do not have children and would likely not choose to insure them if i did nevertheless other people may reasonably choose differently

i get paid a 50 cents more at my second job than my day job and at the end of the week my take home pay from the latter is $ 20 higher that s a bullshit argument $ 5 per hour is a lot of money especially considering that a lot of people have been living paycheck to paycheck throughout obamas never ending recovery   what makes a 's hours $ 5 more valuable than a fedex employee by every measure fedex is a more productive and efficient entity than the us postal service so why is the worth more i 'll tell you exactly why   the fedex employee 's compensation is needs based fedex does a certain amount of business which requires a certain amount of labor which commands a certain price in the labor market fedex does not pay more for labor than it has to because fedex must be an efficient organization to meet its customers price expectations     the 's compensation is arbitrary set by government officials with no direct accountability to customers because they know jack shit about logistics congress has mandated that the postal service offer services to the public at uniform price and quality as such it has continuously failed to manage its budget properly to the tune of $ 5 to $ 10 billion dollar every year with a total mail volume that has declined 29 between 1998 and 2008   why does the postal service exist because it makes your congressman feel good and he 's more than willing to burn your money on the of his and false over the massive arbitrarily created vested interest postal employees have in losing their above average pay hack jobs than for any dedication you he has to the welfare of his constituents   if you want me to run down why i believe our government is not acting in our own personal best interests the postal service is the perfect place to start

basically the banks countrywide was the worst about this failed to uphold lending standards when they were giving out mortgages because it was n't in their self after the banks would give someone a mortgage the banks would make their fees off the mortgage and then bundle these mortgages into securities the banks then had these sub prime mortgages that are now bundled together as securities then s&amp;p and other ratings agencies gave them aaa ratings despite nearly everyone in the industry knowing they were time bombs waiting to go off goldman sachs and everyone else knew what was going on but they did n't want to get stuck holding the bag per se so they committed fraud by knowingly misleading their clients to buy these securities   the problem is n't that we need more it 's that the regulations we have are n't even being enforced obama has prosecuted 1/3 as many financial crimes at bush clinton reagan

mutual funds do n't do what etfs do because according to how the fund was built in their contract they ca n't   that is not how they are built and the people that invested in them expect them to act in a certain way that is ok though   many people still invest in mutual funds partially because of their history but there are some advantages to mutual funds over etfs   mainly mutual funds must mark to market at the end of day while etf values can drift from the asset value especially in crisis   as long enough people invest in mutual funds the funds make enough money on their fees they do n't need to change   maybe mutual funds will go as etfs do have significant advantages but it likely wo n't happen soon

you only need umbrella policy for large amounts of liability protection i think they usually start with $ 1 m so if you do n't have and do n't expect to have assets at such a high value why would you need the insurance your homeowners renters car travel insurance should be enough and you still need to have those for umbrella since its on top of the existing coverage not instead many people just do n't have enough assets to justify such a high coverage

the principle to follow is called pay yourself first have your savings deducted from your paycheck before it hits your checking account you spending will change to accommodate the reduction if you have a 401(k available from your employer start saving some money via that if not figure out a way to have something moved out of your checking account to a separate savings account when your paycheck hits then as you get raises up the amount of automatic savings by half of the raise you will find this hurts less than you think and it will let you build an emergency fund which is the first thing you need when the emergency fund is 6 months of normal spending then you can start to invest

i am relative newbie in the financial market trading and as i understand it the response from victor is accurate in respect of trading cfd contracts however there is also the option to trade through a financial spread betting platform which as its name suggests is purely a bet based upon the price of the underlying stock asset as such i believe that your theory to short a stock just prior to its ex dividend date may be worth investigating further apart from that it 's worthwhile mentioning that financial spread betting is officially recognised by hmrc as gambling and therefore not currently subject to capital gains tax this info is given in good faith and must not be relied upon when making any investment and/or trading i hope this helps you make a fortune if it does then please remember me

the irs no longer requires that employers submit all w4 forms but they can request a w4 for an employee at any time and putting false information on your w4 is still a punishable offense    i agree that having a return is like giving the treasury department an interest free loan for the year but unfortunately paying the appropriate amount of withholding tax is required    there is some ambiguous information regarding an employer adjusting the amount of withholding but it seems to mean that they can withhold more than the estimated rate but never less than what is calculated using the deductions on your w4 see the link for more details irs tax withholding

according to the 401 k information from the irs website it seems that you could seemingly get away with a salary as low as $ 53,000 it 's tough and i 'd suggest speaking with an accounting professional to get the clear answers because as brick 's answer suggests the irs is n't super clear about it   an excerpt from a separate page regarding 401 k contributions the annual additions paid to a participant ’s account can not exceed the    lesser of there are separate smaller limits for simple 401(k plans example 1 greg 46 is employed by an employer with a 401(k plan and    he also works as an independent contractor for an unrelated business    greg sets up a solo 401(k plan for his independent contracting    business greg contributes the maximum amount to his employer ’s 401(k    plan for 2015 $ 18,000 greg would also like to contribute the maximum    amount to his solo 401(k plan he is not able to make further    elective deferrals to his solo 401(k plan because he has already    contributed his personal maximum $ 18,000 he has enough earned income    from his business to contribute the overall maximum for the year    $ 53,000 greg can make a nonelective contribution of $ 53,000 to his    solo 401(k plan this limit is not reduced by the elective deferrals    under his employer ’s plan because the limit on annual additions    applies to each plan separately

every reward program has to have a funding source if the card gives you x percent back on all purchases that means that their business is structured to entice you to pump more transactions through the system either their other costs are lower or the increased business allows them to make more money off of late fees and interest if the card has you earn extra points for buying a type of item or from a type of store home stores improvement in the spring they are trying to make sure you use their card for what can be a significant amount of business during a small window of time sometimes they cap it by saying 5 cash back at home improvement stores during the spring but only on the first $ 1500 of purchases that limits it to $ 75 maximum adding more business for them makes more money for them groceries and gas are a good year round purchase categories yes there is some variation depending on the season and the weather but overall there is not an annual cliff once the season ends gas and groceries account for thousands of dollars a year these are not insignificant categories for many families are recession proof if they perceive a value from this type of offer they will change their buying behavior   my local grocery store has a deal with a specific gas station this means that they made a monetary deal because you earn points at the grocery store and spend points at the gas station the grocery store is paying some compensation to the gas station every time you use points the gas station must be seeing an increase in business so theoretically they do n't get 100 compensation from the grocery store   in cases where credit cards give airline miles the credit card company buys the miles from the airline at a discount because they know that a significant number of miles will never be used

edit 2 my whole answer was based on my misunderstanding that you were renting out a totally separate property to your girl friend   i finally understand now that you 're renting out a room in your apartment flat to your gf   so based on my new understanding i do n't think it 's necessarily a bad idea   the answer below is my answer to a different question original answer my answer has nothing to do with business but is totally relationship based    if you care about her in a we might be together a long time way then i would n't do this   i do n't care what arrangements you setup before hand at some point you 're bound to feel like she owes you something at some point   let alone the easiest of situations to imagine she 's late on the rent she loses her job and ca n't pay etc you 'll be forced to make decisions about how much your desire to love and care for her outweighs your need to pay your mortgage   you can argue how your are all day long but is this something you want to bring into your relationship now if you do n't really care to stay with her that long and you could do life with or without her then go for it   i think the big question is is your relationship worth £ 200 edit in the interest of supporting my opinion here are a few articles i found on the subject unfortunately the way renting to friends or family often works out is far from what would be expected between people who care about one another for the most part friends and family members will actually make bad renters because they ’ll expect more from you than a tenant who does n’t know you you may get a lot of requests for maintenance and repairs even for minor things and you may also find that family members and friends think they should be entitled to perks because of your personal relationship with them when they do n’t get special treatment they can get angry with you and that hurts both your professional relationship and your personal relationship american apartment owners association in my experience landlords renting to relatives does n't work out perfectly said a realtor ® associate at williams realty in ca when you do n't know each other there are fewer problems

contrary to most other advise given here i 'd recommend in your situation not to invest in stock yet there are some hidden cost to investing that will eat your profit and in the end that 's why you are investing banks will charge for buying selling and maintaining stock as well as for cashing dividends depending on which bank or intermediary these costs will rise so my advise is to start playing with stock creating a virtual portfolio and track that just as says start saving also look at my answer here

gt the system is designed   would n't that be more the union is designed why not just end the union 's contract entirely and hire from outside the union or find a different union to negotiate with maybe someone wants to form a union of teachers who want to teach that focuses on job security for the best teachers not the longest serving   i mean if i was negotiating for myself i 'd want merit based pay increases rather than seniority based i 'd probably also be asking that my health benefits be the same as the district administration i might ask for a clause saying that i ca n't be fired unless all worse performing teachers have already been fired yeah about measuring that have n't figured that out yet i might also ask for some sort of third party policy for representation in the event that there 's a need to lawyer up under circumstances where a conflict of interest exists between myself and the district   the last of those the lawyer issue i 've been told by at least one teacher that they feel that 's the primary service the union provides they hate the contract negotiations because they always seem to go to threats to strike before being resolved   i guess it just seems weird to me that once a union has formed the union has a monopoly on providing the services you 'd think that some could join the union while others could choose to operate independently if the advantages of being in the union outweigh the advantages of being independent then you 'd expect everybody to join a 51 vote to unionize seems like a terrible reason to bring the rest of the employees and any new hire along for the ride it should be an individual 's choice to be represented by the union and whether to accept the union terms or negotiate on their own

you 've asked eleven different questions here   therefore the first thing i 'd recommend is this do n't panic seek answers to your questions systematically one at a time   search this site and others to see if there are answers to some of them   you 're in good shape if for no other reason than you 're asking these when you 're young investing and saving are great things to do but you also have time going for you   i recommend that you use your other eight hours per day to build up other income streams   that potentially will get you far more than a 2 deposit any investment can be risky or safe   it depends on both your personal context and that of the larger economy   the best answers will come from your own research and from your advisors since they will be able to see where you are financially and in life

when you say donate it usually assumes charitable donation with in this context tax benefit that is not what happens in your scenario giving someone money with the requirement of that someone to spend that money at your shop is not donation it is a grant you can do that but you wo n't be able to deduct this as charitable donation but the money paid to you back would be taxable income to you i respectfully disagree with joe that its a wash it is not you give them money that you can not deduct as an expense as it is not business expense or donation as strings are attached but you do give them the money it is no longer yours when they use the money to pay you back that same money becomes your taxable income end result you provide service and you 're the one paying taxes for it why would you do that

one reason i have heard beside to keep you paying rent is the cost of maintenance and improvements   if you hire someone else to do all the work for you then it may very well be the case though it is not as bad as a car many factors come into play    if you are lucky you may end up with a lot that is worth more than the house on it in a few decades time personally i feel that renting is sometimes better than owning depending on the local market   that said when you own a home it is yours   you do have to weigh in such factors as being tied down to a certain location to some extent   however only the police can in under certain circumstances where as a landlord can come in whenever they feel like given proper notice or an emergency   not to mention that if someone a door so hard that it through the entire place you can actually deal with it the point of this last bit is the question of home ownership vs renting is rather subjective   objectively the costs associated with home ownership are the drags that may make it a bad investment   however it is not like car ownership which is quite honestly rarely an

in general i 'd try to keep things as simple as possible if your plan is to have a three fund portfolio like total market total international and bond and keep those three funds in general then having it separated now and adding them all as you invest more is fine and upgrade to admiral shares once you hit the threshold for it likewise just putting it all into total market as suggested in another answer or into something like a target retirement fund is just fine too for that amount while i 'm all in favor of as low expense ratios as possible and it 's the kind of question i might have worried about myself not that long ago look at the actual dollar amount here you 're comparing 0.04 to 0.14 on $ 10,000 that 0.1 difference is $ 10 per year any amount of market fluctuation or buying on an up day or selling on a down day is going to pretty much dwarf that amount by the time that difference in expense ratios actually amounts to something that 's worth worrying about you should have enough to get admiral shares in all or at least most of your funds in the long run the amount you manage to invest and your asset allocation is worth much much more than a 0.1 expense ratio difference now if you 're going to talk about some crazy investment with a 2 expense ratio or something that 's another story but it 's hard to go wrong at vanguard in that respect

keep in mind this is a matter of preference and the answers here are going to give you a look at the choices and the member 's view on the positive negative for each one   my opinion is to put 20 down to avoid pmi if the bank will lend you the full 80 then buy the house move in and furnish it keep track of your spending for 2 years minimum it 's the anti budget not a list of constraints you have for each category of spending but a rear view mirror of what you spend this will help tell you if in the new house you are still saving well beyond that 401(k and other retirement accounts or dipping into that large reserve   at that point start to think about where kids fit into your plans people in million dollar homes tend to have child care that 's 3 5x the cost the middle class has disclosure 10 years ago our 's cost $ 30k year   today your rate will be about 4 and federal marginal tax rate of meaning a real cost of 3 just under the long term inflation rate 3.2 over the last 100 years i am 53 and for my childhood right through college the daily passbook rate was 5 long term government debt is also at a record low level this is the chart for 30 year bonds   i 'd also suggest you get an understanding of the long term stock market return long term 10 but with periods as long as 10 years where the return can be negative   once you are at that point 2 3 years in the house you can look at the pile of cash and have 3 choices   we are in interesting times right now for much of my life i 'd have said the potential positive return was n't worth the risk but then the mortgage rate was well above 6 7 very different today

if i open current accounts with all these institutions will they know if i move money between them i.e. from the one i pay my salary to to the next to the next etc   of course they will know after all you will provide the account numbers for transferring the money regarding the intent of transfer they do n't care they only care the about the amount coming in regularly refuse to give me the rates and bonuses i want for this i will go through their terms and conditions and you should do it check for any excluded conditions read between the lines but check on what amount will you be getting the interest most of these accounts pay interest daily and on the amount in the account in a day so you might not be generating much of an interest in those accounts if you do n't have a substantial balance

former boeing manufacturing industrial engineer here   i worked in the seattle metro area mostly on aircraft assembly   raises an excellent point   trade offsets are a major driver for commercial aviation sales   it 's pretty simple if you want to sell into japan or china or a lot of other markets you have to bring aircraft work into the country of course you used to be able to just have fabrication work done but nowadays the capabilities are more sophisticated and the ante is constantly being raised   in that sort of environment it 's not surprising that sr management felt a lot of pressure to go in the direction of more outsourcing with bigger and bigger chunks of the airplane involved   that being said it was n't hard to see these types of problems coming   especially when attempting to bring in major new technology e.g. major structural elements made from composite   boeing never seemed particularly strong at risk mitigation

sounds like a terrible situation the only thing i can think of if you have the cash for it is to pay down enough of the mortgage and refinance to the point where the rent covers the mortgage plus expenses on the one hand this feels like literally burning money in the fireplace as you will likely never see back the difference between the likely value when you sell and what you are putting in now on the other hand every time you make an interest payment you are burning the smaller amount of money with no hope of seeing it back ever if you do n't have the cash or you find that just throwing away money then i would get out as fast as i can every month you hold you are paying a huge amount of interest if you sold at $ 300,000 you would have only a $ 30,000 debt to manage the total amount it would take to pay that off at anything resembling normal interest rates would probably be less than you have already sunk into this thing of course if you are willing to bet that the market will come back and make you profitable on what you will have to put in from now on then you might want to hold on personally i would not make that bet all around a terrible situation i wish you lots of luck in resolving it

i 'll just add this in the best hedge funds and proprietary trading funds stock selection is approached very scientifically in order to minimize losses maximize gains researchers think of a trading idea and carefully test it to see which methods of stock selection work and how well and finally they combine them every day researchers update their models based on the past performance of each indicator   all this is just too much work to be done manually firms use machine learning methods to understand markets they try to figure out what is normal what did not happen correctly at a specific time what will happen in future for instance they use deep learning networks to look at data and figure out what is normal and what is not these networks can analyze an of noise and separate out the signal this is very relevant to finance and markets because finding the patterns and anomalies in market data has been the bread and butter of traders for decades deep learning networks give us applications like feature learning by features i 'm referring to certain attributes in data that indicate an event by anticipating them we can help predict future price movements new technology is allowing us to break new ground in managing risk to be a typical and manage risk in ever improving ways it 's the responsibility of every trader whether working for themselves or others to take advantage of this technology to improve the collective investing experience i care very deeply about this i have many close friends in the finance world and without who have lost large amounts of money to poor trade tools and lack of transparency

though mentioned it in a comment i would like to emphasize the point that the financial planner cfp you talked to said that he was a fiduciary   a fiduciary has an obligation to act in your best interests   according to when one person does agree to act for another in a fiduciary relationship the law forbids the fiduciary from acting in any manner adverse or contrary to the interests of the client or from acting for his own benefit in relation to the subject matter   so any of these stack exchange community members may or may not have your best interest at heart but the financial advisor you talked to is obligated to you have to decide for yourself is it worth 1 of your investment to have someone legally obligated to have your best financial interest in mind versus for example someone who might steer you to an overpriced insurance product in the guise of an investment just so they can make a buck off of you   or versus wandering the internet trying to make sense of conflicting advice   in my opinion a fiduciary registered cfp is probably the best person to answer your questions

note the answer below is speculative and not based on any first hand knowledge of pump and dump schemes the explanation with spamming does n't really makes sense for me often you see a stock jump 30 or more in a single day at a particular moment in time unlikely that random people read their emails at that time and decide to buy what i think happens is the does a somewhat risky thing starts buying a lot of shares of a stock that has declined a lot and had low volumes during the previous days as the price starts to increase other people start to notice the jump and join the buying spree also do n't forget that some probably use buy stop orders which are triggered when the price reaches a particular level also there should be some automatic trading involved maybe hft firms do pump and dumps as you have to trade a big volume in a relatively short time span i think it is unlikely to be done by human operators another explanation would be that there is a group of to spread the risk so to speak update as i think more of it it is not necessary to buy a lot of shares you could buy some shares sell them to another and buy from them again at a higher price in several iterations i think this could also work if you do it fast enough these scheme makes sense only you previously bought many shares at the low price possibly during several weeks once the price is pumped high enough you can start selling the shares you previously bought in the days preceding the pump

options are an indication what a particular segment of the market those who deal a lot in options think will happen and just because people think that does n't mean it will   bearing in mind however that people writing covered calls may due so simply as part of a strategy to mitigate downside risk at the expense of limiting upside potential   the presence of more people offering up options is to a degree an indication they are thinking the price will fall or hold steady since that is in effect the bet they are making   otoh the people buying those options are making the opposite bet so who is to say which will be right   the balance between the two and how it affects the price of the options could be taken as an indication of market sentiment within the options market as to the future direction the stock is likely to take i just noticed that blackjack posted the that can be used to model all of this   to address the last part of your question does that mean it will go lower i would say this   the degree to which any of this puts actual pressure on the stock of the underlying instrument is highly debatable since many likely most people trading in a stock never look at what the options for that stock are doing but base their decision on other factors such as price history momentum fundamentals and recent news about the company   to presume that actions in the options market would put pressure on a stock price you would need to believe that a fraction of the buyers and sellers were paying attention to the options market   which might be the case for some quants but likely not for a lot of other buyers    and it could be argued even then that both groups those trading options and those trading stocks are both looking at the same information to make their predictions of the likely future for the stock and thus even if there is a correlation between what the stock price does in relation to options there is no real causality that can be established   we would in fact predict that given access to the same information both groups would by and large be taking similar parallel actions due to coming to similar conclusions regarding the future price of the stock   what is far more likely to pressure the price would be just the shear number of buyers or sellers and also especially since repeal of the uptick rule someone who is trying to actively drive down the price via a lot of shorting at progressively lower prices   something that is alleged to have been carried out by some hedge fund managers in the course of bear raids on particular companies

wow this turns out to be a much more difficult problem than i thought from first looking at it let 's some of the variables to simplify the equations a bit let rb be the growth rate of money in your bank for one period by growth rate i mean the amount you will have after one period so if the interest rate is 3 per year paid monthly then the interest for one month is of 1 = .25 so after one month you have times as much money as you started with similarly let si be the growth rate of the investment then after you make a deposit the amount you have in the bank is pb = s. after another deposit you 've collected interest on the first so you have pb = s rb + s. that is the first deposit with one period 's growth plus the second deposit one more deposit and you have pb = s rb + s rb + s = s + s rb + s etc so after n deposits you have pb = s + s rb + s + s + + s this simplifies to pb = s 1 similarly for the amount you would get by depositing to the investment let 's call that pi except you must also subtract the amount of the broker fee b. so you want to make deposits when pb > pi or b > then just solve for n and you 're done except maybe someone who 's better at algebra than me could solve that for n but i do n't see how to do it further complicating this is that banks normally pay interest monthly while stocks go up or down every day if a calculation said to withdraw after 3.9 months it might really be better to wait for 4.0 months to collect one additional month 's interest but let 's see if we can approximate if the growth rates and the number of periods are relatively small the compounding of growth should also be relatively small so an approximate solution would be when the difference between the interest rates times the amount of each deposit summed over the number of deposits is greater than the fee that is say the investment pays 10 per month more than your bank account wildly optimistic but just for example the broker fee is $ 10 and the amount of each deposit is $ 200 then if you delay making the investment by one month you 're losing   10 of $ 200 = $ 20 this is more than the broker fee so you should invest immediately okay suppose more realistically that the investment pays 1 more per month than the bank account then the first month you 're losing 1 of $ 200 = $ 2 the second month you have $ 400 in the bank so you 're losing $ 4 total loss for two months = $ 6 the third month you have $ 600 in the bank so you lose an additional $ 6 total loss = $ 12 etc so you should transfer the money to the investment about the third month compounding would mean that losses on transferring to the investment are a little higher than this so you 'd want to bias to transferring a little earlier or you could set up a spreadsheet to do the compounding calculations month by month and then just look down the column for when the investment total minus the bank total is greater than the broker fee sorry i 'm not giving you a definitive answer but maybe this helps

its not just citi and bofa even barclays hsbc and other large banks are trading below book value in markets they are listed are there particular assets that are causing these two banks to be valued lower relative to their book values than the other banks there no particular assets given the current economic situation most banks are not making good returns i.e. expected returns of markets are around 10 12 and the returns getting generated are around 4 6 the overall slow down in various segments as well as regulations in most countries mean that banks have to at the business model in short term and generate more revenue the market believes that banks may loose money faster and hence the negative outlook and the trading below the book value note book value is derived in ideal conditions i.e. when the company is healthy if any company were to sell the assets in distress the actual funds raised would be quite a bit less than book value its also to be noted that typically banks would not close out and hence book value to an extent is just an indicator or is it a residual based on their being the biggest losers of 2008 that are still around today the 2008 has gone past this is more recent if you look most of these banks were doing quite well till last year and had recovered substantially after 2008

diversification is extremely important and the one true free lunch of investing meaning it can provide both greater returns and less risk than a portfolio that is not diversified the reason people say otherwise is because they are talking about true portfolio diversification which can not be achieved by simply spreading money across stocks to truly diversify a portfolio it must be diversified across multiple unrelated return drivers i describe this throughout my best selling book and am pleased to provide complimentary links to the following two chapters where i discuss the lack of diversification from spreading money solely across stocks including correlation tables as well as the benefits of true portfolio diversification jackass investing myth 8 trading is gambling investing is safer jackass investing myth 20 there is no free lunch

use the $ 11k to pay down either car loan your choice you should be able to clear one loan very quickly after that lump sum after that continue to aggressively pay down the other car loan until it is clear lastly pay off the mortgage while making sure you are financially stable in other areas cash on hand retirement etc reasoning the car loans are very close in value making it a wash as far as payoff speed the interest is not a large factor here as a percentage of all these numbers the few bucks a month is n't going to change your financial situation this is assuming you will pay off both loans well ahead of schedule making the interest rate negligible in the answer paying off the mortgage last is due to the risk associated with the car loans the cars are guaranteed to lose value at an alarming rate while a house certainly may lose value it is far from an expectation it is likely that your house will maintain and/or increase in value unless you have specific circumstances not disclosed here this makes the mortgage a lower risk loan in your financial world you can probably sell the house to clear the loan balance if necessary the cars are far more likely to depreciate beyond the loan balance

in how much trouble can i get exactly if the irs finds out i    understand that there 's a 6 year statute of limitations on criminal    charges and no limitation at all on fraud is this considered fraud    i 'm assuming not there 's no statute of limitations for fraud which is a criminal charge the statute of limitations is for failure to report income which is not fraud in your case since you willingly decided to not report it knowingly that you should it can most definitely account for fraud so i would n't count on statute of limitations in this case i should amend my taxes for those years that would be the easiest way to go would the irs go all the way and file criminal charges considering the amount of money i owe they have the legal right to and if you do get caught likely they will easy money for them since you obviously have income and can pay all the fines and penalties practically speaking what 's the worst case scenario theoretically can be jail as well being charged in a criminal court even if the eventual punishment is just a penalty is a punishment of its own you 'll have troubles finding jobs passing security checks getting loans approved etc for $ 3200 when you 're in 25 bracket as an individual for years i 'd say not worth it

paraphrased from economics of money banking and financial markets money is 1 a medium of exchange 2 a unit of account 3 a store of value   to the first point as simpson 's brain explained to him money can be exchanged for goods and services   the second money acts as a measure to keep track of the relative worth of an enormous amount of items this makes it much simpler than tracking how many apples are worth how many and so on and so forth as occurs in barter economies   the last point money is a terrible store of value your money tends to inflate meaning that its worth decreases over time   i think your explanation went into territory that it did n't need to your explanation of the creation of money for example seems to imply that the banking system is not involved in the process of money creation when actually the opposite is true

i would be realistic and recognize that however you invest this money it is unlikely to be a life changing sum it is not going to provide an income which significantly affects your monthly budget nor is it going to grow to some large amount which will allow you to live rent free or similar therefore my advice is quite different to every other answer so far if i was you i would i reckon this might get you through half the money take the other $ 25,000 and go travelling plan a trip to europe south america asia or australia ask your job for 3 or 6 months off and quit it they wo n't give it you find a few places which you would really like to visit and schedule around them a lot of time to go where you want book your flights in advance or book one way and put aside enough money for the return when you know where you 'll be coming back from stay in a tent or cheap airbnb. make sure you have a chance to meet other people especially other people who are travelling around figure out in advance how much it will cost you a day to live basically and budget for a few beers restaurants cinema concert tickets drugs whatever you do to have fun   it 's really easy nowadays to go all sorts of places and be very about what you want to do next you will find that everywhere in the world is different all people have something unusual about them and everywhere is interesting you will meet some great people and probably become both more independent and better at making friends with strangers your friends in other countries could stay friends for life the first time you see rome the great barrier the panama canal or the tokyo fish market will be with you forever you have plenty of years to fill up your 401k. you wo n't have the energy and of a 23 year old forever go for it

and ach are a desperate try of the us banking system to get into the 21st century all eu countries and some others have direct deposits and transfers as the standard way of transferring money since about 20 years and since about 5 years it is cost free and one day across all the eu the rest of the world runs mostly country specific system as there is not that large a demand for cross country shifting and exchange rates are also an issue in any such transaction because they have different ways that work fine since decades other countries will consider the idea as a step backwards and will probably ignore it so your answer is none international companies work with banks in a different relationship than retail customers so they can do things you and me can not do depending on size and volume some large companies get a banking license and then handle their own stuff medium sized companies make favorable contracts with banks they are golden goose customers never an issue no brick and mortar presence needed banks love them or they simply suck up the transfer cost if you move millions who cares about a 40 $ fee small businesses whine and live with what they get

in the united states you ca n't because the average millennial in the united states has no opportunity to save money either you get a college education then you will be burdened with a student loan the cost of college education skyrocketed in the past decades it is now practically impossible to enter the workforce without a huge debt unless you are one of the lucky few who has rich and generous parents or you skip college but college is the only way in the united states to obtain a generally accepted qualification so you wo n't get any job which pays enough to save any money as soon as that student loan is paid off you need to get another loan for you house which you pay off for several decades as soon as the house debt is paid off you will be old and develop some medical problems the medical bills will come in and you will be in debt again so when in their life are millennials supposed to save money

for restricted stock i think the vesting date meets the requirements of the second wash sale trigger from irs pub 550 wash sales acquire substantially identical stock or securities in a fully taxable trade i base this on these two quotes from irs pub 525 restricted property any income from the property or the right to use the property is included in your income as additional compensation in the year you receive the income or have the right to use the property until the property becomes substantially vested it is owned by the person who makes the transfer to you usually your employer   so on the vest date the transfer is taxable ownership is transferred to you that seems close enough to a fully taxable trade for me   maybe this changes if you pay the tax on the stock on the grant date see pub 525 restricted property choosing to include in income for year of transfer obviously if this is important you should consult your tax advisor   technicalities aside i do n't think it passes the sniff test you 're getting salable shares when the restricted stock vests if you 're selling other shares at a loss within 30 days of the vesting date that smells like a wash sale to me

hindsight is 20/20 but i offer some suggestions for how this might have gone down if you had told the bank what was going on they might have extended the terms of your loan until the truck was ready alternatively you might have taken the loan was it secured on the truck and put the money in a savings account until the truck showed up while asking the dealer to pay the interest on it until the truck showed up or you might asked the dealer to supply you with a rental truck until yours showed up i 'm not saying i would have thought of these under the circumstances but worth trying

why would someone invest in other instruments e.g. stocks to pay for    childrens college education when the capital gains on those are    taxed unlike a home equity loan many tax advantageous vehicles exist for the purpose of saving for college education such as 529 plans roth iras series ee and i bonds tax and penalty free distributions from a portfolio of stocks is possible if the distributions are for qualified education expenses and the account is in the form of a roth ira   a house is collateral for a home equity line of credit   a combination of unfortunate events could cause someone to default on the loan and loose their residence also the tax advantages of 529 plans and roth iras are not applicable to purchase a motor boat   with respect some people like to leave the home equity loan untapped for other uses more details 529 plans are not taxed by on the federal level when the withdraws are used for college   in many states contributions to state sponsored 529 plans are deductible on the state level   these are not self directed so you ca n't trade stocks bonds in a 529 plan however certain plans allow you to lock in the rate you pay for credit at today 's prices if you want a self directed ability to trade stocks bonds vehicle with tax free disbursements for qualified education consider a roth ira there are yearly contribution limits and penalty if the proceeds are not used for qualified educational expenses also i believe interest revenue from series ee and i bonds is tax free if the bond is used for education there are special conditions and situations to 529 plans roth iras series ee and i bonds the purpose of this answer was to expand upon the tax advantageous vehicles for higher education

you sound like you 're well educated well spoken and so i 'm going to assume that you are somewhere in the neighborhood of top 5 material that means you can pretty much do anything you want to if you put enough effort into it there are two types of people in this world those who run the world and those who live comfortably in it and of course everyone else but they are irrelevant to the discussion who do you want to be i 've been around a lot of wildly successful people and they have two consistent traits   connections and freedom first everyone always told me that it 's not what you know it 's who you know but i never appreciated it until after college the world runs on connections   the more connections you have and the more successful they are the more successful you will be second the more freedom you have the more opportunity you will have to take chances which is how you become wildly successful freedom comes from not being in debt first and having money second why do you think harvard grads are the guys that end up having so much money and power it 's probably because they grew up in a rich family which provided them money freedom and a wide social circle of rich people connections so you 're not rich   what to do well the easiest way to get into that group is to go to college with them and that means you need to get into harvard or another ivy league stanford if you want to be an engineer college will be where you will make your most intense and long lasting friendships   that roommate at harvard that you went on the crazy four day road trip with may someday be ceo of a company and when he needs a cio you can be damn sure you 'll be at the top of the list if you 're qualified but harvard costs a lot of money which means you 'll be in debt a lot when you get out of college you 'll have lots of rich important but you 'll be deeply in debt no freedom most of these type of people end up becoming consultants at big firms because they pay well    you 'll live a comfortable life and pay off your student loans in five or 10 years    then you 'll continue to live comfortably   but at that point you 'll be too old to take huge chances and too comfortable to change things or perhaps you 'll have a big mortgage =   no freedom with a heavy debt load it 's almost impossible to say join an early stage startup and really be able to take huge chances   you can do it maybe   or as an alternate option you can do what i did go to a cheap state school and graduate with no debt that puts you on the other side of the fence   freedom but no connections   then in order to be successful you have to figure out how to get connections goldman sachs wo n't hire you and everyone you meet is going to automatically assume you 're mediocre because of where you went to college at this point your only option is to take big chances move to new york or san francisco offer to work for free as an intern somewhere or something   it can be done and it 's really not too hard you just have to have lots of spending restraint because the little money you have has to go a long way so what are the other options well some people are recommending that you think about not going to college at all that will certainly save you money and give you a four year head start on whatever you decide to do freedom but you 'll forever be branded as that guy without a college degree   think my second option above but just two or three times worse    you wo n't even get that free internship and you 'll be that weird guy at dinner parties who answer the first question so where did you go to college   it does n't matter if you 're self taught   life is n't a meritocracy   if you 're very good you 'll end up getting a nice cushy job pushing ones and zeros a nice cushy golden job well you could go to community college they 're certainly cheap you can spend very little money so you 'll end up with fairly good freedom    i might add though that community colleges teach trades and not high level things like management and complex architecture    you 'll be behind technically but not as bad as if you did n't go at all how about connections your fellow students will probably lack ambition money and connections they 'll be candidates for entry level wage slave jobs at fortune 500 companies after they graduate if they get lucky they 'll work up to middle management there 's no alumni association and there 's certainly no club in downtown boston at new york and silicon valley dinner parties having a community college degree is almost as bad as having nothing at all   indeed the entire value of the community college degree will be what you learn and you 'll be learning at the speed and level of your classmates my advice if you get into an ivy league school go and hope you get some grants to help you out the debt will suck but you 'll be well positioned for the future otherwise go to a cheap second tier school where you can get a large scholarship there are also lots of third party scholarships that are out there on the internet you can get i got a couple from local organizations do n't work during college focus on expanding your network instead the future value of a minimum wage job while you 're trying to go through school is practically zero

the first thing that it is important to note here is that the examples you have given are not individual bond prices   this is what is called the generic bond price data in effect a bond with the indicated maturity period   you can see individual bond prices on the uk debt management office website the meaning of the various attributes price yield coupon remains the same but there may be no such bond to trade in the market   so let 's take the example of an actual uk gilt say the 4.25 treasury gilt 2019   the uk debt management office currently lists this bond as having a maturity date of and a price of gbp   this means that you will pay to purchase a bond with a nominal value of gbp 100.00   here the nominal price is the price that hm treasury will buy the bond back on the maturity date    note that the title of the bond indicates a nominal yield of 4.25   this is called the coupon so here the coupon is 4.25   in other words the treasury will pay gbp 4.25 annually for each bond with a nominal value of gbp 100.00   since you will now be paying a price of gbp to purchase this bond in the market today this means that you will be paying to earn the nominal annual interest of 4.25   this equates to a yield where =    it is very important to understand that the yield is not the whole story   in particular since the bond has a nominal value of gbp100 this means that as the maturity date approaches the market price of the bond will approach the nominal price of 100 in this case this means that you will witness a loss of capital over the period that you hold the bond   if you hold the bond until maturity then you will lose gbp for each nominal gbp100 bond you hold   when this capital loss is netted off the interest recieved you get what is called the gross redemption yield   in this case the gross redemption yield is given as approximately 0.75 per annum nb   the data table you have included clearly has errors in the pricing of the 3 month 6 month and 12 month generics

regardless of how long the mortgage has left the return you get on prepayments is identical to the mortgage rate what happens on your tax return is a different matter it 's easier to get a decent financial calculator the ti ba-35 is my favorite than to construct spreadsheets which may or may not contain equation errors when i duplicate john 's numbers $ 100 k mortgage 4 rate i get a 60 mo remaining balance of and with $ 50 extra $ a diff of $ $ return on the $ 3000 $ over 5yrs is $ over an average $ 1500 put in = 4.2   of course the simple math of just averaging the payment creates that .2 error a 60 payment $ 50 returning $ produces k with all due respect there 's nothing for me about time value of money calculations that can be counter intuitive while i like playing with spreadsheets the first thing i do is run a few scenarios and double check using the calculator your updated sheet is now at a time of money calculation should not have rounding errors that larger it 's larger than my back of envelope calculation   if you do n't need the money and would buy a cd at the rate of your mortgage then pay early nothing wrong with that

you should definitely be able to keep the us bank account and credit cards i 'm a uk citizen and resident who worked in the us for a few months on a temporary visa many years back and i still have the us bank account from that time unless you are planning on moving to the uk permanently you also should keep your us bank account and cards to make the process of moving back there eventually easier i would also suggest keeping moving at least a portion of your savings to the us at regular intervals to insure you against the risk that exchange rates will be against you when you move back it 'll also make things easier when you visit the us as you presumably will every so often if you use your us account and cards you wo n't get hit so badly by charges for making each individual payment

he general advice i get is that the younger you are the more higher risk investments you should include in your portfolio i will be frank this is a rule of thumb given out by many lay people and low level financial advisors but not by true experts in finance   it is little more than an old 's tale and does not come from solid theory nor empirical work   finance theory says the following the riskiness of your portfolio should inversely correspond to your risk aversion   period it says nothing about your age   some people become more risk averse as they get older but not everyone   in fact for many people it probably makes sense to increase the riskiness of their portfolio as they age because the uncertainty about both wealth social security the value of your house the value of your human capital and costs how many kids you will have the rate of inflation where you will live go down as you age so your overall level of risk falls over time without a corresponding mechanical increase in risk aversion in fact if you start from the assumption that people 's aversion is to not having enough money at retirement you get the result that people should invest in relatively safe securities until the probability of not having enough to cover their minimum needs gets small then they invest in highly risky securities with any money above this threshold this latter result sounds reasonable in your case   at this point it appears unlikely that you will be unable to meet your minimum needs i'm assuming here that you are able to appreciate the warnings about underfunded pensions in other answers and still feel comfortable   with any money above and beyond what you consider to be prudent preparation for retirement you should hold a risky but still fully diversified portfolio   do n't reduce the risk of that portion of your portfolio as you age unless you find your personal risk aversion increasing

the credit and debit terms here is talking from bank 's point of view should n't be a surprise banks are never known to look at things from the customers pov   in accounting a liability loans owners capital etc is a credit balance and asset cash buildings and such is a debit balance   your account is a liability to the bank in accounting parlance that is because they owe you every single penny that is there in your account btw in literal parlance too if you really make their life harder   so when the bank accepts money from you they need to increase their asset cash which they will debit higher debit balance for asset means more assets and at the same time they also have to account for the added liability by crediting the deposited money into your account so when bank says they have credited your account it means you have more money in your account now if you transfer money from your account to another or make a payment through your account your account will be debited and the beneficiary account will be 's liability towards you reduces more or less what everyone else said here but hey i could also take a swipe at banks

credit unions are mutually owned i.e. customer owned financial institutions that provide banking services   they take deposits from their members customers and loan them to other members   members vote on a board of directors who manage operations    they are considered not for profit but they pay interest on deposits   they get some preferential tax treatment and regulation and their deposits are insured by a separate organization if federally accredited   state chartered credit unions do n't have to maintain deposit insurance at all    their charters specify who can join   they can be based employer based or based on some other group with common interests   regulators restrict them so that they do n't interfere too much with banks   otherwise their preferential tax and regulatory treatment would leave banks uncompetitive    other organizations with similar limits have gone on to be competitive when the limits were released   for example there used to be an insurance company just for government employees the government employees insurance company   you may know it better as geico yes the one with the advertisements   now they offer life and auto insurance all over    credit unions would like looser limitations or no limitations at all but not enough to give up their preferential tax treatment   banks oppose looser limitations and have as much political clout as credit unions

yes what you are describing is an off exchange trade and can be done using stock certificates here you will privately negotiate with the seller on a price and delivery details that is the old school way to do it many companies about 20 of the s&p 500 will not issue paper certificates and you may run a hefty printing fee up to $ 500 source wikipedia above other other type of private party transactions include a deal negotiated between two parties and settled immediately or based on a future event for example warren buffet created a deal with goldman sachs where warren would have the choice to purchase gs shares in the future at a certain price this was to be settled with actual shares rather than cash settled ignoring that he later canceled this agreement if it were to go through the transaction would still have been handled by a broker transferring the shares you can purchase directly from a company using a direct stock purchase plan just pick up the phone ask for their investor relations and then ask if they offer this option if not they will be glad for your interest and look into setting it up for you

it 's not a ponzi scheme and it does create value i think you are confusing creating value and producing something the stock market does create value but not in the same way as toyota creates value by making a car the stock market does not produce anything the main way money enters the stock market is through investors investing and taking money out    the only other cash flow is in through dividends and out when businesses go public     the stock market goes up only when more people invest in it although the stock market keeps tabs on businesses the profits of businesses do not actually flow into the stock market earnings are the in flow that you are missing here business profits do flow back into the stock market through earnings and dividends think about a private company if it has $ 100,000 in profits for the year then the company keeps $ 100,000 but if that same company is publicly traded with   100,000 shares outstanding then all else being equal each of those shares went up by $ 1 when you buy stock it is claimed that you own a small portion of the company this statement has no backing as you can not exchange your stock for the company 's assets you ca n't go to an apple store and try to pay with a stock certificate but that does n't mean the certificate does n't have value using your agriculture example you would n't be able to pay with a basket of tomatoes either you would n't even be able to pay with a lump of gold we used to do that it was called the barter system   companies also do buy shares back from the market using company cash although they usually do it through clearing houses that are capable of moving blocks of 1,000 shares at a time

point being the problem has n't been fixed the deficit went from enormous in 2009 to simply large today   it 's never going to be paid back   the main issue to consider is that today the united states is the third largest oil producer in the world and the largest natural gas producer thanks to hydraulic fracturing most of this surge happened during the obama administration spurred on by relatively high energy prices   without the fracking boom the us economy would still be considered in a commentary oil and gas boom gdp   the $ 300-$400 billion yearly increase in output from oil and gas production economy growth would still be negative manhattan institute senior fellow mark mills shows the extent these industries have contributed to u.s. growth in his new report where the jobs are small businesses unleash energy employment boom   the us manufacturing sector also benefits from this indirectly as low energy costs thanks to suddenly abundant natural gas keeps domestic production affordable without the fracking boom the us economy would be in a european type situation in fact european companies move their manufacturing capacity to the us citing low american gas natural gas boom attracting manufacturing us overseas take advantage cheaper   the problem with all of this is that we know that fracking is not sustainable it depends on very high oil prices which consumers simply ca n't afford to continue paying without oil prices rising the industry is forced to enter further and further into debt part of the reason oil prices are so high in the first place right now is because of speculative traders who expect oil prices to rise higher in the future which is unlikely to happen   when obama claimed that there is 100 years worth of natural gas in the us he was wrong if he really believes that story himself it 's going to lead him to take bad decisions by basing an economy on hypothetical cheap energy that wo n't be there in the future the gdp contribution by the fracking industry is going to evaporate at which point you 're left with a massive debt you ca n't pay back

if one has established a liquid emergency fund of 3 to 6 months income as suggested in several places here as well as being recommended by many financial planners then a savings account is a great place to keep that money all things being equal between the savings and checking account the limited transfers should be a non issue since ideally you wo n't be using that money and if you need to in an emergency you could move a whole months worth of expenses to checking in one transfer   the savings account gives you a place to keep the emergency fund segregated from your normal funds out of sight out of mind as it were a savings account also gives you a place to stash funds intended for short term goals away from normal use funds one such example i can use is that i am purchasing several plane tickets for various family members to come visit for christmas i have those funds set aside in a savings account so they do n't interfere with my budgeting of my normal living expenses while these are just examples and your situation may vary they are both examples of where a savings account would be useful even if it is identical to a checking account   edit   using other types of accounts can also accomplish the same thing since we are using the assumption that the checking and savings accounts are identical the benefit of using a savings account is that it is usually inherently linked to the associated checking account without any additional effort on the part of the account holder any other account type would require additional effort however minor on the part of the account holder to link them in such a way that would make transfers between accounts as easy as possible

i agree with option 3 from the accepted answer his hers joint but with one caveat that my wife and i are finding out once you have children if your income is in the mid range where you are not paycheck to paycheck but are not floating in excess money either ie you can have a vacation but you have to plan for it and save up for a few months to do so the child relative expenses begin to be a huge factor in your overall budget such that particularly if one partner does more of the child related buying it can be hard to really keep up the 3 account separation because those child related expenses may end up being all of one earner 's paycheck we originally did the 3 way split where we took rent car and utilities from joint ie each transferred a reasonable portion to the joint account to cover and just bought groceries each occasionally such that it was generally a reasonable split as we both shopped for groceries and both earned close enough to each other that it worked out   but once we had kids it ended up being very different and we eventually had to more properly budget all of our funds as if they were basically joint funds   while we still do have separate accounts and largely separate credit cards etc except for one joint card it 's almost pro forma now due to the kids

you 're confusing a lot of things here company b llc will have it 's sales run under company a llc and cease operating as a separate entity these two are contradicting each other if b llc ceases to exist it is not going to have it 's sales run under a llc since there will be no sales to run for a non existent company what happens is that you merge b llc into a llc and then convert a llc into s corp. so you 're cancelling the ein for b llc you 're cancelling the ein for a llc because both entities cease to exist you then create a ein for a corp which is the converted a llc and you create a dba where a corp dba b shop you then go to the bank and open the account for a corp dba b shop with the ein you just created for a corp. get a better accountant before you convert to s corp

this answer is an attempt to answer the actual question posed please keep in mind that this applies specifically to the equifax credit model that mint uses as mentioned in the accepted answer and that different models may react in different ways or not at all as mentioned in the comments the number of total accounts you have does not have much bearing on your overall credit score if you click on mint 's about total accounts link you get the following statement total accounts has a low impact on your score second the way the total accounts score is represented is misleading this is not a count of the total number of accounts you have open but rather how many accounts you have in your total history mint 's under this metric is flat out wrong try to have a good mix of credit lines open to back up the assertion that this is looking at total accounts in your credit history rather than just those that are open my mint report shows 2 open accounts and 7 closed accounts for a total of 9 under the total accounts metric i am plotted smack in the middle of the not bad range right where people with 9 would be plotted so the proper advice here is to just let it be and only open new accounts as you need them as you amass credit history this metric will continue to grow naturally it should never decrease you may ask then why did your overall score decrease when you paid off your student loans most likely because your average age of credit dropped when you closed your loan account if you 're like most people i know your student loan is one of your oldest accounts so closing that account will hurt your score credit age is measured only on your open accounts

taking into account that you are in cyprus a euro country you should not invest in usd as the usa and china are starting a currency war that will benefit the euro meaning if you buy usd today they will be worth less in a couple of months as for the way of investing your money look at it like a boat race starting on the 1st of january and ending on the 31st of december each year there are a lot of boats in the water some are small some are big some are whole fleets your objective is to choose the fastest boat at any time if you invest all of your money in one small boat that might sink before the end of the year you are putting yourself at risk say startup capital if you invest all of your money in a medium sized boat you still run the risk of it sinking say stock market stock if you invest all of your money in a the risk of it sinking is smaller and the probability of it ending first in the race is also smaller say a stock of a multinational a fleet is limited by it 's slowest boat but it will surely reach the shore say a fund now investing money is time consuming and you may not have the money to create your own portfolio your own fleet so a fund should be your choice however there are a lot of funds out there and not all funds perform the same   most funds are compared with their index a 3 star morningstar rated fund is performing on par with it 's index for a time period a 4 or 5 star rated fund is doing better than it 's index most funds fluctuate between ratings a 4 star rated fund can be mismanaged and in a number of months become a 2 star rated fund or the other way around but it 's not just luck depending on the money you have available your best bet is to buy a number of star rated managed funds there are a lot of factors to keep into account currency is one geography sector do n't buy for less than € in one fund and do n't buy more than 10 funds stay away from gold unless you want to speculate short term stay away from the usd for now and if you can prevent it do n't put all your eggs in one basket

are you interested in your rented home here in singapore if you are struggling with financial difficulties you can apply for a renovation loan offered by banks most banks in singapore offer renovation loans and home loans only to those who own a property it is very hard to find a renovation loan for a rented home   home loans for renovation   you can take a home loan for your rented property and top up your home loan to finance your renovation project if you already have a home loan all you need to do is ask your bank representative to add extra financing to your home home for renovation purpose applying for a home loan for a rented property is simple you can use an online loan calculator and compare home loans provided for a rented property according to your repayment capacity and financial requirements you can choose a home loan and use it for renovation make sure you have a good credit score while applying so that your home loan gets approved easily   personal loans for renovation   if you are not able to find too many home loans or renovation loans for rented property you need not worry have you considered taking a personal loan to make awesome home improvement measures that ’s right you can apply for a personal loan and use the funds to renovate your the best thing about a personal loan is that a lender does not enquire about the purpose for your loan application so you can use your personal loan for any of your needs   eligibility criteria for personal loans   the general criteria to be qualified for a personal loan in singapore are the applicant should be 21 to 65 years old the applicant should be a or a permanent resident or a foreigner the minimum income requirement for a or pr is generally p.a and p.a for a foreigner   when are personal loans ideal for renovation   there are a few situations when a personal loan is the best option for renovating your rented property many banks give personal loans with attractive promotions such as interest free loan for a certain period you can take this loan and even repay the full amount before the zero interest period expires this will help you save efficiently on your renovation project the minimum income required to secure a home loan is generally higher than the income requirement for a personal loan hence a personal loan is a better option a home loan generally gives a higher sum of money than a personal loan this high amount is suitable for a construction project but will be excessive for renovation work therefore it makes more sense to apply for a personal loan to give the perfect makeover to the in your home the approval process for a home loan is typically very lengthy personal loan applications get approved within 24 hours by most banks in singapore so now you can apply for a personal loan without any tension and remodel your to have a party at home sweet home personal loan rates are generally lower than home loan rates you can refurbish your living space by paying your loan at an interest rate not more than 4 now you would have got a fair idea about how to finance your work always remember to enquire about every loan ’s terms and conditions never sign any loan contract without being absolutely clear about the loan ’s features

there are a few incorrect assumptions in your question but the tl;dr version is all or most of the withdrawal is taxable income that is reported on lines total distribution and 15b taxable amount of form 1040 none of the distribution is given special treatment as qualified dividends or capital gains regardless of what happened inside the ira and none of the distribution is subject to the 3.8 net investment income tax that some high income people need to compute on form if the withdrawal is not a qualified distribution it will be subject to a 10 excise tax tax penalty on premature withdrawal not all contributions to traditional iras are deductible from income for the year for which the contribution was made people with high income and/or coverage by a workplace retirement plan pension plan 401(k plan 403(b plan etc can not deduct any contributions that they choose to make to a traditional ira such people can always make a contribution subject to them having compensation earned income such as salary or wages self employment income commissions on sales etc but they do n't get a tax deduction for it just as contributions to roth iras are not deductible whether it is wise to make such nondeductible contributions to a traditional ira is a question on which reasonable people can hold different opinions   be that as it may nondeductible contributions to a traditional ira create or add to what is called the basis of an ira they are reported to the irs on form 8606 which is attached to the federal form 1040   note that the ira custodian or trustee is not told that the contributions are not deductible earnings on the basis accumulate tax deferred within the ira just as do the earnings on the deductible contributions now when you make a withdrawal from your traditional ira no matter which of your various ira accounts you take the money from part of the money is deemed to be taken from the basis and is not subject to income tax while the rest is pure taxable income that is none of the rest is eligible for the reduced taxation rates for qualified dividends or capital gains and since it does not count as investment income it is not subject to the 3.8 net investment tax of form either computation of how much of your withdrawal is nontaxable basis and how much is taxable income is done on form 8606 note that you do n't get to withdraw your entire basis until such time as when you close all your traditional ira accounts how is all this reported well your ira will send you form 1099-r reporting the total amount of the withdrawal what income tax if any was withheld etc the do n't know what your basis is and so box 2b will say that the taxable amount is not determined you need to fill out form 8606 to figure out what the taxable amount is and then report the taxable amount on line 15b of form 1040 the total withdrawal is reported on line which is not included in the agi computations note that as far as the irs is concerned you have only one traditional ira the a in ira stands for arrangement not account as most everybody thinks and your traditional ira can invest in many different things stocks bonds mutual funds etc with different custodians if you choose but your basis is in the ira not the specific investment that you made with your nondeductible contribution that 's why the total ira contribution is limited not the per account contribution and why you need to look that the total value of your ira in determining the taxable portion not the specific account(s from which you withdrew the money so how much basis did you withdraw   well if you withdrew $ w during 2016 and the total value of all your traditional ira accounts was $ x at the end of 2016 and your total basis in your traditional ira is $ b then assuming that you did not indulge in any traditional to roth rollovers for 2016 multiply w by to get the amount of nontaxable basis in the withdrawal b thus gets reduced for 2017 by amount of basis withdrawal what if you never made a nondeductible contribution to your traditional ira or you made some nondeductible contributions many years ago and have forgotten about them well you could still fill out form 8606 reporting a zero basis but it will just tell you that your basis continues $ 0 or you could just enter the total amount of your withdrawal in lines and 15b effectively saying that all of the withdrawal is taxable income to you the irs does not care if you choose to pay taxes on nontaxable income

generally speaking the lower credit score trumps   in the case you cite the lower credit score will prevail   however you may need to do exactly that in order to qualify for the loan income wise    there are two factors when obtaining a mortgage really all loans but more so with a mortgage   the to repay credit score   and your ability to service the debt   this last one is a combination of income and debt to income ratio if you do n't have enough income to qualify for the loan or fail to meet the debt to income ration you may have to use your gf 's income to qualify despite her poor credit you might want to see past posts about buying property with non spouses   it could work but generally it requires a lot of legal work before closing on the deal   avoiding this will lead to tales of woe

that 's easy keep making the payments and go on with life the number that matters more than loan market value is loan equity as long as you can sell it for enough to pay the balance on your loan you should be okay not saying it does n't suck but financially you are fine if you owe more than the house is worth i 'd suggest paying it down as quickly as possible to fix that ratio to reduce your financial risk in case you lose your source of income personally i think it is pretty slimy for people to walk away from house notes or try to short sell them when they can afford to continue payments just because the market value of the house fell   how would you feel if when house prices were skyrocketing the bank canceled your loan and repossessed your house because they could resell it for more money not that they could realistically just speaking hypothetically

i would advise to never cash out retirement funds unless you 're actually retired or in case of an extreme emergency not only because of the huge tax bill that you 'd incur as mentioned in addition to your top bracket rate add 10 but also because you will never be able to recover from the loss your current retirement fund is the one that will compound the most by the time you deposit the same amounts you 're thinking of withdrawing now the compound effect would have grown the original amount further by the time you could catch up it would compound further you will never be able to repair the damage of early withdrawal at this stage consider this calculation lets say you worked for 10 years out of 40 years of your career path and have $ 1 k to deposit a year for ease of computation essentially by withdrawing now you 'll reduce your retirement savings by about 50 in thirty years from now how much is that 6 interest on your student loan i seriously doubt its worth it

one advantage of the chip cards is that the card information needed to make purchases ca n't be easily skimmed or stolen   another is that it is more difficult to create a fake physical card   these advantages still exist regardless of what form of verification is used or even if no verification is used the type of fraud you 're describing in which your card is physically lost or stolen is a relatively small proportion of total fraud 14 according to this site   one reason this is not as big a problem is that often if you lose your card or get robbed you know the card is compromised and you can cancel it   even if it takes you a while to do this at least you are on the alert   the real danger comes when your card info is stolen without your knowledge and this is harder to do with a chip card it 's also worth noting that there are more ways for a fraudster to get than being caught red handed entering the wrong pin at the point of sale   the credit card companies are still tracking card usage and watching for unusual purchases that might indicate fraud   also sometimes fraudsters do surprisingly dumb stuff like use the card to buy something online and mail it to themselves   so it 's not correct to say that there is zero risk of getting caught   with both stripe and chip cards you can catch the person by tracking them via their usage of the card the biggest security risk with the new cards is that many vendors do n't actually require use of the chip at all they still let you swipe   however with changes to credit card liability policies this is a risk for the vendors not for you

i like muro questions no i do n't think they do   because for me as a personal finance investor type just trying to save for retirement they mean nothing if i can not tell what the basic business model of a company is and how that business model is profitable and makes money then that is a no buy for me   if i do understand it they i can do some more looking into the stock and company and see if i want to purchase i buy index funds that are indexes of industries and companies i can understand   i let a fund manager worry about the details but i get myself in the right ballpark and i use a simple logic test to get there not the word of a rating agency if belong in the system as a whole i could not really say   i could not possibly do the level of accounting research and other investigation that rating agencies do so even if the business model is sound i might lose an investment because the company is not an ethical one   again that is the job of my fund manager to determine   furthermore and i mitigate that risk by buying indexes instead of individual stock

you could conceivably open a few accounts   for example a bank account and a credit card account   then the accounts will be older when evaluated for credit when you return   this would look better than opening fresh accounts later   but do n't expect a big difference in score   and you 'll be stuck with those accounts in the future otherwise you lose the benefit   i would n't worry about maintaining balances now   you can wait until you come back   occasional purchases may be helpful    what they really want to see is a regular and sustained use of accounts without missing payments or   but if you 're not going to be here you ca n't really do that   note that good credit scores are based on seven years of data preferably a lot of it   opening a few accounts ca n't substitute for that even if you put balances on them    if you 're not here you wo n't be paying rent or utilities   you wo n't have a proven payment history on the most common accounts    if money were no object you could do something like purchase a house or condo that you could rent out utilities included   that would build up a payment history   but if money were no object you probably would n't be worried about your credit score   it 's more practical to just live normally and be sure that you always live within your means so that you do n't experience negative credit events    you might think about why you want a good credit score   is it to borrow a lot of money   you might be able to spend money to achieve that   is it to save money on future borrowing   if it costs money now how much will you save total    opening accounts now that you wo n't really use until you return is about the only thing that you can do that wo n't cost you money   perhaps put a balance on the bank account at least you 'll get that money back some day   maintaining a balance on the credit cards would cost you money in interest charges and you do n't really benefit from an improved credit score until you use your credit   so the interest fees are n't really buying you anything

i would advise against wasting this rare opportunity on mundane things like by paying off debts or buying toys you can always pay those from your wages plus you 'll inevitably accumulate new debts over time so debt repayment is an ongoing concern this large pile of cash allows you to do things you ca n't ordinarily do so use the opportunity to invest buy a house then rent it out rent an apartment for yourself the house rent will pay most maybe all of the mortgage plus the mortgage interest is tax deductible so you get a lower tax bill and houses appreciate over time so that 's an added bonus when you get married and start a family you 'll have a house ready for you partially paid off with other people 's money

if the person has prepared put your affairs in order then they will have a will and an executor and this executor will have a list of the life insurance policies and will contact the companies to arrange payouts to the beneficiaries it 's not really the beneficiary 's job to do that if the person has n't made a list of their policies but has a will and an executor then the executor can try things like looking at recently paid bills you 're sending $ 100 a month to friendly life insurance company bet it 's a life insurance policy or paperwork that is in the person 's home or their safety deposit boxes even if you do n't have the key to those boxes a copy of the will and the death certificate will get the box drilled out for you if you do n't know what bank they might have sd boxes at again your paperwork will get the manager to find out for you if there is a box at that particular branch so a day spent visiting branches can be fruitful something i know from personal experience with someone whose affairs were nowhere near in order generally you find out you 're a beneficiary of a will because the executor tells you i suppose it 's possible that a person might name you beneficiary of their life insurance without telling you or anyone else and without writing a will but it 's pretty unlikely if you 're worried i suggest you encourage your parents grandparents and other likely of you to write up some paperwork and keep it somewhere family is likely to find it not hidden inside a book on a or in the back of the wool

a bond fund will typically own a range of bonds of various durations in your specific fund the fund holds high quality long term new york municipal bonds with an    average duration of approximately years so through this fund you get to own a range of bonds and the fund price will behave similar to you owning the bonds directly   the fund gives you a little diversification in terms of durations and typically a bit more liquidity   it also may continuously buy bonds over time so you get some averaging vs. just buying a bond at a given time and holding it to maturity   this last bit is important over long durations the bond fund may perform quite differently than owning a bond to maturity due to this ongoing refresh   another thing to remember is that you 're paying management fees for the fund 's management as with any bond investment the longer the duration the more sensitive the price is to change in interest rates because when interest rates change the price will track it i.e. compare a change of 1 for a one year duration vs. 1 yearly over 10 years if i 'm correct why would anyone in the u.s. buy a long term bond fund    in a market like this one where interest rates are practically    bottomed out that is the multi trillion dollar question   bond prices today reflect what people are willing to pay for them   those people include the federal reserve which through various programs qe operate twist etc has been forcing the interest rates to where they want to see them   if no one believed the fed would be able to keep interest rates where they want them then the prices would be different but given that investors know the fed has access to an infinite supply of money it becomes a more difficult decision to bet against that   aka do n't fight the fed   my personal belief is that rates will come up but i have n't been able to translate that belief into making money   this question is very complex and has to do not only with us policies and economy but with the status of the us currency in the world and the world economy in general   the other saying that comes to mind in this context is that the market can remain irrational and it certainly seems to be that longer than you can remain solvent

ok it 's a bit of a but here goes you only pay corporation tax in the uk on any profit made so your salary would not be classed as part of the profit so in the example you give you would only pay corporation tax on £ 4k less your salary ie £ so profit on the £ 800 remaining gross profit you do n't say if your figures are monthly annual etc but you only pay income tax if you earn over £ in any given tax year the rates increase as your income does check here   you may have a different tax code you would need to check that with hmrc but the link gives the default position which is correct for most people if the figures you give are monthly then i would consult an accountant as they are likely to save you more than they will charge for their services you will probably find it is most tax efficient to pay yourself a dividend from the company 's profits but check with an accountant more info

you can you can take out a conventional mortgage and keep the cash   a mortgage is nothing but a secured loan against your home you can open a heloc and treat it as a negative equity bank account note that both a mortgage and a heloc tend to have significant up front or administrative costs attached to them   it costs the loaning institution some money to ensure they are in a safe position and they will want to pass it on to you they do n't want you taking out such a loan and not using it on the other hand the interest rates on such a loan are often much lower than interest rates on other loans if you have a reliable source of significant income getting a completely unsecured line of credit may be possible with a rate only a few percentage points higher than a heloc without having to pay a cent in fees   the bank does n't have to appraise your home or ensure ownership before such a loan just assess income which is easy especially if you have a regular paycheck auto deposited into an account at the same branch toss in some signatures from your employer and good to go if that is feasible you could end up with a lower rate   withdraw from the line of credit pay off your other loans then work to repay the line of credit if an unsecured line of credit has a rate 1 3 higher than a secured one and you are borrowing 5000 $ against it and pay it off over 2 years the total interest you would save from a secured line is about note that in some jurisdictions your home is protected against loss from bankruptcy unless you have used it as collateral for a loan or it is easier to claim the home if you are insolvent if you have used it as collateral   determining what the consequences of securing your loan against the house could itself be expensive

it 's important because you may be able to reduce the total amount of interest paid by paying the loan faster but you can do nothing to reduce the total of your principal repayments the distinction can also affect the amount of tax you have to pay some kinds of interest payments can be counted as business expenses which means that they reduce the amount of income you have to pay tax on but this is not generally the case for money used to repay the loan principal

the problem with rate of return calculation on short positions is that the commonly used approach assumes an initial investment creating a cash outflow if we want to apply this approach to short selling we should look at the trade from another perspective we buy money and pay for this money with stock our investment to buy 50 $ in your example is 1 share   when closing the short position we effectively sell back our money 50 $ and receive 2 shares our profit on this position is obviously 1 share setting this in relation to our investment of 1 share yields a performance of 100    in reality we do not sell back the entire cash but only the amount needed to get back our investment of 1 share this is actually comparable to a purchase of stock which we only partially close to get back our invested cash amount and keep the remaining shares as our profit

when you start investing makes a very large difference to the outcome but that is on the time scale of what generation you were born into not what week you choose to open your 401(k   as you note in your last sentence there is nothing that you can do about this so there is no point in worrying about it if you could successfully market time successfully then that would make a difference even at smaller time scales   but you probably ca n't so there is no point in worrying about that either as points out your statement about not their net worth until 2013 applies to someone who invested a lump sum at the 2007 peak not to someone who invested continuously throughout    by my calculation if you started continuously investing in a broad market index at the peak around jun 4 2007 you would have recovered your net worth relative to investing in a safe instrument that merely kept up with inflation a hard thing to find these days around april 12 2010   i 've done the computation on each business day because that is easier so it might be slightly worse if do the periodic investment on each payday which is much more realist for a 401(k and of course if you need to preserve recover you net worth in 3 years you should n't be in stocks in the first place

it definitely depends on the exchange you are trading on i 'm not familiar with scottrade but a standard practice is to fulfill limit orders in the order they are placed    most of the time you would n't see stocks trade significantly under your bid price but since penny stocks are very volatile it 's more likely their price could drop quickly past your bid and then return above it while only fulfilling a portion of the orders placed example 1 penny stock priced at $ 0.12 2 others place limit orders to buy at $ 0.10 3 you place limit order to buy at $ 0.10 4 stock price drops to $ 0.07 and some orders are filled anything $ 0.07 or higher based on a first come first served basis 5 due to the increase in purchases of the penny stock the price rises above $ 0.10 before your order is filled edit adding additional clarification from comment section a second example if the price drops from $ 0.12 to $ 0.07 then orders for all prices from $ 0.07 and above will start to be filled from the oldest order first that might mean that the oldest order was a limit buy order for 100 shares at $ 0.09 and since that is above the current ask price it will be filled first the next order might be for 800 shares at $ 0.07 it 's possible for a subset of these to be filled let 's say 400 before the share 's price increases from the increased demand then if the price goes above $ 0.10 your bid will not be filled during that time

true but the gop supports this network and framework of us law that actually encourages businesses to do this   dems like obama want to do a minimum tax for multinationals to make american employees more attractive and to end some of the tax hiding these corps which depend on the american military and good name to make a profit   the gop are against this   we should nt give corporate america a free reign and then ask the american worker to compete with workers in other countries that do nt give a fuck about the enviroment they do nt care if they kill every fish in the rivers to compete with workers that live in countries with zero labor laws   the answer is not to fuck out enviroment   the answer is not for americans to take pay cuts   the answer is not outsourcing   the answer is not to do away with our clean air and clean water laws   the answer is to make it less profitable for corps that enjoy all the benefits of being american for them to send jobs overseas the easiest way to do this is with tax code   you ca nt just have your base in america use our army our intelligence services and our strong arming and courts but then only employ people in china

hi ly   it 's really great you are doing this and i hope some of the suggestions help you    when i was in wonderful angkor wat a few things struck me as very helpful    1 make your tuk tuk recognizable and write you name somewhere this way when i go out of a temple you will be easy to spot   2 you seem to speak english well this is an important aspect your customers will really appreciate   3 from what i 've seen the methods for getting customers for your tuk tuk in siem reap is as follows get them when they get off the bus and drive them to the hotel then try to tell them to invite you back the next day for taking them to angkor wat i am sure this works but since everybody are doing it i imagine it 's the hardest way for customer acquisition you can distinguish yourself from the other drivers by    a. making sure you show the customers you have excellent english and you can share you knowledge with them    b. sell western style kind of less pushy smile at a potential customer when they see you they will smile back talk to them in your normal voice volume this will make them come closer since they want to hear what a nice smiling guy like is saying   then explain their options for visiting the temples     4 make deals with hotels and people trust the receptionists at their hotel more than street tuk tuks it is highly likely they will ask the reception for the best way to get to angkor wat and you should be the one they recommend try getting on as many lists as possible and high up that list as possible    5 having cold water wet wipes and other commodities are nice ideas but i am not sure this will what get people in your tuk tuk it will only make them more satisfied once they are inside it might be to hard and expensive to keep them ice cold but you can suggest travelers to stop at a kiosk where they can but some supplies before the trip or make a deal with a kiosk and before you exit siem reap stop there and give them a fresh water bottle from the fridge   most importantly do n't spend money on stuff like and curtains before you are sure they are money makers i am pretty sure 99 of customers will not notice they extended they take fresh air for granted     i hope you found this helpful and please feel free to message me   hope to see you soon

edited pub 550 says 30 days before or after so the example is ok but still a gain by average share basis   on sale your basis is likely defaulted to average price in the example so there was a gain selling at 10 but can be named shares at your election to your brokerage   and supported by record keeping a pub 550 wash might be buy 2000 10 with basis 20000 sell 1000 nominally a loss of 1000 for now and remaining basis 10000 buy 1000 8 within 30 days    because of the wash sale rule the basis is 10000 + 8000 paid + 1000 disallowed loss from wash sale with a final position of 2000 shares at basis   i think i have the link at the example

from a mathematical expected value standpoint there is no difference between gambling e.g. buying a lottery ticket and investing e.g. buying a share of stock   the former probably has negative expected value while the latter probably has positive expected value but that is not a distinction to include in a definition else every company that gives a bad quarterly earnings report suddenly changes categories however investment professionals have a vested interest in claiming there is a difference that justifies them charging fees to steer you into the right investment   consequently hair splitting ideas like the motive behind a purchase are introduced   the classification of an item to be purchased should not depend on the mental state of its purchaser depending on the situation it may be right to engage in negative ev behavior   for example if you have $ 1000 and need $ 2000 by next week or else you ca n't have an operation and you will die and you ca n't find anyone to give you a loan   your optimal strategy is to gamble your $ 1000 at the best odds you can get with a possible outcome of $ 2000   so even if you only have a 1/3 chance of winning and getting that operation it 's still the right bet if you ca n't find a better one

robert is right saying that options prices are affected by implied volatility but is wrong saying that you have to look at the vix index for two reasons   1 the vix index is for s&p500 options only if you are trading other options it is less useful 2 if you are trading an option that is not at the money your implied volatility may be very different and follow a different dynamics that the vix index   so please look at the right implied volatility   in terms of strategy i do n't think that not doing anything is a good strategy i accept any point of view but you should consider that option traders should be able to adjust positions depending on market view   so you are long 1 call suppose strike 10 suppose the underlying price at the time of entry was 10 so the call was at the money now it 's 9   1 you still have a bullish view buy 1 call strike 9 and sell 2 calls strike 10 this way you have a bull call spread with much higher probability of leading to profit you are limiting your profit potential but you are also reducing the costs and managing the greeks in a proper way and in line with your expectations   2 you become bearish you can sell 1 call strike 9 this way you end up with a bear call spread again you are limiting your profit potential but you are also reducing the costs and managing the greeks in a proper way and in line with your expectations 3 you become neutral buy 1 call strike 8 and sell 2 calls strike 9 this way you end up with a call butterfly you are almost delta neutral and you can wait until your view becomes clear enough to become directional at that point you can modify the butterfly to make it directional   these are just some opportunities you have there is no reason for you to wait options are eroding contracts and you must be fast and adjust the position before time starts eroding your capital at risk   it 's true that buying a call does n't make you loose more than the premium you paid but it 's better to reduce this premium further with some adjustment is n't it   hope that helps

if history is any guide page ’s idealistic impulses could result in a more sprawling company the following is an example of one of page ’s idealistic impulses wanting people to share spectrum which could result in a more sprawling company if they had n't been outbid google would have expanded by buying a business asset i.e. spectrum which they did n't need i 've no experience with bidding i do n't understand what 's happening at all an auction is a way to sell something instead of offering it for sale at a fixed price you offer it to the highest bidder someone e.g. google says i 'll offer you some amount e.g. a million dollars for it if no one else exceeds that bid then you say sold and google has bought it alternatively someone else comes along with a higher bid i 'll offer you two million dollars for it in which case they 're the new high bidder and you 'll sell it to them unless the process repeats itself with anyone counter offering an even higher bid see also and the disadvantages section of this article alleges currently without a citation that despite the apparent success of spectrum auctions an important disadvantage limiting both efficiency and revenues is demand reduction and bidding the information and flexibility in the process of auction can be used to reduce auction prices by collusion when bidder competition is weak and one bidder holds an apparent advantage to win the auction for specific licenses other bidders will often choose not to the bid for higher prices hence reducing the final revenue generated by the needed in this case the auction is best thought of as a negotiation among the bidders who agree on who should win the auction for each discrete bit of spectrum google 's bid made that impossible or at least ensured that the winning bid would be at least as high as the minimum which was set by google 's bid

your question does not say this explicitly but i assume that you were once a w-2 employee   each paycheck a certain amount was withheld from your check to pay income social security and medicare taxes   just because you did not receive that amount of money earned does not mean it was immediately sent to the irs   while i am not all that savvy on payroll procedures i recall an article that indicated some companies only send in withheld taxes every quarter much like you are doing now   they get a short term interest free loan   for example taxes withheld by a w-2 employee in the later months of the year may not be provided to the irs until 15 january of the next year    you are correct in assuming that if you make 100 k as a w-2 you will probably pay less in taxes than someone who is 100 k self employed with 5 k in expenses   however there are many factors   provided you properly fill out a 1040es and pay the correct amount of quarterly payments you will almost never owe taxes   in fact my experience has been the forms will probably allow you to receive a refund   tax laws can change and one thing the form did not include last year was the medicare surcharge for high income earners catching some by surprise     as far as what you pay into is indicative of the games the politicians play   it all just goes into a big old bucket of money and more is spent by congress than what is in the bucket   the notion of a social security is pure politics fantasy as well as the notion of medicare and social security taxes   the latter were created to make the actual income tax rate more palatable      i 'd recommend getting your taxes done as early as possible come 1 january 2017   while you may not have all the needed info you could firm up an estimate by 15 jan and modify the amount for your last estimated payment   complete the taxes when all stuff comes in and even if you owe an amount you have time to save for anything additional   keep in mind between 1 jan 17 and 15 apr 17 you will earn and presumably save money to use towards taxes   you can always rob from that money to pay any owed tax for 2016 and make it up later all that is to say you will be golden because you are showing concern and planning   when you hear horror stories of irs dealings it is most often that people spent the money that should have been sent to the irs

if you have maxed out your ira contribution for 2017 already and it all went into your roth ira then until the 2017 tax day in april 2018 you can remove any part of this contribution and the earnings from your roth ira without any tax consequences or penalties if you discover in early 2018 that you are not eligible or only partially eligible to contribute to a roth ira then of course you must remove all or part of your 2017 contributions and the earnings from your roth ira by the 2017 tax day in april 2018 indeed if you have filed for an extension of time to submit your 2017 tax return then you have until the extended due date to make the withdrawal as 's answer points out for 2017 you and withdraw and re contribute as many times as you like though if you push this idea to excess with the same ira custodian the custodian may start charging fees   note that irs publication 590b says in the roth ira section withdrawals of contributions by due date    if you withdraw contributions including any net earnings on the contributions by the due date of your return for the year in which you made the contribution the contributions are treated as if you never made them if you have an extension of time to file your return you can withdraw the contributions and earnings by the extended due date the withdrawal of contributions is tax free but you must include the earnings on the contributions in income for the year in which you made the contributions now if in the middle of all these transactions you need to take a distribution from your roth ira during 2017 say because you have a cash flow problem then it makes a lot of sense to first withdraw all your 2017 contributions and the earnings if more money is needed than you can take a distribution from your roth ira what the distribution consists of is described in great detail in publication 590b and you might have to pay a tax penalty for a   premature distribution depending on how much the distribution is the first dollars coming are assumed to be previous contributions in the order in which you made them and these are tax free and penalty free after that the rollover and conversion amounts start to come out and are penalized if they have not spent 5 years in the ira etc but you can put the money back into your roth ira within 60 days and avoid penalties   important notes regarding rollover transactions

it comes down to the resolution you want to have on your personal finances   a package like gnucash allows you to easily answer questions like exactly how much do i spend on interest per month year decade   same with pretty much any other expense liability or asset you have whether it be taxes utilities your home equity or your net worth   the other tools you mention are nice and certainly convenient but they tend to lump things together in broad strokes and omit many categories altogether taxes   ultimately by having such a fine grained accounting tool you can target small or large things to better budget your money    another thing a package like gnucash provides is a single private place to consolidate all of your finances   this is nice for things like net worth and asset accounts that you might not want to give a company access to finally gnucash in particular helps normal people think like accountants   rather than lump everything into income and expenses once you start using gnucash you 'll start thinking in terms of equity liabilities net worth and assets in addition to income and expenses   this gives me a much more accurate view of my finances and helps me better target areas for improvement   in short it helps me to see the broader picture which helps me to keep my eye on the prize which of course is to not have to worry about money at all

if you receive a loan from your parents it is treated legally just as a loan a bank or from any private person with spare money you do n't pay tax on a loan that you get from your bank or your parents and the bank or your parents do n't pay tax when you repay the loan if you pay interest the parents will have to pay tax on the interest just like they would have to pay tax if the money was in their own bank account   i would advice both you and your parents to make sure that a contract is signed saying that this is a loan and how it is repaid and that you follow the contract otherwise if you or your parents treat the loan as an actual present then you might have to pay tax because there is tax due on gifts and you might get a penalty for trying to avoid tax by declaring the gift as a loan so pay the money back only up to £ 3,000 in cash gifts that a person gives each year is tax free but the parents can use any unused money from last year so they can give a gift of £ 6,000 if they gave nothing in the previous year and it is per parent so both the mother and father can make a gift

it is my understanding that the money in the hsa is yours to keep forever even if you leave the country    when you leave the country and no longer have an hsa eligible high deductible health plan you will no longer be able to contribute new money to your hsa   however you can still spend the money on eligible medical expenses even if these expenses are outside the u.s.   however there are a few caveats the hsa money will remain in a u.s. hsa bank account   you wo n't be able to transfer the entire account to a new account in your home country without paying taxes and penalty   therefore you need to have a mechanism for accessing and transferring the money from abroad so that you can reimburse yourself as you have medical expenses until the hsa account is empty even after you leave the u.s. as long as you have the hsa in place you will need to file a u.s. tax return form 1040nr in any year that you have an hsa distribution if you decide to take the money out without medical expenses you will need to pay income tax on the money plus a 20 penalty see how do i withdraw all money from my hsa account as a non resident for more information

square charges a 2.75 fee which the merchant pays so you would be losing money if you only got a 1.5 cashback bonus i would guess that the real reason square prohibits you from getting cash is because of visa mc state and federal regulations   visa mc probably prohibit it for regular merchants due primarily to laws that are designed to prevent money laundering certain merchants like casinos are allowed to give you cash advances against a credit card but regular merchants are not allowed to do this it is much more difficult to get visa mc to approve merchants to handle cash advances and they are subject to many additional regulations   services like western union will let you send cash with a regular credit card but they are classified as money and must comply with additional state and federal regulations if square were to allow cash advances this would likely subject them to a bunch of additional regulations   it would cost them more to comply with these regulations and is outside their business model so they simply prohibit it

i think swenson 's insight was that the traditional recommendation of 60 stocks plus 40 bonds has two serious flaws 1 you are exposed to way too much risk by having a portfolio that is so strongly tied to us equities especially in the way it has historically been recommend 2 you have too little reward by investing so much of your portfolio in bonds if you can mix a decent number of asset classes that all have equity like returns and those asset classes have a low correlation with each other then you can achieve equity like returns without the equity like risk this improvement can be explicitly measured in the sharpe ratio of you portfolio the vanguard risk factor looks pretty and lame to me the book the the ivy portfolio does a great job at covering the swenson model and explains how to reasonably replicate it yourself using low fee etfs

some technical indicators e.g. williams r indicate whether the market is overbought or oversold    every time a stock or commodity is bought it is also sold and vice versa so how can anything ever be over bought or over sold but i 'm sure i 'm missing something what is it you 're thinking of this as a normal purchase but that 's not really how equity markets operate first just because there are shares of stock purchased it does n't mean that there was real investor buyer and seller demand for that instrument at that point in time   markets have dedicated middlemen called market makers who are responsible to make sure that there is always someone to buy or sell this ensures that all instruments have sufficient liquidity   market makers may decide to lower their bid on a stock based on a high number of sellers or raise their ask for a high number of buyers during an investor rush to buy or sell an instrument perhaps in response to a news release it 's possible for market makers to accumulate a large number of shares without end investors being involved on both sides of the transaction   this is one example of how instruments can be over bought or over sold since williams r creates over bought and over sold signals based on historical averages of open close prices perhaps it 's better to think of these terms as over valued and under valued   of course there could be good reason for instruments to open or close outside their expected ranges so williams r is just a tool to give you clues not a real evaluation of the instrument 's true value

the advice i have is short and sweet be an investor not a speculator adopt the philosophy of warren buffet which is the buy and hold philosophy avoid individual stocks and buy mutual funds or etfs pick something that pays dividends and reinvest those dividends do n't become a speculator meaning avoid the buy low sell high philosophy   edit for some reason i can not add a comment so i am putting my response here   the buy low sell high approach makes money for the stock broker not necessarily you as we learn in the movie trading places each buy or sell creates a commission for the broker it is those commission expenses that eat away at your just do n't sell if a security is trading at $ 10 a share and pays $ 0.25 a share each quarter then you are getting 10 roi if you buy that security and if it continues to pay $ 0.25 a share each quarter if the price goes up then the roi for new buyers will go down but your roi will still be the same you will continue to get 10 for as long as you hold that security a mutual fund buys the individual stocks for you the value of the fund is only calculated at the end of the day an etf is like a mutual fund but the value of the etf is calculated moment by moment

any publicly traded financial instrument can be sold short in theory   there are however many regulations associated with short sales of us equities that may prevent certain stocks from being sold short at certain times or through certain brokers some examples the most basic requirement this is n't a regulation it 's just the definition of a short sale is that you or your broker must have access to someone willing to loan you his her shares   if you are interested in shorting a security with few shares outstanding or low trade volume there may simply not be enough people in the world willing to loan you theirs   alternatively there may be a shareholder willing to loan shares but your broker may not have a relationship with the clearing house that shareholder is using   a larger better different broker might be able to help threshold securities list since 2005 each day certain securities are not allowed to be sold short based on their recent history of liquidity   basically if a certain number of transactions in a security have not been correctly settled over the past few days then the sec has reason to believe that short sales which require extra transactions are at higher risk of falling through circuit breaker a.k.a alternative uptick since 2011 during certain market conditions exchanges are now required to reject short sales for certain securities in order to prevent market crashes market abuse

if the op is saving 33 if his her current income he she does n't want or need yet more income from investments right now the advice on diversifying in the other answers is the standard investment advisor response to beginner 's questions and has two advantages for the advisor 1 they wo n't get sued for giving bad advice and 2 they can make a nice fat commission selling you some very average performance products and note they are selling you investment industry products not necessarily good investment opportunities advisors get paid commission and bonuses for selling more stuff not for selling good stuff   my advice would be to drip feed some of your excess income into the emerging market sector maybe 1/3 or 1/4 of the excess with the intention of leaving it there untouched for up to 20 or 30 years if need be at some unknown future time it is almost certain there will be another em boom if only because people have short memories when that happens sell up take your profits and do something less risky with them   you might consider putting another slice of your excess income into the commodities sector i do n't know when the oil price will be back at $ 150 or $ 200 a barrel but i would be happy to bet it will happen sometime in the op 's lifetime since you apparently have plenty of income and are relatively young that is the ideal time to adopt a risky investment strategy even if you lose your entire investment over the next 5 years you still have another 20 years to recover from that disaster if you were starting to invest at age 56 rather than 26 the risk reward situation would be very different of course

yes you can rollover as many different 401ks into a single ira account   i have done it personally and it really cuts down on the overhead of keeping up with lots of different accounts   your brokerage or mutual fund company should be able to help you with it   if you are using a company that just gives you forms and those forms do n't mention an easy way to combine   then i suggest rolling over one 401k first then once that 's finished you can rollover the other 401k into that same account

in summary you are correct that the goal of investing is to maximize returns while paying low management fees   index investing has become very popular because of the low fees   there are many actively traded mutual funds out there with very high management fees of 2.5 and up that do not beat the market   this begs the question of why you are paying high management fees and not just investing in index funds consider maxing out your tax sheltered accounts 401(k and roth ira to avoid even more fees on your returns also consider having a growth component of your portfolio which is generally filled with equity along with a secure component for assets such as bonds   bonds may not have the exciting returns of equity but they help to smooth out the volatility of your portfolio which may help to keep peace of mind when the market dips

you asked for simple and i promise you this is it just looks a bit math heavy to start with because we have to handle a couple of different scenarios bear with me i find the best way to deal with these kinds of questions is to put together a total cost for each option for a sensible amount of time and see what the difference is we 'll include the current cost for both options plus the subsequent costs for 12 months i find that more useful than a straight which is more expensive right now because it includes the potential costs of the next upgrade and any changes to the plan let 's throw some numbers together for the next 12 months if your current plan is longer than 12 months read the note at the bottom first first write down the cost of these things the above assume that you have two options if you take the repair option and only one option if you use the buy out option the two options we 're assuming here are that you can either   if you 'd choose the same new plan regardless of whether you take the $ 100 or $ 150 option there 's no need to include both options to simplify things you can just use the same numbers for both b c and pu and the calculation below will still work when you 've found and written down the above just do the sums below to find your two total costs over 12 months nothing fancy just plug the numbers above into the equation eg if pe ebay value of the phone is $ 80 replace pe with 80 do n't forget to do the parts in brackets first that 's your total cost for both options for the next year note i 'm assuming that your plan ends within the next 12 months if not just replace 12 in the above calculations with another term you can also do this if you want to find out the price difference over a longer period noting that if you upgrade to the same plan regardless of choice you 'll get the same answer for any period longer than your current contract

the one thing that i saw in here that raised a big red flag is that you said you overpaid on your interest   always make sure you tell them that any extra money should be applied to principal only not to interest   you accrue interest based on your outstanding principal amount so getting that lower reduces the overall amount of interest you end up paying   paying the interest ahead saves you nothing   however make sure you pay the current interest owed that month they can capitalize past due interest in affect change that to be considered an addition to the loan principal amount and you end up paying interest on the interest

what you are positioning as a loan was not a loan at all your father bought something to be delivered in the future your aunt does not want to deliver it so she should buy it back at whatever the current market value is what is the price that your dad believes her share of the inheritance is currently worth is that based on actual appraisals and some sort of objective audit if so your aunt does n't have much of a case if not then she could seek an audit to bolster her bargaining position how much did your aunt benefit from having a place to live for the last 15 years was that benefit greater than some larger amount of money at an unknown future date that 's probably why she sold her inheritance 15 years ago now that the inheritance looks like it is going to be available soon she wants to trade back after having enjoyed the use of your father 's money that might be okay but simply paying back the original sum with inflation but without interest does n't seem fair to your father she may not be able to afford to give any more than what she is offering in which case she might want to consider offering the original sum now and some portion of her inheritance as interest on that original sum i 'm not taking sides in this one if it were one of my siblings i 'd be inclined to give the benefit of the doubt and take a smaller amount back if i felt that the lesson was learned and if i felt that he she would make wise use of my gift to him her   i have no idea what your father 's current economic situation is nor am i aware of any other baggage that might influence his feelings about his sister it 's as likely as not that money is n't really what is bothering him in which case the amount she repays may have little to do with bridging the divide between them you might need to ask different questions in the interpersonal skills stack if you want to help your father feel better

the largest problem and source of anxiety ruin for homeowners during the housing market collapse was caused by the inability to refinance many people had bought homes which they were stretched to afford by using variable rate mortgages   these would typically offer a very attractive initial rate with an annual cap on the potential increase of rate   many of these people intended to refinance their variable rate to a fixed rate once terms were more favorable   if their house wo n't appraise for the value needed to obtain a new loan they are stuck in their current contract with potentially unfavorable rates in the later years above prime was not unheard of also many people especially those in areas of high inflation in the housing market used a financial device known as a balloon mortgage which essentially forced you to get a new loan after some number of years 2 5 10 when the entire note became due   some of those loans offered payments less than principal + interest so say you move near los angeles and ca n't afford the $ 1.2 m for the ranch in which you wish to live   you might work out a deal with your mortgage broker banker in which you agree contractually to only pay $ 500/month with a balloon payment of $ 1.4 m due in 5 years which seemed like a good deal since you and everyone else actually expect the house to be worth $ 1.5 m in 5 years this type of thing was done all the time back in the day   now imagine the housing bubble bursts and your $ 1.2 m home is suddenly only valued at perhaps $ 750k   you still owe $ 1.4 m sometime in the next several years maybe very soon depending on timing and can only get approved financing for the current $ 750k value so you 're basically anticipating becoming homeless and bankrupt within the same year that is a source of much anxiety about being upside down on a loan see this question for an unfortunate example

update unfortunately citibank have removed the standard account option and you have to choose the plus account which requires a minimum monthly deposit of 1800 sterling and two direct debits absolutely there is   i would highly recommend citibank 's plus current account   it 's a completely free bank account available to all uk residents there are no monthly fees and no minimum balance requirements to maintain   almost nobody in the uk has heard of it and i do n't know why because it 's extremely useful for anyone who travels or deals in foreign currency regularly in one online application you can open a sterling current account and deposit accounts in 10 other foreign currencies when i opened mine around 3 years ago you could only open up to 7 accounts at any one time citibank provide a visa card which you can link to any of your multi currency accounts via a phone call to their hotline unfortunately not online which frequently annoys me but i guess you ca n't have everything   for usd and eur you can use it as a visa debit for usd eur purchases for all other currencies you ca n't make debit card transactions but you can make atm withdrawals without incurring an fx conversion best of all for your case a free usd cheque book is also available you can fund the account in sterling and exchange to usd through online banking   the rates are not as good as you would get through an fx broker like xe.com but they 're not terrible either you can also fund the account by usd wire transfer which is free to deposit at citibank but the bank you issue the payment from will likely charge a swift fee so this might not be worth it unless the amount is large enough to justify the fee if by any chance you have a citibank account in the us you can also make free usd transfers in out of this account subject to a daily limit

the vendor needs to do this using apportionment according to the vat rules for mixed supplies if you make mixed supplies and the individual supplies are not liable to vat    at the same rate then you need to work out the tax value of    each supply in order to calculate how much tax is due if the tax    value is based on the total price you charge see paragraph 7.3 you    do this by splitting that price between the supplies this is called    an apportionment there is no special method of apportionment however your calculations must be fair and you must be able to justify them it is usually best to use one of the methods shown in section 32 the section 32 referred to really relates to use between business and non business purposes but it implies that splitting up the total price in proportion to the original prices would probably be fair so in your example the vendor might split the £ 5 discount equally between the spoon and the as they had the same gross cost and pay vat as if each had cost £ 7.50 gross the vendor could also do it in proportion to their net pre vat prices and thus a bit more of the discount to the than the spoon but as this would lead to them paying slightly more tax overall they probably would n't choose to however none of this is likely to be too relevant to a consumer since in the uk prices must be presented as the gross vat inclusive amounts and so the discounts will also apply to those amounts it will of course affect how much of the purchase price the vendor ends up paying on to the government and thus might indirectly affect what discounts the vendor is willing to offer

echoing that bank fees are mostly because they can although partly this is because simply holding onto the money does n't really pay enough for the physical infrastructure of branches atms and staff so like a budget airline they make it up on additional fees but that document does n't actually say they charge 3 for currency conversion it 's 0.20 of transaction amount for currency conversion which is not bad although watch out for the spread between buying and selling rates i see international pos atm transaction fee 3 of transaction amount which is very different that 's a card fee the big issue with these is fraud your card number suddenly being used in a different country will nearly always trigger extra fraud checks it also involves a much more complicated settlement process i 'm more with the monthly service charges and the huge $ 85 fee for international wire transfers

the dividend reinvestment wo n't change whether the dividends themselves are qualified or not for us income tax purposes   it 's still the holding period on the stock that matters   if you bought stock in different lots then you could have a situation where some of the dividends paid are qualified and some are not but for completeness it 's worth noting that some dividends can not be qualified no matter how long you hold them but if you 've got an investment in a common corporate stock vs. something more exotic then what 's above should apply

the first thing you have to do is to decided what area in finance you want to get into for example investment banking and quant are very different jobs learning all the cfa material is useful so you might as well take the exams too while you are at it you may be able to get into financial it or some type of financial programming job that is one step closer to your goal because at least you will be at a finance company and you can network with people that are in the field   also if you want to go into the buy side like i did i recommend you invest your own money and manage your own portfolio that way you would have some intimate familiarity with some companies strategies you ca n't get this from a textbook there is something a little wrong with someone who wants to manage other people 's money when he does n't manage his own that is a tough sell   you ca n't be too picky about where you get in getting in the door is the most important i got a lot of quant interviews because i was an engineer those interviews consist of a lot of math and brain teaser type questions for fundamental analyst positions they will typically want to figure out how you think about businesses companies   you can typically steer the interview any way you want which is why i think it is important that you invest your own money if you say the largest position i hold is in xyz company you can be 99 certain that they will be asking about that investment for the next 15 minutes at least that is your opportunity to show how you can add value   most companies prefer students for entry level because why hire a guy who is already working in another field when you can get someone fresh i stood out in the interviews because i could say i put $ 50k into this position because it 's not the only way to do it but i can only provide you with my experience

a kindle 's screen displays text much better than most mass market paper novels   every time we moved prior to starting to mostly read ebooks we had boxes of books that we either gave away or threw away   i rarely re read books   you can actually lend more and more books   you can also borrow them from amazon if you 're a prime member and libraries if they participate   dedicated e readers have batteries that are pretty tough to kill unless you keep the wireless on for several days   textbooks actually suck as ebooks in my opinion   more annoying to take notes in probably ca n't use the ebook version on any tests and i 'm more likely to need to page back and forth through a text book than a novel

i think there is a rather unclear line but it is being crossed i do n't want to say no career advice because there has been some really helpful questions asked that while they want to know for a job search are helpful there 's also the posts like what does an banker actually do that do n't belong here tricky to differentiate what 's okay from what is n't but at the moment i 'd rather downvote the incorrectly posted to keep the useful posts

the reason this sort of question gets asked over and over again is because it 's initially difficult to comprehend how you can possibly be scammed if you have no money in your bank account perhaps this would make it easier to understand someone approaches you in the parking lot of a mall and says excuse me complete stranger please take this $ 100 bill and go buy me a pair of $ 50 shoes at the shoe store then go buy whatever you 'd like with the rest of the money sounds like a good deal right the $ 100 bill is counterfeit if it were not the person would buy the shoes themselves it does n't get any simpler than that

the share price weighting of the djia is a historical artifact   the djia remains share price weighted today because that 's the way it has always been done and we 're talking about an index with more than a hundred years history   the djia was first calculated on may 26 1896 perhaps back then price weighting was the most straight forward feasible way to calculate it each day   you 're right that it does n't make a lot of sense and that 's why the s&p500 and other indexes are better

that 's a very good point but advertising inevitably gets out of control and consumers end up hating it which is why we see things like dvrs with their ad skipping technologies emerging in the marketplace and being hugely popular amongst consumers people hate ads even tho they want them in small amounts   people who live ad free lives as i do learn about products through the recommendations of friends or through very filtered means such as user groups where someone says hey guys i found this neat widget check it out   you could argue that 's advertising and you might be right but we 're speaking specifically about paid ads that widget company a pays social media company b to place on their website and similar models all of that is going away just as fast as the technology makes it possible to eliminate it with or without the approval of either company consumers hate ads and love ad blockers   to understand what s happening you need to appreciate just how young ad blocking technology is it 's only existed a very short while and has already decimated the internet to the point that various websites have gone bankrupt nobody as big as facebook yet but large popular magazines and newspapers have been really struggling and the tech is in it 's infancy as it matures it will cause more shake ups

would i only have to pay regular taxes plus the excess contribution    tax on any contributions yes you 'll pay regular taxes plus the excess contribution taxes on the contributions until you withdraw so what would be your gain in doing this the whole point in hsa is to use pre tax money for medical expenses and you 're not only going to use post tax money you 'll pay extra tax for doing that 6 for each year the contribution remains in the account are you trying to get the employer match in this way maybe just ask for a raise instead would this cause problems for my employer in any way not sure but it might is it possible to simply receive funds in my hsa even though i am not    eligible and then transfer them to his hsa to avoid any penalties no hsa is a personal account you can pay for dependents but you ca n't move money between the accounts you can roll over to your own account see the irs publication 969 for more details

i do n't use a rule of thumb for this instead i use a budget   throwing money into a savings account for the purpose of building a savings account is okay but i only put money into a savings account that i have a purpose for   for example there are bills that come up once a year such as insurance premiums property tax annual subscriptions and memberships etc i plan for these in my budget each month and the money goes into my savings   i also have an emergency fund which is used in the event that a large one time unexpected expense comes up that i had n't planned for i have a goal for how large i want this fund to be so i put money in savings until it is built up to the level i want it at   there are other long range saving goals i have my next car vacation furniture replacement technology replacement etc each of these gets some money each month which goes into savings   i also have retirement savings in the budget but that does n't go into the savings account it gets invested in my retirement account   my point is that instead of arbitrarily choosing a percentage of your income to put into a savings account think about the purpose of that money that will help you determine how much needs to be saved and it will also help motivate you to do so

the gross liabilities benefit obligation will still be there regardless they are future benefits   sure you can increase funding to the plan to eliminate the net pension liability but why the new assets would earn very little the shortfall is not an excessively large risk the only reason seems to be the all consuming focus on immediate results which is more rhetoric than reality in this case

a lawyer might be overkill for recovering a judgment   do a google search for judgment recovery service in your area   they specialize in what you 're trying to do the service will charge you a fee usually 10 for any monies recovered   what happens is that you assign the right to collect on the judgment to the service and their staff can run with it from there   whoever you contract with will get as much information as possible about your ex husband employment businesses and so forth   this information can be used to have levies issued by the state wage garnishment and so forth   there is no given timetable for how long it takes if your ex is indigent it would be hard to collect by way a recovery service or an attorney because you ca n't collect what he does n't have

there are two sources for shares that employees buy through a company can simply buy the shares on the open market the company must pay for the stock but the employee then pays the company for the shares if employees get a discount on the esop shares the company would pay for that percentage directly the company can choose to issue new shares these new shares dilute the ownership of all the other current stockholders while 2 is common when companies issue stock options i 'd be surprised to see it with an esop in most cases employees are limited in the amount of their salary they can devote towards the esop if that limit is 10 and the discount that the employees get is 10 the cost on a per employee basis would only be 1 of that employees salary which is a small expense
