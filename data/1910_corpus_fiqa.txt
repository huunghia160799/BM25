the only issue i can see is that the stranger is looking to undervalue their purchase to save money on taxes registration if applicable in your state buying items with cash such as cars boats etc in the used market is n't all that uncommon i 've done it several times though not at the 10k mark more along about half of that as to the counterfeit issue there are a couple avenues you can pursue to verify the money is real it 's the preferred means of payment advocated by some prominent personal financial folks including dave ramsey

if you get counterfeit money then you 're dealing with the criminal who is going to be punished by the law for doing that the portion of the total sum that was paid with the counterfeit currency is considered unpaid and you can claim the money from the criminal and sue him while he 's in jail he 'll work hard on those license plates to pay you off however making false statements and assisting in a tax evasion scheme compromises your ability to go to the law enforcement in case of any wrongdoing and then you should worry about the counterfeit money because the law wo n't be on your side to help you and you do n't even get anything out of it why on earth are you willing to take this risk just so you know it may also be money laundering which may get you in trouble even more with the law

i 'd be a bit concerned about someone who wanted to transact that large of a transaction in cash   also consider what you are going to do with the funds if you deposit it you will need to tell the bank where it comes from why does the bank want to know because most legal businesses do n't transact business with large sums of currency what does that tell you about the likelihood the person you are about to do business with is a criminal or involved in criminal affairs   the lower bill of sale price might be more than just to dodge taxes it could be part of money laundering   if they can turn right around and sell the boat for $ 10 k or trade it in on a bigger boat for the same amount and have a bill than says $ 4 k then they have just come up with a legal explanation for how they made 6 grand   and you could potentially be considered an if someone is checking up on their finances really is it worth the risk

there are some excellent responses to this question at the time of this post i have had the greatest success writing options the 2 main reasons are as follows with little time to expiration as stated in the question the implied volatility of the option is dictating the premium looking for the highest premiums is a mistake because you are taking a conservative strategy and re creating it into a high risk strategy my sweet spot is a 2 4 monthly return for my initial profit and then mastering management techniques to protect that return and even enhancing it

the fact that you are planning to move abroad does not affect the decision to contribute to a 401(k the reason for this is that after you leave your employer you can roll all the money over from your 401(k into a self directed traditional ira that money can stay invested until retirement and it does n't matter where you are living before or after retirement age   so when deciding whether or not to use a 401(k you need to look at the details of your employer 's plan does your employer offer a match if so you should definitely take advantage of it   are there good investments available inside the 401(k some plans offer very limited options if you ca n't find anything good to invest in you do n't want to contribute anything beyond the match instead contribute to an ira where you can invest in a fund that you like   the other reason to use a 401(k is that the contribution limits can be higher if you want to invest more than you are allowed to in an ira the 401(k might allow that   in your case since there is no match it is up to you whether you want to participate or not an ira will allow more flexibility in investing options if you need to invest more than your ira limit the 401(k might allow that when you leave your employer you should probably roll any 401(k money into an ira

it will be helpful to establish some definitions long long is financial slang for to have possession of an asset legally and to debit an asset financially    short short is financial slang for to be liable for an asset legally and to credit an asset financially option option is financial slang for to have the right but not obligation to force the liable to perform action legally   without limits and when taken to absurdity this can mean slavery   for equities this means to have the right but not the obligation to force the liable to buy sell a specified asset at a specified price with a specified expiration for that right for a call put respectively by the above a call option is the right but not the obligation to force the liable to buy a specified asset at a specified price with a specified expiration for that right by the definition of long above a call option is actually not long the underlying by the definitions above and with a narrower scope applied to equities indexes to be long the call means to have the right but not the obligation to force the liable to buy a specified asset at a specified price with a specified expiration for that right while to be short the call means to have the obligation to be forced to sell a specified asset at a specified price with a specified expiration for that right so to be long a call means to simply own the call

there 's two reasons one is that you have a longer time horizon other answers cover that the second is that for someone who is younger most of their capital is human capital in terms of their future work output and earnings if you 're 25 and your $ 20,000 portfolio gets wiped out that 's only a small amount of your total earnings you still have 45 years in which to earn money and invest it if you 're 65 and your $ 1,000,000 portfolio gets wiped out you 're in much bigger trouble note that this means that in certain circumstances a younger investor would want to be more conservative if you 're 25 but got a million dollar settlement for an injury which means you ca n't work anymore you want to be more conservative than your average 25-year old if you 're 65 and just sold a business for which you get $ 1,000,000 in two years you can be more aggressive with your currently invest able portfolio

absolute scam   any time anyone asks you to open a bank account so they can send you money and then you have to send some portion of it back to them it 's a guarantee that it 's a scam what happens is that your dad will deposit the check and transfer it to this woman then the check will bounce or turn out to be fake altogether and your dad will be on the hook for the money to the bank these schemes are dependent on the fact that people want hope and believe in quick easy money and it works as long as the con artists are able to get the mark the person who deposits the check and sends them the money to send the money before the check always drawn on some obscure foreign bank has a chance to clear this is another variation of a long running type of bank scam and if you get involved you 'll regret it   i hope you can keep your dad from getting involved because it will create a financial mess and affect his credit as well the basic premise of this scam is this   in the interests of providing good customer service most banks will make some or all of a deposit available right away even though the check has n't cleared   the scammer has you withdraw the money either a cashier 's check have you send a wire transfer etc immediately and send it to them eventually the check is returned because it is   the bank charges the check back against your account often imposing pretty substantial penalties and fees so you as the account holder are left without the money you sent the scammer and all of the fees this is the easy version of events   you could end up in legal trouble depending on the nature of the scam and what they determine your involvement to be   it will certainly badly affect your banking history chexsystems tracks how we all treat bank accounts much like the credit agencies do with our credit so you may have trouble opening bank accounts   so there are many consequences to this to think about and it 's why you just say no do n't walk away from this run

you owe no tax on the option transaction in 2015 in this case   how you ultimately get taxed depends on how you dispose of the position   if it expires then you will have a short term capital gain on the option position at expiration   if it is exercised then the option is gone for tax purposes and your basis in the underlying is adjusted   from irs publication 550 if a call you write is exercised and you sell the underlying stock increase your amount realized on the sale of the stock by the amount you received for the call when figuring your gain or loss the gain or loss is long term or short term depending on your holding period of the stock in your case this will be a long term capital gain for completeness if you buy to cover the option back from the market before expiration or exercise then it is also a short term capital gain also keep in mind that this all assumes that this covered call is qualified so that it does not count as a straddle   you can find more about that in pub 550 all of this is for us tax purposes

perfect credit would be defined by your credit score   you may have a perfect repayment history but that is only one factor in your credit score   paying off a loan early does n't by itself cause your score to go down   a lack of history however will result in a lower score   lenders use the score because the general consensus is that what you have done in the past is the best indicator of what you will do in the future   in essence your credit score tells a potential creditor what type of risk they are taking by lending you money   if you have very little history the risk is not necessarily higher but it is less predictable so you have a lower score these pages explain what makes up your credit score

i 'm a little confused on the use of the property today   is this place going to be a personal residence for you for now and become a rental later after the mortgage is paid off   it does make a difference if you can buy the house and a 100 ltv loan would cost less than 125 of comparable rent then buy the house put as little of your own cash into it as possible and stretch the terms as long as possible   scott w is correct on a number of counts   the cost of the mortgage is the after tax cost of the payments and when that money is put to work in a well managed portfolio it should do better over the long haul   do n't try for big gains because doing so adds to the risk that you 'll end up worse off if you borrow money at an after tax cost of 4 and make 6 after taxes you end up ahead and build wealth a vast majority of the wealthiest people use this arbitrage to continue to build wealth   they have plenty of money to pay off mortgages but choose not to   $ 200,000 at 2 is an extra $ 4000 per year   compounded at a 7 rate it adds up to $ 180k after 20 years not exactly chump change money in an investment account is accessible when you need it   money in home equity is not has a zero rate of return before inflation and is not accessible except through another loan at the bank 's whim   if you lose your job and your home is close to paid off but is n't yet you could have a serious liquidity issue now if a 100 mortgage would cost more than 125 of comparable rent then there should be no deal   you are looking at a crappy investment   it is cheaper and better just to rent   i do n't care if prices are going up right now   prices move around   just because canada has n't seen the value drops like in the us so far does n't mean it ca n't happen in the future   if comparable rents do n't validate the price with a good margin for profit for an investor then prices are and can not be trusted and you should lower your monthly costs by renting rather than buying   that $ 350 per month you could save in rent adds up just as much as the $ 4000 per year in arbitrage for rentals you should only pull the trigger when you can do the purchase without leverage and still get a 10 cap rate or higher rate of return after taxes insurance and other fixed costs   that way if the rental rates drop and again that is quite possible you would lose some of your profit but not all of it   if you leverage the property there is a high probability that you could wind up losing money as rents fall and you have to cover the mortgage out of nonexistent cash flow i know somebody is going to say but john 10 cap on rental real estate   that 's just not possible around here   that may be the case   it is possible somewhere   i have clients buying property in arizona new mexico alberta michigan and even california who are finding 10 cap rate properties   they do exist   they just are n't everywhere if you want to add leverage to the rental picture to improve the return then do so understanding the risks   he who lives by the leverage sword dies by the leverage sword   down here in the us the real estate market is littered with of people who thought they could handle that leverage sword   it is a gory ugly mess

until the card act credit card rules required that merchants had no minimum purchase requirement to use a card new rules permit a minimum but it must be clearly posted   update stores can now refuse small credit card charges is an excellent article which clarifies the rules it appears that these rules apply to credit not debit cards so to be clear the minimum do not apply to the op as he referenced using a debit card   superiority hm i 'd be a bit embarrassed to charge such small amounts although when cash in my wallet is very low i may have little choice note and disclaimer i am 48 30 years ago when i started using cards there were no pos machines credit card transactions had a big device that got a card imprint and the merchant looked up to see if your card was stolen in a big book they got weekly monthly times have changed and debit cards may be faster especially if with cash you give the cashier $ for a $ transaction but the guy entered $ 5 already this often takes a manager to clear up

one of the more subtle disadvantages to large credit card purposes purchases besides what the other answer mentions is that it makes you less prepared for emergencies if you carry a large balance on your credit card with the idea that your income can easily handle the payments to beat the no interest period you never know when you 'll have an unexpected emergency and you 'll end up having to pay less miss the deadline and end up paying huge interest even if you are about saving and budgeting what if your family comes under a large financial burden just as one possible example

it 's been said before but to repeat succinctly a company 's current share price is no more or less than what the market thinks that share is worth as measured by the price at which the shares are being bought and sold as such a lot of things can affect that price some of them material others a common reason to own stock is to share the profits of the company by owning 1 share out of 1 million shares outstanding you are entitled to of that company 's quarterly profits if any these are paid out as dividends two key measurements are based on these dividend payments the first is earnings per share which is the company 's stated quarterly profits divided by outstanding shares with the second being the price earnings ratio which is the current price of the stock divided by its eps your expected yield on this stock is more or less the inverse of this number if a company has a p e ratio of 20 then all things being equal if you invest $ 100 in this stock you can expect a return of $ 5 or 5 1/20 as such changes in the expected earnings per share can cause the share price to rise or fall to maintain a p e ratio that the pool of buyers are willing to tolerate news that a company might miss its profit expectations due to a decrease in consumer demand an increase in raw materials costs labor financing or any of a multitude of things that industry analysts watch can cause the stock price to drop sharply as people look for better investments with higher yields however a large p e ratio is not necessarily a bad thing especially for a large stable company that stability means the company is better able to weather economic problems and thus it is a lower risk now not all companies issue dividends apple is probably the most well known example the company simply retains all its earnings to reinvest in itself this is typically the strategy of a smaller start up whether they 're making good money or not they typically want to keep what they make so they can keep growing and the shareholders are usually fine with that why well because there 's more than one way to value a company and more than one way to look at a stock owning one share of a stock can be seen quite literally as owning a share of that company the share can then be valued as a fraction of the company 's total assets   sounds simple but it is n't because not every asset the company owns has a line in the financial statements a company 's brand name for instance has no tangible value and yet it is probably the most valuable single thing apple owns similarly intellectual property does n't have a book value on a company 's balance sheet but again these are huge contributors to the success and profitability of a company like apple the company is viewed as a center of innovation and if it were not doing any innovating it would very quickly be seen as a middleman for some other company 's ideas and products a company ca n't sustain that position for long even if it 's raking in the money in the meantime overall the value of a company is generally a combination of these two things by owning a portion of stock you own a piece of the company 's assets and also claim a piece of their profits a large company with a lot of material assets and very little debt can be highly valued based solely on the sum of its parts even if profits are lagging conversely a company more or less operating out of a storage unit can have a patent on the cure for cancer and be shoveling money into their coffers with

presumably you need a car to get to work so let 's start with the assumption that you need to buy something to replace the car you just lost the biggest difficulty to overcome in buying a car is the concept of the monthly payment dealers will play games with all of the numbers to massage a monthly payment that the buyer can swallow but this usually does n't end up giving the customer the best deal the 18 month term is not normal for a lease typically you 'll see 24 or 36 months you are focusing on another goal of paying your student loans by then which would free up much more money for other wants like a car but at what cost the big difficulty of personal finance is the mental mind game of delaying gratification for greater long term benefit you are focusing on paying your student loans now so that you can be free of that debt and have more flexibility for the future good you 're tempted to spend another $ 5400 assuming no down payment or other surprise fees to drive a car for 18 months that does n't sound any wiser than $ 5,000 for an unreliable used car that gave you more problems than you for presumably you got some percentage of that money back from the insurance company when the car was totaled but even if not the real lesson should be finding a car that you can afford up front but also one that you can still use when the loan is paid off like your education that investment will keep giving even when the loans are a distant memory my advice would be to look for a car that has about 30k miles on it and pay for it as quickly as possible then drive it at least for 70 120k more miles before replacing it you may wish for a newer car especially in 3 or 4 more years when it starts to show its age but you 'll also thank yourself when you can buy a newer better car with cash and break out of the monthly payment game that dealers try to push on you you might even enjoy negotiating with car salesmen when you see through their manipulations and simply work for the best cash price you can get

the terms debit and credit come from double entry book keeping in this system every transaction is applied against two accounts it debits one and credits the other by equal amounts or more technically it affects two or more accounts and the total of the credits equals the total of the debits whether a debit or a credit adds or subtracts from the balance depends on the type of account the types of accounts were defined so that it is always possible to have these matching debits and credits assets like cash or property that you own are debit accounts that is a debit is an increase in the balance of the account liabilities like money you owe are credit accounts that is a credit is an increase to get into all the details would require giving a tutorial on double entry book keeping which i think is beyond the scope of a forum post by a quick bing search i find this one i have n't gone through it so i ca n't say if it 's a particularly good tutorial there are plenty of others on the web and in bookstores note that the terminology can be backwards when someone you 're doing business with is describing the account because their viewpoint may be the opposite of yours for example to me my credit card is a liability i owe the bank money so when i post a charge that 's a credit and when i pay it off that 's a debit but to the bank my account is an asset the customer me owes them money so to the bank a charge is a debit and a payment is a credit

another thing to keep in mind is the fact that capex is viewed as required cash spend in order to maintain the business at its current levels whereas as expansionary capex is viewed as voluntary if i were to value your company i would want to know how well it cash flows as is given that whatever voluntary growth capex investments current management is making may not apply to my plan for the company if i were to purchase it   secondly often times expansionary capex is funded through credit facilities and thus from a credit perspective it is helpful to break out maintenance capex and growth capex when determining certain credit metrics such as a fixed charge coverage ratio

as pointed out they usually mean libor or the ffr or for other countries the equivalent risk free rate of interest i will just like to add on to what everyone has said here and will like to explain how various interest rates you mentioned work out when the risk free rate moves for let 's denote the risk free rate by rf the savings account interest rate as rs a mortgage interest rate as and a term deposit rate with the bank as savings account interest rate when a central bank the overnight lending rate or the prime rate repo rate etc in some countries banks are not obliged to increase the savings account interest rate usually a downward revision will force them to lower it because they net they will be paying out = rf rs on the other hand if rf goes up and if one of the banks increases the rs then other banks may be forced to do so too under competitive pressure in some countries the central bank has the authority to revise rs without the overnight lending rate term deposits with the bank or certificates of deposit usually movements in these rates are more in sync with rf than rs is the chief difference is that savings account offer more liquidity than term deposits and hence banks can offer lower rates and still get deposits under them the higher interest rate offered by the term deposit as a liquidity risk premium generally interest rates paid by instruments of similar risk profile that offer similar liquidity will move in parallel otherwise there can be arbitrage sometimes these rates can move to anticipate a future change in rf mortgage loan rates or other interests that you pay to the bank if the risk free rate goes up banks will increase these rates to keep the net interest they earn over risk free (= = rf the same if rf drops and if banks are not obliged to decrease loan rates then they will only do so if one of the banks does it first wherever i have said they will do so when one of the banks does it first i am not referring to a but merely to the competitive market theory under such a theory the first one to cut down the profit margin usually has a strong business incentive to do so e.g. gain market share or eliminate competition by lowering profit margins etc others are forced to follow the trend

technically you should take the quarterly dividend yield as a fraction add one take the cube root and subtract one and then multiple by the stock price if you want a dollar amount per share rather than a rate   this is to account for the fact that you could have re invested the monthly dividends and earned dividends on that reinvestment however the difference between this and just dividing by three is going to be negligible over the range of dividend rates that are realistically paid out by ordinary stocks

your statement not practical   presumes that the primary goal of having the store is to allow the store to thrive but if you subscribe to the idea that stores and other companies are just organizations of people that presumption is false   we humans form social structures that benefit people who live within the social structures towns cities teams companies political parties    the success of the store   or the company or the team or the city is not the primary goal the success of the people ought to be the primary goal    example hospitals were n't originally conceived to make money and grow they were conceived to aid people who were sick these days hospitals make a lot of money despite being classified as nonprofit institutions in the usa as a result we have bad medical practice over prescription of opioids over use of surgeries over use of diagnostic tests etc all of which benefits the hospital but not the patients    it 's not always a clear line look at the real jobs vs environment issues in mining or fracking    but the balance we have struck now gives great profits to the companies profits are at record highs while income inequality is also at record highs how is that sensible or sustainable or moral    my key point here is that your statement that it 's not practical for the store is misguided the store 's well being can not be the primary goal of commerce we need to place a higher priority on benefiting people broadly framed not just owners of the store

this is fine just have a plan before you go into it look up a co ownership agreement contract off legalzoom they are like $ 15 or get a lawyer if you want decide if you want to be joint tenants or tenants in common you probably want to be joint tenants so that if one of you dies the property goes to the other person go through the agreement make any changes you want and then both sign it these documents outline what happens if someone dies or if you break up or if you are allowed to sell your ownership and anything else keep a record of who has paid what of equity towards the house also look into tax laws if the mortgage or house is only truly in 1 person 's name they may get a tax break that the other person will not get the co ownership agreement is essentially the same agreement that happens when you 're married the only difference is that it happens automatically and implicitly when you 're married it 's interesting that some people are saying this is a horrible idea when it 's practically the same as the agreement you 'd have if you were married whether you 're single or married if you own a house with another person and you break up it 's going to be a bit complicated get a contract in place beforehand so that things go as smoothly as possible if you are both rational adults you should n't have any problems

separation of powers under the united states constitution   separation of powers is a political doctrine originating in the writings of charles de baron de in the spirit of the laws in which he argued for a constitutional government with three separate branches each of which would have defined abilities to check the powers of the others this philosophy heavily influenced the writing of the united states constitution according to which the legislative executive and judicial branches of the united states government are kept distinct in order to prevent abuse of power this united states form of separation of powers is associated with a system of checks and balances   during the age of enlightenment philosophers such as advocated the principle in their writings whereas others such as thomas strongly opposed it     ^ ^pm](https://www.reddit.com message compose?to = kittens_from_space ^| ^exclude ^me](https://reddit.com message compose?to = wikitextbot&amp;message = excludeme&amp;subject = excludeme ^| ^exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com r economy about banned ^| ^faq ^/ ^information](https://np.reddit.com r wikitextbot wiki index ^| ^source](https://github.com kittenswolf wikitextbot    ^ ^downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.24

perhaps buying some internationally exchanged stock of china real estate companies it 's never too late to enter a bubble or profit from a bubble after it bursts as a native chinese my observations suggest that the bubble may exist in a few of the most populated cities of china such as beijing shanghai and the price does n't seem to be much higher than expected in cities further within the mainland such as and i myself is living in i did a post about the urban housing cost of at the end of last year it may give you a rough idea of the pricing level the average of 5,500 cny per square meter condo has n't fluctuated much since the posting of the entry but you need to pay about 1,000 to 3,000 higher to get something desirable for location just search china in google maps = = = = = = = = = = = i actually have no idea how you a foreigner can safely and easily profit from this i 'll just share what i know it 's really hard to financially enter china to prevent speculative funds from freely entering and leaving china the admin of forex has laid down a range of rigid policies regarding currency exchange by law any native individual such as me is imposed of a maximum of $ 50,000 that can be converted from usd to cny or the other way around per year and a maximum of $ 10,000 per day larger chunks of exchange must get the written consent of the admin of forex or it will simply not be cleared by any of the banks in china even hsbc that 's not owned by china however you can circumvent this limit by using the social id of your immediate relatives when submitting exchange requests it takes extra time and effort but viable however things may change drastically should china be in a forex crisis or simply war you may not be able to withdraw usd at all from the banks in china even with a positive balance that 's your own money my whole income stream are usd which is wired monthly from us to bank of china i purchased a property in the middle of last year that 's worth cny using the funds i exchanged from usd i had earned it 's a down payment on a mortgage loan of 20 years in cny not usd the current household loan rate is across the entire china however because this is my first property it is discounted by 30 to to encourage the first house purchase there will be no more discounts of loan rate for the 2nd property and so forth to discourage speculative stocking that drives the price high the apartment i bought in july of 2009 can easily be sold at 300,000 now some of the earlier buyers have enjoyed much more appreciation than i do to give you a rough idea a house bought in 2006 is now evaluated 100 more one bought in 2008 now 50 more and one bought in the beginning of 2009 now 25 more

how can one offset exposure created by real estate purchase provides a similar discussion even if such a product were available in the precise increments you need the pricing would make it a loser for you there 's no free lunch in this case and the cost to insure against the downside would be to the true risk say you bought a $ 100 k home at today 's valuations the downside over a given year might be say 20 it might cost you $ 5000 to insure against that $ 20 k risk   let me offer an example the spy s&p etf is now at $ a $ 160 dec 14 put costs $ 7.50 so if you fear a crash you can pay 4 but only get a return if the market falls by over 14 if it falls just 10 you lose your premium    with only 5 down you will get a far better risk adjusted return by paying down the mortgage to < 78 ltv and requesting pmi if any be removed even if no pmi in 5 years you 'll have 20 more equity than otherwise over the long term 5 year 's housing inflation would be ~ 15 or so this process would help insure you are not underwater in that time not guarantee but help

the failure of the facebook ipo has everything to do with public access to markets it certainly was overvalued at issue and there were a host of other problems as well but the main issue that has caused the problem is that there were too many armchair analysts in on it less investors got in on facebook at $ 38 + because they liked facebook and everyone they knew liked facebook by and large they could n't read a balance sheet or describe how the firm made money as such as soon as it began to decline they sold without regard for the loss very few if any professionals actually it at launch and more than one pro shorted the position and cleaned up i find it humorous that while most people would never think of trying to buy a house a realtor they are perfectly happy buying thier own stocks without professional advice say what you want about the finance industry but for the vast majority of people having an advisor is a far smarter option

without knowing the details of your financial situation i can only offer general advice   it might be worth having a financial counselor look at your finances and offer some custom advice   you might be able to find someone that will do this for free by asking at your local church i would advise you not to try to get another loan and certainly not to start charging things to a credit card   you are correct when you called it a nightmare   you are currently struggling with your finances and getting further into debt will not help   it would only be a very short term fix and have long lasting consequences    what you need to do is look at the income that you have and prioritize your spending   for example your list of basic needs includes if you have other things that you are spending money on such as medical debt or other old debt that you are trying to pay off those are not as important as funding your basic needs above if there is anything you can do to reduce the cost of the basic needs do it   for example finding a cheaper place to live or a place closer to your job might save you money   perhaps accepting nutrition assistance from a local food bank or the salvation army is an option for you now about your car your transportation to your job is very much one of your basic needs as it will enable you to pay for your other needs   if you can use public transportation until you can get a working car again or you can find someone that will give you a ride that will solve this problem   if not you 'll need to get a working car you definitely do n't want to take out another loan for a car as you are already having trouble paying the first loan   i 'm guessing that it will be less expensive to get the engine repaired than it will be to buy a new car at this point   but that is just a guess   you 'll need to find out how much it will cost to fix the car and see if you can swing it by perhaps eliminating expenses that are n't necessary even for a short time   for example if you are paying installments on medical debt you might have to skip a payment to fix your car   it 's not ideal but if you are short on cash it is a better option than losing your job or taking out even more debt for your car alternatively buying another functional car if it costs less than fixing your current car is an option   if you do n't have the money to pay your current car loan payments you 'll lose your current car just to be clear many of these options will mess up your credit score   however borrowing more in an attempt to save your credit score will probably only put off the inevitable as it will make paying everything off that much harder   if you do n't have enough income to pay your debts you might be better off to just take the credit score ding get back on your feet and then work to eliminate the debt once you 've got your basic needs covered sorry to hear about your situation   again this advice is just general and might not all apply to your financial details   i recommend talking to the pastor of a local church and see if they have someone that can sit down with you and discuss your options

if you 're living in a market where some houses are going for $ 150 k over asking then you must buy before you sell   in a seller 's market you will get multiple offers on your current house when you decide to sell it will sell for well over asking and you can dictate possession dates   you do not need to worry about selling your own home if you have a competent realtor but buying a home is an entirely different story   you may struggle to find something affordable and there may be multiple buyers each time you decide to make an offer   you may go through this cycle several times over many months before your offer   is accepted   you should do this while living in your own home with the comfort of knowing that you can sell your own home easily at any time instead of the stress of an imminent closing date on your own home   or worse move into rented space or 's mom 's house for months or a year while the market increases by 15 and the houses in your old area are now selling for $ 100 k more than you sold for   ouch now you really ca n't afford to buy what you want and you may end up buying something equivalent to what you used to own for more plus legal realtor and land transfer costs if the closing dates do n't align then bridge   this will only end up costing a few hundred dollars less than $ 1 k including legal fees the lawyer will also charge to handle this   but by buying before you sell you 'll easily make up that difference this advice only applies to hot property markets   i 'm not a realtor just a guy living in the who went through this process last year   lost out on three offers over 10 months then bought for asking price on fourth offer very fortunate then sold for $ 90 k over asking then for 2 months   my realtor is awesome and made the process as stress free as it can be    get a good realtor start house hunting while preparing your own house for sale and enjoy the process   also you should negotiate with your realtor they may be willing to reduce their commission on your sale if they are also representing you on the purchase good luck p.s. do not make a contingent offer and do not accept one   get your financing in place before you make an offer and if you are concerned about inspection you can also do that before the offer if you act quickly   the inspection will cost ~$500 but it will increase the value of your offer by much more than that since you will be going in without conditions   i spent on two property inspections on homes i lost out on and i do n't regret it   that is the cost of doing business the other offers on the home i eventually bought were for significantly more than my offer but they had conditions   i saved at least $ 40 k by being condition free and i only spent $ 1,500 on three property inspections   and some people will just drop out of the multiple offer scenario when they learn that one of the buyers has done an inspection

yes it can be done   see scenario 4 at isolating 401(k basis   though that article is primarily about getting after tax 401(k money into a roth ira scenario 4 applies to the scenario you are asking about at a high level you do exactly what you say transfer the pre tax money from your trad iras to a 401(k btw a solo 401(k will work for this also does n't have to be your employer 's but then you need to be eligible to set up a solo 401(k   this is allowed because qualified plans ca n't accept after after tax traditional ira money so the transfer the usual pro rata rules and strains the basis out and leaves it in the trad ira    however there 's a mismatch between the intent of congress as indicated by the joint committee on taxation report on the law and the actual text of the law as detailed in the fairmark article which while it does n't stop you from doing this adds a couple of hoops to jump through if you want to be in total compliance with the law

each of us makes our own way in life making choices based upon or own needs and desires some of us choose to live simple lives others choose more complex lives where we earn and spend more there are several points which one should examine and consider consider that the market for new cars is not the entire population but only the fraction of the population that can afford to spend $ 20,000 + for a new car at $ payments you quickly realize that most people making below median income can not afford to purchase a new car they buy used cars from the pool of cars left after depreciation has reduced the price of the car by half or more one rule of thumb might be to spend < 10 of your income on transportation which might allow for a $ 400 500/month car payment for half of families and when you keep a car for 10 years that can mean two cars one payment free consider that a new honda accord or toyota camry is $ 20 30,000 which is 2/3 to 3/4 the price of a new luxury car when i purchased my used civic several years ago the price was nearly 1/2 the price of a new luxury car i recently purchased a used luxury car 7 year old 70,000 miles less than 1/3 the new price the leather interior looks new more amenities better performance than my civic the car runs well and with proper maintenance i expect to drive it for 2 3 years and pass it along to one of my children

coincidentally just read a nice post on this topic in short sell the stock as soon as it vests and treat it as a cash bonus assuming you 're in the us and the stock is possible to sell public company no trading window restrictions you have no material nonpublic information etc   what do you do with a cash bonus if you have no savings an emergency fund would be good then start on retirement savings perhaps it sounds a bit like you could use some broad general financial planning info my favorite book for that is one exception to selling immediately could be if the company stock is hugely undervalued but it probably is n't and it 's probably too hard to determine

sort of yes sort of no all teslas actually claim to be completely out of charge while there is actually still a bit of juice in the battery they do this because fully draining the battery damages it and its life span significantly but that 's just a few percent of full battery capacity and not what 's being discussed in this article   the thing being discussed in this article is that tesla used to sell one specific model that had about 15 of it 's normal battery capacity artificially locked away you could pay tesla a bit extra at any time and they would unlock the full potential of the battery via a remote software update that particular model sold pretty poorly unclear if it 's because customers did n't like the artificial restriction or if the range on that model was simply too short but either way tesla stopped selling it not long after introducing it

first if your stock is trading at $ 1 and you transfer the 5000 shares in kind to your tfsa on august 2 2011 you are deemed to have disbursed that stock in your assumed non registered account this may have tax consequences depending on the of the original purchase as for your tfsa overcontribution you will only have to pay the 1 monthly penalty on the value of the overcontribution i.e. $ 5000 you will pay for each month the overcontribution exists regardless of what the value of the assets end up being thus you 'll pay a $ 250 penalty for an overcontribution life of 5 months the stock price could go to $ 2 or $ 0 but you 'll pay a fixed tax of $ 250 for the value of the initial overcontribution see these articles at the cra website for more information tax payable on excess tfsa amount and examples tax payable on excess tfsa amount

j gruber 's consulting reports for the various states minnesota wisconsin etc     and the article it addresses which included some numbers from the reports     note that gruber has made a whole spectrum of claims from initially claiming that premiums would go down for a consulting agreement with the obama administration to later revisions showing significant increases to varying degrees depending on the individuals specific demographic to wit   ’s new reports are in direct contrast obama ’s words and with claims gruber himself made in 2009 then the economics professor said that based on figures provided by the independent congressional budget office health care reform will significantly reduce not increase non group premiums   gt;during his presentation to wisconsin officials in august 2011 gruber revealed that while about 57 percent of those who get their insurance through the individual market will benefit in one way or another from the law ’s an even larger majority of the individual market will end up paying drastically more overall   the application of tax subsidies 59 percent of the individual market will experience an average premium increase of 31 percent gruber reported   gt;the reason for this is that an estimated 40 percent of wisconsin residents who are covered by individual market insurance do n’t meet the affordable care act ’s minimum coverage requirements under the affordable care act they will be required to purchase more expensive plans   for his own explanation for the expected health insurance rate hikes gruber told that his reports reflect the high cost of folding state high risk pools into the federal government 's exchange without using the money the state was already spending to subsidize those high risk pools   note emphasis added     note 2 to begin with an average increase of 31 qualifies as significant hell it 's a lot more than merely significant that 's a huge increase and secondly that is an average meaning that while some of the people in that 59 will probably not see such a high increase a fairly large segment and per the provisions of the act versus current premium calculation methods we know these will be young healthy singles and especially males will face increases that are substantially higher than 31 and in fact will probably be in the nature of double or triple previous premiums as would be required in order to meet another provision of the act that highest premiums for older pool members can not be higher than 3x that of the youngest lowest tier premiums and if the company is to balance the books it can only bring down the one end if it makes a compensating increase at the other end   none of that is rocket science and it is entirely predictable the only things that would be odd would be that anyone should expect anything different and that gruber 's initial claims of across the board lower costs were ever accepted in the first place

in terms of preserving good relationships one approach is to charge a nominal rate of interest maybe a few percent of the total and agree a time when it should be paid back this may actually make them feel better about borrowing them money especially especially if it is something like business loan or buying a house or car   if they need the money for a real crisis and they have no clear strategy for paying it back then it may just be better all around if you make it clear that it is a gift   what you do n't want to do is set up a situation where you are creating unnecessary problems down the road and that will very much depend on your individual relationship and how seriously you take the loan   here it is important that you are completely open and honest about the arrangement so take the time to make sure that both parties understand exactly what they expect from each other

i think your best bet here would be hsbc   they will provide the required currencies credit debit cards and very easy to use online banking transfers   this includes an online global account view which features all of your accounts on a single screen and allows you to drag and drop money between accounts regarding fees i suspect you will need to be a premier account holder in order to avoid any fees imposed on transactions such as money transfers and exchanging money between currencies   in my experience hsbc offers extremely good exchange rates when exchanging large amounts of money greater than $ 10,000 gbp 5,000   exchanging small amounts will carry a larger spread but still much better than most banks offer in my experience exchanging gbp 5000 will have a spread of about percent while exchanging more than will have a spread of as little as percent in order to qualify for a premier account if my memory of hsbc uk serves me correctly you will need to have at least gbp 50,000 net across all of your hsbc managed accounts including and other investment accounts in order to open a banking swiss account you will need to travel to switzerland and apply in person   you can not open a foreign bank account remotely   with a foreign investment account i believe you can open accounts remotely   for example i opened an account with fidelity switzerland using my fidelity uk account directly from the uk however obviously fidelity does not provide banking services so this is not of interest to you the simplest thing to do is to visit your local hsbc branch and discuss it with them in person other uk banks such as barclays will also provide such services but in my experience they are not as competitive on fees

what do you mean exactly   do you have a future target price and projected future dividend payments and you want the present value time discounted price of those edit the dcf formula is difficult to use for stocks because the future price is unknown   it is more applicable to fixed income instruments like coupon bonds   you could use it but you need to predict speculate a future price for the stock you are better off using the standard stock analysis stuff learn stock basics how to read a stock table quote the p e ratio and the dividend yield are the two most important   the good p e ratio for a mature company would be around 20   for smaller and growing companies a higher p e ratio is acceptable   the dividend yield is important because it tells you how much your shares grow even if the stock price stays unchanged for the year hth

agriculture is down to single digits as part of the gdp what does that have to do with a gold standard and monetary policy   i was being sarcastic    gt;but as soon as the usa left the gold exchange standard total factor productivity began to dramatically stagnate   correlation does n't equal causation remember that this is also the same time that european japanese and soviet economies were picking back up after ww2 global production picked up and there was more international competition    gt;because our massive debt is doing so well for us in the beginning it looks nice because there is very little pain and is practically but as we see current events playing out in the us and to a greater extent europe which is nt as tightly economically as the us fiat currency has huge problems   the eu can not print money in the same way the usa can if anything the euro is a cautionary tale about currency 's with too stringent printing limitations along with tying together a set of countries at vastly different levels of economic development    the usa is not anywhere near the point of no return and seeing as we can finance our debt at ridiculously low rates compared to the rest of the world it would be much simpler to do that than try and restructure the entire monetary system of the usa   over what the last 40 years we are at about 80 90 years now    hardly enough time to call practical fact when the gold standard existed for hundreds and thousands of years   the gold standard has not been in use for hundreds of thousands of years nor was it the only currency previous to fiat   gt;i am not sure why you think that the usa is in such a great position the american dream is if you 're just starting out in life just ask any number of recent college grads who are increasingly living with parents not getting married and ca n't find jobs   i do n't think asking my local college grad is a good way of determining the usa 's macro economic situation you 're absolutely right that there is a major major disparity of wealth problem but the gold standard is n't the reason for that unemployment insurance and welfare are also comically small portions of the budget if you wanna talk about cutting spending defense and medicare are where it 's at and you do n't even have to hurt old people or soldiers to fix them

do n't start by investing in a few individual companies this is risky want an example i 'm thinking of a big company say $ 120 billion or so a household name and good consistent dividends to boot they were doing fairly well and were generally busy trying to convince people that they were looking to the future with new environmentally friendly technologies then they went and spilled a bunch of oil into the gulf of mexico yes it was n't a pretty picture if bp was one of five companies in your portfolio that day things would look a lot better if they were one of 500 or 5000 companies though so first aim for diversification via mutual funds or etfs i personally think you should probably start with the mutual funds you avoid trading fees for one thing it 's also easier to fit medium sized dollar amounts into funds than into etfs even if you do get fee free etf trading etfs can get you better expense ratios but the less money you have invested the less important that is once you have a decent sized portfolio tens of thousands of dollars or so then you can begin to consider holding stocks of individual companies take note of fees including trading fees commissions if you buy $ 2000 worth of stock and pay a $ 20 commission you 're already down 1 if you 're holding a mutual fund or etf look at the expense ratio the annualized real return on the stock market is about 4 a real return is after adjusting for inflation if your fee is 1 that 's about a quarter of your earnings which is huge and while it 's easy for a mutual fund to outperform the market by 1 from time to time it 's really really hard to do it consistently once you 're looking at individual companies you should do a lot of obnoxious boring stupid research and do n't just buy the stock on the strength of its brand name you 'll be interested in a couple of metrics the main one is probably the p e ratio price earnings if you take the inverse of this you 'll get the rate at which your investment is making you money e.g. a p e of 20 is 5 a p e of 10 is 10 all else being equal a lower p e is a good thing it means that you 're buying the company 's income really cheap however all else is seldom equal if a stock is going for really cheap it 's usually because investors do n't think that it 's got much of a future earnings are not always consistent there are a lot of other measures like beta correlation to the market overall riskier volatile stocks have higher numbers gross margins price to unleveraged free cash flow and stuff like that again do the boring research otherwise you 're just playing games with your money

i am answering this in light of the op mentioning the desire to buy a house   a proper mortgage uses debt to income ratios typically 28/36 which means 28 of monthly gross can go toward principal interest tax insurance and the total debt can go as high as 36 including credit cards and car payment etc so if you earn $ for easy math the 8 gap between 28 and 36 is $ 400 if you have zero debt they do n't let you use it for the mortgage it 's just ignored so a low interest long term student loan should not be accelerated if you are planning to buy a house better put that money to the down payment but for credit cards the $ carries $ 8000 banks treat it as though the payment is 5 of debt owed so i 'd attack that debt with a   no eating out no movies beer etc pay it off as if your life depended on it and you 'll be happier in the long run

other individuals answered how owning an reit compares to an individual real estate investment but did not answer your second question as readily are reits a good option to generate passive income for awhile the awhile part is quite important in answering this question if your intentions are to invest for a relatively short time period say 7 years or less it may be especially advantageous to invest in a reit the foremost advantage comes from significantly lower transaction fees stock etf trades are practically potentially free today compared to purchasing real estate which involves fees taxes broker fees which in a round trip transaction purchase and sale would come to ~10 the secondary advantage to owning a reit is they are much more liquid than a property if you wanted to sell your investment at a given point in time you can easily log into your brokerage and execute your transaction while liquidating an investment property will take time on market potentially tossing tenants fixing up place etc on the other hand illiquid investments have generally yielded higher historical returns according to past research

james money saved over the long term will typically beat inflation there are many articles that discuss the advantage of starting young and offer a 21 year old who puts away $ for 10 years and stops depositing will be ahead of the 31 yr old who starts the $ deposit and continues through retirement   if any of us can get a message to our younger selves time travel anyone we would deliver two messages start out by living beneath your means never take on credit card debt and save at least 10%/yr as soon as you start working i 'd add put half your raises to savings until your rate is 15   i ca n't comment on the pension companies here in the us our accounts are somewhat guaranteed not for value but against theft we invest in stocks and bonds our funds are not with the assets of the investment plan company

which option will save you the most money in the long run that is tough assuming you stay healthy do n't lose your job do n't experience a pay cut or any major emergency that drains your savings then applying the $ 6000 to the higher interest loan will save you more money in the long run however the difference in savings is a few hundred dollars not much really so in this case i 'd put the $ 6k towards the smaller loan why because then you 'd pay it off faster once that 's done you open up your cash flow by the minimum monthly payment you would have had on that loan   assuming they both have the same or similar number of months left by paying the smaller loan off sooner you 'd open up $ x month where $ x is your minimum monthly payment this could be useful to you if you want to take on some other debt like buying a house because it lowers your debt to income ratio if you put that money towards the higher loan your dti wo n't change until the normal time you would have paid off the smaller loan even if you are not looking to purchase anything that requires you to have a lower dti paying the smaller loan off sooner increases your cash flow sooner because your monthly payment on the higher loan does n't change just because you lowered the balance by $ 6k so you 'd be more robust to emergencies if your current income does n't allow for much savings a major emergency could wipe out all savings from paying down the bigger balance so i 'd suggest edit asked a question pretty much requesting more details for why i was biased towards paying off the smaller loan first what follows is my response with a bit of reorganization typically people asking these questions do n't have so much wealth that which loan to pay first is an academic question they need to make smart financial decisions while paying the highest interest loan saves the most money in interest that only occurs under the assumption that nothing bad will ever happen to you until the loans are paid off in reality other things happen tires blow out children get sick you get laid off and so the best thing to do is the one that maximizes your long term financial health even if it comes at the expense of a few $ k more interest each loan has a minimum monthly payment let 's assume barring any windfalls of additional cash you will just make the minimum payments each month towards a loan if you pay off the smaller loan first that increases your available monthly cash flow at that point you can put extra towards the other loan however if an emergency should come up or you need to save for a vacation you can do that without negatively impacting the second loan because you 'd just drop back to its minimum payment putting the money towards the higher balance loan would mean it takes you longer to reach this point as the time to reach payoff on the first loan will not change $ 6k only reduces the $ loan to $ so you never gain the flexibility of additional cash flow until the time you would have paid off the $ originally i 'd rather have a few hundred dollars each month that i can choose to use to make additional loan payments eat out pay for car repairs pay for emergencies than be forced to dip into credit or worse pay day loans should an emergency happen

gold is a good investment when central bank money printers ca n’t take their thumbs off the print button over the last 3 years the us federal reserve printed a ton of dollars to bail out banks and to purchase us federal debt   maybe i should exchange my dollars for euros the european central bank ecb is following the fed plan and printing money to buy greek italian and now spanish bonds   this indirectly is a bailout of french and german banks maybe i should exchange my euros for yen the bank of japan japan ’s central bank is determined not to let the yen rise against other currencies so they too are printing money to keep the yen weak maybe i should exchange my yen for swiss francs the swiss national bank switzerland ’s central bank is also determined not to let the franc rise against other currencies so they too are printing money you quickly begin to realize that your options are dwindling for places to put your money where the government central bank is n’t working hard to dilute your savings physical gold is also a good investment for several other situations   what situations would lead to a drop in gold prices what are the alternatives silver has traditionally been used more as money than gold   silver is usually used for day to day purchases while gold is used for savings

it looks like the resource to deciding these is here   concerning the meals the law seems a bit vague to me you can exclude the value of meals you furnish to an employee from the    employee 's wages if they meet the following tests this exclusion does not apply if you allow your employee to choose to    receive additional pay instead of meals if the whole point of google providing meals is to benefit google as such people will not leave the when to obtain meals elsewhere causing increased productivity for google then this is covered as a business expense   even if it was n't google would have to notify you that it was providing you a non benefit i.e. compensation by giving you a 1099 at the end of the year concerning the other benefits the only way i could see those items not being taxable benefits is if one of the two applies

candle stick patterns are generally an indication of possible short term changes in price direction if a reversal pattern a doji is such a reversal candle and should be read as there could be a short term change in the direction of price action a doji is most effective at peaks or and the outcome can be a higher probability if during overbought conditions at the peak or during oversold conditions at the trough so a doji should be used for short term changes in direction and not a total change in the overall trend although there could be a doji at the very top of an uptrend or at the very bottom of a downtrend we would n't know it was the change of the trend until price action confirms it   the definition of an uptrend is higher highs and higher lows the definition of a downtrend is lower lows and lower highs so an uptrend will not be broken until we have a lower high and confirmed by a lower low or a lower low confirmed by a lower high similarly a downtrend will not be broken until we have a higher low confirmed by a higher high or a higher high followed by a higher low another thing to consider is that doji 's and other candle stick work best when the market is trending even if they are only short term trends you should usually wait for confirmation of the change in direction by only taking a long trade if price moves above the high of the doji or only taking a short trade if price moves below the low of the doji

i think the most concise way to understand ev is the value of the operating assets of the firm it 's most generally used when using income statement or cash flow ratios that are unlevered before applying interest expense which if the firm is optimally financed in theory should only impact the equity examples include revenue ebit ebitda unlevered fcf etc   in your hypothetical scenario you would expect the equity value of the firm to increase linearly as cash builds up in other words in some implausible ceteris paribus formulation of the firm the enterprise value should remain constant

because it is a roth ira not traditional you never pay penalties for withdrawing any amount up to your total contributions amount this is because you are funding it with after tax money but it sounds like your roth had $ 11 k in it and you zeroed it out if you were less than 59.5 years old at the time you made the withdrawal then if you did not return anything to the account then you would pay tax on the 6 k as income this year at your normal tax rate plus an additional 10 penalty on that 6 k $ 600 the 5 k in contributions is not taxable now since it 's been more than 60 days since you withdrew the money you can not put the 6 k in earnings back in without paying the penalty however you can still contribute $ 5500 per year or $ 6500 if you 're over 50 so you can put back $ 5500 and then you would only have to pay tax + 10 on the $ 500 difference update i would recommend talking to an accountant the fact that you intended to buy a house might provide a mechanism for getting the money back in if you wish if this was your first house or you have not owned a home in the last 2 years then you would be considered a first time homebuyer and there is a special exception allowing you to remove 10 k without penalty if you end up not purchasing the home you have 120 days to contribute those funds back in treated as a thank you littleadv for the link to this as for the final 1 k overage i believe you can count that towards your $ contribution when you put the entire amount back lastly after digging into this you have hit so many edge cases with your scenario 6 k in earnings being between 5500 for under 50 and 6500 for over 50 it 's been 70 days which is between the 60 day normal cutoff and the 120 day extended cutoff for home purchase falling through and 11 k total being just over the 10 k cutoff for the same that i 'm starting to wonder if this is some sort of contrived case for an accounting exam

with an annuity you invest directly into an annuity with money you have earned as wages salary etc you pay for it and trade your payments into the annuity for guaranteed payments from the annuity issuer in the future the more you pay in before the annuity payments begin the more you will receive for your annuity payment with a pension most often you invest implicitly rather than directly into the pension rather than making a cash contribution on a regular basis it is likely that your employer has periodically invested into the pension fund for you using monies that would otherwise have been paid to you if there were no pension system this is why your pension benefits are often determined based on years of service your rate of pay and similar factors

you have a loan you can probably assume you 're going to have to repay that loan every dollar and every dollar that 's outstanding on that loan costs you interest so assuming you 're not hit by any pre payment penalty any dollar that you pay down on your house right now saves you a compounded a year where r is your mortgage rate it does n't really matter whether you 're planning to sell it in a few years or not if you pay $ n you 'll save the interest + $ n taken from the sale price and sent to the bank when you sell the house and move though you might get a tax deduction on the interest if you have a better place to park your money and earn a decent rate of return it would be worth it to do that instead of paying down the mortgage if you had another loan with higher interest rates that 's probably a better loan to pay off if you can spend some of all of it on something that 's actually genuinely worth of its purchase price a year plus whatever the wear and tear takes away from its value if anything then spend it on that instead that 'd be a better investment for instance investments in the stock market may offer better returns however that 's risky observe that you ca n't lose money paying down your mortgage and that safety is usually relatively expensive these days so it 's not a bad deal but if you 're talking about using it for long term retirement savings that are tax advantaged to boot that 's another matter if you already have ample emergency funds and were just planning on putting the money into a savings account to rot at taxable interest it 's definitely worth it to pay down your balance now unless you 're about to sell so the savings are slight and it 's a real inconvenience

having just gone through selling a car i can tell you that carmax will most likely not be the best solution i recently sold my 09 vibe which had a kbb and edmonds value private party sale of around $ 6k trade in value was around $ i took it to the local carmax for a quote and they came back with $ 3,500   refinancing is tricky banks have a set limit on how old a car they will finance many wo n't even offer financing if the vehicle has over 100k miles we looked at refinancing our other car and even getting the apr down over a point we would only have saved $ or so banks typically offer much higher interest rates for used non dealership cars and refinancing than they do for new cars or even used cars purchased from a dealership assuming you have 2 3 years left on your loan i do n't think that refinancing would save you enough to be worth considering carmax sells cars in 1 of 2 ways they are also up front with you about the process they do not reference kbb or edmonds or any other valuation tool other than their own internal system they either take the car it up a bit then resell it on their lot or they sell it at auction if they determine your car will be sold at auction then they will offer you a rock bottom price the determining factors that come into play include age of the car mileage and of course overall condition if you mini is still in good shape and does n't have a lot of miles then they may try to resell it on their lot for which they could offer you closer to personal sale price than trade in how many 2007 's are for sale in your area how much are they selling for i did sell them a truck back in 2005 and received $ 200 more than kbb valued it for but it was in great shape only a couple of years old relatively low mileage and it was in high demand god bless the south and their love for trucks i ended up selling my to another local car dealership they offered me $ after negotiating leaving the dealership then negotiating more over the phone it took me a day and a half and really very little effort i have several friends that have gone through the same thing with selling cars and all have had similar luck going to other dealerships where prices can be negotiated rather than carmax   carmax has no incentive to settle or forgive your loan if you really want to pay it off save up what you believe the difference will be then shop your car around the local dealerships and get prices for your mini remember that dealers have to turn a profit so be reasonable with your negotiation if you can find comparable vehicles in your area listed for $ then knock $ 1,500 off that price and tell the dealerships that 's what you want

a kid can lose everything he owns in a crap shoot and live but a senior citizen might not afford medical treatment if interest rates turn and their bonds underperform in modern portfolio theory is measured by beta and you get more return by increasing risk risk adjusted return is measured by the sharpe ratio and the efficient frontier shows how much return you get for each level of risk for simplicity we will assume that choosing beta is the only investment choice you make you are buying a house tomorrow all cash you should set aside that much in liquid assets today return = who cares beta = 0 your kids go to college in 5 years so you invest funds now with a 5 year investment horizon to produce with a reasonable level of certainty the needed cash then beta = low you wish to leave money in your estate invest for the highest return with a horizon of your lifetime return = maximum beta = who cares in other words you set risk based on how important your expenses are now or later and your portfolio is a weighted average on paper let 's say you have sold yourself into indentured servitude in return you have received a paid up front annuity which pays dividends and increases annually for someone in their twenties this adds up to a present value of $ 1 million when young the value of lifetime remaining wages is high it is also low risk you will probably find a job eventually in any market condition if your portfolio is significantly smaller than $ 1 million this means that the low risk of future wages pulls down your beta and therefore youth invest aggressively with available funds because they compensate large low risk future earnings to meet their desired risk appetite

paying off the debt is low risk low reward   you 're effectively guaranteed a 4 return   if you buy a mutual fund you 're going to have to take some risk to have a decent chance of getting better than 4 and change return in the long run which probably means a fund that invests primarily in stocks   buying a stock mutual fund is high risk high reward especially when you 're in significant debt   on the other hand 4 and change is very low interest   if you wanted to buy stocks on margin financing stock investments directly with debt you 'd pay a heck of a lot more   bottom line   it comes down to your personal risk tolerance

gt;but we can always produce more classrooms   can we   we certainly ca n't at a moment 's notice those things take time   time represents risk   education could be just another bubble like real estate is it worth taking the risk of building more classrooms considering the possibility that in 2 years the demand may drop because people have realized that education does not necessarily correlate to motivation   in fact that 's already happened a few times recently   for example the tech bubble of the memory fades late 90s right   while the bubble was growing and computers were going from either toys that geeks played with or tools of business to things that everybody had to have it looked like programming and related skills might soon be highly so schools started popping up to meet that demand   but by the time those students were ready to enter the market the bubble had burst and while still not a bad career it was nowhere near the easy ride that many of the students had envisioned   the schools got their money but people saw that the promise of an education does n't always meet and a lot more people are seeing that right now as record numbers of graduates ca n't find are schools going to bet on neverending growth   i do n't think so   they might milk it while it lasts though   meh it 's late and i have n't my thoughts very well here feel free to pick it apart

while the issuer of the security such as a stock or bond not the short is responsible for the credit risk the issuer and the short of a derivative is one in all cases it is more than likely that a trader is owed securities by an agent such as a broker or exchange or clearinghouse legally only the options clearing corporation clears openly traded options   with stocks and bonds brokerages can clear with each other if approved while a trader is expected to fund margin the legal responsibility is shared by all in the agent chain   clearinghouses are liable to exchanges   exchanges are liable to members   traders are liable to brokerages   both ways and so on clearinghouses are usually ultimately liable for counterparty risk to the long counterparty and the short counterparty is ultimately liable to the clearinghouse clearinghouses are not responsible for the credit risk of stocks and bonds because the issuers are not short those securities on the exchange thus no margin is required   credit risk for stocks and bonds is mitigated away from the clearing process

i am surprised no one has mentioned the two biggest things in my opinion   or i should say the two biggest things to me   first 1099 have to file quarterly self employment taxes   i do not know for certain but i have heard that often times you will end up paying more this way then even a w-2 employees   second an llc allows you to deduct business expenses off the top prior to determining what you pay in taxes as pass through income   with 1099 you pay the same taxes regardless of your business expenses unless they are specifically allowed as a 1099 contractor which most are not i believe   so what you should really do is figure out the expense you incur as a result of doing your business and check with an accountant to see if those expenses would be deductible in an llc and if it offsets a decent amount of your income to see if it would be worth it   but i have read a lot of books and listened to a lot of interviews about wealthy people and most deal in companies not contracts   most would open a new business and add clients rather than dealing in 1099 contracts   just my two cents good luck and much prosperity

whoa these things are on two dimensions   it 's like burger and fries you can also have chicken sandwich and fries or burger and onion rings    you can invest in an taxable brokerage account and/or an ira   and then within each of those   you can buy index funds and/or anything else all 4 combinations are possible   if someone says otherwise take your money and run   they are a shady financial advisor who is ripping you off by steering you only into products where they get a commission those products are more expensive because the commission comes out of your end   not to mention any names       if you want financial advice that is honest find a financial advisor who you pay for his advice and who does n't sell products at all   or just ask here   but i would start by listening to suze orman dave ramsey whomever you prefer   and read john bogle 's book    they can tell you all about the difference between money market bonds stocks managed mutual funds ripoff and index funds ira accounts roth ira accounts and taxable accounts are all brokerage accounts   within them you can buy any security you want including index funds   the difference is taxation   suppose you earn $ 1000 and choose to invest it however   later you withdraw it and it has grown to $ 3000   investing in a taxable account you pay normal income tax on the $ 1000 when you later withdraw the $ 3000 you pay a tax on $ 2000 of income   if you invested more than a year it is taxed at a much lower capital gains tax rate   with a traditional ira account you pay zero taxes on the initial $ 1000   later when you take the money out you pay normal income tax on the full $ 3000   if you withdrew it before age 59 1/2 you also pay a 10 penalty $ 300   with a roth ira account you pay normal income tax on the $ 1000   when you withdraw the $ 3000 later you pay nothing in taxes   provided you followed the rules    you can invest in almost anything inside these accounts money market funds terrible return   you wo n't keep up with the market   bonds   low return but usually quite safe   individual stocks   good luck    managed mutual funds   you 're paying some genius stock picker to select high performing stocks he has a huge staff of researchers and   good social connections   he also charges you 1.5 per year overhead as an expense ratio which is a total loss to you   the fact is he can usually pick stocks better than a monkey throwing darts   but he 's not 1.5 better   index funds   these just shrug and buy every stock on the market   there 's no huge staff or genius manager just some intern making small adjustments every week   as such the expense ratio is extremely small like 0.1     if any of these investments pay dividends you must pay taxes on them when they 're issued if you 're not in an ira account   this problem gets fixed in etf 's   index etf 's   these are index funds packaged to behave like stocks   dividends increase your stock 's value instead of being paid out to you which simplifies your taxes   if you buy index funds outside of an ira use these   too many other options to get into here

see publication 505 specifically the section on annualized income installment method which says if you do not receive your income evenly throughout the year for example your income from a repair shop you operate is much larger in the summer than it is during the rest of the year your required estimated tax payment for one or more periods may be less than the amount figured using the regular installment method the publication includes a worksheet and explanation of how to calculate the estimated tax due for each period when you have unequal income   if you had no freelance income during a period you should n't owe any estimated tax for that period however the process for calculating the estimated tax using this method is a good bit more complex and confusing than using the short method in which you just estimate how much tax you will owe for the year and divide it into four equal pieces   therefore in future years you might want to still use the equal payments method if you can swing it   it 's too late for this year since you missed the april deadline for the first payment   if you can estimate the total amount of freelance income you 'll receive even though you might not be able to estimate when you 'll receive it you can probably still use the simpler method   if you really have no idea how much money you 'll make over the year you could either use the more complex computation or you could use a very high estimate to ensure you pay enough tax and you 'll get a refund if you pay too much

i do n't think you can compare savings accounts and peer to peer lending the former is a liquid way of stashing some money away iow you can get at it pretty much any time you want whereas the latter is extremely illiquid you only get your money back if and when the loan has been repaid also as mentioned by the other posters there is a risk attached to p2p lending even if the borrowers are vetted by the p2p lending platform you 're essentially taking the same risks that a bank would take when writing a couple of personal loans and that 's quite far removed from a safe haven for your cash if you have enough money to invest not save invest then it might be worth putting a small amount into p2p lending but it 's anything but an alternative to a savings account

stock b could be considered to be more risky because it seems to be more volatile sharp rises on large volume increases can easily be followed by sharp drops or by further rises in the start of a new uptrend   however if both a and b are trading on low volume in general they can both be more on the risky side due to having relatively low liquidity especially if you buy a large order compared to the average daily volume but just looking at the criteria you have included in your question is not enough to determine which stock is riskier than the other and you should look at this criteria in combination with other indicators and information about each stock to obtain a more complete picture

the short answer is that the exchange of the stock in exchange for the elimination of a debt is a taxable exchange and gains or losses are possible for the stock investor as well as the bank    the somewhat longer answer is best summarized as noting that banks do n't usually accept stocks as collateral mostly because stock values are volatile and most banks are not equipped to monitor the risk involved but it is very much part of the business of stock brokers    in the usa as a practical matter i only know of stock brokerages offering loans against stock as part of the standard services of a margin account you can get a margin account at any us stock broker the stockholder can deposit their shares in the margin account and then borrow around 50 of the value though that is a bit much to borrow and a lower amount would be safer from sudden demands for repayment in the form of margin calls in a brokerage account i can not imagine a need to repay a margin loan if the stocks dividends plus capital appreciation rises in value faster than the margin loan rate creates interest charges   trouble begins as the stock value goes down   when the value of the loan exceeds a certain percentage of the stock value which can depend on the stock and the broker 's policy but is also subject to federal rules like regulation t the broker can call in the loan and/or take initiative to sell the stock to repay the loan    notice that this may result in a capital gain or loss depending on the investor 's tax basis which is usually the original cost of the stock   of course this sale affects the taxes of the investor of who gets the money

you 'll have much more flexibility and peace of mind if your expenses are based on your current income and that income increases in the future it 's great that you are n't comfortable with spending more you do n't want to end up in the position you just removed yourself from   that said you do n't just ignore planned income altogether personally my wife and i feel best knowing that i have the essentials covered with my income and that her income primarily helps us put away more for retirement home renovations and vacations because she likely wo n't work for a long while if we have kids how you plan depends on your wife 's career aspirations and prospects if your wife has high income potential and you do n't plan to buy until after she resumes work then it may suit you to plan on her income too you 'll have to balance the certainty and amount of her income with your goals   if you 're trying to make up ground on savings retirement then a less expensive house seems wise anyway it 's a much easier problem to decide what to do with excess funds than feeling trapped stressed by a high mortgage payment

the core idea behind this statement is that there is always money for what you prioritize if you try to use whatever is left over after your bills for savings you probably wo n't save very much if anything in practice you decide on a fixed amount of money you will save out of each paycheck and put that aside in an investment or savings account then pay your bills out of what is left   essentially it is a way to counteract the tendency of your lifestyle rising to exactly meet your income and leaving nothing for savings

other than the fact that treasury can not sell to the fed by law your theory is nice you forget the step where the open market buys from the treasury since they desire bonds to invest in and the fed can buy only from the open market   secondly the fed does not give cash to the treasury the mint a branch of the treasury not the fed prints cash   so it seems your understanding of how the money system works is quite wrong yet since this is the economy subreddit instead of the economics subreddit i expect you to get upvotes for saying what is popular even though it is incorrect   you seem to not like cash that was not even existing previously all cash was not existing previously how do you expect people to make transactions barter   you call them interest free loans but above claimed they will never be paid back but then the fed is making a profit on them it seems you contradict yourself with all that   it would be interesting for you to explain how and why money not cash gets added and removed to the economy    yay for ignorance

directors can be held responsible for the liabilities of the corporation see this wikipedia article and especially if it was clear that was the reason for the arrangement you might well find this happening that said i know a canadian who sold his house to a corporation he already owned he was doing consulting work through it at the in his opinion ridiculously high amount it had been assessed for property tax purposes the company paid and claimed any and all expenses including paying for the lawn to be and the house to be painted he lived in it at a reduced rent this rent was then income to the company in exchange for looking after it he was very happy with the arrangement he was losing the no income tax when you sell your primary residence benefit we have here but since he expected to never be able to sell it for more than the amount the company had paid he was n't worried if the company exists for no reason other than to shelter income hide you from liability and reduce your taxes then i would expect it would get you some unwanted attention and possibly some rulings you did n't like if the company exists for a real purpose and has income and expenses that outweigh whatever games you 're playing with cars and homes you might be able to achieve this you need to work out what the benefits other than liabilities would be and whether they are worth the hassle

gt;however the caveat i will add is that if you go into debt for your education you should certainly be thinking about the economic value your education can provide you   i agree but we 're not going to have that discussion when many parents do n't understand debt accurately and the ones that do are the ones whose kids are n't as likely to need big loans    gt;at the end of the day though these findings are all moot unless we can have a conversation about the hyperinflation in college costs directly related to free aka subsidized education    the hyperinflation is n't because college costs are subsidized federal loans still have caps it 's because student loans ca n't be discharged in bankruptcy in the vast majority of cases that means that private loans are available which means the federal loan caps are effectively useless    free college would have its challenges and we 'd need to make private loans in bankruptcy which would in turn make banks lend to only credit worthy students co signers using appropriate risk models but then we 'd also be able to make other adjustments    there are some things that we could probably be doing now but others might be too easily corruptible without the market correction of private loans only to those who are credit qualified   we could put more stringent requirements on grade point averages for example if you do n't hit that you do n't get your free college you can continue going if you go get private loans not able to qualify time to do something else then work and save for college trade school enter the workforce permanently etc this would n't work as well if private loans were still easily and non because there could be shady dealings to make more people not eligible for the free assistance with some type of crazy obstacles etc   we could do things like cap the costs for particular programs if you want to study mechanical engineering you can get up to x amount but if you 're studying early french you can only get up to y amount yes we could do that now but i do n't love the idea of putting those type of restrictions when it 's the student paying it seems a bit of an    there are lots of ways we could be addressing things but we are n't

a debenture is a security document this means that the bond is secured over assets under english law you can issue bonds which if defaulted upon you can enforce your security against the issuer i.e. the company which means you can attempt to get your money back by getting hold of the company 's assets    as for a floating charge i 'll first explain what a fixed charge is say you 're a bank a lender and you lend £ 1000 to x. you take security by way of a fixed charge over x 's photocopy machines x is unable to dispose of the machines without the lender 's consent this means that if x can not pay up the loan you can enforce security by taking possession of the photocopy machines sell them and hopefully get enough money back to cover the default   a floating charge works the same way but over assets which fluctuate e.g. x 's stock of potatoes x sells potatoes to supermarkets all the time so you ca n't just take a fixed charge over it for practical reasons you ca n't just ask the lender each time you want to sell a potato when an event of default occurs i.e. you do n't pay back the loan or breach a condition of the loan agreement the floating charge and becomes a fixed charge thus enabling the lender to sell the potatoes to get their money back   random examples but makes sense   source future english solicitor

you need to do a bit more research and as @littleadv often wisely advises consult a professional in this case a tax layer or cpa you are not allowed to just pull money out of a property and write off the interest   from deducting mortgage interest faqs if you own rental property and borrow against it to buy a home the    interest does not qualify as mortgage interest because the loan is not    secured by the home itself interest paid on that loan ca n't be    deducted as a rental expense either because the funds were not used    for the rental property the interest expense is actually considered    personal interest which is no longer deductible this is not exactly your situation of course but it illustrates the restriction that will apply to you   elsewhere in the article it references how if used for a business the interest deduction still will not apply to the rental but to the business via schedule c.   in your case it 's worse you can never deduct interest used to fund a tax free bond or to invest in such a tax favored product   putting the facts aside i often use the line do n't let the tax tail wag the investing dog borrowing in order to reduce taxes is rarely a wise move if you look at the interest on the 90 k vs 290 k you 'll see you are paying in effect on the extra 200 k due the higher rate on the entire sum elsewhere on this board there are members who would say that given the choice to invest or pay off a 4 mortgage paying it off is guaranteed and the wiser thing to do i think there 's a fine line and might not be so quick to pay that loan off an after tax 3 cost of borrowing is barely higher than inflation but to borrow at over 5 to invest in an annuity product whose terms you did n't disclose does seem right to me borrow to invest in the next property that 's another story

answers 1 no sections of the irc were passed in the reagan 2 not only can a foreign company like a chocolate company fall afoul of the definition of pfic because of the asset test which you cite but it can also be called a pfic because of the income test   for example i have shares in a development stage canadian biotech which is considered a pfic because it has no income at all except for a minor amount of bank interest on its working capital   this company is by no means passive it has run 31 clinical trials in over 1100 human research subjects burning $ 250 m of investor 's money in the process nor is it an investment company but the stupid irs considers it to be a passive foreign investment company   the irs looks at it and sees only the bank account and assumes it is a foreign shell corporation set up to shield the bank interest from them 3 yes a foreign mutual fund is exactly what congress intended to be a pfic when passed irc   candy factories ect got nailed as innocent   note that if you hold a us mutual fund then every year you 'll get a form 1099 in the mail   the 1099 will report your share of the mutual fund 's own income and capital gains which you must report on your taxes   you can also have capital gains from selling your shares of the mutual fund but that 's a different thing now suppose that there was no pfic law   then the us investors in the mutual fund would do better if the mutual fund were in a foreign country for two reasons a the fund would no longer distribute 1099 's   that means the shareholders would n't have to pay tax every year on their proportions of the fund 's own income gains   the money that would have sooner gone to the irs can sit around for years earning interest b the fund could return profits to shareholders exclusively through capital gains rather than dividends thus ensuring that all of the investors income on the fund would be taxed at < rather than up to 39   the fund could do this by returning cash to shareholders exclusively through buybacks however the us mutual fund industry does n't want to move the industry to canada and it only takes a few newspaper articles about a foreign loophole to make congress spring to action 4 it depends   if you have a election in place as i do for my biotech shares then form 8621 takes a few minutes by hand   however this requires both the company and the investor to fully cooperate with congress 's vision for pfics   the company by providing a so called pfic annual information sheet which replaces the 1099 form for a us mutual fund   the investor by having a election in place for each and every tax year in which he held the stock and by reporting the numbers from the pfic annual information sheet on his return   note that the election persists once made until revoked   there are here that i am glossing over since deemed sale elections and other means may be used to modify a share 's holding period to come into compliance note that there is software coming out to handle pfics and that the software makers will already run their software to make your form 8621 for $ 75 or so   i should also warn you that the blogs of tax accountants and tax lawyers all contradict each other on the basic issue of whether you can take capital losses on pfics for which you have no form 8621 elections   see section 2.3 of my notes for commentary on this mess   i do not know if the software people will tell you which elections are best made on form 8621 though or advise you if it 's time to simply dump your investment the professional software is at and the individual 8621 preparation is at btw in case you 're interested i wrote up a very careful analysis of how to deal with the pfic situation for the small biotech i invested in in certain cases it is posted   for tax reasons it was quite fortunate that the share price dipped to near an all time low on jan 1 2015 making the next 2015 tax year ripe for a so called deemed sale election   this was only possible because the company provides the necessary pfic annual information statements which your chocolate factory may or may not do

if anything the price of an etf is more tightly coupled to the underlying holdings or assets than a mutual fund because of the independent creation destruction mechanism with a mutual fund the price is generally set once at the end of each day and the mutual fund manager has to deal with investments and redemptions at that price by the time they get to buying or selling the underlying assets the market may have moved or they may even move the market with those transactions with an etf investment and redemption is handled by independent authorized participants they can create new units of the etf by buying up the underlying assets and delivering them to the etf manager and vice versa they can cancel units by requesting the underlying assets from the etf manager etfs trade intraday i.e. at any time during trading hours and any time the price too far from the underlying assets one of the authorized participants has an incentive to make a small profit by creating or destroying units of the etf also intraday

no spdr etfs are not a good fit for a novice investor with a low level of financial literacy   in fact there is no investment that is safe for an absolute beginner not even a savings account   an absolute beginner could easily overdraw his savings account leading to fees and collections i would say that an investment becomes a good fit for an investor as soon as said investor understands how the investment works   a savings account at a bank or credit union is fairly easy to understand and is therefore a suitable place to hold money after a few hours to a day of research   even after 0 hours of research however a savings account is still better than a sock drawer money market accounts through a bank certificates of deposit through a bank and money market mutual funds through a mutual fund provider are probably the next easiest thing to understand   this could take a few hours to a few weeks of research depending on the learner equities corporate bonds and government bonds are another step up in complexity and could take weeks or months of schooling to understand well enough to try   equity or bond mutual funds or the etf versions of those which is what you asked about are another level after that also important to understand along the way are the financial institutions and market infrastructure that exist to provide these products   banks credit unions public corporations brokerages stock exchanges bond exchanges mutual fund providers etf providers etc

your idea is a good one but as usual the devil is in the details and implementation might not be as easy as you think   the comments on the question have pointed out your steps 2 and 4 are   not necessarily the best way of doing things and that perhaps   keeping the principal   amount invested in the same fund instead of taking it all out and re investing it in a similar but different fund might be better the other points for you to consider are as follows how do you identify which of the thousands of conventional mutual   funds and etfs is the average risk high gain mutual fund into which you will place your initial investment   broadly speaking most actively managed mutual fund with average risk are likely to give you   less than average gains over long periods of time   the   unfortunate truth to which many pay only service is that   x% of actively managed mutual funds   in a specific category failed   to beat the average gain of all funds in that category or the   corresponding index e.g. s&p 500 index for large stock mutual funds over the past n years where x is generally between 70 and   100 and n is 5 10 15 etc   indeed one of the arguments in   favor of investing in a very low cost index fund is that you are effectively guaranteed the average gain or loss do n't forget the possibility of loss this of course is also the argument used against investing in index funds   why invest in boring index funds and settle for average gains at essentially no risk of not getting the average performance average performance is close to guaranteed when you can   get much more out of your investments by investing in a fund that is among the funds that had better than average returns   the difficulty is that which funds are x rated and which non x rated i.e. rated g = good or pg = pretty good is known only in hindsight whereas what you need is foresight as everyone will tell you past performance does not guarantee future results   as someone john bogle said   when you invest in a mutual fund you are in the position of a in you can see where you have been but not where you are going   in summary implementation of your strategy needs a good crystal ball to look into the future there is no such things as a guaranteed bond fund they also have risks though not necessarily the same as in a stock mutual fund you need to have a plan b in mind in case your chosen mutual fund takes a longer time than expected to return the 10 gain that you want to use to trigger profit taking and investment of the gain into a low risk bond fund and also maybe a plan c in case the of the market cause your chosen mutual fund to have negative return for some time what is the exit strategy

i hate that anderson   every movie he makes is a vegan trap   he starts by talking about how red meat and dairy are bad then eggs are bad oh and of course fish are also bad   the only healthy way to eat of course is being a vegan     the pseudo science is painful to listen to   he basically tries to say protein is as bad as heroin   and they call milk cow   i turned it off as soon as they called cheese basically cow     he takes advantage of the fact that people take health documentaries pretty seriously and uses it to push his personal agenda   really disappointing because nothing i 've seen in any of his movies has any credibility once i realized how much he was stretching the facts     there are tons of better documentaries that will have a similar affect on people but with way better science   these days i see tons of people saying they watched a netflix doc and changed their eating habits   fed up was pretty great   also sugar coated is one of my favorite food docs ever

see an advisor but with a healthy level of skepticism question why they make the recommendations they do   if you have debt no the interest rate   if cagr gt interest invest instead of immediately paying off debt   in reality invest the most you can    you 're young and try to live your life like you would've without the inheritance   the longer you let that money grow in an investment untouched and honestly that amount of money is a huge gift surprise at your age the more you 'll thank yourself in the end   max out a roth ira your advisor can explain that to you   also you can afford to invest super aggressively since you 're so young   you could also find a variable life insurance contract to act like a roth and grow a death benefit to continue leaving a legacy in your family line   sorry for the advisory   i 'm sorry for the loss that led to this inheritance but that 's a great opportunity and there are a ton of options and none of them are wrong   best of luck

your university should have a finance department which can help with payments speak with them and tell them you have interest in paying for at least part of your next semester in cash from here they should be able to tell you the best method for this though most likely cash check will suffice if there is no finance department or you are still unsure check with student services for more information

here 's another example of such a practice and the problem it caused   my brother who lived alone was missing from work for several days so a co worker went to his home to search for him and called the local sheriff 's office for assistance   the local fire department which runs the ems ambulance was also in the event there was a medical emergency   they discovered my brother had passed away inside his home and had obviously been dead for days   as our family worked on probate matters to settle his estate following this death it was learned that the local fire department had levied a bill against my brother 's estate for $ 800 for responding with their ambulance to his home that day   i tried to talk to their commander about this insisting my brother had not called them nor had they transported him or even checked his pulse   the commander insisted theirs was common practice that someone was always billed for their medical response   he would not withdraw his bill for services   i hate to say but the family paid the bill in order to prevent delay of his probate issues and from receiving monies that paid for his final expenses

another option to a human advisor is a web service that if it supports your 401k plan gives personalized algorithmic advice on what you should hold in your 401(k and other retirement accounts   if it does n't support your 401(k plan just yet you can sign up to be emailed when your plan is added   disclosure i work here but i believe in the product and it 's designed to solve this exact problem so i 'm mentioning it here   note from joetaxpayer 's disclosure is much appreciated the fee is $ with a free trial consider that a commissions based advisor wo n't even take on a $ 10 k level account and at $ 100 k you 'd be hard pressed to gain by more than his 1 fee so while i 've not dug deeper into this site a rules based methodology is likely to be worth the cost if over time it gains you even a fraction of a percent compared to what you 'd have done blindly

whole life insurance accumulates a cash value on a pre tax basis with a paid up policy you make payments until a particular age usually 65 or 70 at which point you are insured for the rest of your life or a very old age like 120 you can also access this pool of money via loans while you are still alive but you reduce your benefit until you repay the loans this may be advantageous if you have a high net worth also if you own a business or farm a permanent policy may be desirable if the transfer of your property to heirs is likely to generate alot of transactional costs like taxes nowadays there are probably better ways to do that too whole life universal life is a waste of money of the time an example my wife and i were recently offered open enrollment no medical exam insurance policies our employers in new york we 're in our early 30 's i bought a term policy paying about $ 400k which costs $ my wife was offered a permanent policy that pays $ 100k which costs $ and would have a cash value of $ 35k at age 65 if you invested the $ difference between those policies and earned with 30 taxes on the gains you 'd have over $ 40k with 4x more coverage

the guideline for the size of an emergency fund is just a guideline   i 've usually heard it expressed as 3 to 6 months but everyone has a different idea of exactly how big it should be the purpose of the fund is to give you enough cash to be able to pay for unexpected expenses that have come up that you have not budgeted for without you having to borrow money to pay for them to figure out how big this fund should be we look at the worst case scenario   suppose that you lost your job tomorrow   what would you do cut your expenses   you 'd probably be much more careful how you spend money secure health insurance   this would be done by either continuing your employer 's policy with cobra or by purchasing your own insurance likely through the obamacare aca market   keep in mind that most likely your employer is paying for a portion of your insurance now so this expense will go up quite a bit no matter which option you choose look for another job   you 'd probably begin your search for a new job immediately the size of your emergency fund determines how long you will be able to go without income before you need to start a new job regarding cutting your expenses it is up to you how much you would cut   there are things that are easy to cut temporarily or permanently such as restaurants entertainment expenses vacations etc   you would probably stop retirement investing until you have income again   the more you cut the longer your emergency fund would last   things you do n't want to cut are necessities like housing groceries utilities transportation etc   i would also include health insurance in this list   certainly if you have a pre existing condition you do not want to let your health insurance coverage lapse your is also a factor   if you believe that you would have an easy time finding similar employment to what you have now your emergency fund might not need to be quite as big as someone who believes they would have a harder time finding another job

but i do n't see how it 's any different than buying a stock at a low price and holding on to it for some months based on your question i would say the difference is time day trading by its nature is a endeavor if you buy low and are planning to sell high then you only have a few hours to make this happen as a previous poster mentioned there is a lot of white noise that occurs on a weekly daily hourly min basis long term investors have the time to wait it out although as a side note if you were a buy and hold investor from the 1960s early 1980s then buy and hold was not very good is it just the psychological addictive aspect of it this is the biggest reason day trading is stressful and stress can cause financially destructive decisions such as over leveraging over trading etc why is day trading stressful because you are managing hundreds to thousands of trades a year when combined with the lack of time in a day to make moves it becomes stressful also many day traders do it full time which adds to the pressure to be correct and to be incredible at money a lot of buy and hold investors have full time jobs and may only check their positions every month or so

every economy wants growth and for growth to come you need investments so you must provide some motive for people to risk their money every investment has inherently a degree of risk or if you want uncertainty about the outcome as a result the tax on capital gains is lower than on other types of income because the risk is almost zero the tax is considered in the calculation of the net interest rate and you can see this as the interest which the investors demand in order to invest their money

a real simple definition or analogy of present value would be the principal or loan amount being lent and the future value as being returning the principal along with cost of borrowing the is the interest you earn on present value the is the interest you pay on future value the first one is the or future value of a $ 1 the second one is the or present value of a $ 1 both these interest factors assume interest is paid annually if the interest payment is made more often within the payment year then interest factors look this way m is the frequency of interest payment the higher this frequency the more of interest you pay or earn and you pay or earn the most interest when compounding occurs on each small fraction of time this entails here e is the 's e   thus the interest factors turn to this the examples only considered a single repayment at future date now if you were obliged to make periodic loan repayments say in amount of $ 1 for n number of periods then the present value of all such periodic payment is the principal or amount you borrowed this is the sum of discounted periodic payments as   if we replace with x then this turns out to be geometric series of the form this simplifies to   replacing for x we get which is the present value of periodic payment in amount of $ 1 the future value of periodic payments in amount of $ 1 can be arrived at multiplying the by giving once again the interest is compounded per annum and for intra year compounding you would have to at first find the annual effective yield to use as the effect rate is the and calculation for continuous compounding all the calculation discussed thus far did not take inflation into consideration if we were to adjust the amounts for a growth of then the present value of a $ 1 would be as follow once again you would have to use if compounding frequency of interest is intra year now assume that each loan repayment increases or decreases by an extra amount q per period to find the present value of series of payments p that increase or decrease per period by an amount q we would do the following calculations here and all of these calculations have been available in add in for finance and incrementally being offered as javascript financial functions library please note that the tad series of the financial functions library for various environments such as excel javascript php ruby and others are property of the author writing this post all of these libraries except one for excel are available for free for public use and the future value of such payments with increments may be found by multiplying the pv by as follows here

remind yourself that markets recover usually within a few years if you believe this and can remind yourself of this you will be able to see the down cycles of the market as an opportunity to buy stock on sale no one knows the future so many people have found investing on a regular schedule to be helpful by putting in the same amount of money each period you will end up buying fewer shares when the market is up and more when it is down as long as your time horizon is appropriate you should be able to wait out the ups and downs stocks are volatile by their very nature so if you find that you are very concerned by this you might want to consider whether you should adjust the amount of risk in your investments since over time most people lose money by trying to time the market however if your investment goals and requirements have n't changed there likely is n't any need to change the types of assets you are investing in as what you are choosing to invest in should depend on your personal situation edit i am assuming you want to be a long term investor and owner making money by owning a portion of companies profits and not by trading stocks and/or speculation

stop spending on the cc with the revolving balance    after the discussion below i feel i should clarify that what i am advocating is that you make your prepayment though i disagree with calling it that to the existing cc   then rather than spending on that card spend somewhere else so you wo n't accrue any interest related to your spending   at the end of the month send any excess to the account that has a balance   this question is no different than i have $ x of cash should i let it sit in a savings account or should i send it to my cc balance   yes 100 you should send this $ 750 to your cc balance   then stop spending on that cc and move your daily spending to cash or some other place that wo n't accrue interest at all the first step to paying off debt is to stop adding to the balance that accrues interest   it 's not worth the energy to determine the change in the velocity of paydown by paying more frequently when you could simply spend on a separate card that does n't accrue any interest because you pay the entire balance every month the reason something like this may be advisable on a heloc but not a cc is the interest rate   a heloc might run you 4 or 5 while your cc is probably closer to 17   in one situation your monthly interest is 0.4 and in the other your monthly interest is 1.4   the velocity of interest accrual at cc rates is just too high to justify ever putting regular spending on top of an existing revolving balance   additionally i doubt there is anyone who is advocating for anyone to charge their heloc for daily spending   you would move daily spending to somewhere that is n't accruing interest no matter what   you would use a heloc to pay down your cc debt in a lump or make a large purchase in a lump   your morning coffee should never be spent in a way that will accrue interest immediately ever stop spending on the that are carrying a balance period generally credit cards have a grace period before interest is charged   as long as a balance is n't carried from one statement period to the next you maintain your grace period   if you spend $ 100 in the first month you have your card say the period is january 1 to january 31 you 'll get a statement saying you owe $ 100 for january and payment is due by feb 28   if you pay your $ 100 statement balance before february 28 you wo n't pay any interest even if you charged an additional $ 500 on february 15 you 'll simply get your february statement indicating your statement balance is $ 500 and payment is due by march 31 still no interest   but   if you pay $ 99 for january leaving just a single dollar to roll over you now owe interest on your entire average daily balance   so now you 'll receive your february statement indicating $ 501 + interest on approximately $ of average daily balance $ 1 carried + $ 500 charged on feb 15 due by march 31   that $ 1 you let roll over just cost you $ in interest $   and   now that balance is continuing to accrue interest in the month of march until the day you make a payment   it typically takes two consecutive months of payment in full before the grace period is restored there is no sense in continuing to spend on a cc that is carrying a balance and accruing interest even if you intend to pay all of your current month spending entirely   you can avoid 100 of the interest related to your regular spending by simply using a different card and no rewards will beat the interest you 're charged

there is no simple answer to your question   it depends on many things perhaps most notably what college your daughter ends up going to and what kind of aid you hope to receive your daughter will probably fill out the fafsa as part of her financial aid application   here is one discussion of what parental assets count towards the expected family contribution on the fafsa   you can find many similar pages by googling   retirement accounts and primary residence are notable categories that do not count   so if you were looking to reduce your apparent assets for aid purposes dumping money into your mortgage or retirement account is a possibility however you should be cautious when doing this type of gaming because it 's not always clear exactly how it will affect financial aid   for one thing financial aid includes both grants and loans   everyone wants grants but sometimes increasing your eligibility may just make you or your daughter eligible for larger loans which may not be so great also each college has its own system for allocating financial aid   individual schools may ask for more detailed information such as the css profile   so strategies for minimizing your apparent assets that work for one school may not work for others   some elite schools with large endowments have generous aid policies that allow even families with sizable incomes to pay little or nothing e.g. stanford tuition for most families with incomes under $ 125,000 you should probably research the financial aid policies of schools your daughter is interested in   it can be helpful to talk to financial aid advisors at colleges as well as high school counselors not to mention general financial advisors if you really want to start getting technical about what assets to move around   needless to say it all begins with talking with your daughter about her thoughts on where to go

it 's simply supply and demand    first demand if you 're an importer trying to buy from overseas you 'll need foreign currency maybe euros   or if you want to make a trip to europe you 'll need to buy euros   or if you 're a speculator and think the usd will fall   in value you 'll probably buy euros unless there 's someone willing to sell you euros for dollars you ca n't get any   there are millions of people trying to exchange currency all over the world   if more want to buy usd than that demand will positively influence the price of the usd as measured in euros   if more people want to buy euros well vice versa there are so many of these transactions globally and the number of people and the nature of these transactions change so continuously that the prices exchange rates for these currencies fluctuate continuously and smoothly demand is also impacted by what people want to buy and how much they want to buy it   if people generally want to invest their savings in stocks instead of dollars i.e. if lots of people are attempting to buy stocks by exchanging their dollars for stock then the demand for the dollar is lower and the demand for stocks is higher   when the stock market crashes you 'll often see a spike in the exchange rate for the dollar because people are trying to exchange stocks for dollars this represents a lot of demand for dollars then there 's supply it may seem like there are a fixed number of bills out there or that supply only changes when bernanke prints money but there 's actually a lot more to it than that   if you 're coming from europe and want to buy some usd from the bank well how much usd does the bank have and what does it mean for them to have money   the bank gets money from depositors or from lenders   if one person puts money in a deposit account and then the bank borrows that money from the account and lends it to a home buyer in the form of a mortgage the same dollar is being used by two people   the home buyer might use that money to hire a carpenter and the carpenter might put the dollar back into a bank account and the same dollar might get lent out again   in economics this is called the multiplier effect the full supply of money being used ends up becoming harder to calculate with this kind of debt and re lending    since money is something used and needed for conducting of transactions the number of transactions being conducted sometimes on credit affects the supply of money demand and supply blur a bit when you consider people who hoard cash   if i fear the stock market i might keep all my money in dollars   this takes cash away from companies who could invest it takes the cash out of the pool of money being used for transactions and leaves it waiting under my mattress   you could think of my hoarding as a type of demand for currency or you could think of it as a reduction in the supply of currency available to conduct transactions the full picture can be a bit more complicated if you look at every way currencies are used globally with swaps and various exchange contracts and futures but this gives the basic story of where prices come from that they are not set by some price fixer but are driven by market forces    the bank just facilitates transactions   if the last price exchange rate is 1.2 dollars per euro and the bank gets more requests to buy usd for euros than euros for usd it adjusts the rate downwards until the buying pressure is even   if the usd gets more expensive at some point fewer people will want to buy it or want to buy products from the us that cost usd   the bank maintains a spread like buy for 1.19 and sell for so it can take a profit you should think of currency like any other commodity and consider purchases for currency as a form of barter   the value of currency is merely a convention but it works   the currency is needed in transactions so it maintains value in this global market of bartering goods services and other currencies   as supply and demand for this and other commodities goods services fluctuate so does the quantity of any particular currency necessary to conduct any of these transactions a official basket of goods and the price of those goods is used to determine consumer price indexes inflation etc   the official price of this particular basket of goods is not a fundamental driver of exchange rates on a day to day basis

yup and circa 2003 2004 2005 2006 and even 2007   the people who had claimed there was a housing bubble were laughed at as well remember all of those assurances that there was no bubble and that housing prices were based on solid fundamentals   i recall a few years back when i said the fed would end up blatantly buying treasuries i was told that was unprecedented and that no way etc etc   fast forward a bit and the fed is now the majority buyer really there is no market for treasuries other than the fed and if the fed were not buying then it would be hugely different   but let 's ignore all that and just call for the bartender to serve another round on the house

as stock prices have declined the net worth of people has come down imagine owning a million shares of a stock worth $ 100/share this is worth $ 100,000,000 now if the stock is suddenly trading at $ 50/share then some would say you have lost $ the value of the stock is less the uncertainty is always there as there are differences between one day 's close and another day 's open possibly the sale price is likely to be near the last trade is what is being used here if you place a market order to sell your stock the price may move between the time the order is placed and when it is filled there are limit orders that could be used if you want to control the minimum price you get though you give up that the order has to be filled as otherwise people could try to sell shares for millions of dollars that would n't work out well

the crazy thing about this is that $ 30 million in annual salary and compensation really is n't the end of the story for rich guys   i worked for a reit a few years back and the guy that founded that reit made a few million in salary a year   i thought the number seemed a bit low for his lifestyle   he had many properties in the us for his own personal use around 6 8 big homes   he also had a garage that was insane   he had over 25 very expensive cars   my co workers would say nick is out his garage when he drove one to work every day for a month without driving the same vehicle twice in one month   it turns out he owned 30 million shares of stock that paid him $ 1.00 per share per year   so while his annual compensation was only a few million per year his dividend income was many many times that   think about that next time you see a ceo 's annual income and you think that it really is n't as much as you expect

as you 're saving up for an expenditure instead of investing for the long run i would stay away from any sort of parking facility where you run the risk of not having the principal protected the riskier investments that would potentially generate a bigger return also carry a bigger downside ie you might not be able to get the money back that you put in i 'd shop around for a cd or a mma regular savings account with a half decent interest rate and yes i 'm aware that the return you might get is probably still less than inflation

assuming this to be in the uk and i suspect   the rules are similar elsewhere this indeed may be true there is a threshold beneath which a business does not have to register for vat currently a turnover of £ a non vat registered business does not charge vat but also can not reclaim the vat on their business expenses for some businesses below the threshold it is worthwhile registering because the amount they can reclaim is significant however there are also many small businesses that do a lot of cash only jobs so as to not put the money through the books and therefore avoid any tax liability there are also many who will get the the customer to buy materials direct to avoid including these in their turnover   like every type of tax rule there is a grey area between people trying to avoid paying more tax than is needed and dodgy deals to avoid paying their fair share of tax

basically yes do n't use your business account for personal spending because it may invalidate your limited liability protection transfer a chunk of money to your personal account write it down in your books as distribution or something similar and use it in whatever way you want from your personal account the irs does n't care per se but mixing personal and business expenses will cause troubles if you 're audited because you 'll have problems distinguishing one from another you should be using some accounting software to make sure you track your expenses and distributions correctly it will make it easier for you to prepare reports for yourself and your tax preparer and also track distributions and expenses i suggest gnucash i find it highly effective for a small business with not so many transactions if you have a lot of transactions then maybe quickbooks would be more appropriate

i just want to point out something that seems to be generally true if you are supposed to report something to the irs and you do n't the irs will probably send you a letter assuming the maximum possible tax liability and it 's up to you to prove that scenario is incorrect in your case you obviously owe no tax but since you did n't report it the irs simply assumed that you do owe tax until you prove otherwise you 're one form away from fixing the issue i have first hand experience that this is also true if you forget to report an hsa distribution i received a letter considering my entire distribution as if it was for non eligible medical expenses this made the amount taxable and had an additional 20 penalty to boot of course i have medical receipts for all of the distributions which makes them not taxable and had i simply put the correct number on my return to begin with i would n't have had to fill out the additional form to correct my mistake

estimated tax payments should be a reasonable estimate of what you owe for that time period if it seems reasonable to you it is probably reasonable sure you can adjust for varying length periods as long as in the end you can and do pay what you owe and do n't underpay the estimated withholding by enough that you owe a penalty the irs is n't all that picky about how the money is actually distributed through the year

no that 's pretty unlikely card issuers typically base your rate on your credit score paying down debt reduces your percent of available credit used and improves your score until you are in the 1 20 range that 's optimum to this issuer you are one of a million customers there 's no emotion in this just numbers to them for what it 's worth if a card issuer raises your rate you are permitted to not accept the rate stop using the card for new charges and pay at the current rate of course this does n't apply to zero interest deals only to increases to your regular rate

deliberately breaking transactions into smaller units to avoid reporting requirements is called structuring and may attract the attention of the irs and/or law enforcement agencies   i 'm not sure what the specific laws are on structuring with respect to fbar reporting requirements and/or electronic transfers as opposed to cash transactions   however there 's been substantial recent publicity about cases where people had their assets seized simply because federal agents suspected they were trying to avoid reporting requirements even if there was no hard evidence of this   it is safer not to risk it   do n't try to structure your transactions to avoid the reporting requirements

whether or not you make money here depends on whether you are buying or selling the option when you open your position   you certainly would not make money in the scenario where you are buying options at the open   if fact you would end up loosing quite a lot of money you do not specify whether you are buying or selling the options so let 's assume that you are buying both the call and the put   we 'll look a profitable trade at the bottom of my answer buying an in the money call option with a strike price of $ 90 when the underlying asset price is $ 150 would cost you a small fraction over $ 6000 = 100 x $ 60 since the intrinsic value value of the option is $ 60   add to this cost any commission charged by your broker buying an out of the money put option with a strike price of $ 110 when the underlying asset price is $ 150 would cost you a small premium lets say a premium of something like $ 0.50   the option has no intrinsic value only time value and a volatility value so the exact cost would depend on the time to expiry and the implied volatility of the underlying asset since the strike price is well out of the money being about 27 below the underlying asset price the premium would be small   so assuming the premium of $ 0.50 you would pay $ 50 for the option plus any commission applicable the cash settlement on expiry with an underlying settlement price of $ 100 would be a premium of $ 10 for each of the two options so you would receive cash of 100 x $ 10 + $ 10 = $ 2000 less any commission applicable   however you have paid $ 6000 + $ 50 to purchase the options so you realise a net loss of $ $ 2000 = $ 4050 plus any commissions applicable thus you would make a profit on the put option but you would realise a very large loss on the call option on the other hand if you open your position by selling the call option and buying the put option then you would make money for the sale of the call option you would receive about $ 6000   for the purchase of the put option you would pay about $ 50 on settlement you would pay $ 1000 to buy back the call option and you would receive about $ 1000 when selling the put option thus you net profit would be about $ 6000 $ 1000 for the call position and $ 1000 $ 50 for the put position   the net profit would then total $ less an commissions payable

sorry but you already provided the answer to your own question   the simple answer is to not day trade but hold things for a longer period and do n't trade a large number of different stocks every week seriously have a look at the rules and see what it implies an average of 20 buys and sells of longer term positions per day is a pretty fair bit of trading that 's really churning through the positions compared to someone who might establish positions with say 25 well picked stocks and might change even 5 of those a week to a different stock   or even a larger number of stocks but seeking to hold them for over a year so you get taxed at the long term cap gains rate if you want to day trade be prepared to be labeled as such and deal with your broker on that basis   not like they will hate you given all the fees you are likely to rack up   and the government will love you also since you 'll be paying short term gains taxes   and trust me us appreciate the liquidity the speculative and short term folks bring to the market in terms of how it would impact you expect to be required to have a fairly substantial balance $ 25 k if you are maintaining a margin account i 'd suggest reading this thread my account 's been labeled as day trader and i got a big margin call what should i do what trades can i place in the blocked period

a good answer to the question really depends on where you want to live ultimately where you want to live pretty much dictates your investment priorities if you want to invest in terrain so you can build a house next to all the cool people in that should be your first priority your new wife may have an opinion on that matter you should consult her in real life most people are less concerned about their absolute level of wealth than with keeping up with their friends or other reference group if you do n't buy the terrain the danger is that in five years it may go up three four five times and be out of your reach even if your other investments do well on the absolute standard   while it 's fairly easy to invest the equivalent of $ 250 k in land it 's hard to invest that much in stocks if you want to buy stocks with that kind of money it will be u.s. european or maybe other latin american e.g. brazilian stocks that kind of asset allocation would tell me that you are thinking of leaving your country at some point if you 're a sensible allocation might be 50 50 but in any event first decide how you want to live your life then adopt the investment strategy that best supports that life

welcome to the 21st century the new order forget all that legal jumbo you may have read back in law school in the 1960s about commercial code its all gone now now we have check 21 and the patriot act basically what this means is that because some arab fanatics burned down the world trade center the us government and its allied civilian banking company now have total control and dictatorship over your money which is no longer really money but more like a credit to your account with them which they can do with what they want here are some of the many consequences of the two aforementioned acts 1 you can no longer sue a bank for mishandling your money 2 all your banking transaction information is the joint property of the bank its affiliates and the us treasury 3 you can no longer conduct private monetary transactions with other people using a bank as your agent you can only request that a bank execute an unsecured transaction on your behalf and the bank has total control over that transaction and the terms on which occurs you have no say over these terms and you can not sue a bank over any financial tort on you for any reason 4 all banks are required to spy on you report any suspicious actions on your part develop and run special software to detect these suspicious actions and send their employees to government run educational courses where they are taught to spy on customers how to report suspicious customers and how to seize money and safe deposit boxes from customers when the government orders them to do so 5 all banks are required to positively identify everyone who has a bank account or safe deposit box and report all their accounts to the government 6 no transactions can be done anonymously all parties to every banking transaction must be identified and recorded so from the above it should be clear to if you are a lawyer why no endorsement is present that is because your check is not a negotiable instrument anymore it is merely a request to the bank to transfer funds to the treasury the treasury does not need to endorse anything in fact legally speaking the treasury could simply order your bank to empty your account into theirs and they actually do this all the time to people they are investigating for supposed crimes you do n't need to endorse checks you receive either because as i said above the check is no longer a negotiable instrument banks still have people do it but it is just a pro forma habit from the old days since you ca n't sue the bank the endorsement is pretty meaningless because it can not be challenged in court anyway you could probably just write x there and they would deposit it

in addition to all these great answers check out the wikipedia entry on options the most important thing to note from their definition is that an option is a derivative and nothing about any derivative is simple   because it is a derivative increases or decreases in the price of the underlying stock wo n't automatically result in the same amount of change in the value of the option

first welcome to money se   the selected page is awful i do n't know the value in listing different expirations at the same strike usually all the strikes are grouped by month so i 'd be looking at jan 15 across all strikes   in the money means the price of a stock is trading above the strike price if a call or below it if a put   on of some year intel was trading at $ the january $ 25 call strike was just $ and april 's was $ these were out of the money the $ 25 puts were in the money by $ so you could have paid $ 1.90 for the jan $ 25 put with $ of time premium   by november the price rose and the put fell to $ .85 all time premium   as with stocks the key thing is to only buy calls of stock that are going to go up if a stock will fall buy puts curious what was the class discussion just before the teacher gave you this image

i can only give you advice on what i would do if i was in this situation   as mentions above the first question you have to ask yourself is how much time do you want to spend to manage your money the more money you have the more money you can possibly make by becoming educated in investing e.g. if you can increase your return on investment roi on $ 500,000   1 it does   a lot more than increasing your roi on $ 50,000 by 1   if i was you i would either track my investments myself or ask an accountant or a fee only financial advisor to determine 3 things at the very least i would spend some serious time getting educated about your newfound wealth   good luck and if you find a need for additional computer programmers at your company do nt hesitate to let me know

two main points to answer this in my opinion first most people do n't start with say half a million dollar to buy all the stocks they need in one shot but rather they accumulate this money gradually so they must make many buys in their lifetime similarly most people do n't need to withdraw all their investment in one day and should n't do this anyway as it cuts the time of investment so there will be many sells performing a single buy or sell per year is not efficient since it means you have lots of cash sitting doing nothing so in this sense low cost indexing lets you quickly invest your money and withdraw it when needed after say you retire without worrying about commission costs each time the second and most important point to me to answer this is that we should make a very clear distinction between strategy and outcome today 's stock prices and all the ups and downs of the market are just one possible outcome that materialized from a virtually number of possible outcomes it 's not too hard to imagine that tomorrow we hear all iphones explode and apple stock comes crashing down or that in a parallel universe amazon never takes off and somehow sears is the king of online commerce another item in the outcome category is your decisions as a human being of when to buy and sell if that exploding iphone event does occur would you hold on to your stocks would you sell and cut your losses does the average person make the same decision if they had $ 1000 invested in apple alone vs $ 1 m   index investing offers a low cost strategy that mitigates these uncertainties for the average person again here the key is the word average picking a handful of the stocks as you mention might give you better returns in 30 years but it could just as easily give you worse and the current data suggest the latter is more likely come and go who were they 30 years ago and just like how the other 450 companies may seem right now as dragging down the portfolio just as easily a handful of them can emerge as the new guaranteed no possible yes   jack bogle is simply saying low cost indexing is one of the better strategies for the average person given the data but nowhere is it guaranteed that in this lifetime e.g. next 30 years will provide the best outcome berkshire on the other hand are in the business of chasing maximum outcomes mid or short term returns it 's two different concepts that should n't be mixed together in my opinion

it 's helpful to remember that charles ponzi started with a legitimate arbitrage international postal remittances   once of arbitrage reach a certain scale there 's a natural tendency to become lazy and just forgo the arbitrage and just use new investor money to pay off previous investors   banks would n't be any different if it were n't for central banks and government participation   indeed the primary reason that the fedresink came into existence is because of ponzi like bank failures bankers call them a run on the bank   economics is about using the synthesis of state sovereignty and central bank monetary theory to keep the system they 've developed intact   and as fun as it might be to sit back and calculate just how much debt can be created from a life time of labor proceeds a couple million for the average completely hypothetical back of the envelope inflation excluded ^ 14 which is still in middle of the trillions it would be wise to keep in mind that the last banking crisis while fundamentally caused by the inability to collect future labor proceeds was not by individuals but by repurchase agreements propping up extremely leveraged positions made by and between massive investment banks   so the thing to remember is that fractional reserve debt issuance banking is like a 10 to 1 that has a fundamental tolerance requirement on the source signal but that when the source signal fades it can draw from the surplus signal created by the 10 to 1 up to a certain point and then the goes up in a puff of smoke

in general following the w-4 instructions should result in withholdings that are fairly close to the amount of taxes that you will owe for the year particularly if your situation is relatively claiming less withholdings than the form suggests can help ensure that you end up saving money in your interest free irs savings account and get a refund at the end of the year which some people prefer so they do n't need to budget separately for a tax payment i 'm guessing that the hr employee either prefers doing so himself or has on occasion received complaints from other employees that they did n't take enough out personally i 'd prefer to claim as many withholdings as i can and be sure to have some money aside in case it turns out that i have to owe a little bit since it means i get more take home pay throughout the year it 's good to keep in mind that a w-4 is n't written in stone if it turns out that too much or too little is being taken out you can always change it you can also try playing around with the irs withholding calculator to try some scenarios

duffbeer703 covers most everything the entire point of an emergency fund is for it to be liquid   now i do understand if you feel your situation requires over 6 months of living expenses that is a lot of money to have sitting in a statement savings account under no circumstances should you take any sort of risk with an emergency fund however you could do this invest some of the assets in a six month 1 year or 2 year cd if returns were enough to be worthwhile   if you do n't need the money then fine great but if you do you can break a certificate of deposit before maturity there will be a penalty fee you might lose interest too but you 'll have access to your money no liquidity risk so maybe you could put most say 60 of your rainy day funds in truly liquid assets the remainder could be in longer term cd 's which you hopefully wo n't need because you 'll be back to non rainy day living again

yes if the deceased owned the policy the proceeds are considered part of the estate in the specific case where the estate is worth this year 2011 more than $ 5 m there may be estate taxes due and the insurance would be prorated to pay its portion of that estate tax bill   keep in mind the estate tax itself is subject to change i recall when it was a simple $ 1 m exemption and if i had a $ 1 m policy and just say $ 100 k in assets there would have been tax due on the $ 100k. in general if there 's any concern that one 's estate would have the potential to owe estate tax it 's best to have the insurance owned by the beneficiary and gift them the premium cost each year

oh please most of the unsecured creditors who get screwed in bankruptcy are large banks they know the risk going in which is why unsecured lends at a high interest rate yes trade creditors often do get screwed but it 's a cost of doing business it 's why a vendor needs to monitor its receivables and watch for signs of insolvency and adjust the terms of trade accordingly   you should have made sure you were covered by brokerage insurance before handing money to a company like that the i 'm the little guy argument is just weak

there is one edge case that may be of value to you if you declare a bonus probably to yourself given a very small company you can deduct it from your year and then have up to 6 months to actually write the cheque and give it to the person say your year end for the corporation is july 31st you could declare the bonus july 30th and deduct it from that year lowering your corporate tax you could then wait until january 30th to actually write the bonus cheque the person would then have that taxable income in a later calendar year deferring paying the tax depending on the size of the bonus this would possibly matter although if you did large bonuses every year it would only matter the first time the other issue is the availability of your bookkeeper or accountant they are sometimes very busy during personal income tax season they often like a vacation immediately after that they may go away in the summer when their kids are out of school the nice thing about a july 31st year end is that you can probably count on a quick turnaround from your accountant in september the possible downside is that you wo n't enjoy reconciling your credit card statements and the like in august as part of getting your year end stuff together you can avoid that by keeping your books in a decent shape all the time

maybe but having one increases the risk of gun accidents and is a real risk if someone in your home has mental health issues and those are statistically far more likely than defending yourself for home or protecting yourself from the breakdown of society   if you are n't someone who genuinely enjoys hunting or range shooting it 's kind of silly to own one

the article made it seem like a lot of these were frivolous purchases but i doubt there 's any clear data on the percent that were someone 's primary vehicle etc usually if you default on a new car loan you can still get a high interest loan for a used car that will still be a lot less than your old payment

i think housing will come back a bit but wo n't be as lucrative as it was in the 90s   millennials although they do n't have much money are still interested in their own houses if they can afford them this means we may see in increase in demand for smaller more efficient houses or for renovating older houses

why you will rarely find a good deal at a liquidation sale will come in and raise the prices well above what they ever sold at higher than kmart 's average retail price then slap some fake off sale on it the real deals are in the last couple days when everything is off and even then you might not find a great deal kmart near me went out years ago went on the last day and picked up a bunch of supplies they used in the store like copy machine and flipped it on ebay

i had a 2000 chevy until late 2011 it worked well but was very definitely at the end of its life this was a low end car certainly but i dispute your claim that cars last 20 25 years consumer reports apparently says the average life expectancy of a new vehicle is around 8 years or 150,000 miles when it came time to replace my i was significantly concerned about car safety and about the ability to handle canadian winters temperatures lots of snow i chose a subaru forester as a good match for me i could have bought one second hand but i was n't willing to get one as old as five years car manufacturers constantly improve safety and features over that time period the forester is massively more capable of handling canadian winters than the was if i was buying a forester now i 'd want the driver assist system which subaru added a couple of years after my model year the newer models score slightly higher in crash tests too that would limit me to 2014 or later models and i 'd be concerned someone selling a 2014 or 2015 knew something i did n't knew they had purchased a lemon i did n't need financing for my vehicle on the other hand i could have invested the money i saved so if all i wanted was something to get me from point a to point b my choice does not make much financial sense but canadian winters are brutal and car safety is massively important to me i 'm well aware that i paid considerably for this and i 'm comfortable with my decision

yeah i read that sentence a few times and still do n't get what he was trying to say   i do n't think he intended to say that autonomous vehicles are n't safer   even the mainstream press is aware that they 're expected to be much safer and articles about autonomous cars usually mention improved safety as an expected benefit
