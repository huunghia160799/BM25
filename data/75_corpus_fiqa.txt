some benefits of having a business checking account versus a personal checking account are the first 3 should be pretty easy to determine if they are important to you 4 is a little more abstract though i see you have an llc taxed as a sole proprietorship and so i 'm guessing protecting your personal assets may have been one of the driving reasons you formed the llc in the first place if so following through with the business account is advised

if you can deal with phone calls instead of a face to face meeting for the average person with an average refinance online tools just offer another way to shop for deals for new mortgages i think having a person you can meet face to face will avoid problems but for just a simple refi online is one of the places you should check compete your current mortgage company your bank hopefully credit union a local broker or two and the online places the more competition you have the more power you have in making a good choice

free they spend millions of dollars for their internet access   net neutrality is n't about them having free connections to the internet it 's about preventing internet service providers from using their position of power to choose which traffic to let through    when comcast and verizon have their own video services or products that compete with online entities like netflix and hulu that neutrality is what stands between them and monopolistic blocking of competition   that 's just one example   does that make more sense

my opinion is that in general it is probably not a good idea to borrow at a cost in order to make your rrsp contribution   banks of course have an interest in loaning you money   do n't expect their literature to be objective on the matter   they are selling you a product and the advice is biased   what better way to double dip than to get guaranteed interest payments from you as well as ongoing fees for probably also getting your loan money invested in their high fee mutual funds a year 's rrsp contribution room allowance is n't use it or lose it unlike 401k contribution allowances in the u.s that is unused rrsp contribution room accumulates and you can take advantage of it in later years if we could n't carry our rrsp contribution room over i might feel different about the general case for rrsp loans yet there are two specific cases i can think of where it may make sense to borrow and pay back a possible case if your tax rate is currently in a high bracket e.g. 46 and you anticipate being in a lower income and bracket next year e.g. 35 then it would make sense to take advantage of the higher tax savings in the current tax year   if you waited until the following year to take the deduction you 'd lose out on 11 of the deducted amount    for a typical person whose income is level or increasing from year to year this is n't likely to be applicable but it could help somebody who is going on leave or otherwise has irregular income a foolish case if you knew somehow that you could realize a return on your invested rrsp money exceeding the pre tax earnings required to pay the interest on the rrsp loan   however i would suggest this is foolish bet to make   the interest you pay is guaranteed but the return you are expected to get is probably not or if it is it is probably a return lower than what your bank wants to charge on the loan if for some reason it does make sense for you take the money and invest it somewhere better than the high fee mutual funds the bank is also pushing

i think you 're doing the right thing one of the benefits of tax deferred account aside of it being tax deferred is that it keeps the money locked from you some people think it 's a bad thing i think it 's a good thing the amount of money locked is not that significant relatively to your income 10 in your case which is a lot relatively to others of your age and shows that you think ahead and plan for your future but it builds up a cushion to fall to when you 're old many people do n't think of the time they 're old or think they 'll be the same or better income wise as they 're now that is not so although during the period of your life your marginal tax will indeed grow in the end it goes back down again for most of the people and that is because your income goes down it is then that you need the money you 're putting aside now and the more you put aside and the earlier you put it aside the more you will have then the fact that it 's locked promises that you will have it then not before when you want to buy a house you ca n't afford or impress a girl with a car you ca n't pay for in my mind that 's the best benefit and the fact that the earlier you start putting the money there the more gains it will acquire until you actually need it so keep up the good work and save for your future lock out that 10 and invest the rest in other channels which may be more risky and with more potential gains

using it as a way to manage their money better it ’s a question not necessarily of spending less but of learning how to spend smarter   and   a strictly financial perspective layaway looks foolish as critics point out if you were to put the purchase on a credit card instead and pay off the amount in full by the time that the layaway period would have elapsed you could well pay less in interest than the five dollar service fee that most stores charge alternatively if you do n’t have a credit card you could put the money you ’re going to spend on the product into a savings account or under your mattress that would save you the service fee and eliminate the risk that you ’ll have to pay a cancellation fee if you end up not making all the layaway payments   basically this   do not make financial sense   you are better off putting the money into a bank account   why do people have such little financial control

the value of debt is that it allows you to profit from the return of equity beyond the amount of actual net equity you own   of course this only works if the cost of borrowing is less than your return on equity   market timing matters a great deal but is n't accounted for in this view   for my answer i would like to hand wave away market timing considerations   one plausible justification is that you could default on your current home and then immediately go buy one of equal value   if you buy a new home of a lesser value due to lack of funds and then prices appreciate then you missed some opportunity cost but probably not $ 100k worth of it moving on here are some helpful assumptions i 'll make i 'll ignore performance of your portfolio after retirement and only seek to optimize f which will be your net worth upon retirement   in either case your current net worth is earning the r2 rate   we can convert this for both your current net worth and future savings using conversion formulas present to future value f = p annual to future value f = s 1 r2 adding these together is sufficient to obtain f in the case that you have no borrowing power   the case where you do not default and maintain your credit score is different due to an initial $ 100k penalty and the amortized value of borrowing power   in a completely theoretical sense you get an effective yield on all borrowed money   the future value will be the following f = a1 one step is missing however which is to convert this value the value of having a good credit score into present value to compare to value of your defaulting p of borrowing power = f = a1 now let 's put some specific values in   say that you can borrow $ 300k with your good credit history and this applies for the next 25 years after which you retire   the borrowing rate is 7 and the time value of money to you is 10   i would then calculate p of borrowing power = $ 58 k < $ 100 k this indicates that it would be more economical to default   of course some people might point out that it will be removed from your record after 7 years   if you plug 7 years instead of 25 years into the equation almost no assumptions about rates will lead to the option of keeping your house being preferable so in a nutshell the value of your credit is probably less than $ 100k in a purely mathematical sense   but there are other factors too   if you do n't have that borrowing ability maybe you would n't be able to borrow money to start the business of your dreams   if you are a rock star entrepreneur then time value of money to you could be 1,000 yield sure then maybe you could make the above numbers work to favor keeping the house   i 've also neglected ethics   as other people point out it would be like stealing from the bank

first i would like to use a better chart   in my opinion a close of day line chart a lot of important information   here is a daily log chart   the initial drop from the close on oct 3 was to intraday to close at on oct 10   after this the market was still very volatile and reached a low of on nov 20 closing only slightly higher than this   it traded as high as on jan 6 2009 but the whole period of nov 24 feb 13 was somewhat of a trading range of roughly 800 900   despite this the news reports of the time were frequently saying things like this is n't going to be a v shaped recovery it is going to be u shaped   the roughly one week dip you see feb 27 mar 9 taking it to an intraday low of only about 11 below the previous low on first glance appears to be just a continuation of the previous trend    however the mar 10 uptrend started with various news articles such as this one which i recall at the time suggested things like the parts of the glass steagall act of 1933 which had been repealed by the gramm leach bliley act   although these attempts appear to have been unsuccessful the widespread of such attempts in the media seemed to have reversed a common notion which i saw widespread on forums and other places that we are going to be in this mess forever the market has nowhere to go but down and therefore shorting the market is a good idea now   i do n't find the article itself but one prominent theme was the up tick rule on short selling source from this viewpoint then that the last dip was driven not so much by a recognition that the economy was really in the toilet as this really was discounted in the first drop and at least by late november had already been figured into the price   instead it was sort of the opposite of a market top where now you started seeing individual investors jump on the band wagon and decide that now was the time for a into selling short   the fact that the up tick rule was likely to be re had a noticeable effect on the final slide

you are in your mid 30 's and have 250,000 to put aside for that is a fantastic position to be in first let 's evaluate all the options you listed option 1 i could buy two studio apartments in the center of a european capital city and rent out one apartment on short term rental and live in the other occasionally i could airbnb the apartment i live in to allow me to travel more one of my life goals to say european capital city is such a massive generalization i would disregard this point based on that alone athens is a european capital city and so is berlin but they have very different economies at this point let 's put that aside for now you have to beware of the following costs when using property as an investment this list is non exhaustive the positive you have someone paying the mortgage or allowing you to recoup what you paid for the apartment but can you guarantee an roi of 10 15 far from it if investing in real estate yielded guaranteed results everyone would do it this is where we go back to my initial point about european capital city being a massive generalization option 2 take a loan at very low interest rate probably 2 2.5 fixed for 15 years and buy something a little nicer and bigger this would be incase i decide to have a family in say 5 years time i would need to service the loan at up to eur 800 usd 1100 per month if your life plan is taking you down the path of having a family and needed the larger space for your family then you need the space to live in and you should n't be looking at it as an investment that will give you at least 10 returns buying property you intend to live in is as much a life choice as it is an investment you will treat the property much different from the way something you rent out gets treated it means you 'll be in a better position when you decide to sell but do n't go in to this because you think a return is guaranteed do it if you think it is what you need to achieve your life goals option 3 buy bonds and shares but i have n't the idea about how to do that and/or manage a portfolio if i was to go down that route how do i proceed with some confidence i wo n't lose all the money let 's say you are 35 years old the general rule is that 100 minus your age is what you should put in to equities and the rest in something more conservative consider this this strategy is long term and the finer details are beyond the scope of an answer like this you have quite some money to invest so you would get preferential treatment at many financial institutions i want to address your point of having a goal of 10 15 return since you mentioned europe take a look at this chart for ftse 100 one of the more prominent indexes in europe   you can do the the return is no where close to your goals my objective in mentioning this your goals might warrant going to much riskier markets emerging markets again it is beyond the scope of this answer

long term student loan debt is a huge on the economy overall when a generation is paying the equivalent of 50 100 of rent or a mortgage on debt you ca n't get around it at best it will delay things like homeownership which is what we 're seeing but at worst it will be crippling for an entire generation of americans which we might also be seeing but it still has to play out   i think the biggest problem with debt is how it changes your risk tolerance meaning we millennials are well trained and well positioned to be employees not inventors or entrepreneurs as as it 's sounds because of pandering politicians small businesses   or   huge drivers of innovation jobs and growth not the growth that only impacts the 1 but the growth that boosts wages and creates good jobs for everyone on one hand it 's an inefficiency but a good inefficiency meaning if you have 100 small business they all need sales guys accountants payroll stock guys cashiers they all use dozens and dozens of suppliers and are more likely to use local domestic labor consolidated industries and reliance more on larger businesses means those 100x accountants and sales guys are replaced by a fraction fewer jobs fewer opportunities smaller salary growth less domestic labor used this to me is the real danger in not only student loan debt but even uncertain retirement conditions our money is paying debt and dumping into 401ks not starting businesses and generating meaningful economic activity

i think separate accounts is the simplest way to go if the tax breaks are significant then the inconvenience should be worth it   you could gift or loan money back and forth done properly it should be technically legal or grey enough to not cause irs trouble specifically they could gift you in january and then you could gift them in december leaving a net gift of 10k$ for the year from you to them which is under the annual gift tax exclusion based on market performance you could gift back exactly enough to hit the gift tax exclusion and keep the rest in their account with you loans would work similarly but the irs tends to treat undocumented or interest free loans as weird gifts but honestly you might just be trading day to day overhead for tax audit risk lastly no offense meant but i suspect that your strategy is probably just some form of martingale betting system and you might cause some serious family strife when you eventually meet your gambler 's ruin even if everything goes smoothly it would take some serious trust for your family to assume that you only netted them 10 roi when your spending habits make it look like you are getting 30 even if you used a single account documenting the trades to their satisfaction might be more hassle than maintaining a separate account personally i would not trade family accord for another 2 roi

typically as an individual you ca n't just decide you want to lend out some securities there is a lot of legalities that must take place in order to engage in such a transaction it 's a regulated industry and the contractual obligations that exist between borrower and seller are taken care of ahead of time by the broker with their client prior to any actual transaction taking place i say typically becuase i 'm guessing that if you are a large enough client and own a substantial block of shares i really mean a lot you may be in the unique position of being able to lend out i 'm not sure what the logistics of this would look like but i think the brokerage house would approach you and negotiate a borrowing rate in that situation you may negotiate lending to the the brokerage house and not necessarily directly to the borrower

inflation can go up for a number of reasons boom times can cause inflation as everyone is making and spending a lot of money so prices and inflation goes up in times like these central banks usually increase interest rates to curb spending and thus bring down inflation by raising interest rates the central bank is increasing the cost of borrowing money so with high prices and a higher cost to borrowing money most people start reducing their spending when this happens businesses sell less stock and have increased costs due to higher interest rates so have to lay off staff or reduce their hours at work so people will have even less money to spend this causes prices to fall and reduces inflation and can result in a recession at this point in time central banks start reducing interest rates to make the cost of borrowing money cheaper and stimulate people to start spending again and so the cycle continues the result in this case is that inflation itself did n't demand but was helped along by the central bank rising interest rates another reason causing inflation can be a restriction on the supply of certain goods or services an example we went through about 2 years ago was when floods caused banana crops up in northern australia to be devastated this caused a lack of supply in bananas for almost a year across australia the normal price for bananas here is between $ 1 to $ 3 per kg during this period banana prices skyrocketed up to $ 14 per kg the result very few were buying bananas so the increase in price here caused a reduction in demand directly

since it 's not tagged united states i 'd like to offer a more general advice your emergency fund should match the financial risks that are relevant to you the two main classes of financial risk are of course a sudden increase in costs or a decrease in income you 'd have to address both independently first loss of income for most this would simply equate to the loss of a job how much benefits would you expect to get and for how long this is often the most important question the 6 months advise in the us is based on a lack of benefits   with two incomes you 're less likely to lose both jobs at the same time that 's a general advise though if you both work for the same employer the risk of losing two jobs at the same time is certainly real also in countries with little protection against dismissal such as the us the chance of being off at the same time is also higher on the debit side there are also two main risks the first is the loss or failure of an essential possession i.e. one which requires immediate replacement this could include a car or a washing machine you already paid for one before so you should have a good idea how much it costs the second expenditure risk is health related costs those can suddenly crop up but often you have some kind of insurance if not you 'd need to account for some costs but it 's hard to come up with an objective number here the two categories are dependent of course health related costs may very well coincide with a loss of income especially if you 're self employed now once you 've figured out what the risks are it 's time to figure out how to insure against them insurance might be a better choice than an emergency fund especially for the health costs you might even discover that you do n't need an emergency fund at all in large parts of europe you could establish a credit margin that 's not easily revoked i.e. overdraft agreements and unemployment benefits are sufficient to cover your regular cost of living the main risk would then be a sudden lack of liquidity if your employer goes bankrupt and fails to pay the monthly wages which means your credit should be guaranteed sufficient to borrow one month of expenses this of course assumes quite good credit pay off my car does n't suggest that

for most people you do n't want individual bonds unless you are investing very significant amounts of money you are best off with bond funds or etfs here in canada i chose a mutual fund which seeks to roughly track the universe bond index see the canadian couch potato 's recommended funds now you live in the u.s. so would most likely want to look at a similar bond fund tracking u.s. bonds you wo n't care much about canadian bonds in fact you probably do n't want to consider foreign bonds at all due to currency risk most recommendations say you want to stick to your home country for your bond investments some people suggest investing in junk bonds as these are likely to pay a higher rate of return though with an increased risk of default you could also do fancy stuff with bond maturities too but in general if you are just looking at an 80/20 split if you are just looking for fairly simple investments you really should n't go for a bond fund that just mirrors a big low risk bond index in your home country i mean that 's the implication when someone recommends a 60/40 split or an 80/20 split should you go with a bond mutual fund or with a bond etf that 's a separate question and the answer will likely be the same as for stock mutual funds vs stock etfs so i 'll mostly ignore the question and just say stick with mutual funds unless you are investing at least $ 50,000 in bonds

why should a bank get into construction specifically lots of business opportunities require capital conceivably banks could build factories develop consumer electronics complete with spacex etc it 's all capital in profits out with varying levels of risk and returns there 's nothing special about constructing apartments the reason banks do n't run businesses is because there are plenty of private firms that compete with each other for business what 's the chance that a bank with all its bureaucracy can deliver cheaper apartments than an apartment developer pretty low in fact and that 's why they would rather lend to an apartment developer rather than building the apartments themselves banks are in the business of competing with other banks the main work they do is to sort out good investments from poor ones and if they can do that just a bit more efficiently than their competitors they make big bucks for example it might only take a few additional hours to better vet a deal worth millions whereas with an apartment building you would n't be able to make that amount of money per hour even if the materials and labor cost you nothing

given the state of the economy and the potential of a rough near future for us recent grads i.e. on off work i would recommend holding off on large purchases while your life is in   this includes both a new car and purchasing a house my short answer is you need a reliable vehicle so purchase a used car from a major dealer yes this will add a fairly high premium but easier financing that is 4 5 years old or more   barring the major dealer purchase be sure to get a mechanic to check out a vehicle many will offer this service for a reasonable payment   as people point out cars these days will run for another 100k miles   you will not have to pay anywhere near $ 27,000 for this vehicle   you may need to leverage your 10k for a loan if you choose to finance but it should not be a problem especially as you seem to imply an established credit history in addition to this start saving your money for the house you would like to eventually get   we have no idea where you live but picking rough numbers assuming a 2 year buy period 20 down and a $ 250,000 home the down payment alone will require you to save starting now barring either of these options max out your money to tax sheltered accounts your roth ira work 401k or a regular ira asap   obviously do not deplete your emergency fund if anything increase it   10k can be burned through in a heartbeat long answer   i purchased a brand new car right out of school at a reasonable interest rate   like you i can afford this vehicle however if someone were to come to me today 3.5 years later and offer me the opportunity to take it back and purchase a 4 5 year used vehicle at a 4 5 year used car price albeit at a much higher interest rate since i financed it would be about a 0.02 second decision i like my car but i 'd like the differential cash savings between it and a reliable used car more   $ 27,000 is also fairly expensive for a new vehicle there are many very nice vehicles for 21 23k   i still would not consider these priced appropriate to spend your money on them but they exist   however you do very much need a reliable vehicle and i think you should get one on the home front your $ 400 all inclusive rent is insanely cheap   many people spend more than that on property tax and pmi each year so anyone who throws the you 're throwing money away line at you is blowing smoke to justify their own home purchase   take the money you would have spent on a mortgage and squirrel it away   do your own due diligence and research the home market in your area and decide for yourself if you think home prices have bottomed and will stay there have further to go or are going to begin to rise   that is a decision only you can make for yourself i 'd add a section about getting expenses under control but you said you could save 50 of your pay   this is an order of magnitude above the average   good job   try doing 50 for 4 months then calculate your actual amount   then try to beat it

okay first of all fair value may not be target price lots of things can go into a price that wo n't be in fair value such as expected future price   second of all if you were good at equity research and could make money off of doing it you would start a hedge fund or get paid very well by some company if you are n't good at equity research but still want to do it you do journalism and estimates on fair value
# 53225
one approach would be to create journal entries that debit asset accounts that are associated with these items and credit an open balance equity account the value of these contributions would have to be worked out with an accountant as it depends on the lesser of the adjusted basis vs. the fair market value as you then depreciate the amounts over time to take the depreciation as a business expense and it adjusts your basis in the company to calculate capital gains losses when you sell if there were multiple partners or your accountant wants it this way you could then debit open balance equity and credit the owner 's contribution to a capital account in your name that represents your basis when you sell from a pure accounting perspective if the open balance equity account would zero out you could just skip it and directly credit the capital accounts but i prefer the open balance equity as it helps know the percentages of initial equity which may influence partner ownership percentages and identify anyone who needs to contribute more to the partnership

sure it does n't but realistically they can't do anything about it in their index funds because then they 're just another stock picker trying to gauge which companies are going to do best   their funds not all being indexes is what i was getting at with my original question how much leeway do they have in their definitions of other funds ie if they had a dividend fund that included all large cap dividend paying stocks above 3 yield they could n't take out shell just because of climate risk without fundamentally changing what the fund is but if it 's just income fund then they can do whatever in that space

in the current system it would be irresponsible to pay more than they have to but if corporations get to be amoral people they need tighter regulation because what 's good for maximizing profits is rarely good for people if you want to argue that businesses are more important than people then perhaps profits should receive favorable treatment to people but i highly doubt lincoln was talking about walmart when he was talking about a government by the people and for the people there 's plenty of businesses out there charging a fair markup for a quality product or service and paying a fair wage it 's not highly profitable but i think we 've been watching the race to the bottom by publicly traded companies maximizing quarterly returns at the expense of literally anything and everything else something 's got ta give   also your argument implies that you 're ok subsidizing walmart 's profit margin with your tax money their employees are receiving government benefits because walmart does n't pay them well enough to afford it on their own figure $ split 190 m ways we us workers all gave walmart a little over $ 30 each

one way to value companies is to use a dividend discount model in substance it consists in estimating future dividends and calculating their present value so it is a methodology which considers that an equity is similar to a bond and estimates its current value based on future cash flows a company may not be paying dividends now but because its future earnings prospects are good may pay some in the future in that case the model will give a non zero value to that stock if on the other hand you think a company wo n't ever make any profits and therefore never pay any dividends then it 's probably worth 0 take microsoft as an example it currently pays ~3 dividend per annum the stock has been listed since 1986 and yet it did not pay any dividends until 2003 but the stock has been rising regularly since the beginning because people had priced in the fact that there was a high chance that the company would become very profitable which proved true in the long term + 60,000 including dividends since the ipo

i want to recommend an exercise find all the people nearby who you can talk to in less than 24 hours about credit cards your family whoever lives with you and friends now ask each of them what 's the worst situation you 've gotten yourself into with a credit card personally the ratio of people who i asked who had credit cards to the ratio of people with horror stories about how credit cards screwed up their credit was nearly 1:1   pretty much only one of them had managed to avoid the trap that credit cards created that sole exception had worked for the government at a high paying job and was now retired with adult children and a lucrative pension   because it 's trivially easy over extend yourself as a result of how credit cards work if you had the cash at any second you would have no need for the credit but do your own straw poll and then see what the experience of people around you has been   and if there 's a lot more bad than good out there then ask yourself am i somehow more fiscally responsible than all of these people

the first thing you need to know is that getting a new social security number will not erase your credit history in fact using a name change or a social security number change to get out of debt is considered fraud in most jurisdictions and you can be arrested for it as soon as you are issued a new social security number your old number and new number are linked in the government and credit bureau files everything that was on your old credit report will appear on your new credit report the second big thing to know is if you suspect that your social security number has been used fraudulently in regards to credit stop reading this right now immediately call one of the three major credit bureaus experian transunion or equifax and place what 's called an initial fraud alert you only need to call one of the three the one you call will notify the other two this places a flag on your credit file at all three bureaus which says that your identity may have been stolen and any financial institution which is processing an application for credit should immediately contact you at the phone number you provide the alert is good for 90 days and you can renew it as many times as you wish i suggest using transunion as your one call because i 've called them when my identity was stolen and they 're automated system is very well designed now that that is out of the way you said that they have your email address but it is very unusual for people to be contacted by email for a debt in fact i would automatically disregard any emails about debts every legitimate financial institution i 've ever come across will either call you or send mail to your last known address regarding what 's being reported on your credit report you need to type a letter to each credit bureau which is reporting the information telling them who you are and that you are disputing this information on your report mail it to the bureaus by certified mail with return receipt under united states law they are required to verify the information on your report if you dispute it and remove the information if they are unable to verify it in many cases it 's too much of a hassle and the bureaus just remove the information the other thing i 'll leave you with is that you said you 've only had credit in the past six months six months is not enough time to build an adequate credit profile you really need to be strategic about your credit score every time you apply for credit it drags the score just a little bit lower your question was n't really about building credit so i 'll spare you the novel on that but i would encourage you to seek out one of the many resources which are readily available online i am not an attorney this is not legal advice you should consult with an attorney who is licensed to practice law in your particular jurisdiction

bit hesitant to put this in an answer as i do n't know if specific investment advice is appropriate but this has grown way too long for a comment the typical answer given for people who do n't have the time experience knowledge or inclination to pick specific stocks to hold should instead invest in etfs exchange traded index funds what these basically do is attempt to simulate a particular market or stock exchange an s&p 500 index fund will generally attempt to hold shares in the stocks that make up that index they only have to follow an index not try to beat it so are called passively managed they have very low expense ratios far below 1 and are considered a good choice for investors who want to hold stock without significant effort or expense and who 's main goal is time in the market it 's a contentious topic but on average an index and therefore an index fund will go even with or outperform most actively managed funds with a sufficiently long investment horizon which you have these may be ideal for you trading in etfs is also typically cheap because they are traded like stock there are plenty of low fee online brokers and virtually all will allow trading in etfs my broker even has a list of several hundred popular etfs that can be traded for free   the golden rule in investing is that you should never buy into something you do n't understand do n't buy individual stock with little information it 's often little more than gambling the same goes for trading platforms like do n't use them unless you know their business model and what they stand to gain from your custom as mentioned i can trade certain funds for free with my broker but i know why they can offer that and how they 're still making money

most credit cards will allow you to pick the closing date in fact almost every bill with the exception of utilities that collected usage by reading a meter at the house will either let you pick the closing date each month or at least have several to pick from they wo n't let you pick the length but they will let you pick the day of the month when i worked a job that paid once a month i wanted all my bills due early in the month get paid pay bill know how much i have left when i went back to every other week spreading them out made more sense no credit card had a problem with this the transitional cycle was not the correct length but after that it was fine as dheer pointed out extending the cycle to 90 days would involve them extending credit for much longer than they would be comfortable also the goal of keeping utilization under 30 would be very difficult you would have to keep your spending per month to less than 10 of your credit limit some people have trouble not falling behind on credit card bills having to set aside the money to pay the bill every 90 day may be way to tough for many people

as the owner of the s corp it is far easier for you to move money in out of the company as contributions and distributions rather than making loans to the company loans require interest payments 1099-int forms and have tax consequences whereas the distributions do n't need to be reported because you pay taxes on net profits regardless of whether the money was distributed if you were paid interest disregard this answer i do n't know if or how you could re categorize the loan once there 's a 1099-int involved if no interest was ever paid you just need to account for it properly if the company did n't pay you any interest and never issued you a 1099-int form i.e. you wrote a check to the company no promissory note no tax forms no payments no interest etc then you can categorize that money as a capital contribution you can likewise take that money back out of the company as a capital distribution and neither of these events are taxable nor do they need to be reported to the irs in quickbooks create the following equity accounts one for each shareholder making capital contributions and distributions when putting money into the company deposit into your corporate bank account and use the capital contribution equity account when taking money out of the company write yourself a check and use the distributions account at the end of every tax year you can close out your contributions and distributions to retained earnings by making a general journal entry for example debit retained earnings and credit distributions on dec 31 every year to zero out the distributions account for contributions do the reverse and credit retained earnings there are other ways of recording these transactions for example i think some people just use a member capital equity account instead of separate accounts for contributions and distributions and qb might warn you about posting journal entries to the special retained earnings account at the end of the year in any case this is how my cpa set up my books and it 's been working well enough for many years still never a bad idea to get a second opinion from your cpa be sure to pay yourself a reasonable salary you ca n't get out of payroll taxes and just distribute profits that 's a big red flag that can trigger an audit if you 're simply distributing back the money you already put into the company that should be fine

you could buy some call options on the usd inr that way if the dollar goes up you 'll make the difference and if the dollar goes down then you 'll lose the premium you paid   i found some details on usd inr options here looks like the furthest out you can go is 3 months note they 're european style options so they can only be exercised on the expiration date as opposed to american style which can be exercised at any time up to the expiration date alternatively you could buy into some futures contracts for the usd inr those go out to 12 months with futures if the dollar goes up you get the difference if the dollar goes down you pay the difference   i 'd say if you were going to do something like this stick with the options since the most you could lose there is the premium you put up for the option contracts with futures if it suddenly moved against you you could find yourself with huge losses note that playing in the futures and options markets are an easy way to get burned it 's not for the faint of heart

the question that i walk away with is what is the cost of the downside protection disclaimer i do n't sell anything i am not a fan of insurance as an investment with rare exceptions i 'll stop there all else is a tangent there 's an appeal to looking at the distribution of stock returns it looks a bit like a bell curve with a median at 10 or so and a standard deviation of 15 or so this implies that there are some number of years on average that the market will be down and others about 2/3 up now you wish to purchase a way of avoiding that negative return and need to ask yourself what it 's worth to do so   the insurance company tells you a 2 off the top i.e. no dividends and b we will clip the high end over 9.5   i then am compelled to look at the numbers knowing that your product ca n't be bought and sold every year it 's appropriate to look at rolling returns the annual returns i see and the return you 'd have in any period i start with 1900 2012 i see an average 9.8 with std of 5.3 remember the 10 year rolling will do a good job pushing the std down the return the insurance would give you is an average 5.4 with std of .01 you 've bought your way out of all risk but at what cost   from 1900 2012 my dollar grows to $ yours to $ for much of the time treasuries were higher than your return much higher   it 's interesting to see how often the market is over 10 for the year clip too many of those and you really lose out   from 1900 2012 i count 31 negative years ouch but 64 years over 9.5 the 31 averaged the 64   the illusion of market gains is how this product is sold long term they lag safe treasuries

quid 's answer explains the settlement period well however it should be noted that you can avoid the settlement period by opening a margin account any specific broker like schwab may or may not offer margin accounts margin accounts allow you to borrow money to avoid the settlement period or to buy more securities than you can actually afford note that if you buy more securities than you can afford using margin you expose yourself to losses potentially larger than your initial investment if you fund your account with $ 50,000 and use margin to purchase $ 80,000 of stock which then drops in value by 80 you will have lost $ and owe the broker $ 14,000 plus fees

actually i think direct financial kickbacks are a minor factor in this problem in most cases a physician makes nothing from the writing of a prescription what does influence a physician is the never ending attempts of pharmaceutical companies to educate them this goes far beyond simple drug reps visits given that most medical conventions and a number of continuing education events are manufacturer sponsored there are many hidden benefits that flow from this tactic and few could be expressed as direct payoffs it 's a race between professional ethics and marketing tactics and at least in the usa ethics are often left in the dust   there is also another factor which may have even greater weight the demand from patients one 's medical education and society in general to do something the value of literally doing nothing is n't emphasized enough in medical education nor is it appreciated by the general public sometimes doing something is fairly benign wave your hands prescribe a pill or engage in alternative voodoo medicine most diseases will get better on their own despite the doctor 's best efforts    once more this situation is at its worst in the usa american physicians are notoriously aggressive and are very prone to given the long standing and well documented failure of the american system to measure up in terms of outcomes compared to other countries this aggression has nothing but negative empirical support in its favour the dismal performance of us   medicine is n't only because of its gross inequalities there are other factors at play and is one you wo n't necessarily get better treatment because you are either wealthy or have wonderful insurance but you will definitely get more treatment

a warrant is similar to a call option the right to buy stock at a certain price with the difference that warrants are filled by the issuing company with new shares diluting the existing shareholders ownership the language is a bit confusing but how i interpret it is so your 9,000 shares will get you 3,000 shares and 3,000 warrants the right to buy shares at a maximum price of 0.27 between april 2 2018 and april 30 2018    i think the phrase the subscription price is sek 0.27 per unit means that you can buy each unit for 0.27 which gets you one share and one option to buy another share

one thing i thought of when i heard this was first announced is how theaters actually make money theaters do n’t make much from the movies they show since studios take a huge portion of ticket sales for themselves especially at release theaters make money with concessions and value add services which would still be in full effect even on this movie a day subscription model i ’m no expert in the industry though so i could be completely wrong here but i ’d imagine if theaters have a limitation on the pass in terms of how long a movie must be out before a pass can be used to see it thereby avoiding the super high studio ticket cost then they can still make good money from people dropping 30 bucks for popcorn a drink and candy before they go in to see the movie

you can withdraw from your rrsp to pay your taxes while not necessarily advisable it is permitted yet the tax consequences are no different just because you happen to be using the money to pay a prior year 's income tax balance due when you make the withdrawal from your rrsp an amount will be withheld towards your income tax for the withdrawal year assuming you have other income then you are likely to owe cra even more than the amount withheld because the withdrawal is effectively taxed at your marginal rate in that case consider the withholding tax merely a downpayment you 'll figure the final amount due when you file your next income tax return e.g. if you were to withdraw money from your rrsp today in 2015 to pay your 2014 income tax balance due then on your 2015 income tax return you 'll need to declare the withdrawn amount as income for 2015 you 'll get credit for the withholding taxes already paid when you made the withdrawal your tax return will indicate how much more you 'll need to pay to settle your 2015 taxes if you then pay your 2015 income tax balance due with an rrsp withdrawal in 2016 then repeat better to save up funds elsewhere e.g. in a bank account or a tfsa to cover an anticipated income tax balance owing

i agree this article does n't even consider the fact that we may be adding different types of jobs and ones in different industries than those that were lost during the recession    instead it seems to assume that all jobs are uniform and that when the economy adds jobs after a recession that they are replacing the old jobs that we lost that is simply not so nothing is that simple   there are n't just jobs and ceo jobs the economy is more complex than that   we lost a lot of high paying jobs in the recession that just wo n't ever come back especially jobs at financial institutions that were dependent on mortgage backed securities a part of that industry that has since shrunk permanently losing those jobs were necessary and good for the economy the fact that the jobs we are adding now happen to be at a lower wage are basically happenstance as i see it   i 'm just happy that we 're adding jobs the inequality thing will always be an issue and i hope it gets better but this article is pretty elementary when it comes to economic truth

you would have to find someone in the other state who wanted to swap   this is conceivable but difficult if you want the houses to be the same value   how do you find the one person who lives in the right place now and wants to move to the right area    the normal way this situation is handled is to simply put your house on the market   at the same time you find a new house in the new location   you arrange for a new mortgage for the new house and make purchase contingent on selling the old house   your buyer pays off your mortgage and gives you a bit left over that you use as a downpayment on the new house    note that you take a loss on closing costs when you do this   this is why if you are in the position where you move frequently you may be better off renting    sometimes an employer will help with this paying for a long term hotel or short term rental   this can give you more room to sell and buy the houses    if you have to move right now immediately not in a few months when your housing situation is fixed consider double renting   you rent out your mortgaged house to someone and pay rent on a new place   you may put some of your stuff in storage until you get into your permanent place    the downside is that it can be harder to sell a house with a tenant until you are close to the end of the lease   and of course you are probably not in the best position to get or pay good rent   your situation restricts your options   you might get stuck in this situation for a year so as to get the time that you need to line up a buyer    of course you may get lucky and find someone who wants your old house as an investment property   such a person wo n't be bothered by a tenant   but they usually want a good price   after all they want to make money off it    there are those operations that advertise that they buy ugly houses   they want a good deal   you 'll probably take a bath   but they can buy quickly so you can move on quickly   no waiting until they find a buyer    and i 'm not saying that you ca n't do a swap like you want   i 'm just saying that you may find it difficult to find a swapping partner   perhaps an investment person would be up for it   they take your house in trade for their house letting you stay in their house until they can fix up your old house and either rent it or sell it   the problem is that it may be hard to find such an investor who can handle a house where you are and has a house where you need to be    i do n't have a good suggestion for finding a swapping partner other than calling a lot of realtors and asking for suggestions   maybe a bit of online checking for properties where the owner 's business is managing the sale

anything related to the central bank will have a large impact as they are the ones who determine interest rates and interest rates have a big effect on currency flows   gdp is also important as when there is an economic slowdown it may result in the central bank reducing rates to boost economic activity the opposite is also true large increases in gdp may mean that an interest rate hike might be needed inflation data is also very important again large changes in inflation either way may push the central bank towards changing rates this data typically is in the form of cpi note that each central bank is different they all have specific mandates and specific pieces of economic data that they place emphasis on the federal reserve as of late has closely been watching inflation data especially wage inflation data and employment significant deviations in these data points from what s expected by investors can greatly move the market however these specific factors are a little less important for say mexico which is mostly concerned with headline inflation read the statements issued by the central banks to find out what s important to them central banks also issue expectations for things like growth cpi etc if these expectations are not met it may result in a policy change or at least talk of a policy change at the next meeting of the central bank anticipating these policy changes and trading accordingly is one strategy to be a profitable forex trader also there are several forex news calendars online that indicate what is likely to be high impact news these can be helpful starting out

the comments are getting too much but to verify that you are not insane you are being   it sounds like this is a sub prime loan of which you are wisely trying to get out of   it also sounds like they are doing everything in their power to prevent you from doing so   for them you are a very profitable customer this might take some legwork for you but depending on how bad they are violating the law they might be willing to forgive the loan   what i am trying to say it might be very worth your while your first step will be looking for any free resources at your disposal just be cautious as many credit representation type business are only offering loan consolidation   that is not what you need fight those bastards

yes you can certainly keep it in a savings account until you spend it you 'll get much less interest than you will be paying on the loan but it will be better than nothing however you may want to ask if you can use the loan flexibly instead i.e. only draw down the money you need when you need it and not start paying interest until that happens that would save you a lot more money note that the isa limit is currently £ and the limit is on total deposits so you wo n't be able to reuse the amount later in the tax year since that ends on april 5th that probably wo n't be an issue for you

a reason to get an accountant is to avoid penalties for possible mistakes that is if you make a mistake the irs can impose penalties on you for negligence if the professional makes the same mistake the burden of proof for negligence shifts to the irs which probably means that you 'll pay more taxes and interest but no penalties hiring an accountant is prima evidence of not being negligent i would get an accountant since this the first time for you in the present situation when mistakes are most likely if you feel that s he did the same for you that you would have done for yourself then you might go back to doing your own taxes in later years

i think you are asking a few questions here why is gold chosen as money in a free market there are five characteristics of a good money gold and silver meet all five characteristics   diamonds are not easily divisible which is why they are not normally used as money   copper iron and lead are not scarce enough you would need a lot of these metals to make weekly or daily purchases   paper is also way too plentiful to be used as money by the way historically silver has been used for money more than gold how does international trade work with gold as money is this what you are asking with your hypothetical example of 10 countries each with y amount of gold typically a government will issue a currency that is backed by gold   this means you can redeem your currency for actual gold   then when an american spends 5 us dollars usd to purchase a chinese good the chinese man now owns 5   the chinese man can either redeem the 5 usd for gold or spend the 5 usd in the us   if a government issues more currency then they have gold for then the gold will start to flow from that country to other countries as the citizens of the other countries redeem the over issued currency for gold   this outflow of gold restricts governments from over issuing paper currency who creates the procedures and who them in modern worldwide economy the federal reserve imf and bank of international settlements all are involved in the current system where the us dollar see bretton woods agreement is the reserve currency used by central banks throughout the world   some think this system is coming to an end   i tend to agree

short term the game is supply demand and how the various participants react to it at various prices on longer term prices start to better reflect the fundamentals within something like week to some month or two if there has not been any unique value affecting news then interest options market swing traders and such play bigger part with intraday the effects of available liquidity become very pronounced the market makers have algos that try to guess what type of client they have and they prefer to give high price to large buyer and low price to small buyer as intraday trader has spreads and commissions big part of their expenses and leverage magnifies those instead of being able to take advantage of the lower prices they prefer to stop out after small move against them in practise this means that when they buy low that low will soon be the midpoint of the day and high etc if they are still holding on buy and sell are similar to long call or long put options position and options are like insurance they cost you also the longer the position is held the more likely it is to end up with someone with ability to test your margin if you 're highly leveraged and constantly making your wins from the same source   risk management is also issue the leveraged pros trade through a company not sure if they 're able to open another such company and still open accounts after the inevitable

based on past case law a check made payable to qualified charity and delivered e.g. placed in the mail on 12/31 would count as delivered as it is out of the hands of the donor would fall under the constructive receipt doctrine however for non charitable gifts e.g. gifts to family members it is the date the check is cashed honored by the receiving bank   this is important as the annual gift exclusion is just that annual   therefore if i gift my child $ 14,000 by writing a check on but they deposit it on then i have used my annual gift exclusion for 2015 and not 2014   this means i could not gift them anything further in 2015 btw the annual gift amount is for all gifts cash and non cash   most people do n't seem to realize this   if i give $ 14,000 of cash to my child and then also give them christmas gifts with a value of $ 1,000 i have exceeded my annual gift exclusion to that child   usually there are ways around this issue as i can give $ 14,000 to each and every person i want and if married my spouse can do the same   this allows us to give $ 14,000 from each of us to each child plus $ 14,000 from each of us to their spouse if married and $ 14,000 from each of us to each of their children if they have any

if you set a savings amount now and leave it totally fixed you 're likely to massively or   what is more likely is that you will adjust either your savings or your retirement expectations as things go along   if it turns out you have $ 10 m 2010 dollars at age 50 perhaps you 'll retire early and if you have $ 10k perhaps you 'll buckle down and work much longer or save much more so i think what you are looking for is an assurance that if you budget to save x% of your salary over n years and you get an after inflation after tax return of y% pa you will eventually be able to retire on an income equivalent to of your working income   it 's pretty easy to calculate that through a future value formula    for instance one set of values that works is saving 20 of income 5 real return 30 years = final income of 66 of working income   or save half your income and within 14 years you can retire and keep spending the amount you were previously spending   resist the temptation to crank up the assumed return until you get the value you want i think it would be great hubris to try to make this very precise   yes probably you will get raises of course there are taxes to take into account probably higher while you 're saving inflation and returns will vary from year to year et   you can guess at them   but they 'll change and there are bigger things that are unpredictable your personal life your health the economic future of your career or industry   i reckon this simple formula is about as good as you will get

you almost never want to repay a student loan early as you 've realised you can put the money in an isa instead and earn more interest than you 're paying on the loan if you withdrew money from the isa each month to replace the repayments being taken from your salary there 'd be money left in the isa when you finished repaying the loan this is also the cheapest debt you 'll ever have so if you repay it now and then end up borrowing money elsewhere in the future you 'll probably be worse off in particular if you expect to have a mortgage at some point you 'll probably be better off keeping the money to add to a deposit rather than repaying it now and then borrowing more on the mortgage you should also consider how long it 'll take you to repay the loan normally if you do n't expect to finish repaying within 25 years you 'd be throwing money away by repaying early this is more of an issue for the larger loans

investing in gold without having physical gold is not really a hedge against inflation gld is really more for speculation not protection against serious inflation if there is any kind of inflation worth really protecting yourself against then one thing you will notice at its onset is a divergence in the price of physical and gld with gld offering very little protection if any against inflation ultimately holders of gld will demand physical metal and the physical price will rise and the paper price will fall i would advise you to study physical gold before you purchase gld for that reason edit just adding this to my answer i do n't know why i did n't put it in before and i to add that i 'm not an expert though a little investigation will show you that this is at least one option for owning gold if you think of having the physical gold yourself at one end of the spectrum and buying gld at the other so that you do n't need to take physical delivery there is another scenario which i understand is in between and sorry i do n't actually know what it 's referred to as but it 's where you buy the physical gold but instead of taking delivery the bars are stored for you in a vault these bars are numbered and you actually own what you have paid for and theoretically you could go and visit your gold and actually remove it because it 's your gold as opposed to having paper gld which in my understanding is a right to take physical delivery of gold and this is slightly different of course unlike gld you actually have to pay a storage fee and of course unlike having the physical gold buried in your garden or something you are not entirely secure against say a robbery of the vault and you are also depending on the company not to sell the same bar to more than one person but that 's the only think that their reputation is built on and a company like that would live or die by the reputation and of course you might lose the proverbial gold buried in the garden either so nothing 's 100 secure anyway really

if you 're absolutely certain that you wo n't buy a house within a year or so i 'd still be tempted to put some of the money into short term cds ie a max of 12 months i think that at the moment cds are a bit of a mug 's game though because you 'd hardly find one that offers better interest rates than some of the few savings accounts that still offer interest a savings account is probably where i 'd put the money unless i could find a really good deal on a cd but i think you might have to check if they 've got withdrawal limits there are a couple of savings accounts out there that pay at least 1 yes i know it 's pitiful so i 'd seek out one or two of those from memory both sallie mae and amex offer those and i 'm sure there are a couple more it 's not great that your money is growing at less than inflation but if you 're saving for something like a downpayment on a house i would think that nominal capital preservation is probably more important than the potential for a higher return with the associated higher risk

your definition of outside your country might need some as there are three different things going on here your financial adviser appears to be highlighting the currency risk associated with point three however consider these risk scenarios a your country enters a period of severe financial difficulty and money markets shut down your brokerage becomes insolvent and your investments are lost in this scenario the fact of whether your investments were in an overseas index such as the s&p or were purchased from an account denominated in a different currency would be irrelevant the only thing that would have mitigated this scenario is an account with an overseas broker b your country 's stock market enters a sustained and deep bear market the value of shares in its companies in this scenario the fact of whether your investments were made in from a brokerage overseas or were purchased from an account denominated in a different currency would be irrelevant the only thing that would have mitigate this scenario is investment in shares and indices outside your home country your adviser has a good point as long as you intend to enjoy your retirement in your home country then it might be advisable to remove currency risk by holding an account in rupees however you might like to consider reducing the other forms of risk by holding non indian securities to create a globally diversified portfolio and also placing some of your capital in an account with a broker outside your home country this may be very difficult to do in practice

the fundamental flaw here is conflating net worth with utility at least failing to recognize that there 's a nonlinear relationship between the two   in the extreme example imagine taking a bet that will either make you twice as rich or completely broke your expected return is zero but it would be pretty dumb to take it since being flat broke could ruin your life while being twice as rich may only improve it marginally in more realistic cases most of your income is tied up in fixed costs which magnifies relatively small to your net worth losing something essential like your house or car even if it 's only 20 of your net worth renders you effectively broke until you scrape together enough cash to get another one that situation robs you of much more utility than you 'd gain from a 20 increase in net worth in either case avoiding the risk is completely rational as long as you believe in nonlinear utility as a function of net worth it 's not just an issue of humans being risk averse

if you made a contribution to a traditional ira for year x whether made during year x or made in year x+1 before the due date of your tax return for year x then you can withdraw the contribution and any gains on that contribution   by the due date of your tax return if the contribution was deductible then of course you must not take a deduction for it in on your tax return for year x or any other year for that matter as for the gains if any that were withdrawn they are taxable income to you for year x not x+1 even if the withdrawal occurred in year x+1 publication says you generally can make a tax free withdrawal of contributions if you do it before the due date for filing your tax return for the year in which you made them this means that even if you are under age 59 1/2 the 10 additional tax may not apply and later in the same publication if you have an extension of time to file your return you can withdraw them tax free by the extended due date you can do this if for each contribution you withdraw both of the following conditions apply      you did not take a deduction for the contribution    you withdraw any interest or other income earned on the contribution you can take into account any loss on the contribution while it was in the ira when calculating the amount that must be withdrawn     if there was a loss the net income earned on the contribution may be a negative amount later the document says you must include in income any earnings on the contributions you withdraw include the earnings in income for the year in which you made the contributions not the year in which you withdraw them and the 10 additional tax on distributions made before you reach age 59 1/2 does not apply to these tax free withdrawals of your contributions however the distribution of interest or other income must be reported on form 5329 and unless the distribution qualifies as an exception to the age 59 1/2 rule it will be subject to this tax since you have a loss on the contributions that you are withdrawing there is no interest or other income that needs to be reported

can i give the bank the $ 300,000 to clear the mortgage or must i pay off the total interest that was agreed upon for the 30 year term this depends on the loan agreement   i had one loan where i was on the hook regardless   early payment was just that early payment   it would have allowed me to skip months without making payments because i had already made them    most loans charge interest on the remaining balance if you pay early it reduces your balance decreasing the interest   if you pay it off early there 's no more balance and no more interest    i 'm curious why the bank would let you do this since they will lose out on a lot of profit but they have their money back and can loan it out again   if they maintained the loan they are n't guaranteed of getting their money    interest is rent that you pay for the loan of the money   once you return the money why pay more rent   while some apartment leases require paying through the entire term most allow for early termination with proper notice   you give back the apartment the landlord rents it out again   why should they get paid two rents    another issue is that if someone with a mortgage switches jobs to a new location that person will likely prefer to sell the current house and buy one in the new location   this is actually the typical way for a mortgage to end   if the bank did not allow that they would essentially force the family to rent out the mortgaged house and rent a new house   so the bank would go from an owner occupied house that the inhabitants want to keep maintained to a rental where the inhabitants only care to the extent of their legal liability    consider the possibility that the homeowners lose one of their jobs   they ca n't afford the house   so they sell it and close out the mortgage   should the bank refuse to allow the sale and attempt to recover the interest from the impoverished homeowners   that situation would almost guarantee an expensive foreclosure    once there is any early termination clause for any reason it makes sense for the bank to structure the loan to include the possibility   that way they do n't have to investigate whatever excuse is involved   loan regulators may require this as well particularly on mortgages

the assumption that house value appreciates 5 per year is unrealistic over the very long term real house prices has stayed approximately constant a house that is 10 years old today is 11 years old a year after so this phenomenon of real house prices staying constant applies only to the market as a whole and not to an individual house unless the individual house is maintained well one house is an extremely poorly diversified investment what if the house you buy turns out to have a mold problem you can lose your investment almost overnight in contrast to this it is extremely unlikely that the same could happen on a well diversified stock portfolio although it can happen on an individual stock thus if non leveraged stock portfolio has a nominal return of 8 over the long term i would demand higher return say 10 from a non leveraged investment to an individual house because of the greater risks if you have the ability to diversify your real estate investments a portfolio of diversified real estate investments is safer than a diversified stock portfolio so i would demand a nominal return of 6 over the long term from such a diversified portfolio to decide if it 's better to buy a house or to live in rental property you need to gather all of the costs of both options including the opportunity cost of the capital which you could otherwise invest elsewhere the real return of buying a house instead of renting it comes from the fact that you do not need to pay rent not from the fact that house prices tend to appreciate which they wo n't do more than inflation over a very long term for my case i live in finland in a special case of near rental property where you pay 15 of the building cost when moving in and get the 15 payment back when moving out and then pay a monthly rent that is lower than the market rent the property is subsidized by government provided loans i have calculated that for my case living in this property makes more sense than purchasing a market priced house but your situation may be different

quick pay off the student loans you have 140 k in savings with a combined salary of you are looking to make money with the 140 k so just pay off the loans it will turn your monthly loan payments in to a stream of money that can be used to save money for the next house   assume the rest of the 700 k needed for a 1.5 million dollar house has to come from savings and the profit from selling the first house if the house sells for loan balance + 300 k you still need 400 k in savings   turning 140 k into 400 k in 5 years will funneling a large amount of your income into savings or excellent returns of course there is no way to predict return or what will happen to the market if you do n't sell the first home you can rent the house you either hope that the rental you charge allows you a positive cash flow or you hope that the house appreciates in value so you hold on to it even if the rental income is a little below break even of course some keep the house because they ca n't sell it in your case the equity might be more important for you to purchase the next house

the article states their reasons pretty clearly and indicates that some people wo n't qualify under the new requirements that would have previously they 're not people with bad credit they 're just looking beyond credit score at other factors they are n't opening for anyone with a pulse to get a car loan just shifting things a bit to cast a slightly wider net this is not new in the world of secured debt the fha has methodology for establishing a non traditional credit report based on things like rental history utility payments auto insurance payments a person ca n't be declined an fha loan for lack for lack of traditional credit history i look beyond credit score as a landlord a tenant with poor credit but a stellar rental history is more appealing than someone with great credit but a bad rental history vehicles and housing are very important to people so they are likely to prioritize them above credit card payments or hospital bills time will tell but it seems like a solid move in my view they can refine their model over time and likely find a solid customer base among those who would n't qualify on credit score alone

there is also the very simple fact that cash is a significantly self limiting thing you are limited in amount you can spend on any give day to the cash you have on hand this along makes you either to spend it forces you to spread your purchases or forgo one in order to enable another and/or requires additional planning to spend larger amounts   conversely most debit amp credit cards while they also have some limits on them enable far more free spending   so whether the spending of cash is a negative painful reaction or really just an awareness that their available resource is being reduced would be a better question   after all similar things are seen in other things that have short term physical limits smokers tend to smoke cigarettes more quickly at the beginning of a new pack and tend to space out the intervals between them as the pack likewise with other resources food beer soda within a home if when the supply is abundant we tend to amp snack as the available supply decreases we cut back

that would deprive me of the rental income from the property yes but you 'd gain by not paying the interest on your other mortgage   so your net loss or gain is the rental income minus the interest you 're paying on your home   from a cash flow perspective you 'd gain the difference between the rental income and your total payment any excess proceeds from selling the flat and paying off the mortgage could be saved and use later to buy another rental for retirement income   or just invest in a retirement account and leave it alone   selling the flat also gets rid of any extra time spent managing the property if you keep the flat you 'll need a mortgage of 105 k to 150 k plus closing costs depending on the cost of the house you buy so your mortgage payment will increase by my fist choice would be to sell the flat and buy your new house debt free or with a very small mortgage   you 're only making 6 on it and your mortgage payment is going to be higher since you 'll need to borrow about 160k if you want to keep the flat and buy a $ 450 k house so you 're no longer cash flow neutral then start saving like mad for a different rental property or in non real estate retirement investments

short answer liquidity well you have to see it from an exchange 's point of view   every contract they put up is a liability to them   you have to allocate resources for the order book the matching engine the clearing etc   but only if the contract is actually trading they start earning the big money now for every new expiry they engage a long term commitment and it might take years for an option chain to be widely accepted and hence before they 're profitable   compare the volumes and open interests of big chains versus the weeklies and you 'll find that weeklies can still be considered illiquid compared to their monthly cousins having said that like many things this is just a question of demand   if there 's a strong urge to trade july weeklies one day there will be an option chain   but personally i think as long as there are the summer there will be no rush to ask for jul and aug chains

retirement calculation in general should be based on the amount of money needed per year month and the expected life expectancy life expectancy if calculated to 90 years let 's say indicates that post retirement age 60 yrs your accumulated invested money should generate adequate income to cover your expenses till 90 years the problem in general is not how long you shall live but what would be your expected spending from retirement to end of life expectancy the idea is at the minimum your investments should generate income that is inflation adjusted one way to do this is to consider your monthly expense now i.e. the expense that is absolute minimum for carrying on food electricity water medicines household consumables car petrol insurance servicing entertainment newspaper etc this does not contain the liabilities home loan child 's education other debts it is better to take this amount per family rather than per person and yearly rather than monthly as we tend to miss a lot of yearly expenses this amount that you need today will increase at a compounded annual growth rate cagr of the average inflation for example if today you spend 100 per year in 7 years you will need to spend 200 at 10 inflation now your investments will not increase post your retirement so your current investment needs to do two things 1 give you your yearly requirement 2 grow by a fixed amount so that next year it can give you cagr adjusted returns in general this kind of investment grows by high net amounts initially and slowly the growth decrease the above can be calculated by net present value npv formulae the key is to remember that the money that is invested when you retire should be able to give you inflation adjusted returns to cover your yearly expenses how much money you need depends on your life style expectation and how much return is received depends on the instruments that you invest on as for your question above on the difference between the age of you and your spouse it better to go with the consolidated family requirement and get an idea of how much investment is necessary and provision the same as soon as possible from your as well as your spouse 's income hope this thanks

how long will that transition take and why did you get into construction   i ask because i 'm curious about how geography the number of jobs in your area in that particular field your perception of job options why you chose that occupation at the time and how long you expect your transition from one job to another to take those things factor into other arguments going on about this article and i 'm curious how that information relates to myself and others   you mentioned cc debt as building the trade deficit and that is n't entirely true at least from what i 've read about the deficit the deficit is a symptom outcome of some of which you know but the decisions businesses make to outsource does n't just add to that but builds a skill deficit manufacturing is a good example of businesses outsourced and that skill seeing less and less entry level work due to it which inhibits choice of income   as for wages a lot of countries have minimum wage laws but to suggest one or another is disastrous for an entire country ignores a variety of economic factors that lead to a crap economy

i agree with the dave ramsey method as well if you do n't have $ 1k in the bank already do that   total up the smaller debts and the best buy card   if they are $ 4k all together then pay them off   do n't get caught up in keeping the smaller one around because they are at zero percent   if they exceed $ 4k then payoff the interest bomb best buy card then pay off the smaller ones starting with the smaller balance   that is the only tweak i will make here   dropping any amount into the citi balance is pointless because it only reduces the amount not the total number of hands reaching into your bank account

from the description you have a income contingent loan the interest rate on those is currently 1.5 but it has varied quite a bit in the last few years due to the formula used to calculate it which is either the inflation rate or 1 + the highest base rate across a group of banks whichever is smaller this is indeed really cheap credit compared to any commercial loan you could get though whether you should indeed just repay the minimum depends on making a proper comparison with the return on any spare money you could get after tax elsewhere there is a table of previous interest rates from your description i think you 've had the loan for about 4 years your final year of uni one year of working without repayments and then two years of repayments a very rough estimate is that you would have been charged about £ 300 of interest over that period so there 's still an apparent mismatch though since both you and i made rough calculations it may be that a more precise check resolves it but the other thing is that you should check what the date on the statement is once you start repaying statements are sent for a period ending 5th april of each year so you may well not be seeing the effect of several months of repayments since april on the statement finally there 's apparently an online facility you can use to get an up to date balance though the administration of the loans repaid via paye is notoriously inefficient so there may well be a significant lag between a payment being made and it being reflected in your balance though the effect should still be to when you actually made it

several people here have highlighted the incentive agency problems that tend to naturally arise when mortgages however the market for mortgage backed securities has existed for decades and during most of that time these agency problems were held in check moreover academics knew about this problem even before the credit crisis and actually recommended the use of in order to avoid the moral hazard problems associated with securitization see 2005   so to give a compelling historical explanation for why the crisis happened when it did you need to explain what changed in the mortgage securitization market to enable these previously agency relationships to breakdown   so what changed in short the growth of the market for cdos collateralized debt obligations composed of mortgage backed securities and not the mbs market itself this market grew so rapidly in the because the ratings agencies created an opportunity for banks to take low rated mbs debt and give it a higher rating by merely it into a cdo it was ratings arbitrage through and through explanations that place the brunt of the blame on the i.e. fannie and freddie can not adequately explain why the majority of mortgage related losses during the credit crisis were concentrated in cdos of mbss and not in the vanilla mbs market   here 's what happened back in the day say pre early 2000s the agency incentive problems that naturally arise in mortgage securitization were held in check by careful institutional investors who would rigorously assess the default risk of the higher risk mbs tranches they had a deep knowledge of the mortgage business sometimes they would even go so far as manually examining the loan documentation the profile of the borrowers the quality of the collateral and so on there were a lot of buyers who were happy to purchase the aaa and aa tranches but they could afford to be because the banks who were mbss knew that without selling to the discriminating buyers of higher risk debt they would n't be able to break even    it worked a bit like a market for fine wines i do n't know much about wine but when i walk into a shop that sells fine wines i can be reasonably certain that there will be a reasonably strong relationship between price and the quality of the wine basically i get to free ride off the superior discrimination of the wine who regularly visit the shop   once the ratings agencies created the now infamous ratings arbitrage between the mbs and cdo markets the market for cdos on mbss expanded as this market grew these discriminating buyers became a proportionally smaller part of the mbs market the folks building cdos of mbss did n't know very much about the mortgage business itself instead they tended to rely on statistical default models provided by the ratings agencies that predicted the probability of mortgage default based on quantitative variables such as borrowers credit scores loan to value ratios etc    the problem is that these models used historical data that was collected back when the discriminating institutional investors kept the agency problems in the mbs market in check the growth of the cdo market spurred even more mortgage securitization which led lending standards to deteriorate because firms like countrywide knew that the cdo buyers only cared about credit scores ltv ratios etc however buyers of mbs were unable to detect these changes in default risk because the models they were using to see those changes were becoming invalidated by the growth of the cdo market itself   if you want to read more about this i 'd highly recommend 's 2011 paper in the american journal of sociology see here it 's a detailed historical account of the changes in valuation practices models used within the mbs and cdo markets and how these practices became invalidated as the cdo market grew in size   tl;dr the credit ratings created a ratings arbitrage that the banks took advantage of they are as much if not more at fault as the   for more info on the deterioration in mortgage quality in the check out    keys benjamin and 2008 did securitization lead to lax screening evidence from subprime loans   and 2008 the failure of models that predict failure distance incentives and defaults december   also the citation i mentioned above   p. 2005 the pooling and of securities a model of informed review of economic studies 35 2005

assuming these are standardized and regulated contracts the short answer is yes   in your example trader a is short while trader b is long   if trader b wants to exit his long position he merely enters a sell to close order with his broker trader b never goes short as you state   he was long while he held the contract then he sold to close as to who finds the buyer of trader b 's contract i believe that would be the exchange or a market maker   therefore trader c ends up the counterparty to trader a 's short position after buying from trader b.   assuming the contract is held until expiration trader a is responsible for delivering contracted product to trader c for contracted price   in reality this is generally settled up in cash and trader a and trader c never even know each other 's identity

gt;well put and honestly seemingly unavoidable   yes there is an aspect of it that i think is the equivalent to ocean there are winds and waves of fortune which are often mistaken as entirely due to merit when in fact the merit may have been only a minor factor   gt;as i see it re is a crap investment for the foreseeable future as oversupply and are not absorbed people have to live so rentals will be key but they have already quite a bit    i 'd agree   i 've looked into and decided to pass on the whole buy up a bunch of homes amp rent them out line   there was definitely an opportunity with foreclosure distressed sale properties in the area but after and seeking advice from several experienced landlords i have concluded that it is not the risk free passive income mechanism that a lot of think it is and there is substantial risk effort involved both in the form of capital investment repairs maintenance requiring both time amp money as well as the probability of an interrupted revenue steam bad renters are difficult expensive to deal with as well as other costs significantly increased property taxes especially on rentals etc   the truly big gains to my understanding anyway of being a landlord are the windfall cash out phase where having had renters paying the mortgage interest you get the benefit of the capital gain on the sale of the property but due to what i think and sincerely believe based on the of boomer die off i am fairly certain that said payoff will not be anywhere near as large in the coming decades as it has been in the past if the payoff even exists at all and is n't a net loss especially in light of the work effort investment involved   will likely trade sideways for awhile before likely tanking as the forced willing withdrawals start happening from the boomers so keeping it in stocks does n't sound overly positive unless a fairly aggressive put strategy is enforced    depends on what you mean by stocks the overall market is one thing specific stocks can be quite a different story while it is an extreme example note the dramatic difference between aapl vs the dow during the past = = = = nasdaq etc   basically the whole idea of passive mindless set it and forget it gains from investments being the path to wealth has to go bye bye it was never really real to begin with unless you timed the market just right and the vast majority of the gains were nominal anyway   gt;for me personally and selfishly i have 20 years minimum for retirement so i 'm fine the market trending sideways or down it means that i 'm getting more bang for my dca buck and 20 + years from now i will be well positioned when the market eventually cycles back up    i guess i take the long term historical view that the very concept of some guaranteed retirement was simply an a lucky generation or two got away with it by accident in the timing of their birth something they really had no input into   instead i think one will always need to be working in some manner or another actively overseeing ones investments and remaining agile in response   and of course there is risk involved in that as if there is really any reason we should expect there not to be anyone who thinks that way imo is simply ignorant of the vast scope of human history   the best i think one can do is to truly diversify and that does not mean mutual funds to separate your eggs into various baskets holding some major part in solid as solid as can be form even with the possibility of zero return and/or some loss i.e. owning primary housing clear of debt some pm 's in physical form etc having other assets in what are fairly solid bets based on demographic trends company quality etc and then some things several small bets that are long shots but potentially high return things where just one win can not only offset a dozen non performers losers but gain you a substantial real profit   basically i think one has to use their mind and available information which must be actively sought out and seriously analyzed considered and then even with all of that realize that there is a certain crap shoot aspect to everything and that big winners are just as often either scam artists who often get their think enron or who are just lucky shits who were in the right place at the right time were dealt the right cards and subsequently made the right bets due to wiki and other biases we just do n't often hear about the ones who hit 4 out of 5 of those things and who might have still been winners but just not large prominent enough to gain fame amp recognition much less the 3 out of 5 whose gains were minimal or a wash

the problem with rate of return calculation on short positions is that the commonly used approach assumes an initial investment creating a cash outflow if we want to apply this approach to short selling we should look at the trade from another perspective we buy money and pay for this money with stock our investment to buy 50 $ in your example is 1 share   when closing the short position we effectively sell back our money 50 $ and receive 2 shares our profit on this position is obviously 1 share setting this in relation to our investment of 1 share yields a performance of 100    in reality we do not sell back the entire cash but only the amount needed to get back our investment of 1 share this is actually comparable to a purchase of stock which we only partially close to get back our invested cash amount and keep the remaining shares as our profit

in a perfect market share prices are by definition a perfect reflection of the true value of a share hence you always get $ 10 for a share that 's worth that much in reality the market is imperfect prices are somewhat of an average of all different estimates and there 's a cost of trading margin between sales and buy prices hence in a perfect market it does n't matter whether you have a stop loss order at $ 9.00 that just trades your stock worth $ 9 for cash worth the same $ 9 in an imperfect market that trade nets you less furthermore is risk a linear function of money perhaps not if you bought on margin need to lend extra and your interest rate increases with the extra credit demand

first of all a person that relies on their ability to tap a line of credit to cover an emergency is n't generally the kind of person that has investments they can cash out to cover the debt that being said my personal reasons for having a liquid emergency fund revolve around bank errors and identify theft i used to work for a company that made bank software errors are a common occurrence you 'd be surprised how many transactions are still input by human hands despite our computerized world all it takes is one typo to wipe out your ability to swipe plastic for a few days this has actually happened to me my utility company sent me a bill for $ 240 and wound up taking $ 2400 by accident overdrawing my account and sending me into a fee spiral they fixed their mistake several days later the snowball of fees from other transactions that bounced took another two months to correct in the meantime i also had my mortgage payment due in the us you ca n't pay your mortgage with credit and for those who rent many landlords wo n't let you pay with credit either i have also seen this scenario play out twice with other people i 've known who 've had their id stolen yes the bank will cover the fraud after a lengthy process but the disruption causes fees and overdrafts to quickly snowball out of control i have a separate savings account at a different bank for this kind of thing and i have a few hundred dollars cash in my house at all times having a liquid emergency fund allows you to quickly stabilize the situation and gives you walking around money for those times where the banking system becomes your enemy for a time

all the other answers posted thus far discuss matters from the perspective of us tax laws and are unanimous in declaring that what the op wants to do is indeed a very bad idea i fully agree it is a bad idea from the perspective of us tax laws and is likely a bad idea from the perspective of indian tax laws too but what the op wants to do is   or used to be common practice in india in more recent times india has created a permanent account number pan number for each taxpayer for income tax purposes and each bank account or investment must have the owner 's or first named owner 's in case of a joint account pan number associated with it   this most likely has decreased the popularity of such arrangements or has led to new being used the op has not indicated the residence and citizenship of his family or his own status for that matter but if they are all indian citizens resident in india and are then there might be one mechanism for doing what the op wants to do apply for a pan number in the name of the hindu undivided family and use this number to carry out the investments in the name of the hindu undivided family   there presumably are similar statuses for undivided families for other religions but i am not familiar with them there are lots of matters here which are more legal questions than personal finance questions e.g. if the op is a us tax resident then the family presumably will not be able to claim hindu undivided family status since the op has been divided from the family for tax purposes or so i think even if status is available the op might not be able to act as the while his father is alive and so on   consultation with tax lawyers not just chartered accountants in india is certainly advisable

you have a few options none of which are trade off free apply for a credit card and live off of that    here of course you will go into debt and there are minimums to pay   but it will tide you over   in any case you are getting unsecured credit so your rates will probably be very very high   you do n't want to build up a lot of 20 per annum debt an alternative to this would be to go to any bank and ask for an unsecured loan   having no income it will be difficult though not necessarily impossible to secure some funds   when i was in between houses once for example i was able to borrow $ 30,000 in unsecured debt to help me construct my new house just based on my income   grant you i paid it 2 months later in order to avoid the 10 year interest but the point is that unsecured debt does exist   credit cards are easier to get   arrange for personal financing through your parents or other relatives if your parents can send you remittances the terms will most likely be more generous   they know your credit and your true ability to repay   just because they send you money does n't mean you have to live with them   as a parent i have a stake in ensuring my children 's success   if i think that them over briefly is in their best interest and mine you better be sure i 'll do it a variation on this is something like kiva   here if you can write up a story compelling enough to get finance there are people who might lend you money   kiva is normally directed towards poorer countries and but local variations exist update google backed is far more appropriate to this situation than kiva   same general idea but that 's the vendor find freelance contract or light employment your concern about employment is justified you do n't want to be in a position where you are unable to travel to an interview because starbucks or mcdonalds will fire you if you do n't show up for a shift   then again do you really care if mcdonald 's lets you go   as such you need to find income that is less bound by schedule   freelance work in particular will give you that freedom assuming you have a skill you can trade   likewise short term contract work is equally flexible usually   finally it may be easiest just to get temporary pickup work in a service capacity   in any event doing something will be better than doing nothing   who knows you might want to be a manager owner of a mcdonalds some day   would n't hurt to say i started at the bottom

if your returns match the market that means their rate of return is the same as the market in question if your returns beat the market that means their rate of return is higher there 's no one market mind you i invest in mutual funds that track the s&p500 which is very roughly the u.s. stock market that track the canadian stock market that track the international stock market and which track the canadian bond market in general you should be deeply dubious of any advertised investment option that promises to beat the market it 's certainly possible to do so if you buy a single stock for example that stock may go up by 40 over the course of a year while the market may go up by 5 however you are likely taking on substantially more risk so there 's a very good chance likely a greater chance that the investment would go down losing you money

i think this question is very nearly off topic for this site but i also believe that a basic understanding of the why the tax structure is what it is can help someone new to investing to understand their actual tax liability the attempt at an answer i provide below is from a canadian us context but should be similar to how this is viewed elsewhere in the world first note that capital gains today are much more fluid in concept than even 100 years ago when the personal income tax was first introduced to pay for wwi a capital gain was viewed as a very deliberate action the permanent sale of property capital gains were not taxed at all initially in canada until 1971 under the view that income taxes would have been paid on income earning assets all along through interest dividends and rent and therefore taxing capital gains would be a form of double taxation this active permanent sale was also viewed as an action that an investor would need to work for therefore it was seen as foolish to prevent investors from taking positive economic action redistributing their capital in the most effective way simply to avoid the tax however today because of favourable taxation on capital gains many financial products attempt to package and sell capital gains to investors for example many canadian mutual funds buy and sell investments to earn capital gains and distribute those capital gains to the owners of the mutual fund this is no longer an active action taken by the investor it is simply a function of passive investing the line between what is a dividend and what is a capital gain has been blurred by these and similar advanced financial products to the casual investor there is no practical difference between receiving dividends or capital gain distributions except for the tax impact the notional gain realized on the sale of property includes inflation consider a rental property bought in 1930 for $ 100,000 and sold in 1960 for $ 180,000 assuming inflation between 1930 and 1960 was 70 in 1960 dollars the property was effectively bought for this means the true gain after accounting for inflation is only $ 10k but the notional gain is $ 80k meaning a tax on that capital gain would be almost entirely a tax on inflation this is viewed by many as being unfair as it does not actually represent true income i will pause to note that any tax on any investment at all taxes inflation interest for example is taxed in full even though it can be almost entirely inflationary depending on economic conditions a tax on capital gains may restrict market liquidity a key difference between capital gains and interest rent dividends is that other forms of investment income are taxed annually if you hold a bond you get taxed on interest from that bond you can not gain value from a bond deferring tax until the date it matures at least in canada you are deemed to accrue bond interest annually even if it is a 0 coupon bond   however what if interest rates have gone down increasing the value of your bond and you want to sell it to invest in a business you may choose not to do this to avoid tax on that capital gain if it were taxed as much as regular income you might be even more inclined to never sell any asset until you absolutely have to thus restricting the flow of capital in the market i will pause here again to note that laws could be enacted to minimize capital gains tax as long as the money is reinvested immediately thus reducing this impact   political inertia lobbying from key interests has a significant impact on the tax structure for investments the fact remains that the capital gains tax is most significantly an impact on those with accrued wealth it would take significant public support to increase capital gain tax rates for any political party to enact such laws when you get right down to it tax laws are complex and hard to push in the public eye the general public barely understands that their effective tax rate is far lower than their top marginal tax rate any tax increases at all are often viewed negatively even by those who would never personally pay any of that tax due to lack of investment income therefore such changes are typically made quietly and with some level of bi partisan support if you feel the capital gains tax rules are illogical just add it to the pile of such tax laws that exist today

these are the things to focus on do not put yourself in debt with a car there are other better solutions   1 get a credit card unless you already have one this and get the best cash back or points card you can get at the best rate   start with buying gas and groceries every month do not run the balance up pay the card off every single month this is important never carry a balance above 25 of your credit limit   every 8 months or so call your credit card company and ask for a credit line increase they should be able to do this without pulling your credit you are only looking for the automatic increment that they can automatically approve this will help increase your available credit and will help keep your credit utilization low only do this is you are successfully doing the other bullet points above   2 pay all of your bills on time this includes everything from water electricity phone bill etc never be late setup automatic payments if you can   3 minimize the number of hard credit inquiries is particularly important when you are looking for your mortgage lender do not let them pull your credit automatically you should be able to provide them your credit score and other information and get quotes from those lenders do not let them tell you then ca n't do this they can   plan when you close a credit line closing them will do two things lower your credit limit often times increasing your credit utilization and it may hurt your average age of credit open one credit card and keep it forever   note credit karma is a great tool you should check your score monthly and see how your efforts are influencing your score i also like citi credit cards because they will provide you monthly with your fico score which credit karma will only provide transunion and equifax   this is educational information and you should consider talking to a banker lender who can also give you more detailed instructions on how to get your credit improved so that they can approve you for a loan   many people can get their score above 720 in 1 2 years time going from no credit doing the steps described above it does take time be patient and do n't fall for gimmicks

yes bond funds are marked to market so they will decline as the composition of their holdings will households actually have relative levels of credit to equity holdings   the reason why is because there is little return on credit making it irrational to hold any amount greater than to fund future liquidity needs risk adjusted and time discounted the vast majority of credit is held by insurance companies   pension funds have large stakes as well   banks hold even fewer bonds since they try to sell them as soon as they 've made them insurance companies are forced to hold a large percentage of their floats in credit then preferred equity   while this their returns it 's not a large problem for them because they typically hold bonds until maturity   only the ones who the risk of insurance will have to sell at unfavorable prices being able to predict interest rates thus bond prices accurately would make one the best bond manager in the world   while it does look like inflation will rise again soon just as it has during every other us expansion can it be assured when commodity prices are high in real terms and look like they may be in a collapse   the banking industry would have to produce credit at a much higher rate to counter the deflation of all physical goods households typically shun assets at low prices to pursue others at high prices so their holdings of bonds etfs should be expected to decline during a bond collapse   if insurance companies find it less costly to hold etfs then they will contribute to an increase in bond etf supply

gt so i asked this question in /r and got some interesting answers mostly about how banks exist to make money out of nowhere and to fool people what do y all have to say   that is n't what they said nobody mentioned fooling people from what i can see from a cursory glance and if they did they 're being facetious   also they did n't mean make money from thin air in the sense of it being a magical trick they make money from a sort of market inefficiency they broker between people who want to invest money and those who want to borrow it   the top two answers are about right a bank borrows money from investors who deposit money in checking and savings accounts and lends it to borrowers in the form of loans or mortgages the difference between the interest rates is their profit   you deposit $ 1000 with me at 2 for 20 years i give you $ at the end of that term where did i get the extra five hundred books well i lent it out in mortgages over the same terms at 6 and received $ over the same period of time your $ 1000 made you $ and made me $ which i keep for the purposes of providing you with atms dealing with bad debts and staffing the place simple eh   of course they also provide other services in addition to this and the way in which they do it is regulated but that 's all a bank is at its core   a central bank is slightly different they issue money i.e. print it and supply it at a headline interest rate to the commercial banks and of course banks borrow amongst themselves but then we get ourselves down the rabbit hole of grown up economics and libor and the like there are whole textbooks used to explain exactly how that mechanism works and what 's going on there   but if you want to get rich find a way to start a bank seriously doing it to the old school way is seriously profitable if you can be trusted

nothing is guaranteed candlesticks are not crystal balls nor is any part of technical analysis candlestick patterns used correctly and in combination with other western technical indicators can increase the probability of a trade going into the derived direction but they are not a guarantee which is why you should always use stop losses with your candlestick or any trading in saying that another candlestick pattern that can provide high probability trades is the doji or a combination of in a row at a market extreme note that both patterns and work best at price extremes highs and lows and in combination with other technical indicators such as an overbought momentum indicator at a market high or an oversold momentum indicator at a market low edit an example here is a sample trade i placed on the 17th october and am currently in profit on see the chart below as it shows taking the trade on the open of the following day after a bullish pattern appeared at the bottom of a downtrend on the 16th in combination with the slow stochastic crossing over in the oversold region below 20 i would consider this a high probability trade and have placed an initial stop loss at 10 below my open price in case the trade went against me as the price moved up i moved the 10 stop loss up as a trailing stop loss my profit target is set at 25 or $ 4.00

in the us there 's no significant difference between what a business can deduct and what an individual can deduct however you can only deduct what is an expense to produce income businesses are allowed to write off salaries but individuals ca n't    write off what they pay their or maid at least in the us if you 're a sole proprietor in the business of managing properties you can definitely deduct payments to gardeners or maids business paying for a on a private property not related to producing the income like ceo 's daughter 's house can not deduct that expense for tax purposes although it is still recorded in the business accounting books as an expense with no tax benefit businesses are allowed to deduct utility expenses as overhead individuals can not same thing exactly i can deduct utility expenses for my rental property but not for my primary residence food shelter clothing and medical care are fundamental human needs    but we still pay for them with after tax money and pay additional    sales tax only interest and not principal on a mortgage is    deductible in the us which is great for people who take out mortgages    and helps banks get more business i 'm sure but you 're out of luck    if you pay cash for your house or are renting sales taxes are deductible you can deduct sales taxes you paid during the year if you itemize your deduction you can chose you either deduct the sales taxes or the state income taxes whatever is more beneficial for you btw in many states food and medicine are exempt from sales tax medical expenses are deductible if they 're significant compared to your total income you can deduct medical expenses in excess of 10 of your agi with the aca kicking in i do n't see how would people even get to that if your agi is low you get subsidies for insurance and the insurance keeps your expenses capped for self employed and employed insurance premiums are pre tax i.e. not even added to your agi principle for mortgage is not deductible because it is not an expense it is equity you own an asset do n't you you do get the standard deduction even if your itemized real deductions are less business do n't get that you also get an exemption amount for your basic living needs which businesses do n't get you can argue about the amounts but it is there in some states like california renters get tax breaks for renting depending on the agi ca renters credit is phasing out at agi of about $ 60 k which is pretty high

the best cheapest and safe way is to wire transfer that money from their bank account to yours ask your bank about information regarding inbound international wire transfer and provide those details to your dad about how much amounts can he do so if the amount is more than $ 10 k you need to provide enough information about where the money is coming from sources and other legal details whatever way you chose never do transfers in small chunks which is called structuring to avoid the legal hassle as that might result in more issues and every bank has checks in place to find out this way of structuring i would suggest wire transfer all the money through proper channel through the banks it 's better to pay some fees follow the law and live peacefully than to go through some improper channels to avoid paltry fees and get into serious issues

back when they started discover undercut visa and amex fees by about a point this was also true when i worked for a mail order computer retailer in the 90s if a customer asked us which credit cards we took we were told to list discover first and amex last because discover had the lowest merchant charges possibly this is no longer true today but for quite a while it was a significant selling point of the discover card to merchants and a reason why many did sign on a reason some stores did not sign on was that discover was owned by sears and many businesses that competed with sears did n't like the idea of sending any of their profits to the competition today discover also owns diners club and the fees for those cards are higher

i 'll chime in and say that my wife and i thought this was a really dumb idea until we tried it i was keeping track of everything in my checkbook ledger but having the physical money in the envelopes really does work we thought it would be more hassle than it 's worth and there were the first month or two but in the end we both agree this is what started our movement towards responsible money management and debt reduction we have the following categories   obviously ymmv but the point is to take any categories in your budget that are hard to budget for as they vary from month to month and just set aside an amount form your paycheck in cash for each one of those categories in an envelope   what i 've noticed is that by putting the money aside up front it 's much easier to stick to the budget we 'll often shuffle money around in the envelopes if priorities change for a particular month as well so rather than taking money away from an extra payment on a debt or our planned savings transfer which would have been our default action pre envelopes we can just move $ xx from date night into groceries if we have to hence planning out how we 'll spend our money budgeting has gotten a lot easier since adopting this system

depends on how you value your time   these programs do not say they will get you the lowest basement price they say you get a reasonable price without negotiation   this is true use a service   pick out the car you want and spend less than an afternoon picking up your vehicle   you do n't have to fret or do all of the price research or comparison shopping because that is what the service does for you since you have to pick a make and model before you begin and because you need to arrange your financing at a credit union before you being regardless of a buying service i do n't think they actually work out financially for most folks my anecdote because we were buying an already inexpensive new car the costco pre negotiated discount was just a few hundred bucks   the discount is different for each car naturally   our base model was terrific in consumer reports but the sticker price does n't leave dealerships a lot of room for profit to start with we ended up saving a couple thousand dollars by skipping the costco program and following these tips from johnfx   what are some tips for getting the upper hand in car price negotiations but we did it all over email   we emailed any dealership we could find online that was in driving distance there were literally dozens of dealerships to choose from   we made a new throw away email address and starting to ask for a lower price   whenever we got a lower price we simply asked the others to beat it   all over email   it only took a few days we know we got a low price and the stress really was n't a factor   a couple of the salespeople got a little rude but it was over the email so we did n't care or fret i had time to kill and the extra hassle and effort saved me much more money

let me make sure i understand the point of what adam smith is going on about in discussion of relative poverty he relates the idea that an individual can be considered in poverty if they do not meet the customary amount of goods considered by their society to be the minimum to be polite in public you have thus transferred his meaning of what poor means to be what is considered   basic living you have then taken this concept and tied the cost of basic living which you still have n't actually narrowed down towards the tax rate on income for a citizen of a community this is all in the context that you 're concerned with the community level of price for basic living and whether its too high however you also have n't said what too high is nor why you 're concerned with the literal price which is why i 've said you can only control the price of a good through central authority   i never made the assertion you wanted to invoke a centrally planned economy i simply stated that the only way to control prices across a community is through central authority you 've stated that we collect taxes on local state and federal levels this is true however it does not mean that they control the price they simply modify the price set by the market and only serve to increase the price from the base set by market participants    when i want to buy beer i do n't just pay for the cost of the beer i pay the cost of the beer + the city tax + county tax + state tax + state sales tax on the beer which raises the price also these taxes are not income taxes which is what was being discussed    i still do n't know what your point is because you can not seem to define phrases you 've used that i have stated i do not know if you can not define what you 're talking about how it relates to the actual discussion and why its relevant then please stop as its simply a

part of the tj 's business model though is that they are almost always placed near a larger full service store   the idea being you shop at 's first to save money and they only sell items with a higher margin which accounts for the higher wages they can pay   then if you still need a specialty item you run next door   the less choice option does n't work as well in isolation so saying everyone should sell less items and only high margin items so they can pay more would leave us with stores like trader joe 's with the same selection as trader joe 's   and a relatively undeserved market   once everyone has the same selection again they have to start competing on price which means someone will open a tj pay their people shit and sell the same things as them

wikipedia has a good summary historically branch banking in the united states especially interstate branch banking was viewed by regulatory authorities and this was codified with the enactment of the act of 1927 which specifically prohibited interstate banking over the next few decades some banks attempted to circumvent 's provisions by establishing bank holding companies that operated so called independent banks in multiple states to address this the bank holding company act of 1956 prohibited bank holding companies headquartered in one state from having branches in any other state most interstate banking prohibitions were repealed by the interstate banking and branching efficiency act of 1994 research has also found that anticompetitive state provisions restricted out of state growth when those provisions were more restrictive than the provisions set by the interstate banking and branching efficiency act or by neighboring states some states have also had restrictive bank branch laws for example illinois outlawed branches other than the main office until 1967 and did not allow an unlimited number until 1993

i do n't think 's explanation is correct   a trailing lit sell order adjusts downwards i.e. if you place the order with an price in it 's trigger price of and a trailing amount of 6.00 then assuming the ask is 100.00 will add the trailing amount to the ask price and if it 's less than the trigger price it will adjust so in my example if the market ask goes straight up to nothing will be adjusted the trigger is touched and the limit order will be placed see below if on the the other hand the market goes down to then amt + ask is if it goes further down to then the trigger price will be adjusted to because it 's less than the current trigger and so on for the lit part you have either an absolute limit price you can enter or you have an offset limit which will be subtracted from the trigger price in which case it is adjusted as well so back to my example the trigger is now and the limit offset is say 1.00 so my limit order would be placed at if the ask ever touches and that in turn is only visible if the bid touches because it 's limit if touched for a buy just use the same explanation with some swapped roles the trigger price adjust upwards when the trailing amount plus bid is larger than the current trigger and the limit offset will be added to the trigger price edit also quite succinct and worth having a look at guesswork highly subjective as for why this might be good well you have to believe in momentum strategies i.e. a market that goes down will continue to go down if you believe that and you believe in mean reversion as well then a trailing limit order can assist you in not buying selling but closer to the mean   i 've never used it that way though what i have done even just now to get the explanation right is to place trailing buy and sell orders simultaneously   you will find that you can just go in with estimates and because the adjustments will go towards each other you will end up with a narrowing band of trigger prices as opposed to trailing stop orders which will give you a widening band of trigger prices   if you believe in and then this can be one easy way to profit from it   i 've just sold eurusd for and bought it back at with a trailing amount of and a limit offset of within the time of writing this

first it is worth noting the two sided nature of the contracts long one currency short a second make leverage in currencies over a diverse set of clients generally less of a problem   in equities since most margin investors are long equities making it more likely that large margin calls will all be made at the same time also it 's worth noting that high frequency traders often highly levered make up a large portion of all volume in all liquid markets in equity markets for instance   would you call that grossly artificial   what is that volume number really telling us anyway in that case the major players holding long term positions in the fx markets are large banks non investment arm central banks and corporations and unlike equity markets which can nearly slow to a trickle currency markets need to keep trading just for many of those corporations banks to do business   this kind of depth allows these brokers to even consider offering leverage   i 'm not suggesting that it is a good idea for these brokers but the liquidity in currency markets is much deeper than their costumers

most basic tip   do n't go to the grocery store hungry what we do to minimize food waste on sunday when my wife and i go grocery shopping we figure out what meals we are going to have for dinner that week and we only buy what we need for those meals we also try to decide in advance what we are going out for dinner for example we know we have to take the in laws out for dinner on wednesday so we do n't buy a dinner for that night as part of our weekly planning we figure out the lunches we will take to work based on our dinners   for example if we plan to make a big pot of pasta for dinner one night we know we 'll have leftovers for lunch so we wo n't buy a lunch for the following day basically we try to match our food purchasing to our food consumption during the week we generally try to cook the dinner that uses the most perishable items first   if we buy seafood that will be monday night 's dinner   the frozen pizza can wait until the end of the week my wife an i both have to deal with the occasional unexpected late night at work which can mess up our cooking plans   as a result it is not uncommon for us to be too tired to cook so we skip a dinner   it is less wasteful to do that with something frozen preserved also we try to consider cooking time vs our work schedule   we do n't pick a complex dinner for a night that we know in advance will be a long work day

from what these people are saying it is impossible for you to put $ 5,500 in if it were a roth though because the money has to be taxed you are correct that this is wrong   you can still put $ 5,500 in a roth the tax payment comes when you file not when you make the investment   this is when the roth is better than a traditional ira when you can invest the max either way   yes you get the tax break for the traditional investment and if you invest the tax savings you 'll be in the same spot all else being equal if you only have a certain amount after taxes to invest say $ 3,000 in a 25 marginal tax bracket then it works out the same either way   you can either invest $ 3,000 in a roth and let it grow tax free or put $ 4,000 in a traditional ira since you can deduct $ 1,000 15 from your taxes when you file then your tax adjusted balance when you withdraw is the same since you 'll have a lot more 33 more in fact in your traditional ira but will have to pay tax on the withdrawals

a 5 funds for $ 15 k is not too many or too few a bit high as i 'd wonder if you 've thought of how you 'll rebalance the funds over time so you are n't investing too much in a particular market segment i 'd also question if you know what kinds of fees you may have with those funds as some of vanguard 's index funds had fees if the balance is under $ 10 k that may change how much you 'll be paying from vanguard 's site we charge a $ 20 annual account service fee for each vanguard fund with    a balance of less than $ 10,000 in an account this fee does n’t apply    if you sign up for account access on and choose    electronic delivery of statements confirmations and vanguard fund    reports and this fee also does n’t apply to members of    flagship ® select ® and services ® so if you do n't do the delivery this would be an extra $ that i wonder if you factored that into things here b have i diversified my portfolio too much or not enough perhaps i    am missing something that would be recommended for the portfolio of    this kind with this goal both in my opinion too much in the sense that you are looking at morningstar 's style box to pick a fund for this box and that which i 'd consider consolidating on one hand yet at the same time i notice that you are sticking purely to us stocks and ignoring international funds i do think taxes may be something you have n't considered too much as stocks will most of those funds and trigger capital gains that you do n't mention at all c if not my choice of my portfolio where would you invest $ 15 k    under similar circumstances and similar goals what is the goal here you state that this is your first cash investment but do n't state if this is for retirement a vacation in 10 years a house in 7 years or a bunch of other possibilities which is something to consider if i consider this as retirement investments i 'd like pick 1 or 2 funds known for being tax efficient that would be where i 'd start so if a fund goes down 30 that 's ok do you have a rebalancing strategy of any kind do you realize what taxes you may have even if the fund does n't necessarily have gains itself in not stating a goal i wonder how well do you have a strategy worked out for how you 'll sell off these funds down the road at some point as something to ponder

real estate potentially has two components of profit the increase in value and the ongoing returns similar to a stock appreciating and its dividends    it 's possible to buy both badly and in the case of stocks there are studies that show the typical investor lags the market by many percent   real estate is not a homogeneous asset class a $ 200 k house renting for $ 1,000 is a far different investment than a $ 100 k 3 family renting for $ 2,000 total rents both exist depending on the part of the country you are in   if you simply divide the price to the rent you get either or this is an oversimplification and of course interest rates will push these numbers in one direction or another it 's safe to say that at any given time the ratio can help determine if home prices are too high a bargain or somewhere in between   as one article suggests the median price tracks inflation pretty closely and i 'd add that median home prices would track median income long term   to circle back yes real estate can be a good investment if you buy right find good tenants and are willing to put in the time   note buying to rent and buying to live in are not always the same economic decision the home buyer will very often buy a larger house than they should and turn their own profit into a loss e.g. a buyer who would otherwise be advised to buy the $ 150 k house instead of renting is talked into a bigger house by the real estate agent the bank the spouse the extra cost of the $ 225 k house is the 1/3 more cost of repair utilities interest etc it 's identical to needing a 1000 sq ft apartment but grabbing one that 's 1500 sq ft for the view

you 're not going to like this answer   you might be able to get out of the car you probably wo n't be able to get out of the loan   option 1 sell the car privately you 'll get more in a private sale and get a private loan for the difference between the sale price and what you owe   option 2 if you go to a dealership that advertises that they will take any trade no matter how much you owe they will roll your balance less your trade in value into your new loan so for example let 's say you buy a car for and borrow $ 20,000 the dealership gives you $ 6,000 for your trade because that 's what they do that leaves $ 9,000 on your loan and you will end up borrowing $ to buy a $ 20,000 car dealerships can be surprisingly accommodating but a lot of car buyers do n't understand the terms of what they 're getting into i actually knew someone a few years ago who left a dealership with a new car and could n't tell you anything about the deal beyond her monthly payment   option 3 hang on to the car and throw every extra penny at it to get the balance down on the loan until you can get it to the point where you can sell it trade it in or refi it without putting out a big one time cash payment

if you have someplace to put the money which you think will yield significantly better returns by all means sell and buy that on the other hand if you think this stock is likely to recover its value you might want to hold it or even buy more as a contrarian investment buy low sell high as much as possible and diversify you need to make a judgement call about the odds we can point out the implications but in the end whether to sell buy hold or hedge is your decision this also suggests you need to sit down and draw up a strategy over every decision is not productive if you have a plan you make this sort of decision before you ever put money into the stock in the first place
