you can make a capital contribution not a loan it 's not a taxable event no interest and you can take a distribution later when the business has the money to pay you back so yes transfer the money if you use software like quickbooks make use of unique accounts for tracking the contribution

payday loan companies basically are banks although they are incredibly terrible ones banks make money in two ways   1 they charge fees for services they provide bank account fees etc and 2 the interest rate differential they borrow money from individuals and corporations your savings account is essentially money you are loaning to the bank for a small paid to individuals and then lend that money back to other people for a higher ie you might earn 0.5 on your savings account but then the bank takes that money and lends it to your neighbor for 2.5 as part of their mortgage payday loan companies make money in one way they charge an enormous markup on money lent out to other people the rates in some cases are so high annualized interest rates of > 1000 are not uncommon in countries without full regulation of this industry that it barely matters where they get money from they might get money from investors who bought shares in the company giving the company initial cash in the hope that they give dividends down the road they might get money from other real banks who lend money just like they would lend money to any other business with a regular interest rate or they might have many from many other sources they might even issue their debt publically so that individuals could buy bonds from the company and receive a small amount of interest every year the point is that the rates of return on the money by payday loan companies are so high that the cost of where the money comes from is not terribly relevant

the initial beneficiary of 529 plan can be virtually anyone you choose even yourself    529 deductions are not deductible from federal taxes   you have about a 60 chance of living in a state that allows you to deduct contributions to your state 's plan from your state taxes    i 'd be more specific but your profile is pretty much empty and there 's no location info to assist me in determining if this applies to you or not if that does apply i 'm pretty sure it 's limited to earned income so you get little benefit from depositing the loans and it generally only applies to your state 's plan the major benefits to 529 plans are that the money grows tax free and withdrawals are not subject to taxes   however if you are not investing long term then it 's pretty hard to gain much from those benefits since you have such a short time horizon you 'll want to make sure the plan investments are directed to very low risk vehicles like a money market fund one of the better sources for info is

you say you have 90 in stocks i 'll assume that you have the other 10 in bonds for the sake of simplicity i 'll assume that your investments in stocks are in nice passive indexed mutual funds and etfs rather than in individual stocks a 90 allocation in stocks is considered aggressive the problem is that if the stock market crashes you may lose 40 or more of your investment in a single year as you point out you are investing for the long term that 's great it means you can rest easy if the stock market crashes safe in the hope that you have many years for it to recover so long as you have the emotional willpower to stick with it would you be better off with a 100 allocation in stocks you 'd think so would n't you after all the stock market as a whole gives better expected returns than the bond market but keep in mind the stock market and the bond market are somewhat negatively correlated that means when the stock market goes down the bond market often goes up and vice versa investing some of your money in bonds will slightly reduce your expected return but will also reduce your standard deviation and your maximum annual loss canadian couch potato has an interesting write up on how to estimate stock and bond returns it 's based on your stocks being invested equally in the canadian u.s. and international markets as you live in the u.s. that likely does n't directly apply to you you probably ignore the canadian stock market but your returns will be fairly similar i 've part of that table here as you can see your expected return is highest with a 100 allocation in stocks with a 20 year window you likely can recover from any crash if you have the stomach for it it 's the allocation with the highest expected return once you get closer to retirement though you have less time to wait for the stock market to recover if you still have 90 or 100 of your investment in stocks and the market crashes by 44 it might well take you more than 6 years to recover canadian couch potato has another article does a 60/40 portfolio still make sense a 60/40 portfolio is a fairly common split for regular investors typically considered not too aggressive not too conservative the article references an ap article that suggests in the current financial climate 60/40 is n't enough even they are n't recommending a or a split though personally i think 60/40 is too conservative however i do n't have the stomach for a split or even a split okay to get back to your question so long as your time horizon is far enough out the expected return is highest with a 100 allocation in stocks be sure that you can tolerate the risk though a 30 or 40 hit to your investments is enough to make anyone investing a portion of your money in bonds slightly lowers your expected return but can reduce your risk as you get closer to retirement and your time horizon you have less time to recover from a stock market crash and do need to be more conservative 6 years is probably too short to keep all your money in stocks is your stated approach reasonable well only you can answer that

devaluation is a relative term so if you want to protect yourself against devaluation of your currency against dollars just buy dollars inflation is something you can not protect yourself against because it is something that describes the purchasing power of the money you will still need to purchase and usually with money a side effect of inflation is usually devaluation against other currencies so one of the ways to deal with inflation is not to keep the money in your currency over time and only convert from a more stable currency when you need to make purchases another way is to invest in something tangible that can easily be sold for example and precious metals but it has other risks re what s legal and illegal in your country we do n't really know because you did n't tell what country that is to begin with but the usual channels like travelers checks or bank transfer should work carrying large amounts of cash are usually either illegal or strictly regulated

specifically what does my broker mean when they say an asset or investment strategy is high risk   in this context it is a statement based on past events and probability it is based on how confident s he is that the investment will perform to certain benchmarks this is a math question primarily with some opinion mixed in granted this is where the sharpe ratio and others fit well how am i supposed to answer a question like rate your risk tolerance from low to high this is the hard question as you have seen in this context risk tolerance is derived from your current position and future plans goals this is a planning goal setting and strategy question primarily with some math mixed in granted how vulnerable is your current position and future plans to an under performing investment if you answer very then you choose investments that have a lower probability of under performing   the sharpe ratio has little to do with answering this question it is a tool to find investments that better match your answer to this question

i seem not to be able to comment on the first answer due to reputation so i 'll aim to enhanced the first answer which is generally good but with these caveats 1 dividends are not guaranteed to preferred shareholders   rather preferred shareholders are normally in line ahead i.e. in preference to or preferred of common shareholders in terms of dividend payment   this is an extremely important distinction because unlike investments that we generally consider guaranteed such as cds known as gics in canada a company 's board can suspend the dividend at anytime for long periods of time without significant repercussions whereas a missed payment to a bank or secured bondholder can often push a company into bankruptcy very quickly 2 due to point 1 it is extremely important to know the or rules both the preferred shares you are buying and the other more senior creditors of that issuing company i.e. taxes almost always come first banks loans leases bonds etc   it is also important to know if a particular preferred share has cumulative dividends   you generally only want to buy preferred 's that have cumulative dividends since that means that anytime the company misses a payment they must pay those dividends first before any other dividends at the same or lower priority in the future 3 unlike a common stock your upside on a preferred stock is relatively fixed you get a fixed share of the company 's profit and that 's it whereas a common shareholder gets everything that 's left over after interest and preferred dividends are paid so if the company does really well you will theoretically do much better with common stock over time for the above reasons it is generally advisable to think of preferred shares as being more similar to really risky bonds in the same company rather than similar to common stock    of course if you are an advanced investor there are a lot more variables in play such as tax considerations and whether the preferred have special options attached to them such conversion into common shares

who issued stock typically support it when the stock price go down   no not many company do that as it is uneconomical for them to do so money used up in buying back equity is a wasteful use of a firm 's capital unless it is doing a buyback to return money to shareholders does the same thing happen with government bonds   not necessarily again here bond trading is very different from equities trading there are conditions specified in the offer document on when an issuer can recall jack up the price of an oversold bond even government bonds have them   the actions of the government has a bigger ripple effect as compared to a firm the government can start buying back bonds to increase it 's price but it will inflation because of the increase in the supply of money in the market which may or may n't be desirable then again people holding the bond would have to incentivized to sell the bond even during the greek fiasco the greek government was n't buying greek bonds as it had no capital to buy printing more euros was n't an option as no assets to back the newly printed money and the ecb would have stopped them from being accepted   and generally buying back is n't useful because they have to return the might run into billions invested in long term projects by the government and can not be liquidated immediately while servicing a bond is cheaper and investing the proceeds from the bond sale is more useful while being invested in long term projects the government can just roll over the bonds with a new issue and refrain from returning the capital till it is in a position to do so

thinking about the business overall your profit would be since this is a sole proprietorship the taxes are going to depend on your marginal tax rate if you file jointly your income will determine what your marginal tax rate is   if you file separately there likely would n't be any tax on that income since it 's less than the standard deduction but you lose benefits of filing jointly combined exemptions etc so think about how much she would charge what expenses are involved before taxes what the taxes would be on that profit and what the opportunity costs are is it worth time away from the kids hobbies etc for that hobby how much should a hobby business make to make it worth the effort of charging for such services that would fall in the expense section   are you talking about the actual costs tax prep etc or just the hassle of collecting accounting etc   certainly those are a consideration but it 's harder to quantify that   if you can come up with some sort of cost then certainly it would fit in the overall value equation i 'm not sure using additional social security benefits as a gauge is helpful since you would n't see those benefits until you 're of retirement age according to ss and a lot can happen between now and then

has a couple of articles on this topic how investing taxes work part 1 and part 2 the following is a summary of that article capital gains and dividends are taxed at a preferred rate while interest tax is taxed at your regular rate interest is taxed at your marginal rate but capital gains are taxed at only 50 of your marginal rate that means that it makes sense to place the interest bearing account inside the rrsp but keep stocks outside additionally you can claim your losses on your capital appreciating stocks against your gains if they are outside of your rrsp hopefully your stocks will never go down but that 's not very realistic dividends from canadian companies are eligible for a dividend tax credit but not dividends from foreign companies i actually understood that dividends from u.s. companies are treated as a special case it 's not clear to me from reading the article how much of this applies to mutual funds the summary is as follows

first as dheer mentioned above there is no right answer as investment avenues for a person is by many subjective considerations given that below a few of my thoughts strictly thoughts 1 have a plan for how much money you would need in next 5 7 years one hint is do you plan you buy a house car get married try to project this requirement 2 related to the above if you have some idea on point 1 then it would be possible for you to determine how much you need to save now to achieve the above possibly with a loan thrown in it will also give you some indication as to where and how much of your current cash holding that you should invest now 3 from an investment perspective there are many instruments some more risky some less the exact mix of instruments that you should consider is based on many things one among them is your risk and fund requirement projections 4 usually not as a rule of thumb the of savings corresponding to your age should go into low risk investments and into higher risk investment 5 you could talk to some professional planners all banks offer the service hope this helps i reiterate as dheer did there is no right answer for your question all the answers would be rather

one way to look at a butterfly is to break it into two trades a butterfly is actually made up of two verticals one is a debit vertical buy put and sell the 460 put   the other is a credit vertical sell a 460 put and buy a 430 put   if someone believes apple will fall to 460 that person could do a few things there are other strategies but this just compares the three common ones 1 buy a put this is expensive and if the stock only goes to 460 you overpay for it 2 buy a put vertical this is less expensive because you offset the price of your put 3 buy a butterfly this is cheapest of the three because you have the vertical in 2 as well as a credit vertical on top of that to offset your cost   the reason why someone would use the butterfly is to pay less upfront while capitalizing on a fall to 460 of the three this would be the better strategy to use if that happens but remember that this only applies if the trader is right and it goes to 460 there is always a trade off for every strategy that the trader must be aware of if the trader is wrong and apple goes to say 400 the put 1 would make the most money and the would lose money while the vertical 2 would still gain so that is what you 're sacrificing to get the benefits of the butterfly also helps to draw a diagram to compare the strategies

agree with it is rare larger cap examples include nokia and holdings   if cash exceeds market cap that means total debt is greater than ev the value of the operating assets if the debt is partially repaid matures the equity is ok but if management is crap and the cash is spent at an below the interest rate on the debt now you have a situation where the net debt exceeds the value of the operating assets the credit quality suffers debt trades down you need to in order to avoid bankruptcy   the above assumes debt is greater than cash situations where cash exceeds market cap and debt is less than cash i.e. a negative ev are exceedingly rare in larger companies and are either a a wonderfully attractive mispricing or b market views management as so awful that the cash will get burnt up by the business and the value of that cash will be destroyed

asset prices across the board are at historic highs because interest rates have been too low for too long owners sellers of assets win and this is primarily the baby boomer generation and the buyer of these assets loose primarily gen x and millennials i 'm really not looking forward to at best stagnating asset prices as interest rates are inevitably increased or at worst another crash

anytime you borrow money at that rate you are getting ripped off    one way to rectify this situation is to pay the car off as soon as possible   you can probably get a second job that makes $ 1000 per month   if so you will be done in 4 months     do that and you will pay less than $ 300 in interest   it is a small price to pay for an important lesson while you can save some money refinancing working and paying the loan off is in my opinion a better option   even if you can get the rate down to 12 you are still giving too much money to banks

true but the gop supports this network and framework of us law that actually encourages businesses to do this   dems like obama want to do a minimum tax for multinationals to make american employees more attractive and to end some of the tax hiding these corps which depend on the american military and good name to make a profit   the gop are against this   we should nt give corporate america a free reign and then ask the american worker to compete with workers in other countries that do nt give a fuck about the enviroment they do nt care if they kill every fish in the rivers to compete with workers that live in countries with zero labor laws   the answer is not to fuck out enviroment   the answer is not for americans to take pay cuts   the answer is not outsourcing   the answer is not to do away with our clean air and clean water laws   the answer is to make it less profitable for corps that enjoy all the benefits of being american for them to send jobs overseas the easiest way to do this is with tax code   you ca nt just have your base in america use our army our intelligence services and our strong arming and courts but then only employ people in china

in some cases it might be rational to pay low interest debt first because the consequences of defaulting on that debt are worse    consider this simplified example   suppose you have two debts a low interest mortgage secured by your house and a high interest unsecured credit card debt both of which are within a few years of being paid off   there is a chance that sometime between now and then something will happen to disrupt your income e.g. medical problems and it wo n't be possible to make the payments on either loan    defaulting on the credit card loan will result in a lower credit score and calls from collection agencies   defaulting on the mortgage will result in the foreclosure or forced sale of your house at best forcing you to move and at worst leaving you homeless at a time when you are also facing other e.g. medical problems   so you might rationally judge that losing your house is much worse than bad credit   therefore you might rationally conclude that it would be better to direct extra income toward paying down the mortgage to increase the chances that if and when an income disruption might occur the mortgage would already be paid off   in other words you shorten the window of time where income disruption results in foreclosure you might decide that this increased security is worth the extra interest you will pay compared to the strategy where you pay the high interest loan first this is a fairly special situation but you asked why might it be a good idea to do this and i am just giving an example where it could rationally be considered a good idea    of course in a real life version of this example there might be other options available such as refinancing the mortgage   if you like you could imagine a more extreme example where the lower interest debt is owed to the who will come and break your if you miss a payment

similar premise yes it 's an investment so you 're definitely hoping it grows so you can sell it for a profit gain public stock market vs. private shark tank are a little different though in terms of how much money you get and the form of income     with stocks if you buy x number of shares at a certain price you definitely want to sell them when they are worth more however you do n't get say 0.001 or whatever percentage you own it would be trivial of the profits they just pay a dividend to you based on a pre determined amount and multiply it by the number of shares you own and that would be your income unless you 're like warren buffet and berkshire who can buy significant stakes of companies through the stock market then they can likely put the investment on the balance sheet of his company but that 's a different discussion it would also be expensive as hell to do that     with shark tank investors the main benefit they get is significant ownership of a company for a cheap price however the risk can be greater too as these companies do n't have a strong foundation of sales and are just beginning investing in apple vs. a small business is pretty significant difference haha these companies are so small and in such a weak financial position which is why they 're seeking money to grow so they have almost no leverage mark cuban could swoop in and offer $ 50k for 25 and that 's almost worth it relative to what $ 50k in apple shares would get him it 's all about the return apple and other big public companies are mature and most of the growth has already happened so there is little upside with these startups if they ever take off then and you own 25 of the company it can be worth billions

due to the zero percent interest rate on the euro right now you wo n't find any investment giving you 5 which is n't equivalent to gambling   one of the few investment forms which still promises gains without unreasonable risks right now seems to be real estate because real estate prices in german urban areas not so in rural areas are growing a lot recently one reason for that is in fact the low interest rate because it makes it very cheap right now to take a loan and buy a home this increased demand is driving up the prices note that you do n't need to buy a property yourself to invest in real estate 20k in one of the larger cities of germany will get you maybe a cardboard box below a bridge you can invest your money in a real estate fund you then do n't own a specific property you own a tiny fraction of a whole bunch of different properties this spreads out the risk and allows you to invest exactly as much money as you want however most real estate funds do not allow you to sell in the first two years and require that you announce your sale one year in advance so it 's not a very liquid asset   also it is still a risky investment raising real estate prices might hint to a bubble which might burst eventually financial analysts have different opinions about this but fact is when the european central bank starts to take interest again then the demand for real estate property will drop and so will the prices when you are not sure what to do ask your bank for investment advise german banks are usually trustworthy in this regard

currency like gold and other commodities is n't really much of an investment at all it does n't actually generate any return its value might fluctuate at a different rate than that of the us dollar or euro but that 's about it it might have a place as a very small slice of a basket of global currencies but most us european households do n't actually need that sort of basket it 's really more of a risk management strategy than an investment strategy and it does n't really reflect the risks faced by an ordinary family in the us or europe or similar investments should n't generally be particularly exciting generally exciting opportunities mean that you 're speculating on the market not really investing in it if you have a few thousand dollars you do n't need and do n't mind losing you can make some good money speculating some of the time but you can also just lose it all too maybe there 's a little room for excitement if you find amazing deals on ordinary investments at the very bottom of a stock market crash when decent solid companies are on sale much cheaper than they ordinarily are

in the us dividends have special tax treatment similar to but not the same as capital gains no easy way to transform one to the other the very fact that you invested your money in a company that has returned part of your capital as income means it is just that income also in the us you could invest in master limited partnerships these are companies that make distributions that are treated as a return of capital instead of dividends throughout the life of the investment you receive tax forms that assign part of the operating expense loss of the company to you as a tax payer then at the end of the investment life you are required to recapture those losses as capital gains on sale of the stock in some ways these investments do exactly what you are asking about they transform periodic income into later capital gains basically deferring tax on the income until the sale of the security here is an article i found about mlps coming to the uk through an etf master limited partnerships in the uk

do you want to do it pre or post correction if you 're bearish on the market the obvious thing to do is short an index i would say this is kind of dumb the main problem is that it may take months or years for the market to crash and by then it will have gone up so much that even the crash does n't bring you profit and you 're paying borrowing fees meanwhile as well you need to watch the portfolio also when you short sell you 'll get a bunch of cash which you most likely will want to invest but once you invest it the market can spike and your short position resulting in negative remaining cash since you already spent it at that point you get a margin call from your broker if you check your account regularly not a big deal but bad things can happen if you treat it as a fire and forget strategy these days they have inverse funds so you do n't have to borrow anything the fund manager borrows for you i 'd say those are much better the less cumbersome choice is to simply sell call options on the index or buy puts these are even cash options so when you exercise you get lose money not shares you can even arrange them so that your potential loss is capped but honestly same goes for shorts it 's called a stop loss you could also wait for the correction and buy the dip less worrying about shorts and such but of course the issue is timing the crash usually the crashes are very quick and there are several pre crashes that look like it bottomed out but then it crashes more so actually very difficult thing to tell you have to know either exactly when the correction will be or exactly what the price floor is and set a limit buy hope your crystal ball works yet another choice is finding asset classes uncorrelated or even with the broader market for instance some emerging markets developing countries some sectors individual stocks that are not inflated bonds gold and so on can have these characteristics where if s&p goes down they go up buying those may be a safer approach since at least you are still holding a fundamentally valuable thing even if your thesis meanwhile shorts and puts and the like are purely speculative

credit card fees on a credit card used for personal expenses are not tax deductible credit card fees on a business credit card are deductible on schedule c or whatever form you 're using to report business income and expenses if you are using the same card for both business and personal well for starters this is a very bad idea because it creates exactly the question you 're asking if that 's what you 're doing stop and get separate business and personal cards if you have separate business and personal cards and use the business card only for legitimate business expenses then the answer is easy you can claim a schedule c deduction for any service charges on the business card and you can not claim any deduction for any charges on the personal card in general though if you have an expense that is partly business and partly personal you are supposed to figure out what percentage is business and that is deductible in an admittedly brief search i could n't find anything specifically about credit cards but i did find this similar idea on the irs web site generally you can not deduct personal living or family expenses however if you have an expense for something that is used partly for business and partly for personal purposes divide the total cost between the business and personal parts you can deduct the business part for example if you borrow money and use 70 of it for business and the other 30 for a family vacation you can deduct 70 of the interest as a business expense the remaining 30 is personal interest and is not deductible refer to chapter 4 of publication 535 business expenses for information on deducting interest and the allocation rules so probably you could add up all the charges you made on the card figure out how much was for business and how much for personal calculate the business percentage and then deduct this percentage of the service fees if the amount involved is not trivial you might want to talk to an accountant or a lawyer

you 're getting paid by the job not by the hour so i do n't see why you think the employer is obligated to pay you for the drive time   the only way that might be true as far as i can see is if he were avoiding paying you minimum wage by structuring your employment this way   it looks like to me you 're over the minimum wage based on what you wrote   at maximum unpaid drive time 59 min each way and maximum length of job 4 hours as you stated it gives your minimum hourly rate of $ the federal minimum wage is currently $ so you 're over that   a quick search online suggests that nv does have a higher minimum at $ under some conditions but you 're still over that too the fact that you 're required to pick up the and that you have a company car at home probably does mean that you 're on the clock from the moment that you leave your house but again you 're not actually being paid by the clock   as long as no other law is being broken and it appears from your telling that there is n't then the employer can set any policy for how to compute the compensation that he wants regarding taxes the employer probably has no discretion there   you 're making what you 're making and the employer needs to tax it in total   since you 're driving a company vehicle from home i do n't think that you 're entitled to any reimbursement vs. wages that would not be taxed unless maybe you pay for gas yourself   the gas money if applicable should be reimbursable as a business expense and that generally would not be taxed

do not provide any personal information if the debt is not yours ask the caller to provide all the identifying information they have over the phone to verify whether they have your information or are just following up on similar names even if they have information that is yours do not provide more information always make them tell you what they know if they provide information that is not yours simply state that it is not your information and politely end the call if they persist in calling you there are local agencies you can report them to   if they have your information then ask for all of the details of the debt who is it owed to when was the debt incurred what was the original amount of the debt what is the current balance when was the last activity on the account what is their relation to creditor   once you know the creditor you can contact them directly for more information it is possible they may have written off the account and closed it selling it to a debt collector in order to get some sort of return on debt if they truly have a debt that is yours and you did not incur it then you will need to file a police report for a case of identity theft be prepared for some scrutiny

a reason that the wealth has never and will never trickle down is because as society goes on the wealth transfer only happens between upper tiers of society   it used to be that the rich would spend their money and many people would benefit from it in a society small business owners were pretty much all their were and the only people who had monopolies were the rail and oil lines   as time went on more major organizations up for news food computers etc now wealth transfers only between the top tiers and the lower tiers only get the crumbs the higher tier chooses to pay them which is significantly less than they used to whereas employees used to cost a reasonable value to a company they are now almost entirely expendable assets exceptions made for certain portions of history   i am of the opinion that much like history the cycle is going to repeat shortly the occupy wall street being a precursor to another wage fight between the rich and poor with the dissemination of knowledge being much easier more people are getting the general idea that they 're getting shafted they want to be rich although not necessarily because the rich are wealthy they simply want to be able to increase their class mobility that 's been dying a slow death for the past 20 years and quite by the bank bail out   it 's unfortunate a sizable portion of the population actually sides with the 1 of people actively preventing them from moving up gaining more mobility and improving the quality of their life i sincerely hope that at some point in the near future people realize this before the lower class goes and starts busting heads

it 's a hard decision to make especially without knowing the complete contract details i would in general stay away from financial advisors like or other pyramid selling companies in german they usually only offer a very limited range of products in most cases they sell only 1 or 2 products and tell everyone that these offers are the best and fit exactly to the client i would prefer an insurance broker requires an education which could in theory offer any product coming to your situation if you already have a product which is maxed out i see no point in another private insurance without any aid the insurance construction allows you to save some taxes but it does cost you a premium i would buy the funds preferable etfs on my own this comes down to the question does the insurance construction payoff for you for the costs it generates

you should definitely favor holding bonds in tax advantaged accounts because bonds are not tax efficient the reason is that more of their value comes in the form of regular periodic distributions rather than an increase in value as is the case with stocks or stock funds with stocks you can choose to realize all that appreciation when it is most advantageous for you from a tax perspective additionally stock dividends often receive lower tax rates for much more detail see tax efficient fund placement

the meaning is quite literal a representative stock list is a list of stocks that would reasonably be expected to have about the same results as the whole market i.e. be representative of an investment that invests in all those stocks of course you do n't want to invest in all stocks individually that would be impractical but you can either choose a diverse array of stocks that are should be representative as the article recommends or alternatively choose to invest in an index fund which offers a practical way to invest in all the stocks in the index at once

the blue line is illustrating the net profit or loss the investor will realise according to how the price of the underlying asset settles at expiry the x axis represents the underlying asset price   the y axis represents the profit or loss in the first case the investor has a naked put write position having sold a put option   the strike price of the put is marked as a on the x axis   the maximum profit possible is equal to the total premium received when the option contract was sold   this is represented by that portion of the blue line that is horizontal and extending from the point above that point marked a on the x axis   this corresponds to the case that the price of the underlying asset settles at or above the strike price on the day of expiry   if the underlying asset settles at a price less than the strike price on the day of expiry then the option with be in the money   therefore the net settlement value will move from a profit to a loss depending on how far in the money the option is upon expiry   this is represented by the diagonal line moving from above the a point on the x axis and moving from a profit to a loss on the y axis   the diagonal line crosses the x axis at the point where the underlying asset price is equal to a minus the original premium rate at which the option was written i.e. net profit = zero   in the second case the investor has sold a put option with a strike price of b and purchase a put option with a strike price a where a is less than b.   here the reasoning is similar to the first example however since a put option has been purchase this will limit the potential losses should the underlying asset move down strongly in value the horizontal line above the x axis marks the maximum profit while the horizontal line below the x axis marks the maximum loss note that the horizontal line above the x axis is closer to the x axis that is the horizontal line below the x axis   this is because the maximum profit is equal to the premium received for selling the put option minus the premium payed for buying the put option at a lower strike price   losses are limited since any loss in excess of the strike price a plus the premium payed for the put purchased at a strike price of a is covered by the profit made on the purchased put option at a strike price of a

wait are you sure you 've got that right what you 're describing is a tax credit that counts against your total owed    in normal operations companies get to write off all of their expenses and they only pay taxes on the net profit of the operation so i guess you could say that if it cost me $ 100 m to move a factory off shore and my marginal tax rate was 35 then i would save $ 35 m in taxes it still cost me the $ 100 m but it only felt like it cost $ 65 m    this is true of any business expense i not romney apparently do n't know of any special treatment that offshoring activities get one way or the other

gt people generally do not like labor especially if it is something they do not find fulfilling    i agree sort of of course people do n't enjoy doing work they find unpleasant but i think the idea that people do not like working as a rule is not as obvious as it seems after all that 's more of a guess as it has never been tested in any meaningful way humans throughout history have for the most part worked    while i have an easy time agreeing that it 's preferable for people to work on things they find fulfilling or at least not unpleasant than to work on things they hate i 'm not sold on the concept that people would actually prefer not working at all to working i think productivity and purpose are critical components to the human experience and work plays a big role in them in other words the idea of not working would n't necessarily match the reality of not working if we ever had a chance to properly explore it on a side note i think this is something absolutely worth experimenting with you could run some decent experiments for less than $ 50 m which is really a small amount to explore such a universally relevant topic    gt wage chattel slavery has never nor will it ever be a positive attribute to any society    this strikes me as a loaded statement and on the surface at least not one i agree with please help me understand your thinking here    how exactly do you define wage slavery    if you define it as working in order to survive would you consider maintaining a small working farm in order to feed your family as was done by many throughout history to be a form of wage slavery how about hunting and gathering not paid labor clearly but nonetheless difficult work that was done only because it was necessary for the worker to survive    is working for wages which you can then exchange to buy food and such different in kind from working to produce or capture food is working to afford enough food and shelter to survive different from working to afford more luxurious food or shelter    i 'm not being i 'm just trying to understand the implications of that statement    as far as a reduction in hours worked that is n't necessarily   disastrous it may be but it can also be mitigated for instance if fewer hours worked yield the same or higher income this is n't as radical as it sounds it could for example be viewed as value based pricing of results as opposed to input    that said in practice i think significant job loss due to technology would be handled poorly and thus very messy at least at first    however i do n't think that the shift in job markets will be as sudden or severe as many claim it will be i think that 's a bit of sensationalist fear mongering based more on predictions than evidence

when buying investment properties there are different levels of passive investment involved   at one end you have those that will buy an investment property and give it to a real estate agent to manage and do n't want to think of it again apart from watching the rent come in every week at the other end there are those that will do everything themselves including knocking on the door to collect the rent where is the best place to be well somewhere in the middle the most successful property investors treat their investment properties like a business they handle the overall management of the properties and then have a team taking care of the day to day nitty gritty of the properties regarding the brand new or 5 to 10 year old property you are going to pay a premium for the brand new a property that is 5 years old will be like new but without the premium i once bought a unit which was 2 to 3 years old for less than the original buyer bought it at brand new also you will still get the majority of the depreciation benefits on a 5 year old property you also should not expect too much maintenance on a 5 to 10 year old property another option you may want to look at is defence housing they are managed by the department of defence and you can be guaranteed rent for 10 years or more whether they have a tenant in the property or not they also carry out all the maintenance on the property and restore it to original condition once their contract is over the pitfall is that you will pay a lot more for the management of these properties up to 15 or more personally i would not go for a defence housing property as i consider the fees too high and would not agree with some of their terms and conditions however considering your emphasis on a passive investment this may be an option for you

a major thing to consider when deciding whether to invest or pay off debt is cash flow specifically how each choice affects your cash flow and how your cash flow is affected by various events simply enough your cash flow is the amount of money that passes through your finances during a given period often a month or a year some of this is necessary payments like staying current on loans rent etc while other parts are not necessary such as eating out for example you currently have $ 5,500 debt at 3 and another $ 2,500 at 5 this means that every month your cashflow effect of these loans is $ 5,500 3 12 + $ 2,500 5 12 = $ 24 interest before any applicable tax effects plus any required payments toward the principal which you do n't state to have the $ 8,000 paid off in 30 years you 'd be paying another $ 33 toward the principal for a total of about $ 60 per month before tax effects in your case if you take the full $ 7,000 you have available and use it to pay off the debt starting with the higher interest loan then your situation changes such that you now assuming that the repayment timeline remains the same the cashflow effect of the above becomes $ 1,000 3 12 = $ interest plus $ toward the principal again before tax effects in one fell swoop you just reduced your monthly payment from $ 60 to $ 5.25 per year this means $ 720 to $ 63 so on the $ 7,000 invested in repayment you get $ in return every year for a annual return on investment it will take you about 11 years to use only this money to save another $ 7,000 as opposed to the 30 years original repayment schedule if the extra payment goes toward knocking time off the existing repayment schedule but keeping the amount paid toward the principal per month the same you are now paying $ 33 toward the principal plus $ 2.50 interest against the $ 1,000 loan which means by paying $ you will be debt free in 30 months two and a half years instead of 30 years an effective 92 reduction in repayment time you immediately have another about $ in your budget and in two and a half years you will have $ 60 per month that you would n't have if you stuck with the original repayment schedule if instead the total amount paid remains the same you are then paying about $ toward the principal and will be debt free in less than a year and a half not too shabby if you ask me also do n't forget that this is a known guaranteed return in that you know what you would be paying in interest if you did n't do this and you know what you will be paying in interest if you do this even if the interest rate is variable you can calculate this to a reasonable degree of certainty the difference between those two is your return on investment compare this to the fact that while an investment in the s&p might have similar returns over long periods of time the stock market is much more volatile in the shorter term as the past two decades have so demonstrated it does n't do you much good if an investment returns 10 per year over 30 years if when you need the money it 's down 30 because you bought at a local peak and have held the investment for only a year also consider if you go back to school are you going to feel better about a $ payment or a $ payment even if the payments on old debt are deferred while you are studying you will still have to pay the money and it will likely be accruing interest in the meantime now i really do n't advocate your savings account entirely the way i did in the example above stuff happens all the time and some stuff that happens costs money instead you should be keeping some of that money easily available in a liquid non volatile form which basically means a savings account without withdrawal penalties or a money market fund not the stock market how much depends on your necessary expenses a buffer of three months worth of expenses is an often recommended starting point for an emergency fund the above should however help you evaluate how much to keep how much to invest and how much to use to pay off loans early respectively

i argued for a 15 rule of thumb here saving for retirement how much is enough though if you 'll let me i 'd refine the argument to use a rule of thumb to set your minimum savings then use monte carlo to stress test and look at any special circumstances and make a case to save more you 're right that the rule of thumb in tons of assumptions great list btw a typical scenario could include if any of those big assumptions do n't apply to you or you do n't want to rely on them you 'd have to re evaluate it sounds like you 're assuming 4 5 investment returns as you say that 's probably the big difference 4 5 is lower than most would assume 6 7 real return is maybe a middle of the road assumption and 8 is maybe an unrealistic one many of the assumptions you list such as married kids cost of living spouse 's income paying for college can maybe be bundled up into one assumption percentage of income you will spend set a percentage budget and as you go along stay within your means by sacrificing as required also smooth out income across layoffs and things by having an emergency fund by staying on budget as you go you can remove some of the the reason i think the rule of thumb is still good despite the assumptions is that i do n't think a more accurate number based on a lot of unpredictable guesses is really better and it may even be harmful if you use it to justify saving less or even if you use it to save far too much see also many most important assumptions are not predictable investment returns health care inflation personal health lifestyle creep changing spending needs desires irrational investment behavior i agree with you that for many scenarios and people 15 will not be enough though it 's a whole lot more than most save already in particular low investment returns over your time horizon will make 15 insufficient and some argue that low investment returns over the coming 30 years are likely without a doubt 20 or more is safer than 15 do consider that saving enough is not a binary thing if you save only 15 and it turns out that does n't completely replace your income it 's not like you 're out on the street you might have to retire a few years later or downsize your house or something but perhaps that is n't a catastrophe there 's a very personal question about how much to sacrifice now for less risk of sacrifice in the future maybe i 'd better qualify not a binary thing some savings rates certainly anything less than 10 make major sacrifices pretty likely so in that sense there is a binary distinction between plausible plan and denial also precise assumptions and calculations get a lot more useful as you approach retirement age you can pretty much answer the question is it reasonable to retire right now or could i retire in 5 years though with a retirement that could last 30 years plenty of unknowns will remain even then i think at age 20 or 30 though just saving 15 20 if you 're conservative and not spending too much time on a speculative analysis would be a sound decision that 's why i like the rule of thumb analysis paralysis saving nothing or near nothing is the real danger early in one 's career any plausible percentage is fine as long as you save as your life and you see what happens you can refine and correct adjusting your savings rate moving your retirement age around spending a little less or more the important thing earlier in life is to just get in the right ballpark

it would be nice if the broker could be instructed to clear out the position for you but in my experience the broker will simply give you the shares that you ca n't afford then freeze your account because you are over your margin limit and issue a margin call this happened to me recently because of a dumb mistake options i paid $ 200 for and expected to expire worthless ended up slightly itm so they were auto exercised on friday for about $ 20k and my account was frozen only able to close positions   by the next monday market news had shifted the stock against me and i had to sell it at a loss of $ 1200 to meet the margin call   this kind of thing is what gives option trading a reputation for danger a supposedly turned into a 6x greater loss   i see no reason to ever exercise i always try to close my positions but these things can happen

also the city streets are not supposed to be a source of competition for their business   17 states disagree with you but they must have been simple minded   how can brick and mortar restaurants factor in any kind of unknown competition such as another brick amp mortar possibly a better or less expensive version of their own business should they be protected from anything they can not factor into their initial decision to open a business where do you draw the line   i think that businesses should be protected from much larger businesses but i do n't think it 's appropriate to use government to protect businesses from smaller more agile businesses or completely different business models   i think this entire argument is based on a logical fallacy that mobile food is going to put restaurants out of business at a rate faster than they already do go out of business

you only need umbrella policy for large amounts of liability protection i think they usually start with $ 1 m so if you do n't have and do n't expect to have assets at such a high value why would you need the insurance your homeowners renters car travel insurance should be enough and you still need to have those for umbrella since its on top of the existing coverage not instead many people just do n't have enough assets to justify such a high coverage

all life insurance is pretty much the same when it comes to cost you can run the numbers over certain time period and the actual cost of insurance is about the same a simplified way to explain life insurance and the differences between them below the 3 characteristics of life insurance there are 5 popular types of life insurance and they are term whole life universal life variable universal life indexed universal life but first one must understand the most basic life insurance which is called annual renewable term   this is a policy that covers 1 year and is renewable every year after the cost of insurance typically increases each year as the insured ages so for every year of coverage your premium increases like in the simplified illustration above this is the building block of all life insurance term or permanent there is no cash value all premium goes to the cost of insurance   this is an art that spans over a longer time period than 1 year say 5 10 15 20 or 30 years all the cost is added together then divided by the number of years of coverage to give a level premium payment for the duration of the policy the longest coverage offered these days is 30 years there is no cash value all premium goes to the cost of insurance the premium is fixed level for the term specified if the policy comes to an end and the owner wishes to renew it it will be at higher premium this can be seen in the simplified illustration above for a 15-year term policy   because life insurance gets very expensive as you reach old age life insurance companies came up with a way to make it affordable for the consumer wishing to have coverage for their entire lifespan they allow you to have interest rate crediting on the cash value account inside the policy   to have cash value in the first place you must pay premiums that are more than the cost of insurance the idea is your cash value grows over time to help pay for the cost of insurance in the later stages of the policy where the cost of insurance is typically higher this is illustrated above in an overly simplified way this is a permanent life insurance policy that is designed to cover the lifespan of the insured there is cash value that is credited on a fixed interest rate specified by the insurance company typically 3 5 the premium is fixed for the life of the policy it was designed for insuring the entire lifespan of the insured this is variation of whole life there is cash value it is credited on a fixed interest rate specified by the insurance company but it does fluctuate year to year depending on the economy typically 3 6 the premium is flexible you can increase decrease the premium   this is basically a universal life policy but the cash value sits in an account that is invested in the market normally mutual funds your interest that is being credited to your account with your cash value from investments is subjected to risk in the market rise fall with the market depending on the portfolio of your choosing hence the word variable you take on the risk instead of the insurance company it can be a very good product if the owner knows how to manage it just like any other investment products this is a hybrid of the and the the interest rate depends on the performance of a market index or a set of market indices the insurance company states a maximum interest rate or cap you can earn up to and a guaranteed minimum floor on your cash value interest that will be credited typically 0 floor and 12 cap it is purely a method to credit you interest rate it takes the market risk out of the equation but still retains some of the growth potential of the market term policy is designed for temporary coverage there is no cash value accumulation permanent policies such as whole life universal life variable universal life and indexed universal life have a cash value accumulation component that was originally designed to help pay for the cost of insurance in the later stages of the policy when the insured is at an advanced age so it can cover the entire lifespan of the insured people do take advantage of that cash value component and its tax advantages for retirement income supplement and maximize the premium contribution always remember that life insurance is a life insurance product and not an investment vehicle there is a cost of insurance that you are paying for but if you have life insurance needs you might as well take advantage of the cash value accumulation deferred tax growth and tax free access that these permanent policies offer

there was an magazine it in a couple of months back one of the major take from the article was that for the auto parts factory their line for whether to buy a robot or use humans for a task came at 2 years if the robot could replace enough workers to pay for itself in 2 years the robot won if you 're talking about a factory operating 24 hours a day a robot costing less than 6 man years of salary and capable of operating 24 hours a day for 2 years would win and 3 workers would lose   personally it seems like there 's always more work that could be done and people should be looking for ways to move higher up the value tree either into tasks that are hard to automate or into roles that accelerate the automation if as a society we 're able to free people up from the basic tasks needed for survival we can progress faster on other things   it 's not like this is the first time that there 's been a revolution in how labor is allocated it used to be everybody farmed their own land for survival then techniques in farming got better and some farmed land while others started making other things to trade for food then crops started producing things like cotton and people would work to turn the cotton into things to trade for food or housing or whatever and people specialized then machines started farming and more people were in factories and then more people in factories with machines etc   if you asked someone from a time when everybody worked their own land for survival to look what modern people have they might look and wonder how you eat when you do n't have enough land to grow food on

there is a misunderstanding    the business and the owner are not the same entity   you said    i give the business $ 25,000 and take 50 of the business no you can give the owner of the business 25 k and now he has 25 k and 50 of a 50 k business    that 25 k sits in mr. smith 's bank account not acme widget 's account    a more simple example is when you buy a car   the money goes to the car dealership it does not get put into the car 's glove box you may be thinking of an investor in a business   he could pump $ $ into the business as operating capital for a share of the business   in that case it would be a bit unfair to get 50 of the business for a 25k.   however the owner may be interested in doing such a deal because value of the investor can add more than just $ $ to the business   having a celebrity investor might do more good for the business than the actual dollars another situation is that the owner might be desperate   without a influx of cash the whole business might end there are guidelines to business evaluation but valuing them is not an easy thing

if a high mileage car has been thoroughly maintained with a credible service history there is no reason to discard the vehicle because of a hypothetical future expense   considering the low value of the vehicle it would be prudent to also lower the cost of the repairs   u.s. car dealerships have a well known reputation for charging significantly higher repair rates than independent repair shops lower the cost of the repairs brakes can be done at independent shops for half what the dealer quoted   sears can install a set of 4 tires on an 04 accord for $ out the door   it makes no financial sense to purchase costly repairs for a low cost automobile when economical alternatives are available

i 'm a senior majoring in accounting and management information systems here is a question i answered a while back about financial statements and employee retention in the answer that i provided at the bottom it was to assess a company 's ability to pay by use of ratios likewise similar accounting methods need to be understood and implemented when assessing is where i believe mr. buffet was going with this as we can see the severity of the questions decreases but if you can not answer question 3 then you should study accounting principles    so how much is enough just to get started you will never have enough knowledge to start period you will have to continuously be learning so start sooner than later   however you need neither economics or accounting knowledge if you were to learn technical analysis many doubt the workings of this technique but in my experience it is easier to learn and practise a comment on 's post   understanding economics and accounting are fundamental analysis seeing trends and copying are human traits that helped us evolve we are very good at pattern recognition taking an intro economic and accounting course at a local community college is an excellent place to start when breaking the mold of pattern thinking you have to be critical in understanding what elements move a company 's a r in the statement of cash flows read literally do n't stop reading latest edition of of 's accounting principles read it cover to cover tax policies on section read it   take a class read a book ask questions good luck welcome to the science of business you 're gon na like it here phil

changing my answer based on clarification in comments it appears that some of the securities you mentioned including are traded on what is colloquially known as the grey market grey sheets and also known as the gray market is another category of otc stocks that is completely separate from pink sheets and the   from investopedia the grey market is an over the counter market where dealers may execute orders for preferred customers as well as provide support for a new issue before it is actually issued this activity allows underwriters and the issuer to determine demand and price the securities accordingly before the ipo   some additional information on this type of stocks source unlike other financial markets no recent bid or ask quotes are available because no market makers share data or quote such stocks there is no quoting system available to record and settle trades all grey sheet trading is moderated by a broker and done between individuals at a price they agree on the only documentation that can be publicly found regarding the trades is when the last trade took place no sec registration and little sec regulation regulation of grey sheet stocks takes place mainly on a state level unlike pink sheets these stocks have no sec registration to possess a stock symbol or to possess shares or trade shares of that stock such penny stocks similar to pink sheets are not required to file sec securities and exchange commission financial and business reports these stocks may not be solicited or advertised to the public unless a certain number of shares are qualified to be traded publicly under 504 of regulation d. extremely illiquid gray sheet trading is infrequent and for good reason difficult to trade not advertised difficult to follow the price the least regulation possible hard to find any information on the stock very small market cap little history and most such stocks do not yet offer public shares the lack of information bids history financial reports alone causes most investors to be very skeptical of gray sheets and avoid them altogether   gray sheets are commonly associated with initial public offering ipo stocks or start up companies or spin off companies even though not all are ipo 's start ups or spin offs grey sheets is also home to delisted stocks from other markets some stocks on this financial market were once traded on the nasdaq or the pink sheets but ran into serious misfortune usually financial and thus failed to meet the minimum requirements of the registered sec filings and/or stock exchange regulations for a financial market such stocks were delisted or removed and may begin trading on the grey sheets   so to answer your question i think the cause of the wild swings is that    great question btw

the livret a is a very specific product it 's tax exempt and would historically not be available through regular banks commercial banks can now offer it but they only collect the money on behalf of the des cdc the cdc then pays interest to the savers and a commission for the bank the commission is baked into the system not charged to the customer directly but since the interest rate is set centrally banks can not compete on that so this is risk free money for them but on the flip side it does not help them meet capital adequacy requirements other savings account or products have different rules another angle to consider is that a livret a was historically very attractive for consumers and was certainly perceived as such so that many people would have a checking account at a regular bank and another account at the or the just to open a livret a. for commercial banks the alternative therefore is n't having your money on your checking account vs. your livret a or another savings account it was having your money on a livret a they administer vs. seeing you run away to another institution there is also a cap on the livret a and you 're not allowed to save more money by opening several of them at different banks at the same time banks have been complaining that the decrease of the interest rate and consequently of their commission makes the whole scheme a lot less interesting for them for what it 's worth i recently a bank account in france after living abroad for a long time and the customer advisor did not seem particularly interested in pushing a livret a.

thanks for the great response   the example with calculus is perfect group a is some students who will never ever get it no matter how much you teach and train them   as you know group b is some students who excel in calculus just by reading the book with no need for a professor to explain or teach them they probably exceed in understanding beyond the course objectives   group c most will be in the middle struggle and with efforts of the professor if the class is not more than 10 15 students and their own efforts they will eventually understand some will get c some will get b and few will get a.   which group will succeed with their career if it requires calculus   gt the messed up part is that professors are never formally taught to teach    true i was an professor while studying for my master 's in the end of the semester students had to evaluate their professors i got the 2nd best results after another part time professor and way above all tenured professors are you surprised by the way i was teaching introductory classes and i was working for the department i was teaching for as a research intern   as for professors who do n't know how to teach this was not an issue in the past and was not needed in the past i.e. it 's because of past traditions    in the past the role of the professor was not so much to teach in the sense and the way teachers teach today in elementary school attend and dance around every student 's special needs and go in a slow pace to accommodate make sure nobody is left behind   the role of the professor in the past being a real expert and full of knowledge far and beyond what is required was to plan and sequence what has to be taught in a pace that will meet the full agenda of the class no concern is given for students who ca n't keep the pace also the role was to challenge the students test then and answer any question they may have this includes debates over any topic related to the class material   gt i think the vast majority of work related skills that people develop are learned on the job   absolutely true or let 's put it this way the best school was is and will be a master and an apprentice which is somewhat still done in germany and is the only way medical students learn because no choice the life of others is in their hands    by the way masters have zero patience for who do n't show a promise masters also have little talent in teaching but masters have long term 1000 patience to show again and again correct again and again demand explain and challenge their   to the point the masters actually do n't do much work and instead just teach in their own special way

you can definitely do it but refinancing would make more sense to you you can refinance at no cost and get rates below 4 so you 'll be saving 1 a year without paying anything extra if you pay the fees you 'll get even lower rates but then you need to check whether its worth it i 've just refinanced to a 15 years fixed mortgage at no cost a couple of months ago and got rate in california so its definitely worth looking into do n't just dismiss it this will limit your flexibility though because paying loan as if is much more flexible than committing on loan you can always go back to your original payments if you want to spread it out a bit more you can add a heloc once you 've accumulated some equity to back you up that 's what i did

i like the answers others gave if it 's some substantial debt you definitely could go the bankruptcy route but it damages your future also it 's morally unethical to borrow all that money and not intend to pay second if you can pay off the entire balance and clear out the 23 interest than i 'd do that first one less bill to concern yourself with now let 's say you 've been making $ 100 payments monthly on each card my assumption for this examples sale now instead of paying $ 100 to the remaining cards balance each month and saving the other $ 100 pay $ 200 against the remaining credit cards balance by not taking home any money this way you are tackling the liability that is costing you money every month unless you have a great investment opportunity on that remaining $ 1000 or have n't created much of an emergency fund yet i 'd consider putting more of that money towards the debt gaining 0.01 on savings interest still means you 're eating in debt monthly if you 're able to i 'd venture out to open a zero interest card and do a balance transfer over to that new card there will be a minimal transfer fee but you may get some cash back out of it and also that zero interest for a year would help hold off more interest accruing while you 're tackling the balance

make sure you are paid on volume not people   almost all companies have a requirement to recruit a certain number of others   that 's not bad it ensures the company continues to grow without having to pay advertising and training costs   that 's what the commissions are for   the largest cost of distributing a product outside of mlm is advertising and marketing   if i remember correctly this adds up to about 66 of the cost of the product   if that 's true an mlm has quite a bit of money available to pay commissions and still have their products remain relatively competitive but when all is said and done you should be paid on volume just like a sales manager position in a company   a sales manager has to hire and train a sales staff but once they are out producing the manager is paid a percentage based on the volume of their sales staff   if an mlm is setup the same way then this is good   if they are setup to pay on recruiting people then run away as quickly as you can the biggest problem with recruiting is not whether or not you can do it   it 's whether or not the people you recruit can do it i have been involved with an mlm of sorts for 10 years   it pays a nice continual flow of income   i worked it hard for about 6 years and have ever since   the problem was attrition   it was greater than i ever imagined   it became very   i never have and never will be a high pressure person   i would show them the business and if they were interested great if not great   the problem was that people became interested but did n't have the skills to be successful   i should never have let them join the business   so they leave the business and say that mlm is bad   no it just was n't right for them or they were n't right for it regardless of what business you join make sure that you believe that everyone you introduce to the business has the ability to do the same thing you are doing   if they do great otherwise do n't even show it to them

you 'd have to consult a lawyer in the state that the transaction took place to get a definitive answer   and also provide the details of the contract or settlement agreement that said if you clearly presented the check as payment verbally or otherwise and they accepted and cashed the check and it cleared you should have good legal standing to force them to finalize the payment    while they had every right to refuse the payment and also every right to place a hold on the credit until the transaction cleared their bank they do n't have the right to simply claim the payment as a gift just because it came in a different form than they specified in the contract   obviously this is a lesson learned on reading the fine print though   and to be frank it sounds like someone wants to make life difficult for you for whatever reason and if that is the case i would refer back to my initial comment about contacting a lawyer in that state

i do n't think it makes sense to invest in an fd since 1 a 30 day fd is not very likely to give you 8 9 2 inflation is so high in india that your losing money even though you think that you are doing well enough   i would suggest you to expect a larger return and try hedging your portfolio correctly   for example you can buy a stock which is likely to go higher and to limit your risks you can buy a put option on the same stock so even if the price falls drastically you can exercise your option and not lose anything except for the premium you paid good luck

banks do n't care that you are responsible cardholder they care to make money interest rates are basically 0 by government policy and the banks charge their responsible cardholders 20 interest rates think about that for one second and realize they really do not care about your ability to avoid paying interest they only need you to slip up one month during your entire lifetime to make a profit from you it is in their interest for you to get into a spending habit from 0 promo rates so that eventually a frivolous purchase or life changing event causes a balance to stay on the card for over one month

do i need to pay taxes in india in this scenario for india tax purposes you would still qualify as resident indian as a resident indian you have to pay taxes on global income it is not relevant whether you transfer the money back to india to keep in us the income is generated and taxable   depending on your contract presumably you are working as a free lance certain expenses are allowed to be deducted from your income for example if you purchase equipment to help carry out the work stay entertainment costs etc consult a professional ca who should be able to guide you on what is eligible and what is not the balance along with your other income will be taxed as per tax brackets there is exemption for certain category of workers mostly in entertainment industry where such income is not taxable this does not apply to your case

technically yes in most cases you 'll probably get all the amt you pay for exercising in the money incentive stock options isos credited back to you practically however inflation could significantly reduce the value of the money when you get it back remember you can only recover the differential between regular income tax and the tentative minimum tax each year depending on your situation that could be a few thousand dollars or less in which case $ 50k of amt credit would take a while to use up however as you point out if you end up selling your shares you 'll likely use up all your amt credit that year so yes you 'd probably get your $ 50k of amt back but a lot of people do n't have that much to tie up in taxes for an extended period of time

i am not an expert in this stuff but my understanding is that the debt is in the form of us treasury securities which mature at set rates and are paid at maturation   so technically the us treasury pays off a portion of its debt whenever the debt securities mature   thus if china or any country buys new treasury securities at a slower rate than its currently held treasury securities are maturing the amount of us debt held by china will decrease   this is what i hear china has been doing recently

the point of the enrollment penalty is basically the same as the aca penalty   any sort of health insurance or really any insurance is funded by creating a risk pool of high and low risk people and pricing it so that the overall payments cover the total risk    that means however that on average the low risk people end up paying more than their share more than it would have cost them without the insurance any provider agreements to charge less which is significant in the health insurance business   of course some of them do end up using more than they pay but not on average assuming the risk was calculated accurately while there is n't really a completely low risk pool in medicare there is a significant difference in utilization = cost between younger 65 70 and older   as such for many health 65 year olds it would be beneficial to not enroll in medicare right away delay a few years if they 're fully healthy and wait until they are less healthy   since medicare wo n't turn you away for pre existing conditions that 's a risk some would take in order to accommodate for that medicare effectively says if you did n't help subsidize the costs of the high users when you were younger you need to pay more to make up for that fact hence the enrollment penalty    the new york times explains this in part in a 2006 article discussing part d which was new that year and has a similar penalty the purpose of the late enrollment penalty is to encourage people to    sign up as soon as possible before they have significant drug costs

best is indeed subjective you could for example get a universal life policy that pays a guaranteed interest on all monies even those in excess of what you need to pay to cover the policy most people will tell you probably correctly that using life insurance as an investment vehicle is a bad idea however   the growth of the money in a policy however is usually tax deductible and grows at a guaranteed rate here in the u.s. pays a guaranteed unless they go broke i suppose 4 per year historically however they 've been paying 6 per year that 's pretty good except a lot of your money goes into buying the policy the first few years

hsas are very similar to iras any investment returns grow tax deferred and once you reach age 59 1/2 65 you can withdraw the funds for any purpose subject to ordinary income tax just like a traditional ira if you can afford to do so i would recommend you to pay medical expenses out of pocket and let the funds in your hsa accumulate and grow in general the best way to allocate your funds is in the following order contribute to a 401(k if your employer matches funds at a substantial rate pay off high interest debt 8 of more in current environment in 2011 contribute to an ira traditional or roth contribute to an hsa contribute to a 401(k without the benefit of employer matching one advantage of hsas versus iras is that you do n't have to have earned income salary or self employment income in order to contribute if you derive income solely from rents interest or dividends you can contribute the maximum amount $ for individuals in 2011 and get a full deduction from your income of course you will need to maintain a high deductible health plan in order to qualify one downside of hsas is the lack of competitively priced providers wells fargo offers hsas for free but only allows you to keep your funds in cash earning a very measly interest rate or invest them in rather mediocre and expensive wells fargo mutual funds vanguard known for its low fee investment options provides hsas through a partner company but the account maintenance charges are still quite high overall hsas are a worthwhile option as part of your investment plan

i do n't think you understand the multiplier effect   the multiplier effect does not allow a bank to loan out more money than they have   the multiplier effect is the theory that when a bank loans out money that money will come back to the bank in the form of a deposit which they can loan out again   with this banking idea if there were enough popularity then when they loan out money they could be getting it back in the form of deposits that they can lend out again

bloomberg suggests that two fidelity funds hold preferred shares of snapchat inc preferred shares hold more in common with bonds than with ordinary stock as they pay a fixed dividend have lower liquidity and do n't have voting rights because of this lower liquidity they are not usually offered for sale on the market whether these funds are allowed to hold such illiquid assets is more a question for their strategy document than the law it is completely legal for a company to hold a non marketable interest in another even if the company is privately held as snapchat is the strategy documents governing what the fund is permitted to hold however may restrict ownership either banning non market holdings or restricting the percentage of assets held in illiquid instruments since ipo is very costly funds like these who look to invest in new companies who have not been through ipo yet are a very good way of taking a diversified position in   start ups since they look to invest directly rather than through the market they are an attractive low cost way for start ups to generate funds to grow the fund deals directly with the owners of the company to buy its shares the of the stock value reflects the accounting principle of marking to market financial assets that do not have a trade price so as to reflect their fair value this implies that fidelity believe that the total npv of the company 's net assets is lower than they had previously calculated this probably reflects a lack of revenue streams coming into the business in the case   of snapchat edit by the way since there is no market for start up stocks pre ipo my heart sinks a little every time i read the title of this question i 'm going to be sad all day now

do i make money in the stock market from other people losing money not normally the stock market as a whole on average increases in value over time so if we make the claim that the market is a zero sum game and you only make money if other people lose money that idea is not sustainable there are n't that many people that would keep investing in something only to continue to lose money to the winners the stock market and the companies inside it grow in value as the economy grows and the economy grows as workers add value with their work   here 's an analogy i can buy a tree seed for very little and plant it in the ground if i do nothing more it probably wo n't grow and it will be worth nothing however by taking the time to water it it weed it it and harvest it i can sell the produce for much more than i purchased that seed for no one lost money when i sell it i increased the value by adding my effort   if i sell that tree to a they can cut the tree into usable lumber and sell that lumber at a profit they added their efforts and increased the value   a carpenter can increase the value even further by making something useful a door for example a retail store can make that door more useful by transporting it to a location with a buyer and a builder can make it even more useful by installing it on a house   no one lost any money in any of these transactions they bought something valuable and made it more valuable by adding their effort   companies in the stock market grow in value the same way a company will grow in value as its employees produce things an investor provides capital that the company uses to be able to produce things and as the company grows it increases in value as the population increases and more workers and customers are born and as more useful things are invented the economy will continue to grow as a whole   certainly it is possible even common to profit from someone else 's loss   people lose money in the stock market all the time   but it does n't have to be this way   the stock market goes up on average over the long term and so long term investors can continue to make money in the market even without profiting from others failures an investor that purchases a share from another investor does not directly provide capital to the company   however this second investor is rewarding the first investor who did provide capital to the company   this is the reason that the first investor purchased in the first place without the second investor the first would have had no reason to invest and provide the capital   relating it to our tree analogy did the builder who installed the door help out the tree farmer   after all the tree farmer already sold the tree to the and does n't care what happens to it after that   however if the builder had not needed a door the would have had no reason to buy the tree

here is something that should help your decision currently you are 57 suppose that means that you will still work for 10 years and then be retired for another 20 before you sell the house your retirement account is nearly flat so you will have to support yourself with your own income   if there are no surprises you and your wife could expect to earn 1.16 million over the   next 10 years there will be interest on your savings but also inflation so to simplify i will ignore both that means you will have an average of 40k gross per year available to live from during the next 30 years if you get a mortgage where you only pay nett 3 interest no payback of the loan that would cost you 6k per year on interest based on if you also want to pay back the 200k difference within 30 years it would totally be close to 13k in annual now consider whether you would rather live on 40k per year in your current place or on a lower amount in a bigger place personally i would not choose to make a 200k investment at this point perhaps after trying to live on a budget for a while this has the additional benefit that you can even build some cash reserve before buying anything

if you are looking for money to speculate in the capital markets then your brokers will already lend to you at a much more favorable rate than an outside party will for instance with $ 4,000 you could easily control $ 40,000 with many brokers at a 1 interest rate this is 10:1 leverage much like how us banks operate every dollar that you deposit with them they speculate with 10x as much interactive brokers will do this for you with your current credit score they are very reputable and clear through goldman sachs so although reputable is subjective in the investment banking world you wo n't have to worry the federal government raiding them or anything if you are investing in currencies than you can easily do 50:1 leverage as an american or as anyone else this means with only $ 400 dollars you can control $ 40,000 account if you are investing in the futures market then there are many many ways to double and triple and quadruple your leverage at the lowest interests rates any contract you enter into is a loan from the market you have to understand that if you did happen to have $ 40,000 of your own money then you could get $ account size for speculating at 1 interest again these are quick ways to lose your money and owe a lot more so i 'd really advise against it a margin call in the futures market can destroy you i advise you to just think more efficiently until you come up with a way to earn that much money initially and then speculate

yes start from scratch there and keep this link open     this is where starts you off at as long as you keep that tutorial open you can always jump back to simpler concepts if you get stuck   the first problem wants you to finish the function ` ` it takes two parameters and returns either ` true ` or ` false `   for starters try writing       def vacation          return true   this is obviously not correct but it 'll show you the various inputs it used for ` weekday ` and ` vacation ` and how your function definition either passed or failed the tests   this is a surprisingly realistic way to learn programming as far as how the professionals do it

wall street salaries are rather exorbitant but its influence is far from insignificant   do you know where pensions come from the money that veterans and retirees rely on to survive hedge funds   how do the firms and companies that employ all those workers listed in greater numbers institutional money management aka hedge funds as a small subset    a company in distress and is in threat of laying off thousands of employees what can help it a private equity firm that will actively work to save and restore the company for it 's own profit but the employees will still have jobs    no large company with tens of thousands of employees can exist right now without the capital raising and transaction advisory services of an investment bank stock trading as a means to grow personal wealth would not exist    while true these institutions make a disproportionate amount money you must consider why nearly all front office jobs on wall street have hours investment banking analysts have up to 100 hours a week that 's salary per hour hedge fund managers wake up at night sweating to check asia markets to see if they 'll still have a job these are not the suburban 9 5 jobs where you can actually have weekends the high salary comes from an extremely rare skillset that 's taught only from experience not in schools high stress and commitment and the highest quality of labor mostly ivy on wall street they 've worked their asses off for these jobs    salary has to do with supply and demand i have the respect for janitorial workers because they do what we do n't want to do but their pay is n't great because anyone can be a janitor if most people in the country could build a portfolio with a sharpe ratio higher than 2 that billions of pension dollars would rely on then we wo n't have such high hedge fund salaries for example

just to be clear to start beta is a statistical property   so if your beta is 0.8 over a period of time   stock x moved on average 0.8 for a point move in the index we might hope this property is persistent and it seems to be fairly persistent predictable but it does n't have to be also it is important to note this is not a lag in time   beta is a measure of the average size of a move in the stock at the same time as a move in the index   in your example both the stock and index are measured at end of day   you can say that the stock lags behind the index because it does n't grow as quickly as the market when the market is growing but this is not a lag in time just a lag in magnitude    people do occasionally calculate betas between a stock and lagged in time market prices but this is not the commonly used meaning of beta   this might actually be a more useful measure as then you could bet on the future of the stock given what happened today in the market but these betas tend to be much more unstable than the version and hard to trade on when you calculated beta you choose a time scale in this case daily   so if your calculation is on a day to day basis then you have only tested the relationship on a day to day basis not for instance on a week to week basis   now day to day and week to week betas are often related and are generally reasonably close but they do not have to be   there can be longer term effects only picked up on the longer scale    stock x could day to day with a average beta of 1 to the stock market but could have even a negative beta year to year with the market if the stock is counter cyclical to longer scale trends on the market   so beta can change with the time scale used in the calculation

capital surplus is used to account for that amount which a firm raises in excess of the par value nominal value of the shares common stock investopedia has a much simpler answer somebody has tried to be smart on wikipedia and have done the calculations without much explanation the portion of the surplus of a business arising from sources other than earnings   all surplus other than earned surplus usually including amounts received from sale or exchange of capital stock in excess of par or stated value profits on resale of treasury stock donations to capital by stockholders or others or increment arising from revaluation of fixed or other assets the number of shares a company wants to issue is decided and agreed with the regulators they decide the par value and then decide how much premium will be charged extra money above the par value take out any of an issue and you find all these details par value = 1   issue at which investors buy = 10 premium = 9 for a single share the capital surplus is 9 multiply it by the number of shares issued and you have the total capital surplus

johnfx and provide excellent answers researching prices others have paid being up front that you 'll go buy a junker car to hold you over if they wo n't meet your price and playing a few dealerships off of each other are all great tactics in addition i 've got a few points about timing your purchase if you 're not desperate for a car these can really help give you the upper hand in negotiations wait until the end of the month dealerships and individual salespeople usually have quotas that they 're trying to clear and the month is usually the standard cutoff the last time i bought a car the salesman made the mistake of mentioning i do n't usually work but i 'll be in this thursday thursday was the 31st i inferred from this information that he had n't made his quota for the month yet so i came back on the 31st to negotiate and managed to hammer out a pretty good deal wait until about an hour before the dealership closes to show up and shop this gives you enough time to not be obvious about the tactic but you 'll definitely be holding them past their normal quitting time if you do much negotiating the salesman will be   a little more inclined to make a deal so he can get home and have dinner bonus points if you can wait until a month that ends on a friday

gold is not debt money is debt whatever it is made of   in the example above everything could have been exactly the same except using certificates written on sharks instead of on paper    now sharks have value paper has value and gold has value when you print money the stuff you make it out of has some utility separate from its use as currency but when you are using it as currency regardless of what it is made from it is a marker for debt    you go to work for an hour your boss gives you a marker that you can trade for a cheeseburger or some gasoline or a or or whatever you want that marker is an iou for the work you did you give it to the store and it becomes an iou for the value of one they give it to the store employees or the grower or whatever and so on    it does n't matter what that marker is made out of its function is the same if it were gold you could melt it down and make a ring out of it if it 's paper you could use it as a bookmark or a shopping list or to blow your nose if it 's a shark you scare people with it in the pool   this is totally separate from the question of whether we should be using gold as a currency which has to do with the fact that the gold supply is a lot more stable than the paper supply and whether being able to easily print more money on demand is a good thing or a bad thing

i think you are thinking too hard about this if a billionaire 's assets increase 70 in the stock market he created $ 700 m in new wealth   if 300 people each create a million dollars in new wealth we have 300 new millionaires creating 300 m in wealth but still 70 of wealth among the people was created by the billionaire 300 new millionaires is still a good thing no matter what you think about how to tax a billionaire 's assets

well which is why healthy markets have regulations because it turns out that the free market dream that people only spend in their own self interest belies that fact that our own self interests are often not so damn short term   it is nt a failure of community it is a failure of government    it is naivety to think even good people would change the world through their shopping habits look at all the companies using slave labor and people decry it all the time and still shop there look at how damn dirty oil just   environmentally and yet we still put it in our car every day because people think short term they think of themselves and not society and well all of us have trouble with externalities costs like war protecting the oil fields is nt paid for at the pump

sometimes very often there is two things at play with the good ones you exchange money for a service that cuts down on the time it takes to learn or improve certain skills this can be done by specific trainings this can be done by making a digestible summary of information etc   in that case i do n't think it 's a waste of time or a waste of money however on facebook you see a lot of business trainers that do n't bring added value the one literally repeating what facebook has in their manuals but charge for it the ones who are not bringing new insights on how you can improve and run your business or how you can improve your management skills because as your business grows you will need to learn more of those and you 'll have less time to learn them in it 's about weeding the bullshit out

the reserve bank of australia 's role in monetary policy has three objectives currency stability primarily keeping inflation within a narrow band full employment and improved prosperity and welfare its primary weapon in this is its setting of a target for the cash rate the overnight money market interest rate charged between financial intermediaries short term market rates closely track this cash rate target because the reserve bank controls the supply of funds that banks use to settle the transactions that use the overnight money market interest rates australian capital markets are liquid with many deposits loans being on variable rate or short term rates hence changes to the cash rate quickly propagate throughout the market nb that the changes propagate but not all interest rates are at the same level the absolute values do n't propagate different interest rates will reflect different loan periods and different perceptions of risks banks are profit so they wo n't loan at a lower rate to one borrower if they can loan the same money to someone else at a higher interest rate and the same or lower risk and they wo n't lend money out unless they can cover the cost of their own borrowing plus overheads plus a reward for the risk of the loan hence the home loan rates of all banks will tend to move in the same direction by broadly the same amount at the same time

as i understand it a company raises money by sharing parts of it ownership to people who buy stocks from it   it 's not ownership in quotes it 's ownership in a non ironic way   you own part of the company   if the company has 100 million shares outstanding you own of it per share it 's small but you 're an owner   in most cases you also get to vote on company issues as a shareholder though non voting shares are becoming a thing   after the initial share offer you 're not buying your shares from the company you 're buying your shares from an owner of the company   the company does n't control the price of the shares or the shares themselves i get that some stocks pay dividends and that as these change the price of the stock may change accordingly the company pays a dividend not the stock   the company is distributing earnings to it 's owners your proportion of the earnings are equal to your proportion of ownership   if you own a single share in the company referenced above you would get $ 1 in the case of a $ 100,000,000 dividend of the dividend for your ownership stake i do n't get why the price otherwise goes up or down why demand changes with earnings and speculation on earnings   companies are generally valued based on what they will be worth in the future    what do the prospects look like for this industry   a company that only makes typewriters probably became less valuable as computers became more   was a new law just passed that would hurt our ability to operate   did a new competitor enter the industry to force us to change prices in order to stay competitive   if we have to charge less for our product it stands to reason our earnings in the future will be similarly reduced    so what if the company 's making more money now than it did when i bought the share presumably the company would then be more valuable none of that is filtered my way as a part owner   yes it is as a dividend or in the case of a company not paying a dividend you 're rewarded by an appreciating value why should the value of the shares change a multitude of reasons generally revolving around the company 's ability to profit in the future

basically the money you pay in student loan interest is tax deductible which means as far as the irs is concerned you did n't make that money however what that saves you on your taxes is a percentage of a percentage you save the amount of your current marginal rate on the money you paid as interest simple example with made up numbers let 's say you had a student loan outstanding and you were making payments of $ 150 monthly on it total payments to said loan in one tax year would be $ 1800 of that amount let 's for the sake of argument say that half $ 900 was interest you get your with that number on it and reduce your taxable income by that amount you 're currently doing well not outstanding but ok so you 're in the 25 tax bracket that most single middle are in so your reduction in taxable income of $ 900 saves you the 25 that those 900 would have been taxed at which is $ 225 so all told this loan is a net drain on your disposable income of $ of which $ 675 is pure cost of capital you never received a dollar in disbursements to match this amount you 're paying so it 's money lost now in return for previous gains 10 years later you pay off the debt now that $ 1800 is yours to keep and to pay full   taxes on you pay $ 225 more in taxes actually because of amortization the amount of additional taxes has been steadily increasing as the interest portion of the loan payments has reduced but have the remaining $ in your pocket to do something else while there is good debt and bad debt debt is debt whether deductible or not the irs will never credit your tax bill in the amount of interest owed afaik if someone knows of a loan whose interest is a credit instead of a deduction i 'm all ears so the deduction on this loan reduces your cost of capital to an effective apr of 4.5 and because it 's a student loan and not a mortgage you do n't have to itemize so this is in effect a free deduction even with an fha mortgage allowing me to deduct interest property taxes and pmi and the residual medical costs after insurance of having our new baby the $ standard deduction for my wife and i was still the better deal this year but you 're still losing 4.5 per year to interest that 's your break even if the money you could use to pay your debt could earn a better return than 4.5 then invest it but if not pay off the loan right now investments that could make you 4.5 are at the bottom edge of a steep increase in risk and variance so if your expected roi is close i 'd lean toward paying off the debt

the are a couple of explanations that i can think of though for determining exactly what is different you will want to print out both returns and compare them line by line to see how they differ if the company up your income to account for the taxes on housing possibly by paying the additional withholding you may be just benefiting from them estimating your tax rate this can especially be the case if your only work was the three month internship they would have to assume your salary was for the entire year there is an earned income tax credit for low wage earners that you may have qualified for it would depend your specific circumstances if you meet the criteria but that credit for a range of income actually pays out more the more you earn to encourage working that extra hour instead of reducing benefit because you had another hour of employment as for the housing subsidy itself while the value is quite high the irs considers that to be a taxable benefit that the employer provided you and so it needs to be added to your w-2 wages $ 8k a month seems quite high but i do n't know the quality of the apartment you were provided and what the going rates are in the area given that you said you worked for a major tech company i can imagine that you might have been working in an area with high rents if the employer did gross up your paycheck so as to cover your taxes that $ 24k would also include that extra tax payment e.g. if the employer paid $ 8k in additional taxes for you then the housing cost that they directly paid were $ 16k

there are two options according to wells fargo you can either apply for a business commercial equity loan or a line of credit a loan is what it sounds like they give you a lump sum of money for you to use and you have to pay it in monthly installments a line of credit is like a credit card you have money that you can borrow up to a certain amount and you have to make monthly payments the process can differ for different business they probably look at what your real estate is worth how much money you are generating from it etc i am not recommending or endorsing wells fargo other major banks offer the same types of products wells fargo just happened to appear first when i searched for business line of credit

you should never invest in a stock just for the dividend dividends are not guaranteed i have seen some companies that are paying close to 10 dividends but are losing money and have to borrow funds just to maintain the dividends how long can these companies continue paying dividends at this rate or at all would you keep investing in a stock paying 10 dividends per year where the share price is falling 20 per year i know i would n't some high dividend paying stocks also tend to grow a lot slower than lower or non dividend paying stocks you should look at the total return both dividend yield and capital return combined to make a better decision you should also never stay in a stock which is falling drastically just because it pays a dividend i would never stay in a stock that falls 20 30 50 or more just because i am getting a 5 dividend regarding taxation some countries may have special taxation rules when it comes to dividends just like they may have special taxation rules for longer term capital gains compared to shorter term capital gains again no one should use taxation as the main purpose to make an investment decision you should factor taxation into your decision but it should never be the determining factor of your decisions no one has ever become poor in making a gain and paying some tax but many people have lost a great portion of their capital by not selling a stock when it has lost 50 or more of its value

there are certain situations where you could legally pay yourself rent but it 'd be in the context of multiple business entities interacting never in the context of an individual renting their own property   even if you could any rent paid to yourself would count as rental income so there 'd be no benefit edit i was hunting for examples where it might be acceptable and did n't but i found a good explanation as to why it is not acceptable from brandon hall on a post to get technical you will be going up against the economic substance    doctrine which states that a transaction has economic substance if    1 the transaction changes in a meaningful way apart from federal    income tax effects the taxpayer â€™s economic position and 2 the    taxpayer has a substantial purpose apart from federal income tax    effects for entering into such transaction by transferring your primary residence into a llc you would not be    changing your economic position further you do not have a    substantial purpose for entering into such transaction other than to    simply avoid paying federal income taxes so it might make sense if multiple people owned the llc that owned the property you wanted to rent and there are instances where company x owns holding company y that owns an office building that company x rents space in but if you 're the sole player in the llc 's then it sounds like a no go

the biggest challenge with owning any individual stock is price fluctuation which is called risk the scenarios you describe assume that the stock behaves exactly as you predict price portfolio doubles and you need to consider risk one way to measure risk in a stock or in a portfolio is sharpe ratio risk adjusted return or the related ratio one piece of advice that is often offered to individual investors is to diversify and the stated reason for diversification is to reduce risk but that is not telling the whole story when you are able to identify stocks that are not price correlated you can construct a portfolio that reduces risk you are trying to avoid 10 tax on the stock grant but need to accept significant risk to avoid the 10 differential tax $ 1000 an alternative to a single stock is to invest in an etf much lower risk which you can buy and hold for a long time and the price growth of an etf ex spy can be charted versus your stock to visualize the difference in growth fluctuation look up the beta volatility of your stock compared to spy for example ibm compare the beta of ibm and tsla and note that you may accept higher volatility when you invest in a stock like tesla over ibm what is the beta of your stock and how willing are you to accept that risk when you can identify stocks that move in opposite directions and mix your portfolio look up beta balanced you can smooth out the variability reduce the risk although you may reduce your absolute return this can not be done with a single stock but if you have more money to invest you could compose the rest of your portfolio to balance the risk for this stock grant keep the grant shares and still effectively manage risk some years ago i had accumulated over 10,000 shares grants options in a company where i worked during the time i worked there their price varied between $ 30/share and < $ 1/share i was able to liquidate at $

you need an accountant and/or a lawyer who is familiar with the us tax code and the rules in south korea assuming from your tag as the interest will be money generated in the us you could be required to withhold some of the interest and remit it to the irs i believe 30 withholding rate since south korea is a treaty country your friend can complete and sign a form w8-ben and give it to you so you may withhold a lower amount your friend would need to file a return if too much was withheld they may also get taxed in south korea there are probably rules in south korea about minimum interest that must be charged similar to applicable federal rates for the us so check with your accountant or lawyer for this if you craft it correctly you will be able to have a loan as a mortgage with the house properly secured which then would allow you to deduct mortgage interest rates from your return as far as i am aware there is no maximum amount for loans

you do n't need a book you need to dig into the business and understand what has changed how long has there been a struggle to make ends meet what seasonality exists for the business look at the period over period change for each product category as well as each line item expense and find correlations that may exist if it 's possible find similar insights about competition both brick and mortar as well as online    it 's important to analyze the results of the business to understand 1 the normal and flows of the jewelry store seasonality and 2 any erosion of the business to online or brick and mortar competitors the other important takeaway is that you have to identify any changes in the business expenses are utilities suddenly taking up more of a share of the profits or are the costs of raw materials on the rise   look at the cash flow to see where the money is going or if there is a revenue problem if business is down and revenue as a result you know where to start perhaps the answer is marketing or providing additional products or services that better match the needs of the clientele who are dropping off i.e. online ordering and free shipping or product pricing is elevated above the competition on the other side if expenses have gotten out of control you know where to apply controls keep in mind that these are not mutually exclusive and the business could have a revenue and an expense problem   if you 've studied economics you have the skills to understand the numbers and drive out the answers but this problem requires application and not philosophy sociology or economics no single book can give you the step by step process every business is unique and no one but your family can provide the insights necessary to analyze the results    best of luck reach out with any additional questions

the government program to keep the unemployed from gaming the system that they mention is n't really what the article is about   most of their complaints are about internships apprenticeships and unpaid overtime for salaried employees   the sectors that are most notorious for these sort of things are those that are often over saturated with qualified candidates   i work in graphic design   the for profit colleges in the us churn out graphic design graduates is high numbers   it 's an easy program to sign people up for because is sounds fun   art is fun computers are fun   make it a career   however there really are n't that many graphic design positions available   lots of unemployed or underemployed graphic designers means that more of them are willing to work for cheap or free to beef up their resumes   cheap freelance options means companies are getting rid of in house designers   those of us that are left can no longer earn what we 're worth but to keep doing what we love we have to suck it up and work the long unpaid hours for less pay   similar things are taking place in a lot of sought after professions like finance law advertising public relations government and various non profits   it 's not terribly ethical but it 's hard to blame employers for not paying interns then they 're for a chance to run coffee just to get a foot in the door   tl;dr people want their long term career choice worse than they want to get paid immediately

for manual conversion you can use many sites starting from google type 30 usd in yuan to sites like xe.com mentioned here for conversion you could use google calculator api or many other currency exchange apis that are available beware however that if you do it on the real site the exchange rate is different from actual rates used by banks and payment processing companies while they use market based rates they usually charge some premium on currency conversion meaning that if you have something for 30 dollars according to current rate it may bet yuan but if he uses a credit card for purchase it may cost him for example yuan you should be very careful about making difference between snapshot market rates and actual rates used in specific transaction

let me provide a general answer that might be helpful to others without addressing those specific stocks dividends are simply corporate payouts made to the shareholders of the company   a company often decides to pay dividends because they have excess cash on hand and choose to return it to shareholders by quarterly payouts instead of stock buy backs or using the money to invest in new projects i 'm not exactly sure what you mean by dividend yield traps   if a company has declared an dividend for the upcoming quarter they will almost always pay   there are exceptions like what happened with bp but these exceptions are rare   just because a company promises to pay a dividend in the approaching quarter does not mean that it will continue to pay a dividend in the future   if the company continues to pay a dividend in the future it may be at a significantly different amount some companies are structured where nearly all of there corporate profits flow through to shareholders via dividends   these companies may have unusually high dividends but this is simply a result of the corporate structure     let me provide a quick example certain etfs that track bonds pay a dividend as a way to pass through interest payments from the underlying bonds back to the shareholder of the etf there is no company that will continue to pay their dividend at the present rate with 100 certainty   even large companies like general electric slashed its dividend during the most recent financial crisis   so to evaluate whether a company will keep paying a dividend you should look at the following update in regards to one the first stock you mentioned this sentence from the companies of yahoo finance explains the unusually dividend the company has elected to be treated as a reit for federal income tax purposes and would not be subject to income tax if it distributes at least 90 of its reit taxable income to its share holders

paying off a loan early is n't a bad thing   having a credit card for 6 months and then closing it is probably unneeded pay it off and then keep it as an emergency card    the key is debt available credit ratio   look at this article for example which explains the different elements the only one you 're affecting here is the second your debt load   if you 're not planning on asking for another loan in the next six months none of this really matters assuming you are paying it off for sure in six months your debt will be gone and your credit score recovered from any hit it takes and if you get a $ 1500 credit card and only put $ 300 on it it might actually improve your credit but having an open $ 1500 credit card with a 0 balance will probably improve your credit rating unless you have a really high amount of available credit   it will improve your debt credit ratio ie total $ you owe divided by total $ you could put on your ccs revolving credit this is all aside from the is it a good idea to borrow money for a 3 month vacation before starting working which the answer is well not exactly   that 's not from a credit perspective just from a living within your means perspective   if you have a firm job that will easily pay off the vacation it 's probably not a bad thing but definitely a certain number of people will take this and end up in spending bad habits that last their life   be aware of that and if you 're just loaning yourself money from the future make sure you understand the terms of that loan and are certain you can pay it off

a combination of market research and tax law would likely be the combination used to set the salary an of each taxes in canada and the us there can be differences in how payments are treated if they are salary e.g payroll taxes such as cpp social security and others may apply in this case as well as personal income tax rates or dividends which may have different treatments in some jurisdictions i believe if salary above $ 250,000 is taxed at 40 and dividends are taxed at 15 which rate would you rather pay this is hypothetical as no jurisdiction has been noted here yet most provinces and states in north america will tax the first few dollars at rather low rates and so it is n't bad to take a nominal rate of $ 1 or so in salary as usually the higher rates exist for higher salaries executive compensation has come under scrutiny in recent years though it is usually a mix of salary bonuses and stock either restricted or options market research some companies may research what other small public companies would pay executives as the salary may have to be approved by a board of directors in some cases at least this would be how i remember things being decided in small companies i worked for in washington state and the province of alberta in a lot of company cases excess earnings are stored and if there is enough of a pile then a special dividend may be given out though some corporate structures like reits force dividends to maintain their tax status note the payment in dividend here requires that the president be able to dictate what happens with the cash in the bank of a company which is n't going to be the case for the regular employee also the dividends here would go to all the shareholders and thus if there are people besides the president owning shares they would also get their portion based on what they own

the closest thing to a libertarian society to my mind the american revolution was relatively stable and amazingly prosperous for hundreds of years to my mind the shows that it is possible at least to some extent   the defining characteristic of a government is that the majority of people perceive their usage of aggressive force as legitimate without that sense of legitimacy no government could ever rule that is why i think that anarchy is stable coercion is just vastly more expensive than co operation without a body of people willing to pay for their own coercion organisations that seek to coerce will be at an incredible economic disadvantage   you want to be careful writing things off as impossible just because of history before the wright brothers all attempts at powered flight had failed as well we must always keep the goal in mind even if we are still unsure of how to attain it

a stock dividend is n't exactly a split example you have 100 shares of stock worth $ 5 a share total value $ 500 the company wants to distribute a dividend worth 1 you could expect a check for $ 5 but if they wanted to do a stock dividend they could send you 0.01 shares for every share you own in your case you will be given a single share worth $ 5 now you own 101 shares why a share dividend it does n't take cash to give the dividend it keeps the money invested in the company some investors re invest a cash dividend some do n't   a cash dividend is generally taxable income for the investor a stock dividend is n't some investors prefer one over the other but it depends on their specific financial picture neither a stock dividend a cash dividend or split changes anything   the split changes the price to meet a goal the cash dividend lowers the price by sending excess cash to the investors the stock dividend lowers the price by creating new shares and retaining cash   it company picks the message and the method depending on their goals and situation remember that a company may want to give a dividend because they have a history of doing so but not have the cash to do so it is like a split because the number of shares you own will go up and the price per share will go down but a split is generally done to bring the price of a share to within a specific range the company sees a benefit to having a stock mid priced instead of very high or very low

the way to resolve your dilemma is to consult the price to rent ratio of the property according to the price to rent ratio is a measure of the relative affordability of renting and buying in a given housing market it is calculated as the ratio of home prices to annual rental rates so for example in a real estate market where on average a home worth $ 200,000 could rent for $ 1000 a month the price rent ratio is that â€™s determined using the formula $ 200,000 Ã· 12 x $ 1,000 also goes on to give a table comparing different cities price to rent ratio and then claim that the average price to rent ratio is currently if your price to rent ratio is lower than then yes your rents are more expensive than the average house claims that a high price to rent ratio is an argument in favor of tenants renting properties while a low price to rent ratio favors people buying either to live in the property or to just rent it out to other people so let 's apply the price to rent ratio formula towards the properties you just quoted there 's a specific house i could buy for 190 perhaps even less that rents for exactly 2000 month 12 = there 's a house for sale asking 400 been on the market 2 yrs could probably get for 350 which rents for 2800   12 = 12 = one can quite easily today buy a house for that would rent out for 1700 2100 month   lower bound 12 = upper bound 12 = even so the rental returns here seem ridiculously high to me based on other markets i 've noticed considering how the average price to rent ratio is and your price to rent ratio ranges from to you are indeed correct they are indeed ridiculously high qualification i was involved in real estate and used the price to rent ratio to determine how long it would take to recover a person 's investment in the property keep in mind that it 's not the only thing i care about and obviously the price to rent ratio tends to expenses involved in actually owning properties and trying to deal with periods of vacancy there 's also the problem of taking into account demand as well according to detroit mi has the lowest price to rent ratio with which should suggest that people should buy properties immediately in this city but that 's probably more of a sign of people not wanting to move to detroit and bid up the prices of properties edit i should also say that just because the properties are ridiculously expensive right now does n't mean you should expect your rents to decrease rather if rents keep staying at their current level i 'd predict that the property values will slowly increase in the future thereby raising the price to rent ratio to non ridiculous mode

target date funds automatically change their diversification balance over time rebalancing and new contributions to become progressively more protective of what you 've already earned as opposed to other funds which continue to maintain the same balance of investments until you explicitly move the money around you can certainly make that same evolution manually we all used to do that before target funds were made available and many of us still do so i 'm still handling the relative allocations by hand but i 'm also close to my retirement target so a target fund would n't be changing that much more anyway and since i 'm already tracking the curve note that if you feel a bit or a bit more cautious than the average investor the target fund was designed for you can tweak the risk benefit curve of a target date fund by selecting a fund with a target date a bit later or earlier respectively than the date at which you intend to start pulling money back out of the fund

the expense ratio reduces the return of the etf your scenario of paying is that of a load   most all etfs can be bought without paying a load sales charge as a percent of amount invested and some etfs can be bought without paying a brokerage fee fixed or variable charge for a buy transaction just like buying any other stock   through the brokerage because the brokerage has waived it   your broker   might charge fees for both buying and selling shares in an etf but in any case this is quite separate from the expense ratio

gt one is whether prices are correlated to each other for long periods of time as a preliminary study suggested which would go against efficient markets hypothesis since you could use that info to game the market or if that result is illusory and the long term returns are close to a standard normal distribution which would follow the markets   the fascinating thing about this is that the returns themselves show no correlation at all at any time scale but the absolute returns do   i.e. following a sharp rise drop in price you can predict that a sharp rise drop is likely to follow you just ca n't say in which direction   and this effect carries over for long periods   given that by the central limit theorem the sum of identically distributed random variables to a gaussian leads one to think that short term returns ought to be gaussian also   however they 're not   evidently there is something very subtle going on

in finance a lot say corporate tax is the original sin   corporate taxes make debt financing more attractive so every company 's debt ratio is much higher than it would be if there were no corporate tax which makes them more vulnerable to shocks in cashflow and at higher risk of default in a downturn   a slight downturn can snowball into a larger one because companies are so heavily debt financed they end up unable to service their debt and end up in worse situations than if they were more equity financed subsequently banks become much more important in the economy because everyone is more leveraged and more company value is tied up in bank debt balances   of course the voting public does n't generally want to lower the corporate tax rate because the general population believes this is how they get their pound of flesh out of corporate america however that is rarely the case

i do nâ€™t know specifics of the situation but one possibility would be that buffett may have billions in various assets etc companies he owns stocks bonds but if he does nâ€™t sell any of those stocks or cash in any of those bonds then on paper he did nâ€™t make any money that year because he â€™s letting the assets appreciate i would say net income is the amount of income you claimed that year so if you had sold some stock the amount of money you sold them for would be your income as opposed to net worth being if they wanted to if buffett sold all of his stocks and assets he would be able to get billions for it so while he technically is worth billions on his tax returns he does nâ€™t claim much income

whole life is life insurance that lasts your whole life   seriously since the insurance company must make a profit and since they know they will always pay out on a whole life policy whole life tends to be very expensive and has lower death benefits than a term policy some of these policies are paid up policies meaning that they are structured so that you do n't have to pay premiums forever   but what it amounts to is that the insurance company invests your premiums and then pays you a smaller dividend much like banks do with savings accounts unless you are especially risk averse it is almost always a better decision to get an inexpensive term policy and invest the money you save yourself rather than letting the insurance company invest it for you and reap most of the benefits if you are doing things properly you wo n't need life insurance your whole life as retirement investments will eventually replace your working income

the swiss franc has appreciated quite a bit recently against the euro as the european central bank ecb continues to print money to buy government bonds issues by greek portugal spain and now italy   some euro holders have to the swiss franc in an effort to preserve the savings from the massive euro money printing   this has increased the value of the swiss franc   in response the swiss national bank snb has tried to intervene multiple times in the currency market to keep the value of the swiss franc low   it does this by printing swiss francs and using the newly printed francs to buy euros   the snb interventions have failed to suppress the swiss franc and its value has continued to rise   the snb has finally said they will print whatever it takes to maintain a desired peg to the euro   this had the desired effect of driving down the value of the franc which effect will this have long term for the euro zone it is now clear that all major central bankers are in a currency devaluation war in which they are all trying to each other   the snb was the last central bank to join the printing party   i think this will lead to major inflation in all currencies as we have not seen the end of money printing   will this worsen the european financial crisis or is this not an important factor i 'm not sure this will have much affect on the ongoing european crisis since most of the european government debt is in euros should this announcement trigger any actions from common european people concerning their wealth if a european is concerned with preserving their wealth i would think they would begin to start diverting some of their savings into a harder currency   europeans have experienced rapidly depreciating currencies more than people on any other continent   i would think they would be the most experienced at preserving wealth from central bank shenanigans

yes you can send in a 2012 1040-es form with a check to cover your tax liability however you will likely have to pay penalties for not paying tax in timely fashion as well as interest on the late payment you can have the irs figure the penalty and bill you for it or you can complete form 2210 on which these   matters are figured out yourself and file it with your form 1040 the long version of form 2210 often results in the smallest extra amount due but is considerably more time consuming to complete correctly alternatively if you or your wife have one or more paychecks coming before the end of 2012 it might be possible to file a new w-4 form with the hr department with a request to withhold additional amounts as federal income tax i say might because if the last paycheck of the year will be issued in just a few days time it might already have been sent for processing and hr might tell you it is too late but depending on the take home pay it might be possible to have the entire $ 2000 withheld as additional income tax instead of sending in a 1040-es the advantage of doing it through withholding is that you are allowed to treat the entire withholding for 2012 as satisfying the timely filing requirements so no penalty for late payment even though you had a much bigger chunk withheld in december and no interest due either   if you do use this approach remember that form w-4 applies until it is replaced with another and so   hr will continue to withhold the extra amount on your january paychecks as well   so file a new w-4 in january to get back to normal withholding fix the extra exemption too so the problem does not recur in 2013

this is a classic case of sunk cost fallacy the basic idea is this do n't look at how much you 've invested look at what the thing is worth it sounds like you are no longer able to keep up so the financial answer is to stop making repairs etc   the only question is whose name is on the deed if your coworker still owns the asset you can simply back out say the mobile home is yours any repairs and payments i made are yours too   basically you will be out all of your work and what you put into it but you 're not continuing to dig a hole your coworker should consider your investment as a gift but a gift that is no longer being made if in taking over the asset he put it in your name the asset is yours to do with as you please   it sounds like you should dispose of the asset even if its at a loss either way from a financial perspective the answer is to cut your losses and be done with it all of that is of course a strictly financial answer   reading between the lines it seems like you feel guilty about not being able to honor the commitment you have made   if there is a sentimental attachment to the mobile i would suggest discussing your situation with the coworker   that 's really not a financial consideration but that does n't mean its unimportant

it seems like you are asking two different questions one is how do i know if i can afford a house the other is how do i know what type of mortage to get the first question is fairly simple to answer there 's plenty of calculators out there that will tell you what you can afford but rule of thumb is 30 of income can goto housing now what type of mortgage to get can be much more confusing because the mortgage industry makes money off of these confusing products the best thing to do in my in situations like this is to keep it simple you need to be careful buying a house so much money is changing hands and there are so many parasites involved in the transaction i would be extremely wary of anybody who is going to tell you what mortgage to get i 've never heard of a fee only independent mortgage broker and if i found one that claimed to be i would n't believe him i would just ignore all the exotic non conforming products and just answer one simple question are you the type of person that buys an insurance policy or that likes to self insure if you like insurance get a 30 year fixed mortgage if you like to self insure get a 7 year arm the average someone owns a house is 7 years plus in 7 years time it might not adjust up and even if it does you can just accelerate your payments and pay it off quickly this is the self insurance part of it if you 're like me i 'm willing to pay an extra .5 for the 30 year so that my payment never changes and i 'm never forced to move which is extremely unlikely but i like the safety i do n't like 15 year term loans because rates are so low you can get way better returns in the stock market right now so why pay off sooner then you need to heck if i had a paid off house right now i 'd refi into a 30 year and invest the money in summary pick 30 year or arm then just shop around to find the lowest rate which is extremely easy

you can hold a wide variety of investments in your tfsa account including stocks such as but if the stocks are being purchased via a company stock purchase plan they are typically deposited in a regular margin account with a brokerage firm a few companies may issue physical stock certificates but that is very rare these days that account would not be a tfsa but you can perform what 's called an in kind transfer to move them into a tfsa that you open with either the same brokerage firm or a different one there will be a fee for the transfer check with the brokerage that currently holds the stock to find out how costly that will be assuming the stock gained in value while you held it outside the tfsa this transfer will result in capital gains tax that you 'll have to pay when you file your taxes for the year in which the transfer occurs the tax would be calculated by taking the value at time of transfer minus the purchase price or the market value at time of purchase if your plan allowed you to buy it at a discounted price the discounted amount will be automatically taxed by your employer 50 of the capital gain is added to your annual income when calculating taxes owed   normally when you sell a stock that has lost value you can actually get a capital loss deduction that is used to offset gains that you made in other stocks or redeemed against capital gains tax paid in previous years or carried forward to apply against gains in future years however if the stock decreased in value and you transfer it you are not eligible to claim a capital loss i 'm not sure why you said tfsa for a family member as you can not directly contribute to someone else 's tfsa account you can give them a gift of money or stocks which they can deposit in their tfsa account but that involves that extra step of gifting and the money stocks become their property to do with as they please now that i 've hopefully answered all your questions let me offer you some advice as someone who also participates in an employee stock purchase plan holding stock in the company that you work for is a bad idea the reason is simple if something terrible happens to the company their stock will plummet and at the same time they may be forced to lay off many employees so just at the time when you lose your job and might want to sell your stock suddenly the value of your stocks has gone way down so you really should sell your company shares at least once a year and then use that money to invest in your tfsa account you also do n't want to put all your eggs in one basket you should be spreading your investment among many companies or better yet buy index mutual funds or etfs which hold all the companies in a certain index there 's lots of good info about index investing available at canadian couch potato the types of investments recommended there are all possible to purchase inside a tfsa account to shelter the growth from being taxed edit here is an article from that talks about transferring stocks into a tfsa it also mentions the importance of having a diversified portfolio

in my opinion it generally makes sense to focus all of your debt reduction energy and funds on one loan at a time there are two reasons for this it will allow you to more quickly move from 4 loans to 3 loans and then 2 and then 1 providing you with a sense of progress and motivation as you reduce the number of loans that you have your monthly minimum payment obligations will be reduced   then if you have a month with an emergency expense you will have more income available to you for your emergency without getting behind on your loans there is debate about whether to pay loans in order of the loan balance or in order of interest rate you can read about this here and here but in your case your highest interest loans also have the lowest balance so either method would have you picking the same loans first    you have already chosen wisely to start with the $ 1500 6.8 loans   send all of your $ 1000 to one of these loans and continue to work aggressively to knock out all four as quickly as possible

there are tax free bonds in the united states   they are for things like public housing and other urban projects   they are tax free for everyone but only rich people buy them   why    the issue is that the tax free nature of the bond is included in its yield   so rather than yielding say a 5 return they figure that the owner is getting 20 off due to not paying taxes   as a result they only give a 4 return but are as risky as a 5 return investment   net result only rich people invest in tax free bonds   rich is defined here to mean people paying a 20 tax on long term investment returns    or take the state and local tax salt deduction which has been in the news recently   again it is technically open to everyone   but there is also a standard deduction that is open to everyone   for the typical family state and local taxes might be 5 of income   so for a family making $ 100k a year that 's $ 5k   the same family can take a $ 13k or so standard deduction instead of itemizing   so why would they take the smaller deduction    as a practical matter two groups take the salt deduction   people rich enough to pay more than $ 13k in state and local taxes and people who also take the mortgage interest deduction   so it helps a lot of people who are rich quite a bit   and it helps a few middle class people some    but if you are lower middle class with a $ 30k mortgage on a tiny house and paying 4 interest then that 's only $ 1200 a year   add in property taxes of $ 3000 and salt of $ and that 's only $ 7k   even if the person gives $ 3k to charity the $ 13k deduction is a lot better and requires less paperwork    contrast that with someone who has $ 500k mortgage at 3.6 interest   that 's $ 18k in interest alone   add in a salt of $ 7k and property taxes of $ 50k and there 's $ 75k of itemized deductions much better than $ 13k   now a $ 7k donation to charity is entirely deductible   and even after the mortgage interest deduction goes away the other $ remains

yes they 're often a beneficial choice because it means you are earning the interest on the money instead of the government you wo n't necessarily pay taxes on it you have many options once you reach the point of wanting to do something with the money many people accumulate the wealth and then pass it down to subsequent generations without paying tax which is perfectly legal if done right others make donations to charity   those are just a couple examples but the point is that you accumulated the wealth over a long period of time and bought yourself time to decide what to do with it edit no if the investor decides to cash the money out all at once at the end it would not be equivalent assuming you had $ 1,000 to put in an account and could get a 5 return on your money and you were in the 25 tax rate the tax free account ends up with more in the end mostly by virtue of the compounding being tax free

you have made the most important first step by starting to think about your money well done firstly pay of all credit cards as quickly as you can and start to live within your means   until you have paid of your credits cards do nâ€™t spend any money of unnecessary items e.g. once your credit cards are paid off you can start living a more normal life   each time you spend money you need to ask yourself is this worth more to be then being    able to buy a new house in a few years    time you should be able to save at least half the amount you were paying of the credit card each mouth and still leave a reasonable life so setup a standing order at the start of the month to   your saving account given your age you are like to get promoted and hence have increased pay or get increments for each year of service   therefore every time your pay goes up set up a    standing order to transfer at least    half of the pay increases to a saving    account    you did not have this money    before so you will not miss it when     you save it in the long term you should be able to keep your car until it is about 15 years old so will not have the cost of buying another car   therefore once the car loan is over you can save that money as well

my view is from the netherlands a eu country con credit cards are more risky if someone finds your card they can use it for online purchases without knowing any pin just by entering the card number expiration date and security code on the back worse sometimes that information is stored in databases and those get stolen by hackers also you can have agreed to do periodic payments on some website and forgot about them stopped using the service and be surprised about the charge later debit cards usually need some kind of device that requires your pin to do online payments the ones i have in the netherlands do anyway and automated periodic payments are authorized at your bank where you can get an overview of the currently active ones con banks get a percentage of each credit card payment unlike debit cards where companies usually pay a tiny fixed fee for each transaction of say half a cent credit card payments usually cost them a percentage and it comes to much more a significant part of the profit margin i feel this is just wrong con automatic monthly payment can come at an unexpected moment with debit cards the amount is withdrawn immediately and if the money is n't there you get an error message allowing you to pay some other way credit card after all other bank account cash etc when a recent monthly payment from my credit card was due to be charged from my bank account recently someone else had been paid from it earlier that day and the money was n't there so i had to pay interest on something i bought weeks ago pro credit cards apparently have some kind of insurance i 've never used this and do n't know how it works but apparently you can get your money back easily after fraudulent charges pro credit cards can be more easily used internationally for online purchases i do n't know how it is with visa or mc issued debit cards but many us sites accept only cards that have number expiration date security code and thus my normal bank account debit card is n't conclusion definitely have one but only use it when absolutely necessary

the classic definition of inflation is too much money chasing too few goods   within a tight range say 1 3 inflation is somewhat benign   there 's a nice inflation widget at the inflation calculator which helps me see that an item costing $ 1000 in 1975 would now 2010 be about $ 4000 and $ 1000 from 1984 till now just over $ 2000 i chose those two years to make a point first i am 48 i graduated college in 1984 so in my working life i 've seen the value of the dollar drop by half on the other hand it only took 9 years from 75 84 to see a similar amount of inflation occur   i 'd suggest that the 26 year period is far more acceptable than the 9 savers should be aware of their real return vs what was a result of inflation i 'm not either way but logically have to acknowledge the invisible tax of inflation i get a say 6 return pay 2 in tax but i 'm not ahead by 4 3 may be lost to inflation on the flip side my mortgage is 3.5 after taxes that 's but less than 0 after long term inflation so as a debtor i am benefiting by the effect of inflation on what i owe   interesting also to hear about deflation as we 've grown used to it in the case of electronics but little else perhaps the ipad wo n't drop in price but every year it will gain features and competitors will keep the tablet market moving yet people still buy these items   right now there 's not enough spending i 'd suggest that good financial advice aside people as a whole need to start spending to get the economy moving the return of some inflation would be a barometer of that spending starting to occur

of the two an option is a more reliable but more expensive means to get rid of a stock as sdg said a put option is basically an insurance policy on the stock you pay a certain price for the contract itself which locks in a sale price up to a particular future date if the stock depreciates significantly you exercise the option and get the contract price otherwise you let the contract expire and keep the stock long term these are bad bets as each expired contract will offset earnings but if you foresee a near term steep drop in the stock price but are n't quite sure a put option is good peace of mind a sell stop order is generally cheaper but less reliable you set a trigger price say a loss of 10 of the stock 's current value if that threshold is reached the stop order becomes a sell order and the broker will sell the stock on the market take his commission or a fixed price depending on your broker and you get the rest however there has to be a buyer willing to buy at that price at the moment the trigger fires if a stock has lost 10 rapidly it 's probably on the way down hard and the order might not complete until you realize a 12 loss or a 15 or even 20 a sell stop limit a combination stop order and limit order allows you to say that you want to sell if the stock drops to $ x but not sell if it drops below $ x y. this allows you to limit realized losses by determining a band within which it should be sold and not to sell above or below that price these are cheaper because you only pay for the order if it is executed successfully if you never need it it 's free or very cheap some brokers will charge a token service fee to maintain a stop or stop limit however if the price drops very quickly or you specify too narrow a band the stock can drop through that band too quickly to execute the sell order and you end up with a severely depreciated stock and an unexercised order this can happen if the company whose stock you own buys another company very quickly both stocks will adjust the buying company will often plummet inside a few seconds after news of the merger is announced based on the steep drop in working capital and/or the infusion of a large amount of new stock in the buying company to cover the equity of the purchased company you end up with devalued stock and a worthless option but one company buying another is not usually reason to sell if the purchase is a good idea their stock will recover another option which may be useful to you is a swaption this basically amounts to buying a put option on one financial instrument and a call on another rolled into one option contract specifying a swap this allows you to pick something you think would rise if your stock fell and exchange your stock for it at your option for example say the stock on which you buy this swaption is an airline stock and you contract the option to swap for oil if oil surges the airline 's stock will tank sharply and you win both ways avoiding loss and realizing a gain you 'd also win if either half of this option realized a gain over the option price oil could surge or the airline could tank and you could win you could even do this naked since its your option if the airline 's stock tanks you buy it at the crashed price to exercise the option and then do so the downside is a higher option cost the seller will be no fool so if your position appears to be likely anyone who 'd bet against you by selling you this option will want a pretty high return

ugh really i thought this subreddit was smarter than this    1 you pay taxes on net income not sales expenses are tax deductible    2 this took place in the uk which operates on a different set of tax rules than many of us are familiar with   3 the company still pays other taxes even if they do n't pay income tax in the us examples would be payroll taxes including the employer portion of things like ss and medicare but i 'm sure the uk has similar programs funded in a similar manner to the extent that they own their buildings they also pay property taxes they globally source their supplies which means they also pay import taxes there are a ton of other taxes that a company pays   4 tax laws are complex because business is complex    inflammatory headlines like this serve no purpose whatsoever

that 's a pretty good writeup the conclusion is worth noting here   gt;he believes that when you add all the environmental impacts they still come out in favor of electric vehicles the union of concerned scientists agrees it found that even when you add in emissions from battery manufacturing evs generate half the emissions of a conventional car over the course of its life still consumers and investors should understand what it takes to make the materials that enable their green choices    electric cars still seem to come out on top though they could get better we need to be aware of the issues so we can hopefully push for better mining practices for greener energy and for awareness of potential trouble points such as recycling

i used to sell electronics at sears   let me tell you something about the sears i worked at   at the time sears could not figure out how to keep track of how many tvs we had   so whenever a customer wanted a tv we had to dash across the store go into the backroom get a manager to open the tv cage and physically check if we had the tv in stock     this was a colossal waste of time and we never really had more than 2 or 3 of any given tv at a time   i lost sales all the time because we did n't have tvs in stock   turns out people do n't want to wait a week to pick up a tv they bought   my coworkers and i complained to our manager about this but nothing was ever done

that 's a loaded question   economists ca n't even agree on an answer from a purely economic point of view   i will say this   i think that many people who are advocating radical cutbacks in spending republicans and tea partiers are themselves in two important ways   1 that it 's possible to balance the budget without raising revenues   i do n't think very many economists agree with this premise   even paul ryan 's plan to balance the budget should one take a hard look at the number clearly show how impossible it is   there would either have to be tax hikes or we slash the military to a fraction of its size now and leave no money for pretty much anything else like roads highways air traffic control food safety inspections education farm subsidies oil subsidies etc   2 more importantly i think there is an implicit and fundamental belief among right that the world will somehow stop what it 's doing while the us balances its budget   the belief goes that once we are fiscally healthy we will remain a superpower and ruling the world like we have for 100 years   this is fundamentally wrong   i think most people even tea partiers fail to appreciate how fundamentally important america 's debt has been to our history   we have essentially borrowed our way into power   should the right win the day and put in place radical cuts in spending america 's economic political diplomatic cultural and military influence around the world will be among to go   the dollar will and so will our standards of living   our gdp will not be able to support a a political economy that can maintain superpower status   now i do not mean to say that i do not agree with the right   from a purely economic point of view they may very well be right   i 'm not even sure there is an option   in fact a part of me is ready to accept america becoming what france and the uk are now still having relatively good standards of living but nowhere near the height of their historical powers   maybe the world will be better for it   i just do n't think tea partiers appreciate the ultimate result of what they want to see happen

it 's about time that we start antitrust against a number of massive corps   enough is enough   a mere mention by amazon that they might be going into a new industry the stocks of all companies in that industry   it 's not that amazon has a secret sauce other than firing all employees and driving them to welfare but their sheer size it brings back memories of the robber barons the massive oil conglomerates and at&amp;t that were broken up to the benefit of society

document how you came to have the stuff in the first place first to defend against potential government inquiry and second to establish that you held the asset more than one year so you qualify for long term capital gains rate   i would n't sell it privately all at once if you can avoid it    if you can prove you held it more than a year   you should pay the long term capital gains tax rate which is fairly low   you 'll keep most of it   a huge windfall often goes very badly people do n't change their financial habits burn through their winnings shockingly fast overspend it and wind up deep in debt   at the end of the crazy train their lives end up worse    that was n't your question but you 'll do better if you 're on guard for that with good planning and a desire to invest it in things which give you deferred income in the future that 's the cooler thing when your investments mean you do n't have to go to work i do n't mean donate all of it to charity but feel free   if you hold a security more than one year and donate it to charity you get a tax deduction for the appreciated value even though the security did n't actually cost you that link do not convert the btc to cash then donate the cash donate it as btc   your tax deduction works against your highest tax bracket   if you are paying in a 28 tax bracket your next $ 100 of income has $ 28 tax then for every $ 100 of charitable donation you get $ 28 back on federal it does the same to state tax and you also avoid the 10 15 capital gains tax because you did n't sell the securities   do your 1040 both ways and note the difference your charitable deduction of appreciated securities is capped at 30 of agi   any excess will carryover and becomes a tax deduction for the next year and it can carryover for several years   use a donor advised fund if you have are donating more than $ 5000 you do n't need to search for a charity that will take bitcoin and you also do n't need to pick a charity now   instead open a special type of giving account called a donor advised fund   the daf itself is a charity it specializes in accepting complex donations and liquidating them into cash   the cash credits to your giving account   you take the tax deduction in the year you give to the daf   then when you want to give to a charity you tell the daf to donate on your    you can tell them to give on your behalf anonymously or merely conceal your address so you do n't get the endless charity junk mail    the daf lets you hold the money in index funds so your charity nest egg can grow with the market   mine has more than doubled thanks to the market   this money is no longer yours at this point you ca n't give it back to yourself only to licensed charities the fidelity donor advised fund makes a big thing of taking bitcoin and i really like them i love my daf and it has been a charitable giving   it turns you into a philanthropist and that changes you life in ways i can not describe certainly makes me more level headed about money    lottery winner syndrome is just not a risk for me partly because i 'm now on the board of charities and oversee an endowment   donating generally will reduce suspicion criminals do n't do that but donating to a daf even moreso   since the daf would have to return ill gotten gains they 're involved   their lawyers will back you up   the prosecutor is up against a billion dollar corporation instead of just you   with fidelity particularly bitcoin is a crusade for them and their lawyers know how to defend bitcoin   a fidelity daf is a good play for that reason alone imo   the gory details presumably you are donating to regular charities or a donor advised fund and these are 50 limit organizations since it 's capital gains you have a 30 limit if your donation is more than 30 of agi or if you have carryover from last year you use worksheet 2 in publication you plug your donations into line 4 then the worksheet grinds through all the math and shows what part you deduct this year and what part you carryover to the next year   i specifically asked managers at two whether they were ok with someone donating a complex asset to the daf and immediately giving the entire cash amount to a charity   the daf does n't get any fees if you do that   they said not only are they ok with it most of their donors do exactly that and most daf accounts are empty   they make it on the 0.6 a year custodial fee on the other accounts and charitable giving to them     mind you you can only donate to type charities what irs calls 50 limit organizations   this actually protects you from donating to organizations who lie about their status   i 'm not with fidelity but i am a satisfied daf customer   the daf funds its overhead by deducting 0.6 per year from your giving account if you invest the funds in a mutual fund within the daf that investment pays the 0.08 to 1.5 expense ratio of the fund    i can live with that   i just the value of donating $ 100 of appreciated security instead of taking it as capital gains income   28 fed tax 15 fed cap gains 8 state tax on both   take the $ 100 as income pay $ 23 in cap gains tax   donate $ 100 in securities the $ 23 tax goes away since you did n't sell it really   the $ 100 charitable deduction offsets $ 100 in income also saving you $ 36 in regular income tax   net tax savings $ 59   however you lost the $ 100   so you are net $ 41 poorer   it costs you $ 41 to donate $ 100 to charity   this gets better in higher brackets

without knowledge of the special provisions of your loan contract the one with the highest interest rate should be paid first or if one 's fixed payment is much larger than the other and it is a burden then it should be paid first but refinancing may be an option socially speaking and possibly even economically since it could affect your reputation it is probably best to either refinance the cosigned loan or pay that off as rapidly as possible economically speaking i would recommend no prepayment since the asset that is leveraged is your mind which will last many decades probably exceeding the term of the loan but some caveats must be handled first many would disagree but i finance the way i play poker tight aggressive

hahaha grand speech good one   i 'm saying if i an outsider see a company paying people less than what i think the job is worth but somehow the company retains employees yes i say nothing because it 's none of my fucking business what a company pays it 's employees if they do n't like it they can walk if they stay as they must do in order for you to complain about it then clearly the wage is worth more than the alternative   or maybe you think the world owes you something

apart from what the other posters have said you could look at some good cause i 'd keep on saving 50 as spending more wo n't really make you more happy you already sound happy what i used to do when i could was to donate 10 of my profit per year i 'd compare year start with year end and do the math afterwards it was just a matter of choosing there are non government organizations that will get most money where it 's needed edit as soon as the business i 'm starting becomes profitable i 'll continue my donations thanks for the

gt second ensure your product experience is outstanding creating ongoing repeat from happy consumers   tivo 's customer experience is outstanding i have been a loyal tivo dvr user since 2003 and their interface and feature set is greatly superior to the junk dvrs that the cable companies provide   the problem for tivo seems to be overcoming the convenience and cost benefits that the cable company provides with their inferior product     what would have been an ideal business model for tivo would have been to get cable companies to offer tivo boxes or cable boxes with the tivo interface perhaps as an upsell product from basic dvr i honestly believe that if a user tried a tivo for a short period of time they would choose to pay a little extra for it
