people 's value of money is not always linear   consider an individual with $ 1000 in the bank   i 'm going to look at amounts of debt by orders of magnitude now its pretty easy to see a order of magnitude increase in impact from $ 100 to $ 1000 and it becomes slightly worse for the $ 10,000 case due to debt   however one more order of magnitude going to $ 100,000 and suddenly it becomes hard to argue that there 's a mere order of magnitude more hurt than the $ 10,000 case   from the cases i 've read those sorts of situations can be far far worse than the monetary cost could convey insurance companies are in a good position to absorb $ 100,000 of debt if something happens far better position than the individual   they rely on the central limit theorem in general they do n't have to pay out all at once the insurance companies have their limits too   when hurricane came through the insurance companies had a tremendously difficult time dealing with so many claims all at once   just like the individuals they found a sudden change in how much value they had to put on their monetary debts

the definition of insurance is the transfer of risk thus you 're paying for transferring of a risk of an item property to the insurer carrier so that they bear the financial burden of a loss accident and not you you could always self insure but a lot of times insurance is cheaper since due to the law of large numbers the insurer can just charge a premium that is small percentage in comparison to the cost of self insuring

for big values the loss becomes negligible say you have a 10 chance to get 10 million $ expected value 1 m you sell that chance for which loses you 10k of expected income why would you throw away 10k because in the face of getting almost 1 m the 10k are insignificant 1 m and will make you roughly equally rich also the increase from 1 m to 10 m is less than 10x since 1 m gives you maybe 90 of the freedom that 10 m does depending on how well you can make 10 m work for you most people will just let it rot in the bank another way to look at it is to look at bankruptcy risk say i have 10k in the bank which is nice those 10k can not pay for a new house or 2 cars mine and the one i hit so i have a small risk of significant loss if i buy an insurance i reduce my chance of going bankrupt from maybe 0.001 to 0 for a fairly small price usually you can buy insurance fairly cheap if you raise your deductible to maybe 5k both for the house and the car so that you shoulder the risk you can risk = gaining money and paying an insurance to shoulder the rest for you that way you minimize the cost to remove the risk of bankruptcy it makes sense to shoulder as much risk as you can unless a fixed fee of the insurance makes in before paying others to do it for you so you can optimize your income while removing fatal risks

first of all insurance never covers the cost of the item it is almost always a partial payout at best for example a typical house in the northeast us where i live that costs $ 300,000 will have the actual house valued at maybe $ and rest of the value will be in the land therefore the insured value will typically be $ 100,000 the only problem is that to actually rebuild the house might easily cost $ 250,000 so your idea that some kinds of insurance allows the beneficiary to recoup their loss is usually never true as you say from an actuarial point of view insurance is a sheer waste of money for example a typical house has maybe a 0.5 chance of burning down every year in other words out of 2000 houses maybe 1 will burn down every year so lets say you got $ 100,000 of insurance on your house then the value of that policy would be $ 100,000 2000 = $ 50 per year an insurance company will charge around $ 700 per year for the policy that means you are basically $ 650 down the toilet every year to maintain that policy the reason why they do this is what says above they are buying peace of mind a psychological product in other they imagine they are somehow safe so even though they are losing money paying it makes them feel as though they are not losing money it 's delusional but then again most people have a lot of delusions of which insurance is just one of many

disclosure i am a real estate agent involved with houses to buy sell but much activity in rentals i got a call from a man and his wife looking for an apartment he introduced itself described what they were looking for and then suggested i google his name he said i 'd find that a few weeks back his house burned to the ground and he had no insurance he did n't have enough savings to rebuild and besides needing an apartment had a building lot to sell   insurance against theft may not be at the top of your list do n't keep any cash and keep your possessions to a minimum but a house needs insurance for a bank to give you a mortgage once paid off you have no legal obligation but are playing a dangerous game you are right it 's an odds game if the cost of insurance is .5 the house value and the chance of it burning down is 1 in 300 i made this up you are simply betting it wo n't be yours that burns down   given that for most people a paid off house is their largest asset more value that all other savings combined it 's a risk most would prefer not to take   life insurance is a different matter a person with no dependents has no need for insurance for those who are married or have a loved one or for parents insurance is intended to help survivors bridge the gap for that lost income the 10 20 times income value for insurance is just a recommendation whose need fades away as one approaches independence i do n't believe in insurance as an investment vehicle so this answer is talking strictly term

there 's an old saying among commodities producers if it 's likely to happen but wo n't kill you you hedge insure options futures if it 's not likely to happen but would kill you you insure   hedging and insuring are both about managing risk if you feel there is no risk at all you do n't need to do either but feeling that you have no risk at all is somewhat naive
# 545305
regarding auto insurance you have to look at the different parts in the united most states do require a level of specific coverage for all drivers that is to make sure that if you are at fault there is money available to pay the victims that payment may be for damage to their car or other property but it also covers medical costs many policies also cover you if the other driver does n't have insurance the policy that covers the loss of the vehicle is required if you have a loan or are leasing the car somebody else owns it while there is a loan so they can and do require you to pay to protect the vehicle   if there i no loan you do n't have to have that portion of a policy other parts such as towing assistance and rental cars replacement may be required by the insurance standards for your state or might be almost impossible to drop because all insurance companies include it to stay competitive with their competition   dropping the non required parts of the coverage is acceptable when you do n't have a loan some people do drop it to save money but that does mean you are self insuring if you can afford to self insure a new car great the interesting thing is that some people have more than enough assets to self the non required part of auto insurance but then they realize that they do need to up their umbrella liability insurance this is to protect them from somebody deciding that their resources make them a tempting target when they are involved in a collision
# 39585
discussions around expected values and risk premiums are very useful but there 's another thing to consider cash flow some individuals have high value assets that are vital to them such as   transportation or housing   the cost of replacing these assets is prohibitive to them their cashflow means that their rate of saving is too low to accrue a fund large enough to cover the asset 's loss however their cashflow is such that they can afford insurance while it may be true that over time they would be better off saving that money in an asset replacement fund until that fund reaches a certain level they are unprotected thus it 's not just about being risk averse there are some very pragmatic reasons why individuals with low disposable income might elect to pay for insurance when they would be financially better off without it

there are many situations where injecting a certain amount of cash at the right time may reap rewards far in excess of the value of the cash injected for example if someone who needs a car to get to work gets in a wreck and that person does not have ready money to make it may have no choice but to secure very expensive financing   receipt of $ 1000 in ready money to repair the car may thus save the person from having to take out a loan that would cost $ 1200 or more to repay while the insurance business has sufficient overhead that it is unlikely that insurance would generally have a positive net expectation even considering such factors it is at least theoretically possible that insurance could have a positive expected value for both the insurer and the insured and in some cases it may have positive expected values for both parties in practice as well
# 257715
because people are risk averse suppose that you own an asset worth $ 10,000 to you   suppose that each year the asset has 1 chance of being stolen or completely broken   the expected value is 99 x 10,000 + 1 x $ 0 = $ 9,900 this is the average outcome if you do not buy insurance   now consider two mutually exclusive outcomes 99 chance of keeping $ 10,000 and 1 chance of losing everything expected value $ 9,900   100 chance of keeping $ 9,900 expected value $ 9,900   everyone would choose option 2 even though the expected values are the same   option 2 is an insurance that cost $ 100 fair aka the odds are fair   now suppose the insurance costs $ 150 instead of $ 100 despite that the bad probability is still 1 you are faced with   99 chance of keeping $ 10,000 and 1 chance of losing everything expected value $ 9,900   100 chance of keeping $ expected value $   some people would still choose option 2 even though the expected value is actually lower   the $ 50 is called risk premium which people are willing to pay in order to avoid uncertainty the odds are unfair but the risk premium has its value   that being said competition between insurance companies would drive down the premium until the insurance is close to fair but they have cost to cover sales administration etc making the odds unfair

lots of people make poor decisions in crises   some panic and do n't make any decision at all insurance for affordable things can provide emotional security   if something goes wrong the purchaser will not have to make a painful financial decision in a crisis   many people do not want to have the burden of arguing about money or having to spend precious cash or borrow money or raid savings accounts just at the time they are already from another loss   having insurance just take care of it can save them an emotional double whammy    several kinds of insurance fill this perceived need
# 239296
the fundamental flaw here is conflating net worth with utility at least failing to recognize that there 's a nonlinear relationship between the two   in the extreme example imagine taking a bet that will either make you twice as rich or completely broke your expected return is zero but it would be pretty dumb to take it since being flat broke could ruin your life while being twice as rich may only improve it marginally in more realistic cases most of your income is tied up in fixed costs which magnifies relatively small to your net worth losing something essential like your house or car even if it 's only 20 of your net worth renders you effectively broke until you scrape together enough cash to get another one that situation robs you of much more utility than you 'd gain from a 20 increase in net worth in either case avoiding the risk is completely rational as long as you believe in nonlinear utility as a function of net worth it 's not just an issue of humans being risk averse

# 520149
apart from legal requirements to have insurance e.g. 3rd party car that other answers have covered well we can think of all insurance as protecting our usable income as we can use cashflow to pay the costs of a loan to replace whatever we decided not to insure     so for example if i do n’t insure my house contents i can replace them on my credit card if needed therefore we are paying for insurance out of our income so as to protect our income knowing that the cost of the protection is on average more than the benefit we get from it but we all know that having an income of $ 50 k is less than double the value of having an income of $ 25k.    e.g. being able to eat and remain warm is more important to us then being able to go on anther holiday   this is way when someone has a higher income it requires more money to effect their actions loss aversion is another factor we are people not logistical machines
# 369496
most people buy insurance because it is legally required to own a car or to have a mortgage people want to own homes and to have personal transportation enough that they are willing to pay for required insurance costs there are a lot of great explanations here as to why insurance is important and i do n't want to detract from those at all however if we 're being honest most people are not sophisticated enough to measure and hedge their various financial risks they just want to own an home and to drive a car

there are several insurance products that i buy for legal reasons both of these protect me from lawsuits and fines many people buy similar products to protect their business operations e.g. medical malpractice insurance there are some insurance products i buy for tax planning and financial planning purposes i have a large amount of savings available so i have several tricks to reduce my insurance costs and i have several products that i avoid several of these reasons are mentioned in other answers but i thought i would collect them into a single answer to demonstrate that there are reasons other than the rational calculation of what the payout will be for the insurance products vs. the premium paid if i gain access to a tax advantaged health savings account that is a bigger benefit to me than avoiding the premium especially when my employer is paying the majority of the premium perhaps it makes no sense to buy insurance given sufficient savings like the products i listed that make no sense for me given my finances but not everyone can self insure it does require a certain level of wealth

insurance is bought for peace of mind and to divert disaster    diverting disaster is a good great thing   if your house burned down if someone hit your car or some other devastating event think medical happened that required a more allocation than you could afford the series of issues may snowball and cause you to lose a far greater amount of money than the initial incident   this could be in the form of losing work time losing a job having to buy transportation quickly paying a premium having to incur high rate debt and so on    for the middle income and lower classes medical house and medical insurance certainly falls into these categories   also why a lot of states have buyout options on auto insurance some will let you drive without insurance by proving bonding up to 250k.    now the other insurance as i have alluded to is for peace of mind mainly   this is your laptop insurance vacation insurance and so on   the premise of these insurances is that no matter what happens you can get back to even by paying just a little extra    however what other answers have failed to clarify is the idea of insurance   it is an agreement that you will pay a company money right now   and then if a certain set of events happen you follow their guidelines they are still in business they still have the same protocols and so on that you will get some benefit when something happens to you   we buy insurance because we think we can snap our fingers and life will be back to normal   for bigger things like medical home and auto there are more regulations but i could get 1000 comments on people getting screwed over by their insurance companies   for smaller things almost all insurance is outsourced to a 3rd party not affiliated legally with a business   therefore if the costs are too high they can simply go under and if the costs are low they continue helping the consumer that does n't need help    so we buy insurance divert catastrophe or because we have fallen for the insurance sales pitch   and an easy way to get around the sales pitch as the person selling you the insurance if you can have their name and info and they will be personally liable if the insurance company fails their end of the bargain

this is just an addition to 's answer   in order to maximize your overall wealth and wellbeing in a long run it is not enough to look only at the expected value ev in his example of always keeping $ or having $ 10000 99 of the time ev in the second case is greater $ > $ and if you are bill gates than you should not take an insurance in this case but if your wealth is a lot less than that you should take an insurance take a look at kelly criterion and utility functions if i offer you to take 100 million dollars no strings attached or to take a risk to get 200 million dollars 60 of the time and $ 0 40 of the time would you take that risk you should n't but bill gates should take that risk because that would be a very good investment for him utility functions can help you choose if you want an insurance or not maybe you want to insure your house because the value of the house is a large percentage of your wealth but on the other hand you do n't need to insure your car if it is very easy for you to afford another one but not easy to afford another house lets calculate what your wealth should be in order not to take this $ 150 insurance on a $ 10000 item if you pay $ 150 for an insurance you have guaranteed $ but choosing not to take an insurance is the same as betting $ in order to gain $ 150 99 of the time by using kelly criterion formula fraction of the wealth needed to make this bet is = + 1 = 1/3   that means that if your wealth greater than $ you do n't need an insurance but if you want to be sure it is advised to use fractional kelly betting for example you could multiply fraction by 1/2 and in that case if your wealth is more than $ you do n't need an insurance for this item
# 473835
you do n't mention what kind of insurance you 're talking about but i 'll just address one angle on the question for some kinds of insurance such as health insurance in the us auto insurance and homeowner 's insurance you may be insuring against an event that you would not be able to pay for without the insurance   for instance if you are at fault in a car accident and someone they could sue you for $ 100,000   a lot of people do n't have $ 100,000   so it 's not even a matter of i 'll take the risk of having to pay it when the time comes if the time comes you could lose virtually everything you own and still have to pay more from future earnings   you 're not just paying $ x to offset a potential loss of $ y you 're paying $ x to offset a potential of your entire life   it is plausible that you could assign a reasonable monetary value to that potential cost that would mean you actually come out ahead in the insurance equation it is with smaller expenses such as insuring a new cellphone against breakage that insurance becomes harder to justify   when the potential collateral damage of a bad event are less you must justify the insurance expenses on the financial consequences only which as you say is often difficult

# 502126
as someone who has worked for both an insurance carrier and an insurance agent the reason people buy insurance is two fold to spread risk out and to get the benefits when applicable of approaching risk as a group what you are really doing when you buy insurance is you are buying in to a large group of people who are sharing risk   you put money in that will help people when they take a loss and in exchange get a promise of having your losses covered   there is an administrative fee taken by the company that runs the group in order to cover their costs of doing business and their profits that they get for running the group well or losses they take if they run it poorly some insurances are for profit some are non profit all work on the principle of spreading risk around though and taking risk as a larger group so let 's take a closer look at each of the advantages you get from participating in insurance   the biggest and most obvious is the protection from catastrophic loss   yes you could self insure with a group size of one by saving your money and having no overhead other than your time and the time value of your money but that has a cost in itself and also does n't cover you against risk up front if you are n't already independently wealthy   a run of bad luck could wipe you out entirely since you do n't have a large group to spread the risk around   the same thing can still happen to insurance companies as well when the group as a whole takes major losses but it 's less likely to occur because there are more rare things that have to go wrong   you pay an administrative overhead for the group to be run for you but you have less exposure to your own risks in exchange for a small premium another significant but less visible advantage is the benefit of being part of a large group   insurance companies represent a large group of people and lots of business so they can get better rates on dealing with recovering from losses   they can negotiate for better health care rates or better repair rates or cheaper replacement parts   this can potentially save more than the administrative overhead and profit that they take off the top even when compared to self insuring there is an element of gambling to it but there are also very real financial benefits to having predictable costs   the value of that predictability and the lesser need for liquid assets is what makes insurance worth it for many people   the value of this group benefit does decrease a lot as the value of the insurance coverage the amount it pays out decreases   insurance for minor losses has a much smaller impact on liquidity and is much easier to self insure   cheaper items that have insurance also tend to be high risk items so the costs tend to be very high relative to the amount of protection   if you are financially able it may make more sense to self insure in these cases particularly if you tend to be more cautious   it may make sense for those who are more prone to accidents with their devices to buy insurance but this selection bias also drives the cost up further   generally the reason to buy insurance on something like a cellphone is because you expect you will break it   you are going to end up paying for an entire additional phone over time anyway and most such policies stop paying out after the first replacement anyway the reason why people buy the coverage anyway even when it really is n't in their best interest is due to two factors being risk averse as pointed out and also being generally bad at dealing with large numbers   on the risk averse side they think of how much they are spending on the item even if it is less compared to large items like cars or houses and do n't want to lose that   on the bad at dealing with large numbers side they do n't think about the overall cost of the coverage and do n't read the fine print as to what they are actually getting coverage for   this is the same reason that you always see prices one cent under the dollar    people often do n't really subconsciously get that they are paying more even if they would be able to eat the loss so they pay what feels like a small amount to offset a large risk   the risk of loss is a higher fear than the known small easy payment that keeps the risk away and the overall value proposition is n't even considered

i 've been thinking about this   here 's what i came up with   please let me know what you think     1 the whole world is on a fiat money system   the central banks were all easing together in a coordinated way   so currencies remain relatively stable relative to each other also the price of goods is n't rising nearly as quickly as the money supply is being expanded because    2 the growth of the internet globalization are deflationary because skilled people in poor countries have access to the global marketplace and are willing to produce far more per dollar than rich country citizens   3 the growth of inequality is deflationary   as wealth concentrates at the top there are fewer and fewer customers who can afford the products services that are being mass produced   so there 's a mismatch between high supply and low demand   4 a poor slow economy low spending debt defaults and business personal bankruptcy is deflationary   we treat credit as money and when debt is wiped out so is the credit that we were accounting for in the money supply   5 the money created over the last 10 years or so has n't had a chance to trickle down yet it 's still tied up in financial market instruments stocks bonds etfs etc held by mostly institutional investors until the next big bubble bursts    so there are many deflationary forces to balance out against the money creation

the only way to roll debt into a home purchase is to have sufficient down payment   under the new lending rules that took effect in canada earlier this year you must have at least 5 of the purchase price as a down payment   if you have $ 60,000 in additional debt the total amount of mortgage still can not be greater than 95 of the purchase price   below is an example purchase price of home $ 200,000 maximum mortgage $ 190,000 95 of purchase price total outside debt $ 60,000 that means the mortgage other than the current debt of $ 60k can only be $ 130,000 this means you would need a down payment of $ 70,000 also keep in mind that i have not included any other legal fees real estate commissions etc in this example since it is safe to assume that you do not have $ 70k available for a down payment renting and paying down the debt is likely the better route   pay off the credit card(s first as they have the higher interest amount best of luck

they do but you 're missing some calculations needed to gain an understanding intro to stock index weighting methods notes in part market cap is the most common weighting method used by an index    market cap or market capitalization is the standard way to measure the    size of the company you might have heard of large mid or small cap    stocks large cap stocks carry a higher weighting in this index and    most of the major indices like the s&p 500 use the market cap    weighting method stocks are weighted by the proportion of their market cap to the total    market cap of all the stocks in the index as a stock ’s price and    market cap rises it gains a bigger weighting in the index in turn    the opposite lower stock price and market cap pushes its weighting    down in the index   pros proponents argue that large companies have a bigger effect on the    economy and are more widely owned so they should have a bigger    representation when measuring the performance of the market which is    true cons it does n’t make sense as an investment strategy according to a market    cap weighted index investors would buy more of a stock as its price    rises and sell the stock as the price falls this is the exact    opposite of the buy low sell high mentality investors should use eventually you would have more money in overpriced stocks and less in    underpriced stocks yet most index funds follow this weighting method thus there was likely a point in time where the s p 500 's initial sum was equated to a specific value though this is the part you may be missing here also how do you handle when constituents change over time for example suppose in the s p 500 that a $ 100,000,000 company is taken out and replaced with a $ company that should n't suddenly make the index jump by a bunch of points because the underlying security was swapped or would you be cool with there being jumps when companies change or shares outstanding are rebalanced consider carefully how you answer that question in terms of histories dow jones industrial average and s p 500 index would be covered on wikipedia where from the latter link the composite as the s&p 500 was first called when it    introduced its first stock index in began tracking a small    number of stocks three years later in 1926 the composite index    expanded to 90 stocks and then in 1957 it expanded to its current    standard poor 's a company that out financial information and analysis was founded in 1860 by henry poor in    poor 's publishing henry poor 's original company merged    with standard statistics founded in as the standard statistics    bureau and therein assumed the name standard and poor 's corporation    the s&p 500 index in its present form began on march 4 1957    technology has allowed the index to be calculated and in    real time the s&p 500 is widely used as a measure of the general    level of stock prices as it includes both growth stocks and value    stocks in september 1962 systems corp. entered into an agreement    with standard and poor 's under the terms of this agreement    computed the s&p 500 stock composite index the stock industrial    index the 50 stock utility index and the 25 stock rail index    throughout the market day these statistics were furnished to standard    poor 's in addition also computed and reported the 94 s&p    sub there are also articles like business insider that have this graphic that may be interesting s p changes over the years the makeup of the s&p 500 is constantly changing notes in part in most years 25 to 30 stocks in the s&p 500 are replaced said    david s&p 's chairman of the index committee and while there    are strict guidelines for what companies are added the final decision    and timing of that decision depends on what 's going through the heads    of a handful of people employed by dow jones

it is a legitimate practice the dealers do get the loan money up front because they 're not holding the loan themselves they promptly sell it to someone else or more commonly just act as salesmen for a lending institution and take their profit as commission or origination fees the combined deal is often not a good choice for the consumer though remember that the dealer 's goal is to close a sale with maximum profit if they 're offering to drop the price $ 2k they either did n't expect to actually get that price in the first place or expect at least $ 2k of profit from the loan or some combination of these standard advice is to negotiate price loan and trade in separately first get the dealer 's best price on the car compare it to other dealer and other cars and walk away if you do n't like their offer repeat for the loan checking the dealer 's offer against banks credit unions available to you if you have an older car to unload get quotes for it and consider whether you might do better selling it yourself = = = = = = = = = standard unsolicited plug for reports car facts service if you 're buying a new car which is n't usually the best option late model used is generally a better value for a small fee they can tell you what the dealer 's real cost of a car is after all the hidden incentives and rebates that lets you negotiate directly on how much profit they need on this sale and focuses their attention on the fact that the time they spend haggling with you is time they could be using to sell the next one simply walking into the dealer with this printout in your hand cuts out a lot of nonsense the one time i bought new i basically walked in and said it 's the end of the model year i 'll give you $ 500 profit to take one of those off your hands before the new ones come in if you 've got one configured the way i want it closed the deal on the spot the only concession i had to make was on color   it does n't always work some salesmen are idiots in that case you walk away and try another dealer i am not affiliated in any way with cu or the automotive or lending industries except as customer and yes this touch keyboard is typo prone

most of the time you 're selling to other investors not back to the company the stock market is a collection of bid buy offers and asks sell offers when you sell your stock as a retail investor at the market price you 're essentially just meeting whatever standing bid offers are on the market   for very liquid stocks e.g. apple you can pretty much always get the displayed price because so many stocks are being traded however during periods of very high volatility or for low volume stocks the quoted price may not be indicative of what you actually pay   as an example let 's say you have 5 stocks you 're trying to sell and the bid side order book is 2 stocks for $ 105 2 for $ 100 and 5 for $ 95 in this scenario the quoted price will be $ 105 the best bid price but if you accept market price you 'll settle 2 for 105 2 for 100 and 1 for 95 after your sell order goes through the new quoted price will be $ 95 for high volume stocks there will usually be so many orders near the midpoint price $ 105 in this case that you wo n't see any price slippage for small orders   you can also post limit orders which are essentially open orders waiting to be filled like in the above example they ensure you get the price you want but you have no way to guarantee they 'll be filled or not   edit as a cool example check out the bitcoin on coinbase for a live example of what the order book looks like for stocks you 'll see that the price of bitcoin will drift towards whichever direction has the less dense order book e.g. price upwards when there are far more bids than asks

my wife and i have been car free since 2011   we spent about $ 3500 on car shares and rentals last year i went through it recently to flag trips that were medical transportation and unreimbursed work related for taxes   this compares favorably with the last year of car ownership   i had reached a point i started needing $ 200 + repairs every couple of months and the straw that broke the back was a dealer mechanic estimate but still $ 3000 estimate to pass emissions inspection    over 11 years the value went from $ to $ 3600 so it depreciated about 2k per year    i was easily spending $ 40 per week on gasoline on my last commute    i now use transit with the irs commuter benefit so i do have a base after tax transportation expense of 1200 per year   we use weekend rentals about 2x per month and do use a warehouse club   she uses rentals for her job about 12 times per year and the medical transportation came in an intense burst    access our nearest is 0.22 miles 3 blocks there are two hotels with full service rental car desks about half a mile from our house and every brand at the station a mile away   there are concrete benefits to density take every advantage insurance i always take the rental company daily insurance for $ 15 per day   certain no annual fee credit cards automatically include   every time an insurance agent cold calls me i ask for a quote for a named non owner policy i 'd probably take it if the premium was   $ 300 or less per 6 months    tips and tricks a minivan or truck rate is probably higher than a car but compared to a full service rental may be much lower the best value i spend no time in my life looking for a parking spot and spend this hour tapping away on se on a train instead of driving

my answer is that when confronted with the obvious the most common human reaction is to seek reasons for it because things have to be right they have to have a reason we do n't like it when things suck   so when finding out that you are being ripped off every day of your life your reaction is there must be a logical reason that perfectly explain why this is after all the world is fair governments are working in our best interest and if they do it this way they must have a very good reason for it sorry but that not the case you have the facts you are just not looking at them economics as a subject is the proper management of resources and production now forget the fancy theories the elaborate nonsense about stocks and bonds and currencies and pay attention to the actual situation on our planet most people earn $ 2,000 per year clean water is not available for a very sizable percent of the world 's population admittedly 90 of the world 's wealth is concentrated in the hands of the most wealthy 10 a chinese engineer earns a fraction of what a similarly qualified engineer earns in the states most people even in rich countries have a negative net value they have mortgages that run for a third of their lifetimes credit card debts loans do the balance most people are broke does this strike you as the logical result of a fair and balanced economic system   does this look like a random happenstance   the dominant theory is it just happened it 's nobody 's fault and nobody designed it that way and to think otherwise is very bad because it makes you a conspiracy theorist and conspiracy theorists are nuts you are not nuts are you look at the facts already in your possession it did n't just happen   the system is rigged when a suit typing a few numbers in a computer can make more money in 5 minutes than an average joe can make in 100 lifetimes of honest productive work you do n't have a fair economic system you have a scam machine   when you look at a system as broken as the one we have you should n't be asking yourself what makes this system right what you should be asking yourself is more along the lines of why is it broken who benefits why did congress turn its monetary policy over to the federal reserve a group of unelected and unaccountable individuals with strong ties in the banking industry and does not even bother to conduct audits to know how your money is actually managed this brilliant movie money as debt points to a number of outrageous bugs in our economic system now you can dream up reasons why the system should be the way it is and why it is an acceptable system or you can look at the fact and realize that there is no justification for an economic system that perform as badly as it does   back to basics money is supposed to represent production it 's in every basic textbook on the subject of economics so what should money creation be based on debt no gold no randomly printed by the government when they feel like it no although this could actually be better than the 2 previous suggestions money is supposed to represent production index money on production and you have a sound system why is n't it done that way why do you think that is

i 'd check the terms of the student loan it 's been a long time since i had a student loan but when i did it had restrictions that it could only be used for educational expenses which they pretty clear spelled out meant tuition books lab fees i think some provision for living expenses if your student loan is subsidized by the government they 're not going to let you use it to start a business or go on vacation nor are they likely to let you invest it even if it is legal and within the terms of the contract borrowing money to invest is very risky what if you invest in the stock market and then the stock market goes down you may find you do n't have the money to make the payments on the loan people do this sort of thing all the time that 's what buying on margin is all about and some of them lose a bundle and get in real trouble

each way you go is a little bit of a gamble    owning equity in the company is best in situations where you can trade and sell that equity or where the dilution of your royalty product would affect your returns or if you can maintain a certain equity stake without working at the company or if you can hold out on taking equity to reinvest profits for the purposes of growth    the royalty is best in situations where you 're getting a portion of the gross since you get paid as a creditor no matter how the company is performing or if you intend to collect royalties after you leave the company now for your situation if your royalties are fluctuating with profit instead of gross and your equity is tied to your continued partnership and not subject to potential growth then they 're pretty much both for the same thing you 've removed the particular advantages for each way of receiving payment if the company ever does buy out or go public how much of your additional x earning a month would you have to then re invest to get an equity stake   and for royalties if another developer came aboard or your company bought another company how much would this dilute your ip contribution so aside from the gambling nature of the issue i 'm not sure your tax calculation is right   you can take equity profit as dividend as long as you 're collecting a sufficient salary this prevents a business from declaring all profits as a dividend   this would put those profits into a different tax bracket 15 capital gains or if all profits are split you could take part as salary part as dividend   as well as someone who 's making active income off of their ip not passive income you 're supposed to file a schedule c not a schedule e so your royalties would include your self employment taxes   the schedule e is for royalties where the author is n't actively in the field or actually self employed in that area or if you own royalties on something you did n't create   should you keep the royalties then go to another job field or retire then your royalties could go on a schedule e.   now a tax advantage may exist on a schedule c if you can write off certain health and business expenses reducing your income that you ca n't on a schedule e though it 'd probably be difficult to write off more than the adjusted self employment cost savings of a schedule e.

typically developing economics are marked by moderate to high inflation as they are growing at a faster pace higher in savings rate and higher lending rates if you reduce the lending rate more business start up will borrow at cheaper rate this in turn means lowers savings rate and leads to higher inflation to combat this central banks make borrowing expensive which lowers inflation and increases the saving rate essentially all these 3 are tied up as to why these countries offer higher interest on usd is because most of the developing countries have trade current account deficit they need to bring in more usd in the country one of the ways is to encourage non resident citizens to park their foreign earning back home ensuring more funds usd inflow   the rate differential also acts as a guide as to how the currency would be valued against usd for example if you get 8 on usd less than 12 had you converted same to rouble at the end of say 3 years the exchange rate between usd and rouble would factor that 4 ie rouble will go down developed countries on the other hand are marked by low inflation they have already achieved everything as there is no in growth it more they are also characterized by low savings and lending rates

it sounds cold but the law has to hold people to their agreements there are exceptions for unconscionable terms but i do n't think this gets close to that level this is certainly but not quite shocking to the conscience maybe there 's an argument to be made regarding whether a reasonably prudent person in the party 's position would have known what they were agreeing to under the circumstances depending upon how the provision was presented but without a lot more information we ca n't say whether that angle has a snowball 's chance in hell   you should read the terms governing every important agreement you enter into it sounds like a huge burden but for any major undertaking you really do need to grit your teeth and through the whole thing if you do n't like what you find ask for a second look from a lawyer to confirm your suspicions or just walk away    bank service agreements loan mortgage applications major venue reservations and employment contracts especially employment contracts all deserve that much time typically the terms you might not like are address circumstances that as a practical matter do n't really concern you but you might be surprised at how often you find deal breakers like this around in the woodwork

not for the tax break no as others have said that still costs you money however with rates being low right now and brought a bit lower by the tax break this is an opportunity for the safest form of leveraged investing you will ever find if you invest that money the returns on investment will probably be better than the mortgage rate and that leaves you with a net profit there is some risk if the market collapses but it 's less risk than any other form of borrowing to invest that also leave you with more flexibility if you need cash in a hurry you can draw down the investments rather than taking another loan if the risk bothers you you can do what i did and split the difference i put 50 down and financed the rest i sometimes regret not having pushed it harder since it has worked out well for me but that was the level of risk i was comfortable with

at 5 this means you expect rents to double every 14 years i bought a condo style apartment 28 years ago sold a while back by the way and recently saw the going rate for rents has moved up from $ 525 to $ 750 after all this time the rent has n't increased four fold   if rents appear to be too low compared to the cost of buying the house people tend to prefer to rent on the flip side if the rent can cover a mortgage and then some there 's strong motivation to buy if not by the renters then by investors who seek a high return from renting those houses thereby pushing the price up   the price to rent ratio is n't fixed it depends in part on interest rates consumer sentiment and banks willingness to lend similar to stock 's p e there can be quite a range but too far in either direction is a sign a correction is due

you ca n't transfer mortgages when you purchase a new property you can purchase a new property now or you can refinance your current property now and leverage yourself as far as possible while rates are low the higher rates you are worried about may not be as bad as you think with higher interest rates that may put downward pressure on housing prices or when rates do rise it may simply move from historic lows to relative lows i had a mortgage at 4.25 that i never bothered refinancing even though rates went much lower because the savings in interest paid minus my tax deduction for mortgage interest did n't amount to more than the cost of refinancing if rates go back up to 5 that will still be very affordable

it looks like you can   take a look at these articles but of course go to the source from publication 529 you can deduct certain expenses as    miscellaneous itemized deductions on    schedule a form 1040 or form 1040nr    you can claim the amount of expenses    that is more than 2 of your adjusted    gross income you figure your    deduction on schedule a by subtracting    2 of your adjusted gross income from    the total amount of these expenses    your adjusted gross income is the    amount on form 1040 line 38 or form    1040nr line 36 i hope that helps   happy deducting

i dug up an old article on motley fool and one approach they mention is to get the stock certificates and then sell them to a friend if the company was liquidated you should receive a 1099-div form at     year 's end showing a liquidating distribution treat this as if you    sold the stock for the amount of the distribution the date of sale    is the date that the distribution took place using your original cost    basis in the shares you can now compute your loss if the company has n't actually been liquidated you 'll need to make    sure it 's totally worthless before you claim a loss if you have    worthless stock that 's not worth the hassle of selling through your    broker you can sell it to a friend or cousin aunt or uncle for    pennies however you ca n't sell the stock to a spouse siblings    parents grandparents or lineal descendants here 's one way to do    it send the certificate to your stock transfer agent explain that the shares have been sold and ask to cancel the old shares and issue    a new certificate to the new owner some brokerages will offer you a quicker alternative by buying all of your shares of the stock for a penny they do it to help out    their customers in addition over time some of the shares may    actually become worth more than the penny the brokers paid for them by selling the shares you have a closed transaction with the stock and can declare a tax loss meanwhile your friend relative or    broker for a pittance has just bought a or liner

this is completely disgusting utterly unethical deeply objectionable and yes it is almost certainly illegal the federal trade commission has indeed filed suit halted ads etc in a number of cases but these likely only represent a tiny percentage of all cases this does n't make what the car dealer 's do ok but do n't expect the swat team to bust some heads any time soon which is kind of sad but let 's deal with the details let 's see what the federal trade commission has to say in their article are car ads taking you for a ride deceptive car ads here are some claims that may be deceptive and    why vehicles are available at a specific low price or for a specific    discount what may be missing the low price is after a downpayment often    thousands of dollars plus other fees like taxes licensing and    document fees on approved credit other pitches the discount is only    for a pricey fully loaded model or the reduced price or discount    offered might depend on qualifications like the buyer being a recent    college graduate or having an account at a particular bank only $ what may be missing the advertised payments are temporary teaser    payments payments for the rest of the loan term are much higher a    variation on this pitch you will owe a balloon payment usually    thousands of dollars at the end of the term so both of these are what the ftc explicitly says are deceptive practices has the ftc taken action in cases similar to this yes they have if auto dealers make advertising claims in headlines they ca n’t take    them away in fine print said jessica rich director of the ftc ’s    bureau of consumer protection these actions show there is a    financial cost for violating ftc orders in the case referenced above the owners of a 20 + dealership chain was hit with about $ 250,000 in fines if you think that 's a tiny portion of the unethical gains they made from those ads in the time they were running i 'd say you were absolutely correct and that 's little more than a cost of doing business for unscrupulous companies but that 's the state of the us nation at this time and so we are left with caveat emptor as a guiding principle what can you do about it competitors are technically allowed to file suit for deceptive business practices so if you know any honest dealers in the area you can tip them off about it try saying that out loud with a serious face   but even better you can contact the ftc and file a formal complaint online i would n't expect the world to change for your complaint but even if it just generates a letter it may be enough to let a company know someone is watching and if they are a big business they might actually get into a little bit of trouble

has an article about short that states the higher the number of days to cover means the possibility for a short squeeze is greater and the potential size of the short squeeze is also greater logically this makes sense a short squeeze occurs when a lack of supply meets excess demand for a stock so the potential for a squeeze increases when supply and demand begin to get out of equilibrium think of two things that would cause the days to cover to increase and what effect they would have on supply and demand   the current short interest numerator increases this implies that if some event triggers short sellers to cover their position there are a higher number of short sellers who will need to do so this the chances that demand will exceed supply   the average daily volume denominator decreases this implies that fewer investors are trading the stock so if an event triggers short sellers to cover their positions there might not be enough traders in the market willing to sell their shares obviously if a short squeeze occurs volume may increase because traders who were unwilling to sell their shares become willing

a flat tax rate is terrible economically but also morally on the one hand it seems morally right to me that the rich should contribute to a larger share of government spending    but that aside economically it makes sense for wealthier people to be taxed more as they are far to save any spare money at the end of the month which by definition if they are rich should be plenty with a flat rate poorer people meanwhile are far to spend any extra income either out of necessity and or perhaps as investments that they have been putting off even small luxuries can now be fitted into the budget like meals in a restaurant or strong comfortable shoes       my point is that this very consumption creates a demand becomes vital to maintaining more demand and have you heard how demand that needs supply creates it 's own demand i know it 's crazy but it 's an actual concept called say 's news economics brief our series looks reasoning made jean say

i would not sell unless the stock is starting to fall in price if you are a long term investor you can review the weekly chart on a weekly basis to determine if the stock is still up trending regarding hd below is a weekly chart for the last 4 years   basically if the price is making higher highs hh and higher lows it is up trending if it starts to make lower lows ll followed by lower highs then the uptrend is over and the stock could be entering a downtrend with hd the price has been up trending but seems to now be hitting some headwinds it has been making some followed by some hls throughout the last 2 years it did make a ll in late august 2015 but then recovered nicely to make a new hh so the uptrend was not broken in early november 2016 it made another ll but this time it seems to be followed by a in mid december 2016 this could be clear evidence that the uptrend may be ending the final confirmation would be if the price drops below the early november low of $ the orange line if price drops below this price it would be confirmation that the uptrend is over and this should be the point at which you should sell your hd shares you could place an automatic stop loss order just below $ so that you do n't even need to monitor the stock frequently another indication that the uptrend may be in trouble is the divergence between the of the price and the peaks of a momentum indicator in this case the macd the two sloping red lines show that the price made in april and august 2016 whilst the momentum indicator made at these peaks in the price as the lines are sloping in different directions it is demonstrating negative divergence which means that the momentum of the uptrend is slowing down and can act as an early warning system to be more cautious in the near future so the question you could be asking is when is a good time to sell out of hd or at least some of your hd to rebalance why sell something that is still increasing in price only sell if you can determine that the price will not be increasing anymore in the near to medium term

people are nearly twice as likely to feel confident great confidence is amazing that and $ 5 will buy you a cup of coffee 44 who hired a pro have $ 100 k or more vs. 9 of there 's no way to examine these numbers without a link to the source but it stands to reason that if you have a plan that you 're sticking to you 'll save more money than if you are just investing it 's too bad that we ca n't see what the returns are for those using a pro vs. that would be much more valuable than an arbitrary dollar level unfortunately $ 100 k is n't really that much money if you live in the us so it 's an irrelevant talking point the real question is whether investment knowledge is readily available to the masses or if having a person who specializes in finance is required to make good decisions about investment i think the fact that the conventional wisdom prefers index funds to actively managed funds demonstrates that investment professionals are less useful than they might have been even a decade or two ago if money should be spent on professional advice it 's probably better spent on cpas or other tax professionals who can help optimize your investments for tax efficiency though even that is now available as more common knowledge

firstly there is also a lifetime tax allowance if the father 's estate including other gifts given in his lifetime is unlikely to exceed that allowance it might be simplest simply to give the whole amount now and count it against the allowance right now the allowance is $ m but that seems quite a big political football and it 's the allowance when you die that matters looking back at past values for the allowance $ 1 m seems like a pretty safe amount to bet on if you want to avoid minimize the use of that allowance i would make a loan structured as a mortgage that will have $ 14 k payments each year which can then be forgiven the points in rick 's answer about an appropriate rate and being able to give more if more notional donors and recipients can be used also apply so for example in the first year hand over $ 200 k at 3.5 and immediately forgive $ the next year forgive the interest charge of $ 6.5 k and capital of $ given the age of the daughter i guess the father might well die before its all paid off that way leaving some residue to be forgiven by the estate and thus potentially incurring estate taxes there might also be state gift estate taxes to consider edited to reflect 2014 gift and lifetime exclusion limits

basic arbitrage is the purchasing and selling of things that are convertible    the classic example is the international trading of equities if someone in london wants to purchase a hundred shares of shell for 40 gbp ea and someone in new york wants to sell you a hundred shares of shell for 61 usd ea you can buy the shares from the guy in new york sell them to the guy in london and convert your gbp back in to usd for a profit of $ minus fees   now if after you buy the shares in new york the price in london goes down you 'll be left holding 100 shares of shell that you do n't want so instead you should borrow 100 shares in london and sell them at the exact same time that you buy the shares in new york thus keeping your net position at 0 in fact you should also borrow and convert them to usd at the same time so that exchange rate changes do n't get you

great work so far and good question   i think a lot of it depends on how risky your financial life is    for example lets say that you are working a temp or contract job that ends in 3 months   that is also the same month your savings and student loan will be equal   i think most would agree that it would be foolish to empty out your savings in such a risky month    now same situation one month later   the company you were working for takes you on as a full time employee   i would go ahead and empty out my savings and make the student loan go away    there could be other risks to consider like needing a different car moving to a new place potential medical bills or a needing to travel   anything like that on the horizon i would hold off out my savings   however once it is smooth sailing go for it being debt free is wonderful and it is a worthy goal

in the question you cited i assumed immediate exercise that is why you understood that i was talking about 30 days after grant i actually mentioned that assumption in the answer sec 83(b does n't apply to options because options are not assets per se it only applies to restricted stocks so the 30 days start counting from the time you get the restricted stock which is when you early exercise as to the amt the iso spread will be considered amt income in the year of the exercise if you file the 83(b for it is ordinary income that 's the whole point of the election you can find more detailed explanation on this website

getting someone else to save for you with their isa allowance has some quite significant disadvantages you 'll be using up their isa allowance so they wo n't be able to make their own tax free savings perhaps you know someone who does n't want to use it anyway and is happy to do this but most people probably do n't you are essentially handing them the money and relying on them to voluntarily give it back to you when the time comes even if you trust them to do this if they have financial problems in the meantime then their creditors would be able to go after the money in the isa and would have an equal or better claim to it that you would when the money is returned to you you would become liable to tax on the interest anyway from the perspective of your own tax situation it 's extra income to you that was n't protected by any isa allowance of yours while in practice you might be able to get away with not declaring it to anyway and not be detected it would still be illegal tax evasion and thus rather risky so overall it 's not really a very effective bypass for whatever restriction a bank wants to impose on your isa holdings

yes overall it is a big inconvenience to you this same issue applies for those that for example receive social security benefits and perhaps other government cash benefits on a pre paid card rather than direct deposit to a bank account they allow a few ways to get cash from the card    you can get cash back no fee when you make a retail purchase you could use the card for relatively small items you would purchase anyway and get $ 100 or more back in cash each time every store chain will have it 's own limits on how much cash back they will allow per transaction and be careful some stores charge a fee for cash back but it 's not at all common if even these small purchases are an issue you can then presumably later return the item you purchased without returning the cash back you received if the store allows returns refunds and since a transaction with cash back is processed as a debit rather than a credit usually if you later return the purchased item you will be refunded in cash rather than a credit back to your card account also for other cards sometimes you can go to a branch of the bank that issued the card and make a no fee withdraw sometimes in cash and sometimes by check this depends on the policy of the issuing bank and the card account finally most of this assumes that you are given a pin or the opportunity to create one with the card because cash back and atm access requires a pin and there are some banks cards that do n't allow any of this

4 finally do all companies reduce their stock price when they pay a dividend are they required to there seems to be confusion behind this question   a company does not set the price for their stock so they ca n't reduce it either   in fact nobody sets the price for a stock the price you see reported is simply the last price that the stock was traded at   that trade was just one particular trade in a whole sequence of trades   the price used for the trade is simply the price which the particular buyer and particular seller agreed to for that particular trade   no agreement well then no trade   there 's no authority for the price other than the collection of all buyers and sellers so what happens when nokia declares a 55 cent dividend   when they declare there is to be a dividend they state the record date which is the date which determines who will get the dividend the owners of the shares on that date are the people who get the dividend payment   the stock exchanges need to account for the payment so that investors know who gets it and who does n't so they set the ex dividend date which is the date on which trades of the stock will first trade without the right to receive the dividend payment   ex dividend is usually about 2 days before record date   these dates are established well before they occur so all market participants can know exactly when this change in value will occur when trading on ex dividend day begins there is no authority to set a different price than the previous day 's closing price   what happens is that all knowledgeable market participants know that today nokia is trading without the payment 55 cents that buyers the previous day get   so what do they do   they take that into consideration when they make an offer to buy stock and probably end up offering a price that is about 55 cents less than they would have otherwise   similarly sellers know they will be getting that 55 cents so when they choose a price to offer their stock at it will likely be about that much less than they would have asked for otherwise

there is no penalty for foreigners but rather a 30 mandatory income tax withholding from distributions from 401(k plans you will get it back when you file the income tax return for the year and calculate your actual tax liability including any penalties for a   premature distribution from the 401(k plan you are of course a us citizen and not a foreigner and thus are what the irs calls a us person which includes not just us citizens but permanent immigrants to the us as well as some temporary visa holders but it is entirely possible that your 401(k plan does not know this explicitly this irs web page tells 401(k plan administrators who can i presume is a us person    a retirement plan distribution is presumed to be made to a u.s. person only if the withholding agent a payment that does not meet these rules is presumed to be made to a foreign person   your ssn is presumably on file with the 401(k plan administrator but perhaps you are retired into a country that does not have an income tax treaty with the us and that 's the mailing address that is on file with your 401(k plan administrator if so the 401(k administrator is merely following the rules and not presuming that you are a us person so how can you get around this non presumption the irs document cited above and the links therein say that if the 401(k plan has on file a w-9 form that you submitted to them and the w-9 form includes your ssn then the 401(k plan has valid documentation to associate the distribution as being made to a us person that is the 401(k plan does not need to make any that you are a us person has been proved beyond reasonable doubt so to answer your question will i be penalized when i later start a regular monthly withdrawal from my 401(k yes you will likely have mandatory 30 income tax withholding on your regular 401(k distributions unless you have established that you are    a us person to your 401(k plan by submitting a w-9 form to them

from april 2017 the plan is that there is now also going to be a lifetime isa in addition to the help to buy isa assuming those plans do not change they government will give 25 after each year until you are 50 and the maximum you can put in per year will be £ 4000 catches   you can only take the money out for certain life events currently buying a house below £ anywhere in the country not just london   passing 60 years of age if you take it out before or for another reason you lose the government bonus plus 5 ie it currently looks like you will be left with 95 of the total of the money you paid in you can not use the bonus payments from this one together with bonus payments from a help to buy isa to buy a home however you can transfer an existing help to buy isa into this one come 2017 while you are not asking about pensions it is worth mentioning for other readers that while 25 interest per year sounds great if you use it for pension purposes consider that this is after tax so if you pay mostly 20 tax on your income the difference is not that big and if your employer matches your contributions up to a point then it may not be worth it if you pay a significant amount of tax at 40 or higher then it may not make sense for pension purposes tax bands and the rates on this isa may change of course on the other hand if you intend to use the money for a house flat purchase in 2 or more years time then it would seem like a good option for you specifically this only covers £ 4000 per year ie not the full amount you talked about but it is likely a good idea for you to spread things out anyway that way if one thing turns out to be not as good as other alternatives it has less impact it is less likely that all your schemes will turn out to be bad luck within the the £ limit may restrict you to a small house or flat in 5 10 years time again prices may stall as they seem barely sustainable now but it is hard to predict measures like this may help push them upwards   on the plus side you could then still use the money for pension although i have a hard time seeing governments not adjusting this sort of account between now and your birthday like pension funds there is an element of luck gambling involved and i think a good strategy is to spread things if you can

third year here and let me echo what everybody below is saying math math math   that being said most programs will give you a chance depending on your quant score from the gmat gre it had better be high though low seven hundreds wo nt even garner a look from any school in the top 20 and your quant should be higher than your verbal from what it looks like from your background it sounds like the masters would be helpful although a masters in econ wo nt be as much of a help as you think finance is a sub field of econ and so to justify our work we have to distinguish ourselves as much as we can my advice is use the masters to take probability theory and statistics courses or econometrics and as many of them as you can    my next advice is apply to as many schools as you can afford and the applications across school rankings some of the foreign students in my program have told me that they sent out dozens of applications and that even 100 apps is not unusual i call it the shotgun approach   third i will agree with some of the other comments in that you will need less math for corporate stuff and or behavioral experimental stuff but it is unlikely that any school will take that into consideration i ca nt think of any other phd student that i have talked to from many other programs that do n't have to take asset pricing and other theory courses phd programs start very generally and then you are allowed to specialize as time goes on   basically expect this shit to be hard finance profs are some of the highest paid in academia which means there is an insane amount of applicants for each spot in my program we average 400 qualified applicants a year for a meager three spots and many of the applicants will already have phds in physics math or engineering they get tired of making no money as a post doc and decide to come for another one in finance where they can get paid not to discourage you at all but revise your expectations

in my experience earning interest is not enough to keep the account in a non dormant state if payment of interest was the trigger to reset the clock then no savings account would ever be considered dormant in general as the account got close to the deadline we were notified that a single transaction moving money into or out of the account would reset the clock i have had this happen in recent years with a bank account and a credit union account   in researching for the exact definition of a dormant account i found this regarding interest on the fdic website that means that the state law may set the definition it also means that you should look at the information regarding the bank policy i did try and see if the rules for a credit union are the same the added twist with a credit union is that if the account is closed they are no longer a share holder and that brings into the discussion voting rights so the policy guidelines is even more complex if the account does go inactive state law will define what happens to the account and how you can get the funds back

both models understand that the value of a company is the sum total of all cashflows in the future discounted back to the present they vary in their definition of cash the gordon growth model uses dividends as a proxy for cashflow under the assumption that this is the only true cash received by shareholders in theory counting cash is meaningless if there 's no eventual end game where the accumulated cash is up amongst the owners the gordon model is best used to value companies that have an established reliable dividend the company should be stable and the payout ratio high will underestimate the value of firms that consistently maintain a low payout ratio and instead accumulate cash there are multiple dcf models a firm valuation measures all cash available to both equity and debt holders a traditional equity valuation measures all cash that can be claimed by shareholders while the latter seems most intuitive and pertinent to a shareholder the former is very good at showing what a company can do regardless of their choice of capital structure a small add on to a firm valuation is the concept of eva or economic value add where the return on capital all capital both debt and equity is compared to the blended cost of capital the dcf model is more flexible optimistic than the gordon in its approach to cash the approach can be applied to many types of companies at every stage in their maturity even if they do n't pay a dividend a simplistic or single stage dcf is similar to the gordon the assumption is that the company is fully mature growing at a rate perhaps just slightly above inflation forever for younger companies a multi stage dcf can be employed where you forecast fairly confident numbers for the next 3 5 years then 3 5 years beyond that the forecast is less certain but assumed to be slowing growth and a generally maturing stabilizing company and then the steady state stage is tacked on to the end you 'll want to check out professor damodaran 's website he addresses all this and so much more and has a big pile of spreadsheets freely downloadable to get you started i also highly recommend his book investment valuation it 's the bible on the topic

it has been hinted at in some other answers but i want to say it explicitly volatility is not risk volatility is how much an investment goes up and down risk is the chance that you will lose money for example stocks have relatively high volatility but the risk that you will lose money over a 40 year period is virtually zero in particular if you invest in index funds bonds on the other hand have basically no volatility their cash flow is totally predictable if you trust the future of your government but there is a significant risk that they will perform worse than stocks over a longer period so volatility equals risk only if you are day trading a 401(k is literally the opposite of that for further reading never confuse risk and volatility also investing is not gambling gambling is bad because the odds are stacked against you you need more than average luck to actually win and the longer you play the more you will lose investing means buying productive capital that will produce further value the odds are in your favor even if you do a moderately bad job at investing the longer you stay the more you will win

the strength of your plan is that you have considered that if you contribute early the the 401 k you might not get the match so you do stretch it out for the entire year   one benefit to putting money into the hsa early is that it will be available if you need it early in the year if you have a major medical emergency in the first quarter if you need to pay a $ 4,000 deductible in january because of you would hate to have to use post tax money to pay the bill of course if you have had the hsa for several years then this might not be a problem if you have n't maxed the roth ira for 2013 you could make contributions to the ira up until april 15 2014 to count for the previous year   a risk with the hsa is if you leave your employer mid year you can keep the money and use it for medical expenses but if the new company does n't have a an hsa high deductible plan you might have contributed too much   the 401 k hsa and ira are annual limits so if you will switch companies you are responsible for not going over the limit

the $ per share figure is the trading price or fair market value of the old johnson controls and should not be used to figure your gain nor to figure your basis in the new johnson controls international your new basis is the total of the gross proceeds received that is the cash   plus the fair market value of the new shares which was $ per share i am not referring to cash in lieu for fractional shares but the $ per share received upon the merger a person holding 100 shares of the old johnson controls would have received $ plus shares of the new company   ignoring the fractional share for simplicity 's sake gross proceeds would equal 83 x $ = $   in fair market value of shares plus the cash of $ for a total of $ this is your basis in the 83 new shares regarding the fractional share since new basis is at fair market value there should be no gain or loss recognized upon its sale

unless you suffer from the illusion that you can time the market it honestly does n't matter much the difference is lost in the noise that may be true even if you do suffer from that illusion   also as discussed here previously the drop in a stock 's price right after the dividend has been paid just reflects the fact that you are n't about to get an immediate refund in the form of a dividend if you look at the real cost per share it 's meaningless and can should be ignored buying after the dividend is paid may save you a tiny fraction of a cent of short term income tax but that 's meaningless in real terms

the issues of trading with unsettled funds are usually restricted to cash accounts   with margin i 've never personally heard of a rule that will catch you in this scenario   you wo n't be able to withdraw funds that are tied up in unsettled positions until the positions settle   you should be able to trade those funds   i 've never heard of a broker charging margin interest on unsettled funds but that does n't mean there is n't a broker somewhere that does brokers are allowed to impose their own restrictions however since margin is basically offering you a line of credit   you should check to see if your broker has more restrictive rules i 'd guess that you may have heard about restrictions that apply to cash accounts and think they may also apply to margin accounts   if that 's the case and you want to learn more about the rules generally try searching for these terms you should be able to find a lot of clear resources on those terms   here 's one that 's current and provides examples on a margin account you avoid these issue because the margin essentially a loan from your broker provides a cushion additional funds that avoid the issues   it is possible that if you over extend yourself that you 'll get a margin call but that seems to be different than what you 're asking and maybe worth a new question if you want to know about that

curious why are you interested in building improving your credit score is it better to use your card and pay off the bill completely every month yes how is credit calculated     is it average utilization over the month or total amount owed per month it depends on how often your bank reports your balances to the reporting agencies it can be daily when your statement cycle closes or some other interval how does credit utilization affect your score   closest to zero without actually being zero is best this translates to making some charges even $ 1 so your statement shows a balance each statement that you pay off this shows as active use if you pay off your balance before the statement closes then it can sometimes be reported as inactive unused is too much a bad thing   yes is too little a bad thing depends being debt free has its advantages but if your goal is to raise your credit score then having a low utilization rate is a good metric less than 7 utilization seems to be the optimal level   last year we started using a number not as a recommendation but as a fact that most of the people with really high fico scores have credit utilization rates that are 7 percent or lower watts said read more remember that on time payment is the most important factor second is how much you owe third is length of credit history maintain these factors in good standing and you will improve your score

how do i determine what to pay the person you pay them either what you believe the work is worth to have done for you vs doing it yourself or how much they ask for after negotiation there 's no rule of thumb because it 's driven by the market   there will always be people who are willing and able to do the work for less than you but ca n't always get work which is the reason they are charging less just as there will always be people who charge much more than you and have to turn work away you are at a comfortable medium where you have enough work to charge a moderate rate and can amplify your reputation network client by the work out as an example if i charge $ to do engineering work but i want to subcontract it out then i have to take into account that so let 's say i have a contract for 20 hours of work at $ $ 2,400 and i figure that i can subcontract out all of it   however it 's going to cost me about 4 hours of work to review their 20 hours of work deal with administrative overhead interpret and pass along requirements etc so if i work 4 hours then the maximum i can pay the contractor for 20 hours of work is the remaining 16 hours x $ 120 the contractor would be doing 20 hours for $ to break even on cash and i only make worth of profit for 4 hours worth of work   that 's actually a net loss unless you can already fill those other 16 hours with paying work i do n't think that would be worth it but if the contractor only required $ then you 're paying him $ 1,200 for 20 hours of work and you get to keep $ 1,200 for only 4 hours of your time   the subcontractor has turned your $ rate into $ now you still only net $ 1,200 rather than the full $ 2,400 so your revenue is down but if you can find work for that other 16 hours at your normal rate then you 're still ahead   alternately you might find that working only 12 hours a week is a fine way to live and choose to forgo that revenue for personal time the costs and break even point vary greatly from situation to situation but hopefully this gives you a framework to evaluate the decision for yourself

i think the best way to handle her fears is to explain the income and expenses of the household overall then explain the savings and investment strategies retirement projections and then finally explain a concrete number for allowable monthly or annual discretionary expenses including charity entertainment vacations etc   you may have delicate relationship reasons for not doing this but if you want a reasonable discussion i would leave it this way please do not open with the question how much do you think we make or anything similar because that comes off as a trick or a quiz   it sounds very condescending and highlights how much more you know about finances than she does   it also highlights subconsciously how little mental control she has over the finances which is likely to make her feel greater anxiety you should emphasize how secure things are and explain why all the savings and investments you 're using are conservatively likely to keep her financially secure   this sets the ground for her to be comfortable with the fact that she now has money in contrast to perhaps a less financially secure personal history after that charitable expenses come out of the expense budget same as vacations recreation etc   if it does not financial security then it 's not dangerous to spend on charity the alternate approach is to avoid the big financial talk and just propose a few small contributions this year then increase it every year incrementally that may be easier to swallow once there 's a psychological track record of donating without incident please go into the discussion remembering three things but above all please do not open up with a quiz   have a simple discussion with her   give her time to consider the expenses budget relative to the savings budget as a proportion of income   and then allow for the fact that she may place a strong premium on savings and a strong discount on charity

gt   how is a loan an asset    to use your example our starting books are $ 100 in cash asset which corresponds to $ 100 in equity we then loan out $ 20 with a future return of $ 25 so our books have changed to $ 80 cash $ 25 in collectable loans assets $ 20 in loan liabilities and $ 80 in equity + $ 5 in interest revenue    gt i can not be acting like i have that 20 $ can i   not really and lending banks are regulated very tightly by having both required minimum capital adequacy ratios basically how many loans you can have out for a given amount of equity and annual stress testing by the fed   gt is n't that how the 08 crash happened is the risk of default accounted for    no and yes lending banks were n't really responsible for the crash and it certainly was n't because of over lending the problem was that the mortgage backed securities that banks were trading were at the time not properly valued to account for their risk and the resulting insurance contracts credit default obligations or cdos were improperly priced and leveraged the cdos were overly complicated and made some strong statistical assumptions about the underlying assets the mbss and the individual mortgages within them that lead to a systemic of risk in default probabilities esp banks since then have dramatically increased the size of their risk management departments and i think it 's fairly unlikely we see another systemic mispricing like that for some time   gt default risk is not transferred with the asset   i do n't agree with this in the basic cases if i sell you the rights to collect a loan that i wrote then absent of any other contract you will bear the full risk of the borrower defaulting   gt   how can it possibly be sold in such a way that the risk of default is detached   credit default swaps and other forms of insurance contracts i could sell you the loan as above but then you could buy an insurance contract on the loan that pays out if the borrower defaults in other words either the loan stays alive and you collect interest as normal or it defaults and you receive some payout from the insurance contract which limits your downside risk just about every large financial institution will have themselves hedged like this to some extent though perhaps by other means    regarding your overall question about student loan defaults i 'm in the camp that believes they 're an overstated direct risk it 's currently not possible to default on a student loan and if the law allowing student loan bankruptcy came in to effect i think we 'd see a large adjustment of interest rates on student loans and probably consumer loans etc as well to compensate for the increased risk of holding these loans   direct risk referring to the risk to the loan holder i think there is a risk that consumer spending becomes weighed down by the burden of large loans however i also do n't think this would appear as a sudden market shock and would likely manifest over an extended period of time   just my thoughts i 'm sure there are some people who 'll disagree with me on this

your impression about banks and bankers is very wrong   wall street banks can and often do lose in transactions   in fact banks go bankrupt and/or require massive bailouts to survive because they sometimes lose a ton of money   the business of investment banking often involves bearing risk for customers which by definition means they lose some of the time   generally the risks they take on individual transactions are not large enough to bring the whole bank down but sometimes they are   banking is a job like any other except that it has more risk than most anyway to your point how do underwriters make money on shares that fall in value before the sale   on the commission   the issuing company will normally pay the investment bank a percentage of the funds raised in the offering regardless of the price   of course it 's possible for the bank to still lose money if their contract stipulates a minimum price and they are not able to meet it   in that case the bank may lose on that offering contradicting your preconceived notion by the way one other question implicit in your post why was the secondary offering considered bad news   if the ceo and other insiders have private information that indicates that the stock is overvalued then doing a secondary offering at the inflated price will greatly enrich them   because this happens some times investors are wary about secondary offerings   this makes companies that would otherwise do a secondary offering shy away from it even if shares are not overpriced   therefore if a company is doing a secondary offering the market is likely to worry that the stock is overvalued even at a reduced price

the short answer is yes electrical vehicles make logistical sense the batteries are n't quite where they should be to really push the market but the are high enough and the batteries themselves can be recycled    there are two major advantages that electric has over oil the first is that electricity is abundant and can come from many sources this means that a car can be running on power from coal wind solar hydro electric or any other source of electricity this also means that the cost per mile driven is generally lower than the cost of a gas driven car    another big advantage is the national security it offers if electric were to really enter the consumer market in a big way the dependency on countries in the middle east and africa would be lessened it would also ease some of the competition between nations like china and the united states over natural resources    of course their are problems with electric cars as well and they are n't even close to replacing gas for use in heavy machinery

income from a hobby is tax exempt under dutch law to consider whether it 's hobby a few rules are applied such as how much time do you spend on the activity and is the hourly wage low obviously having a boss is a sure sign of it not being a hobby the typical example is making dolls and selling them on a crafts fair if you travel the country and sell each weekend on a different fair that 's a lot of time if you only sell them on the fair in your home town it 's a hobby   situation 3 is the most difficult if you just happened to luck out it 's still a hobby if you spent significant time to improve the value of your holdings e.g. by trading in game then it might be seen as work in the latter case you simply file it as income from other sources not yet taxed   for the purpose of determining income from a hobby you may deduct actual expenses so in your case they 'd look at the net income of $ which is not unusual for a hobby it would n't be any different if you took up horse riding decided that you did n't like it and sell your horse at a loss

your bank lloyds sent the australian bank $ 500 aud having converted $ gbp at a rate of aud per gbp which was slightly less than the published rate which normally applies to transfers measured in hundred thousands if not   millions of pounds   using the published rate amounts to an fee of 11 aud which you are not complaining about   you also paid a fee to lloyds of 20 gbp which you disclosed after i had posted this answer the australian bank refused to accept the payment because the account to which the money had to be deposited was closed   perhaps instead of just sending back $ 500 aud it converted the amount to gbp less its fee of what i suspect is $ 60 aud and sent it back   notice that the bank rate of aud per gbp says that gbp is what you get from a tad over   $ 440 aud and so perhaps st george 's charged you a $ 60 aud fee for the conversion while converting the rest $ 440 aud to gbp or maybe lloyds   got $ 500 aud from st and charged you a $ 60 aud fee for converting it to gbp regardless of who did the   conversion it is also possible that the rate you got not   quite as good as the published rate corresponds to $ 450 aud converting to gbp and a $ 50 aud fee for the conversion    you said i was told by lloyds tsb that st. would n't levy any charges as they would be paid a separate agent 's fee this might have been told to you as st. will not be any charges if you send $ 500 aud for deposit to the account in australia and your payee will get exactly $ 500 aud if you pay us gbp plus 20 gbp as our conversion fee today if you want to send gbp instead we can not tell you how much to send   because st. george 's will levy a charge for conversion to aud and the conversion will be at the rate then prevailing so your payee may receive more or less than $ 500 aud perhaps wanting to send exactly $ 500 aud you chose to pay lloyds tsb and send aud but since the account was closed the money came back and so you ended up paying yet another conversion fee the questions are who charged the second fee as muro said in a comment it should be listed somewhere on the itemized statement and is it a reasonable charge i think $ 50 or $ 60 aud is excessive but then i am not a bank and maybe that is what their standard minimum charge is as i said in my comment the charge is usually a percentage of the amount transferred subject to a minimum levy that the bank sets

note   this is not professional tax advice   if you think you need professional tax advice find a licensed professional in your local area what are the expected earnings year us$ 100 us$ 1,000   us$ 100,000   i would say if this is for us$ 1,000 or less that registering an ein and consulting a cpa to file a partnership tax return is not going to be a profitable exercise all the earnings perhaps more will go to paying someone to do or help do the tax filings the simplest taxes are for a business that you completely own   corporations and partnerships involve additional forms and get more and more and complex and even more so when it involves foreign participation   partnerships are often not formal partnerships but can be more easily thought of as independent businesses that each participants owns that are simply doing some business with each other schedule c is the irs form you fill out for any businesses that you own on schedule c you would list the income from advertising   also on schedule c there is a place for all of the business expenses such as ads that you buy a server that you rent supplies employees and independent contractors   amounts paid to an independent contractor certainly need not be based on hours but could be a fixed fee or based on profit earned    finally if you pay anyone in the usa over a certain amount you have to tell the irs about that with a form 1099 at the beginning of the next year so they can fill out their taxes   but according to an article in international tax blog you might not have to file form 1099 with the irs for foreign contractors if they are not us persons not a us citizen or a resident visa holder

when economies are strong it is particularly to have a single currency as it makes trade and tourism simpler and helps reduce costs the problem comes when individual member economies get into trouble because the eurozone is a loose grouping of nations there is no direct equivalent of the us federal government to coordinate a response there is instead an odd mixture of national and central government that makes it harder to get a unified approach to the economy ok it 's maybe not so different to the us in reality   this lack of flexibility means that some of the key levers of international finance are compromised for example a weak economy ca n't float its currency to improve exports similarly individual country 's interest rates ca n't be adjusted to balance spending i suspect the main reason though is political and based on concepts of sovereignty and national pride the uk does the majority of its trade with the eurozone so the pros would possibly outweigh the cons but the uk as a whole and some of our papers in particular have always regarded europe with suspicion most only speak english and find france and germany a strange and obtuse place the almost common language makes it easier to relate to the us and canada than our near neighbours it seems the perception amongst the political establishment is that any attempt to join the euro is political suicide while that is the case it is unlikely to happen purely from a personal perspective i 'd welcome the euro except it means a lot of the products i routinely buy would become a lot more expensive if price is for an example compare the price of the ipod touch in the uk £ to the french pay £ at the current exchange rate which is close to 25 more ouch see also my question about canada adopting the us dollar

you do n't want to do that don't lie to the irs we live overseas as well and have researched this extensively you can not make $ 50k overseas and then say you only made $ 45k to put $ 5k into retirement   i have heard from some accountants and tax attorneys who interpret the law as saying that the irs considers foreign earned income as not being compensation when computing ira contribution limits regardless of whether or not you exclude it publication what is compensation scroll down a little to the what is not compensation section those professionals say that any amounts you can exclude not just ones you actually do exclude then there are others that say the can is not implied so be careful trying to use any foreign earned income to qualify for retirement contributions i have n't ran across anyone yet who has gotten caught doing it and paid the price but that does n't mean they are n't out there an alternative in certain cases there are two things you can do that we have found to have some sort of taxable income that is preferably not foreign so that you can contribute to a retirement account we do this by using capital gains from investments as income since our agi is always zero we pay no short or long term capital gains taxes as long as we keep short term capital gains lower than $ 45k   another way to contribute to a roth ira when you have no income is to do an ira rollover of course you need money in a tax deferred account to do this but this is how it works i always recommend those who have tax deferred ira 's and no agi due to the feie to roll over as much as they can every year to a roth ira that really is tax free money the only tax you 'll pay on that money is sales tax when you spend it =)

their income is from the two sources you mentioned they charge the merchants for each use and they make interest money on people who carry a balance this is one reason a lot of merchants will be willing to give you a discount if you pay cash they do n't have to give a portion to visa or mastercard    i would n't be able to speak to the relative proportions between the two income sources but when many cards are at 30 interest for balances carried and many people have tens of thousands of dollars owed on their cards the interest income is not insignificant   they 'll also charge interest immediately on cash advances a few cards also make money off of annual fees although i 'd suspect this is not very much in the full scheme of things the way to get the most out of a card is to always pay it off fully at the end of each month

when you pay off a loan early you pay the remaining principal and you save all of the remaining interest so you do save on interest but it 's the interest you would have paid in the future not the interest you have paid in the past your remaining balance when you pay off the loan only includes the principal not the projected interest interest is a factor of the amount borrowed the interest rate and the amount of time you borrow the money the sooner you repay the money the less interest you pay imagine if you had taken a 30 year loan at 4 interest but were allowed to make no payments until the loan term ended if you waited 15 years to make your first payment you would n't owe the same money as if you 'd made payments every month no instead of owing you 'd owe because you had borrowed $ 100k for 15 years plus the interest due rather than borrowing a declining sum so that 's why you do n't get a refund on interest for previous months if you had started with a 16 year loan then you would have been paying more principal every month and your monthly amount due would have been higher to reflect that as you paid the principal off faster the interest each month would drop faster paying a huge portion of the principal at the end of the loan is not the same as steadily paying it down in the same time frame you will pay a lot more interest in the former case and rightfully so it might help to consider a credit card payment in comparison if you run up a balance and pay only the minimum each month you pay a lot of interest over time because your principal goes down slowly if you suddenly pay off your credit card you do n't have to pay any more interest but you also do n't get any interest back for previous months that 's because the interest accrued each month is based on your current balance just like your mortgage the minimum payments are calculated differently but the interest accrued each month uses essentially the same mechanism

it is n't just fox news even liberal leaning sources like the washington post abc and the seattle times are using titles like a very new study on seattle ’s $ 15 minimum wage has bad news for liberals and new study of seattle 's $ 15 minimum wage says it costs jobs     now here are some citations from the actual study which you obviously did n't read or you would n't have made the asinine comment above importantly the lost income associated with the hours reductions exceeds the gain associated with the net wage increase of 3.1 using data in table 3 we compute that the average low wage employee was paid $ per month the reduction in hours would cost the average employee $ 179 per month while the wage increase would recoup only $ 54 of this loss leaving a net loss of $ 125 per month 6.6 which is sizable for a low wage worker   our preferred estimates suggest that the seattle minimum wage ordinance caused hours worked by low skilled workers i.e. those earning under $ 19 per hour to fall by during the three quarters when the minimum wage was $ 13 per hour resulting in a loss of 3.5 million hours worked per calendar quarter alternative estimates show the number of low wage jobs declined by 6.8 which represents a loss of more than 5,000 jobs these estimates are robust to other than $ a 3.1 increase in wages in jobs that paid less than $ 19 coupled with a loss in hours yields a labor demand elasticity of roughly   i understand if you wo n't respond it is scary having your liberal narrative

something to consider is how broad is yahoo finance taking in their data for making some comparisons   for example did you look at the other companies in the same industry   on the industry page the top life insurance companies by market cap are mostly british companies which could make things a bit different than you 'd think another point is how this is just for one quarter which may be an anomaly as the data could get a bit awkward if some companies are just coming back to being profitable and could have what appears to be great growth but this is because their earnings grow from $ to $ 1/share which is a growth of $ 10,000 percent as this is an increase of 100 times but really this may just be from various accounting charges the company had that hit its reserves and caused its earnings to dip temporarily

why it is good to be risky the reason why it is good to be risky is because risky investments can result in higher returns on your money the problem with being risky is there is a chance you can lose money however in the long term you can usually benefit from higher returns even if you have a few slip ups let me show you an example   these two lines are based off of placing $ 2,000 in a retirement fund at age of 20 and then at age of 25 start investing $ 6,500 a year based off of a salary of $ 65,000 with a company that will 1 to 1 match up to 5 ira contribution presumably someone with a master 's should be able to get this and then being able to increase your contribution amount by $ 150 a year as your salary begins to increase as well the blue line assumes that all of this money that you are putting in a retirement account has a fixed 3 interest compounded yearly for simplicity sake every year until you retire the red line is earning a 12 interest rate while you are 20 years old and then decreasing by 0.5 per year until you retire since this is using more risky investments when you are younger i have even gone ahead and included losing 20 of your money when you are 24 another 20 when you are 29 and then again another 20 when you are 34 as you can see even with losing 20 of your money 3 different times you still end up with more money then you would have had if you stuck with a more conservative investment plan if i change this to 50 each 3 times you will still come out about equal to a more conservative investment now i do have these 3 loses placed at a younger age when there is less to lose but this is to be expected since you are being more risky when you are young when you are closer to retirement you have less of a chance of losing money since you will be investing more conservatively why it is ok to be risky when you are young but not old lets say you loose 20 of your $ 2,000 when you are young you have 30 40 years to make that back that 's roughly $ 1 a month extra that you are having to come up with so if you have a risky investment go bad when you are young you have plenty of time to account for it before you retire   now lets say you have $ 1,000,000 when you are 5 years from retiring and loose 20 of it you have to come up with an extra $ a month if you want to retire on time so if you have a risky investment go bad when you are close to retiring you will most likely have to work for many more years just to be able to recover from your loses what to invest in this is a little bit more difficult question to answer if there was one right way to invest your money every one would be doing that one right way and would result in it not turning out to be that good of investment what you need to do is come up with a plan for yourself my biggest advice that i can give is to be careful with fees some places will charge a fixed dollar amount per trade while others might charge a fixed dollar amount per month while even others might charge a percentage of your investment with only having $ 2,000 to invest a large fee might make it difficult to make money

i know its not legal to have open long and short position on specific security on two stock exchanges nse bse there is nothing illegal about it there are prescribed ways on how this is addressed   in cash segment intra day trades    one can short sell a security if by end of day he does not buy the security it goes into auction the said security is purchased on your behalf any profit or loss arising out of this is charged to you similarly one can buy a security if one does not pay the amount by end of day it would go into auction and sold any profit or loss arising out of this is charged to you if you short sell a security on one exchange you have to buy it on same exchange if you buy on other exchange it will not be adjusted against this short position also is it legal to have long position on stock and short its derivative future option there are no restrictions edit party a shorts 10 shares of hdfc today in intra day cash segment purchased by party b. rather than buying back 10 shares or allowing it to go into auction party a borrows 10 hdfc shares from x via for a period of say 6 months 1 month to 1 year this is recorded as party a obligation to x these 10 borrowed shares are transferred to party b. so party x does n't have any hdfc shares at this point in time however in exchange party x receives fees for borrowing from party a. if there is dividend are declared company pays party b. however recovers identical amount from party a and pays party x. if there is 1:1 split now party a owes party x 20 hdfc shares on maturity after 6 months party a has to buy these from market and given back the borrowed shares to party x. if there are some other corporate actions i.e. mergers the obligation of party a to party x is closed immediately and position settled of course there are provisions whereby party a can pay back the shares earlier or party x can ask for shares earlier and there are rules trades mechanisms to facilitate this

when you hold units of the tsx etf you are indirectly holding u.s. dollars cash or cash equivalents the etf can be thought of as a container the container gives you the convenience of holding usd in say cad denominated accounts that do n't normally provide for usd cash balances the etf price $ and $ in your example simply reflects the cad price of those usd and the change is because the currencies moved with respect to each other and so necessarily given how the etf is made up when the value of the u.s. dollar declines vs. the canadian dollar it follows that the value of your units of declines as quoted in canadian dollar terms currencies move all the time similarly if you held the same amount of value in u.s. dollars directly instead of using the etf you would still experience a loss when quoted in canadian dollar terms in other words whether or not your u.s. dollars are tied up either in or else sitting in a u.s. dollar cash balance in your brokerage account there 's not much of a difference you lose canadian dollar equivalent when the value of usd declines with respect to cad selling more quickly your units in a usd denominated account to yield u.s. dollars that you then directly hold does not insulate you from the same currency risk what it does is reduce your exposure to other cost risk factors inherent with etfs liquidity spreads and fees however i doubt that any of those played a significant part in the change of value from $ to $ that you described

started to post this as a comment but i think it 's actually a legitimate answer running a rental property is neither speculation nor investment but a business just as if you were renting cars or tools or anything else that puts it in an entirely different category the property may gain or lose value but you do n't know which or how much until you 're ready to terminate the business so like your own house it really is n't a liquid asset it 's closer to being inventory meanwhile like inventory you need to it on a fairly regular basis by maintaining it finding tenants and so on and how much it returns depends strongly on how much effort you put into it in terms of selecting the right location and product in the first place and in how you market yourself against all the other businesses offering near equivalent product and how you differentiate the product and so on   i think approaching it from that angle deciding whether you really want to be a business owner or keep all your money in more abstract investments then deciding what businesses are interesting to you and running the numbers to see what they 're likely to return as income then making up your mind whether real estate is the winner from that group is likely to produce better decisions among other things it helps you remember to focus on all the costs of the business when doing the math do n't forget that income from the business is taxed at income rates not investment rates and do n't forget that you 're making a bet on the future of that neighborhood as well as the future of that house changes in demographics or housing stock or business climate could all affect what rents you can charge as well as the value of the property and not necessarily in the same direction it may absolutely be the right place to put some of your money it may not explore all the possible outcomes before making the bet and decide whether you 're willing to do the work needed to influence which ones are more likely

if so then if company a never pays dividends to its shareholders then what is the point of owning company a 's stock the stock itself can go up in price this is not necessarily pure speculation either the company could just reinvest the profits and grow since you own part of a company your share would also increase in value the company could also decide to start paying dividend i think one rule of thumb is that growing companies wo n't pay out since they reinvest all profit to grow even more but very large companies like mcdonalds or microsoft who do n't really have much room left to grow will pay dividends more surely the right to one vote for company a 's board ca n't be that valuable   actually google for instance neither pays dividend nor do you get to vote basically all you get for your money is partial ownership of the company this still gives you the right to seize google assets if you go bankrupt if there 's any asset left once the creditors are done credit gets priority over equity what is it that i 'm missing what you are missing is that the entire concept of the dividend is an illusion there 's little qualitative difference between a stock that pays dividend and a stock that does n't if you were going to buy the stock then hold it forever and collect dividend you could get the same thing with a dividend less stock by simply waiting for it to gain say 5 value then sell of your stock and call the cash your dividend but wait you say that 's not the same my net worth has decreased guess what stocks that do pay dividend usually do drop in value right after the pay out and they drop by about the relative value of the dividend as well likewise you could take a stock that does pay dividend and make it look exactly like a non paying stock by simply taking every dividend you get and buying more of the same stock with it so from this simplistic point of view it is irrelevant whether the stock itself pays dividend or not there is always the same decision of whether to cut the goose or let it lay a few more eggs that every shareholder has to make it paying a dividend is essentially providing a different default choice but makes little difference with regards to your choices there is however more to it than simple return on investment arithmetic as i said the alternative to paying dividend is reinvesting profits back into the enterprise if the company decided to pay out dividend that means they think all the best investing is done and they do n't really have a particularly good idea for what to do with the extra money conversely not paying is like management telling the shareholders no we 're not done we 're still building our business so it can be a way of judging whether the company is concentrating on generating profit or growing itself needless to say the the market is wild and unpredictable and not everyone such assumptions furthermore as i said you can effectively overrule the decision by increasing or decreasing your position regardless of whether they have decided to pay dividend to begin with lastly there may be some subtle differences with regards to things like how the income is taxed and so on these do n't really have much to do with the market itself but the bureaucracy tacked onto the market

one could use technical indicators in any number of ways they are n't defined for use in any particular way   if they were only computers would use them having said that moving averages are frequently used by people operating on the assumption that short term price movements will soon be reverted back to a longer term mean   so if the price shoots up today traders who use moving averages may believe it will come back down pretty soon   if this is the belief and it usually is for this type of trader a price significantly above a moving average could indicate an overpriced stock   a price below the moving average could indicate an underpriced stock similarly a short term moving average above the long term moving average may indicate an overpriced stock   when you are dealing with more than one frequency though there is more disagreement about how to use technical indicators   some traders would probably say the opposite that a short term average above the long term average indicates an upward movement that will continue because they believe the stock has momentum note that i am not saying i believe in using these averages to predict mean reversion or momentum effects just that traders who rely on moving averages frequently do

i know this is rather late but with your income it is almost certainly better for your mother to claim you as a dependent i was in a similar situation this last year i did n't get the full weight of the tax break because my taxes went down to zero with this exemption along with claiming myself as a dependent i used turbotax to run both our taxes both ways to verify the difference was about 1000 dollars saved for my parents to claim me as a dependent vs claiming myself as a dependent     if you are unsure it does n't take long to run the numbers through turbotax taxact or some similar software

congratulations to you and good luck and good health with the baby i had a friend in a similar situation and i told him that he could do quite well by putting out the word to an upper middle class neighborhood that he was available to setup routers home networks etc   i suggested that he could start at a low enough wage that people would see the beneficial tradeoff to having him come over for a few hours versus doing it themselves after a few months he hired someone to take the extra work he was receiving and directed the more routine requests his employee   he had a full time job plus all the extra work he wanted   most people who hire him simply want someone they would trust in their home and his service spread by word of mouth   he also got to meet many people who liked him and were impressed by his work ethic resulting in many good connections if he ever wanted to pursue other employment my friend was an it professional the best support person at our tech heavy firm so he was n't giving his time away   he did enjoy doing it and he did enjoy the extra money   on an hourly basis especially once he added the assistant he was making more on the side than he did at his job   however i believe he did start lower than that good luck

running for profit business does n't pressure those involved to make the best product it pressures them to make the best profit   making the best profit pressures those involved to produce the cheapest product that the market wo n't reject marked at the highest price the market wo n't reject   private companies have the freedom to avoid or limit the effect of that pressure if they choose and sacrifice some profit for quality and improved customer satisfaction though many still choose profit   public companies who are eventually to shareholders who sole goal is profitability are much less likely to avoid the pressures to increase profits at all costs   particularly in the age of day traders and ceo merry go round long term planning is very difficult when short term profitability is on the line   a company that made one widget a year for $ 1 and sold that widget for $ 10 billion would be a very successful company from the profit standpoint and would likely have an excellent share price if the business model looked secure for the next year or two   competition helps alleviate this and pushes for better products and lower prices by upping the bar of what the market will reject over time increase the available alternatives and the features quality price scale shifts   the importance of having a level playing field anti monopoly laws and ensure that new players can come onto the scene is fundamental to capitalism working otherwise those who hold monopoly positions will prevent competition from emerging and charge as much as is possible for the cheapest product people will still buy   this is of particular issue when not buying the product is a threat to one 's life or safety medical care emergency services food etc

any accounting software should be able to handle this   when you invoice them set the invoice date to the date of the event   then receive a partial payment against that invoice   this will cause your accounting software to display the service income in the correct period as well   so if you sent them invoice for august 7 2014 event on may 5th 2014 and they gave you $ 500 due you would see this income in august $ 500 on cash basis $ 1000 on accrual basis   when you received the other $ 500 in august you would see $ 1000 for both methods   you would not see any income in may when you created the invoice   this is better for revenue matching with the correct period when you send them same invoice say 30 days before the event set the software to show payments already received   it seems that most online accounting software will do this by default   here is an example in     here is an example in xero   seems they both display information on when you can expect payment on the their respective    in the desktop version of quickbooks which i use a lot it will not show the balance of the customer by default on an invoice   you will have to modify the invoice template   there are more details on that here   in desktop version of quickbooks you can look at cash flow forecast report to see the expected amount coming in    i hope that helps and good luck

they used to pay over 90 during the glorious 30s 1940 1970 all of this is about the capture of politicians by the rich both democrats and republicans and the balance of power between labor and capital which has tilted on favor of capital as warren buffet said there is a class war and we are winning it with the free movement if capital it 's super easy for the super rich to get their money out of a country   now regarding of taxes and their level if you posit that taxes take away your hard earned work then both 10 and 90 are unacceptable it 's like a thief arguing he only stole 10 of a bank how is it more or less acceptable    of course i do n't subscribe to this logic at all i just want to point out that either any level of taxation is fair regardless of the level or unfair there are n't any in    to finish i would use market mechanisms to set taxation taxes on the super rich should be gradually increased until there is a noticeable effect on productive investment

there are a couple of things that are missing from your estimate in addition to your standard deduction you also have a personal exemption of $ 4050   so d in your calculation should be $ 6300 + $ 4050 = $ 10,350 as a self employed individual you need to pay both the employee and employer side of the social security and medicare taxes   instead of 6.2 + 1.45 you need to pay 6.2 + 1.45 2 = 15.3 self employment tax in addition there are some problems with your calculation quarter 1 estimated income should be your adjusted annual income divided by 4 not 3 likewise you should estimate your quarterly tax by estimating your income for the whole year then dividing by 4   so annual estimated federal tax should be quarterly estimated federal tax would be = 4 annual estimated self employment tax is = 15.3 a with the quarterly self employment tax being one fourth of that = 4 self employment tax gets added on to your federal income tax   so when you send in your quarterly payment using form 1040-es you should send in + the form 1040-es instructions pdf comes with the 2016 estimated tax worksheet that walks you through these calculations

frequently people saving money for a down payment or for their emergency fund feel that they need to find a way to the process via methods that will generate more interest than a bank account or a cd once they have reached their goal they also feel that having the money sitting around not generating income is a missed opportunity all investments that are n't 100 safe introduce risk to entice you to invest they offer the opportunity make more money than a bank account or cd but the downside is that the extra money is n't guaranteed in fact the introduced risk also opens up the investment to the possibility of losses including a total loss you have identified risks with bank accounts and cds with the bank account you will generally lose money vs. inflation with a cd the investment is less liquid if you sell early or you want need to sell 1/2 a cd you will give up some of that extra income also if rates on a cd rise next month you are locked into your current rate til the cd ends putting some or all of the money you are saving for the house into a risky investment means that you may shorten or extend the time period nobody knows   by investing in real estate we can offset the risk of real estate    going up in the next couple years if real estate goes up we will    still be able to use our down payment for a comparable house as of    now inversely if real estate goes down we will lose on the down    payment but be able to get a house cheaper unless the reit matches the market of residential real estate in your city metropolitan region there is no guarantee that home prices in your city will move the same way the reit does   a recent listing of the 10 largest holdings of the index is none of these tell me what home prices in my neighborhood will do next year

as an easy way to answer look at an index let 's say the s&p 500   look at the price this last october and predict where it will move in november easy right   it already happened and you have the benefit of hindsight   the move looks like such a consistent obvious continuation of the previous up and down pattern   it looks predictable like you could have guessed that   now look at today 's price and predict where it will go next month   not so easy now   the problem is every point you 're at all the time looks like a possible inflection point or turning point   if you 're following an uptrend you may think it 'll continue but you may also think that it so far up already that now it 's ready for a down where you 'll buy   so you wait and it keeps rising and you kick yourself for missing out   next time you see another uptrend and resolve to buy it regardless thinking now it 'll keep going but it turns down the second you buy it and keeps dropping   you kick yourself again   the market is amazing at doing this to you every time   in real time every wiggle in the price looks simultaneously like a trend that could continue and like a trend that has moved far enough and is ready to reverse   and more likely you 'll guess the wrong one    the only way with some little hope of succeeding is to study study study and find and learn trading rules with just over 50/50 chances like buying when a moving average is touched within an uptrend as an example and setting a stop loss at -1 and a sell limit at + 2 or something and then never ever deviate from that strategy because your only hope is in the consistency of statistics and odds over time   you 'll get many -1 losses and hopefully enough 2 gains to compensate the losses plus some profit    or to make it easier just buy in on a dip and hold and hold and collect dividends and be content to match the market without effort

first check out some of the answers on this question oversimplify it for me the correct order of investing when you have determined that you are ready to invest for retirement there are two things you need to consider the investment and the account   these are separate items the investment is what makes your money grow the type of account provides tax advantages and restrictions   generally these can be considered separately for the most part you can do any type of investment in any account briefly here is an overview of some of the main options in your situation the roth ira is what i would recommend this grows tax free and if you need the funds for some reason you can get out what you put in without penalty you can invest up to $ 5500 in your roth ira each year in addition to the above reasons which are true for anybody a roth ira would be especially beneficial for you for three reasons for someone that is closer in age to retirement and in a higher tax bracket now a roth ira is less attractive than it is for you inside your roth ira there are lots of choices you can invest in stocks bonds mutual funds which are simply collections of stocks and bonds bank accounts precious metals and many other things discussing all of these investments in one answer is too broad but my recommendation is this if you are investing for retirement you should be investing in the stock market however picking individual stocks is too risky you need to be diversified in a lot of stocks stock mutual funds are a great way to invest in the stock market   there are lots of different types of stock mutual funds with different strategies and expenses associated with them managed funds actively buy and sell different stocks inside them but have high expenses to pay the managers index funds buy and hold a list of stocks and have very low expenses the conventional wisdom is that in general index funds perform better than managed funds when you take the expenses into account   i hope this overview and these recommendations were helpful if you have any specific questions about any of these types of accounts or investments feel free to ask another question

no financial interest means that you have signing authority over the account but you do n't own the money in it and are n't allowed to withdraw from it at will one example would be a business account owned by a company where you 're employed as a purchasing manager and you need to sign checks drawn on that account to pay invoices fbar does n't care about income it just wants to know about every account that you having signing authority over

for whatever it 's worth   judging from the comments in the other answers i think everyone is addressing your question how can you possibly lose money   there are a lot of ways to possibly lose money in the stock market   here are my thoughts   this is a chart of the s&p 500 from about 1996 to about 2012   at the top from the first arrow the entire s&p500 index fell about 45   from the top of the second arrow the entire s&p500 index fell about 52   it is really easy to look at our sustained bull market and feel   and while i 'll concede that not every company in the index fell over these two periods bear in mind that the s&p500 index is a collection of the 500 largest companies in the united states and the entire index lost half it 's value twice   as the companies contained in the index shrink in value they were replaced by companies that are the new biggest 500 in the country then those fell too and so on and so forth until the entire index lost half value is a funny thing because it is n't necessarily tied to the performance of the business look at the current rosy valuations of all these non earnings tech companies   it could be that a company is still performing very well but there are just no buyers for the stock    so how can you lose money in the stock market   very easily   in a practical sense it 's when you need the money and can no longer weather the storm   people who went out for retirement around 2000 could n't sit around and wait until 2007 for their account values to be replenished   this is why you roll off your stock exposure as you age   as you get older you do n't have time and if you stop having income you can find yourself selling your assets at the least opportune time

a couple of thoughts and experiences germany italy first of all i recommend talking to the belgian bank and possibly to a dutch bank of your choice i have similar conditions for my german bank accounts but even though they talk about it as salary account all they really ask for is a monthly inflow of more than xxxx € which can be satisfied with an automatic direct transfer i have some money automatically circulating for this reason which earns about 4 p.a by saving fees in that case it may be a feasible way to have a belgian and a dutch bank account and set up some money circulation   experiences working in italy some years ago sepa payments were kind of new and the debits were n't implemented then   my guess with your service providers is that they are allowed to offer you contracts that are bound to rather arbitrary payment conditions after all you probably can also get a prepaid phone or a contract with a bill that you can then pay by wire transfer however afaik they are allowed to offer discounts ask fees for different payment methods just like there is no law that forces the store around your corner to accept credit cards or even large eur denominations as long as they tell you so beforehand    afaik there is eu regulation saying your bank is n't allowed to charge you more for wire to foreign country within the sepa zone than a national wire transfer

i am not sure if this is the actual reason or not but all of the major credit cards visa mastercard amex discover provide damage insurance coverage on car rentals debit cards do not usually provide this coverage so if you use a credit card the car company knows it will be able to recover the cost of any damage to the car   of course this does n't explain some of the odd debit card policies out there for example will not let you use a debit card unless you provide proof of round trip travel like a plane or cruise ticket but you can use a credit card without having a travel ticket i 'm not sure how having a travel ticket makes debit card users less of a risk but apparently it does somehow

if you 're in the 25 tax bracket then you probably should n't be doing a roth conversion right now   you 'd prefer to do roth conversions when you can do so at a 15 rate   you could contribute some of your current annual contributions to roth directly but even that is n't a great idea except to diversify your holdings odds are you wo n't be paying 25 average tax rate on your retirement unless you 're doing very well in your retirement account   odds are you 'll be somewhere around 15   converting at a 15 rate therefore is fine basically you 'll have something like this based on some assumptions i 'm making up dollars brackets etc obviously these will change doing this you pay 0 15 tax on up to 75k then pay 0 tax after that on the roth which you paid 15 tax on already   therefore you do n't end up paying more than 15 on any single dollar and you pay less on the total sum   but you also do n't really want to be paying 25 on any of it since that wo n't really help you out any and could hurt you will hurt you if you end up getting some of that 15 bracket income from the roth if you 're in the 25 bracket now then you probably are better off just keeping everything in regular ira unless you 're expecting to be in the 28 bracket after retirement   putting some in roth is n't a terrible idea just for diversification 's sake but it 's probably going to cost you money unless tax rates rise dramatically which they certainly could though not as likely to rise on the middle class 0 100k range   they 'd have to double for you to be worse off this way and finally do not ever withdraw from the 401k to pay taxes on a conversion you 're subject to a 10 penalty for doing that as it 's an early withdrawal and also have to pay taxes on that withdrawal      for more information about when roth makes sense read site joetaxpayer 's blog article on the subject which explains this in great detail

assume you 're asking about things like the consumer price index   different countries have different approaches   if they 're honest then the statistical sampling is conducted independently and consistently with a clear publication schedule and as littleadv answered by the men with it is that publication schedule which leads to a little of speculation as investors try to guess what unemployment growth or inflation figures may be immediately prior to release for many countries such inflation measurement is entirely political and so the statistical sampling is anything but honest or consistent   argentina 's official inflation rate for example is but analysts regard the real inflation rate as closer to 25   places like venezuela zimbabwe iran and even egypt prior to their revolution who knows now all manipulate statistics to portray their countries economies in a better light however even in the us where the bureau of labour statistics bls has been nominally independent for over a century the choice of what to include in the consumer basket the official basket of items chosen to reflect cost of living and measured by the men with is not always honest   for 30 years the us basket has excluded house prices because they were too volatile   enter house price credit disaster

i asked this question in another sub but i thought i might also get answers here    i was just wondering how pension funds or investment firms calculate the interest that they give to their members or clients in the us or whichever country you are from    i ask this because i have a gut feeling that the national pension fund in my country does it the wrong way and is basically cheating people so i wanted to make a comparison with other countries forgive me if i 'm wrong and there 's nothing to worry about    ok so what they do is collect money in a given financial year which starts in july and ends in june let 's say they collect 100 million in 2010 11 they then invest this 100 million in the year july 2011 june 2012 after deducting admin costs and all that interest for this 2010 11 money is declared on october 1st 2012    that basically means that money someone contributed in july 2010 will earn interest 2 years later in 2012 i just feel like that is not how it should be done but you can correct me if i 'm wrong    they also regularly give interest at about 12 which is good when i read about interest rates in the us being around 7 but i feel like since this interest is basically announced after 2 years that 12 is n't as good as it seems    someone help me understand if i 'm wrong   thanks

if you pay off a debt through a collections agency it will damage your credit   here 's an alternative approach   settling a $ 10 k loan for $ 2 k shows the lender is keen to settle    instead of paying the collections agency negotiate with the lender and agree to pay 2 k to settle provided that they agree to this could be a win win for both   the lender gets to keep full 2 k without having to pay the collection agency a fat commission and your credit is n't damaged not saying this will always work but worth a try    pro tip get everything in writing before you pay anything

let 's look at basics your 340 k mortgage amortized over 25 years at 3.5 is going to cost you $ 1700 in payments almost exactly your rent you wo n't be paying out less you will in fact be paying out more because you are now liable for more insurance and any repairs will have to be paid for by you not the landlord so do n't do this to save money figures from here do n't forget that it is extremely likely that interest rates will go up in the next few years 7 is not unlikely can you afford it if your payments double you can get a fixed rate mortgage but they are going to cost you much more than 3.5 for more than a couple of years do n't be fooled by the pay yourself argument for getting a mortgage in the first few years almost all of your payments is interest not paying down the principal you are just switching from paying a landlord to paying a bank there are huge advantages to waiting until you have a good down payment before buying a house people with a big down payment get better interest rates and do n't need to pay as much cmhc insurance you will be less at risk if the price of your house drops also ask yourself if you are sure you will be in your house for five years if not even real estate agents would usually admit you should n't buy the truck payment should n't be an issue as long as you are sure you can service both truck and mortgage payments nor is $ 600 in credit card debt significant in the big scheme i would probably put any spare cash towards a down payment it reduces your interest rate possibly some expenses with regard to your mortgage and your risk if you have to sell and your house value has dropped   you might like to look at the government of canada website rent or buy it 's down right now so i ca n't give you a link i 'll edit it in when it 's back up edit turns out it 's offline for updating here 's the link

diversification is a risk mitigation strategy when you invest in equities you generally get a higher rate of return than a fixed income investment but you have risks a single company 's market value can decline for all sorts of reasons including factors outside of the control of management diversification lets you spread risk and concentrate on sectors that you feel offer the best value investing outside of your currency zone allows you to diversify more but also introduces currency risks which require a whole other level of understanding today investing in emerging markets is very popular for us investors because these economies are booming and us monetary policy has been weakening the dollar for some time a major bank failure in china or a flip to a strong dollar policy could literally implode those investments overnight at the end of the day invest in what you understand know the factors that can lower your investment value

you want to have 2 4 credit cards with a credit utilization ratio below 30   if you only have 2 cards closing 1 would reduce your credit diversity and thus lower your credit score   you also want at least 2 years credit history so closing an older credit card may shorten your credit history again lowering your credit score   you want to keep around at least 1 2 older cards even if they are not the best you have 4 cards but having 2 4 cards you have 4 means you can add a 5th and then cancel one down to 4 or cancel one down to 3 and then add a 4th for little net effect   still there will be effect as you have decreased the age of your credit and you have opened new credit always a ding to your score do you have installment loans cars you mention a new mortgage so you need to wait about 3 months after the most recent credit activity to let the effects of that change settle you want both spouses to have separate credit cards and that will increase the total available to 4 8   that would allow you to increase the number of benefits available

the scenarios you describe are obviously easy to catch it is reasonably defined in tax law but more needs to be done to exert the spirit of the rules the problem is that when international businesses are cross charging   there is limited information the tax offices have to argue the toss for example a uk tax office can not audit the accounts of its us parent in order to decide whether a cross charge representing license fees and marketing costs is fair but these types of transaction are one of the primary mechanism for avoiding taxes these are inferred by the uk companies accounts but not in the open in the sense that they can be easily challenged with accurate information and that is why it happens people know about it but it is still not easy to stop

your initial premise mid cap and small cap company stocks have outperformed the market is partially correct they have over many 40 yr periods provided higher returns than large caps or bond funds the important thing to consider here is that risk adjusted the returns from a diversified portfolio are far more robust with proper asset allocation you and expect high returns and reduce your risk simultaneously   imagine this scenario you decide to stick to small mid caps for 10 15 yrs and move into a more diversified portfolio then had you made that decision during a sustained period of poor small cap performance late 80s or the 40 's you would have lost a of return as those were periods were small underperformed the market as a whole and large caps in particular as an example from 1946 to large caps outperformed small every single year if 2016 were to be the first year of a similar trend you 've done yourself a major disservice   since the dot com crash small have outperformed for sure pretty much every year but that does n't mean that they will continue to do so the reason asset allocation exists is precisely this over a 40 yr period no single asset class outperforms a diversified portfolio   if you attempt to time the market even if you do so with a multi decade time horizon in mind there a good chance that you will do more poorly

at the most fundamental level every market is comprised of buyers and selling trading securities these buyers and sellers decide what and how to trade based on the probability of future events as they see it that 's a simple statement but an example demonstrates how complicated it can be picture a company that 's about to announce earnings some investors traders from here on agents will have purchased the company 's stock a while ago with the expectation that the company will have strong earnings and grow going forward other agents will have sold the stock short bought put options etc with the expectation that the company wo n't do as well in the future still others may be unsure about the future of the company but still expecting a lot of volatility around the earnings announcement so they 'll have bought sold the stock options futures etc to take advantage of that volatility   all of these various predictions expectations etc factor into what agents are bidding and asking for the stock its associated derivatives and other securities which in turn determines its price along with overall economic factors like the sector 's performance interest rates etc it can be very difficult to determine exactly how markets are factoring in information about an event though take the example in your question the article states that if market expectations of higher interest rates tightened credit conditions in this case lenders could expect higher interest rates in the future so they may be less willing to lend money now because they expect to earn a higher interest rate in the future you could also see this reflected in bond prices because since interest rates are inversely related to bond prices higher interest rates could decrease the value of bond portfolios this could lead agents to sell bonds now in order to lock in their profits while other agents could wait to buy bonds because they expect to be able to purchase bonds with a higher rate in the future   furthermore higher interest rates make taking out loans more expensive for individuals and businesses this potential decline in investment could lead to decreased revenue profits for businesses which could in turn cause declines in the stock market agents expecting these declines could sell now in order to lock in their profits buy derivatives to hedge against or ride out possible declines etc however the current low interest rate environment makes it cheaper for businesses to obtain loans which can in turn drive investment and lead to increases in the stock market this is one criticism of the easy money quantitative easing policies of the us federal reserve i.e. the low interest rates are driving a bubble in the stock market one quick example of how tricky this can be the usual assumption is that positive economic news e.g. low unemployment numbers strong business residential investment etc will lead to price increases in the stock market as more agents see growth in the future and buy accordingly however in the us positive economic news has recently led to declines in the market because agents are worried that positive news will lead the federal reserve to taper stop quantitative easing sooner rather than later thus ending the low interest rate environment and possibly tampering growth   summary in short markets incorporate information about an event because the buyers and sellers trade securities based on the likelihood of that event its possible effects and the behavior of other buyers and sellers as they react to the same information information may lead agents to buy and sell in multiple markets e.g. equity and fixed income different types of derivatives etc which can in turn affect prices and yields throughout numerous markets

if money is more expensive costs more to borrow then fewer people will be able to qualify to make the payments for a particular size of mortgage   this reduces the number of potential buyers for property at that price   as sellers still want to sell they will move their prices down to where more people can afford to buy so rising interest rates create downward pressure on housing prices but toronto is the biggest city in canada   i 'd expect part of the high prices there is the location lots of people want to be close to lots of activities action and opportunity   unless something catastrophic happens i do n't see toronto losing that advantage   if anything it 's going to get a tad warmer up there in the coming decades

a strategy of rebalancing assumes that the business cycle will continue that all bull and bear markets end eventually   imagine that you maintained a 50 split between a us treasury bond mutual fund and an s&p 500 stock mutual fund vfinx beginning with a $ 10,000 investment in each on january 1 2008 then on the first of each year you rebalanced your portfolio on the first of january we can pretend the markets are open that day the following table illustrates the values in each of those funds with the rebalancing transactions this second table shows what that same money would look like without any rebalancing over those years obviously this is cherry picking for the biggest drop we 've recently experienced but even if you skipped 2008 and 2009 the increase for a rebalanced portfolio from 2010 2017 is 85 verses 54 for the portfolio that is not being rebalanced in the same period this is also a plenty conservative portfolio you can see that a 100 stock portfolio dropped 40 in 2008 but the combined portfolio only dropped 18 a 100 stock portfolio has gained 175 since 2009 compared to 105 for the balanced portfolio but it 's common to trade gains for safety as you get closer to retirement you did n't ask about a 100 stock portfolio in your initial question these results would be repeated in many other portfolio allocations because some asset classes outperform others one year then underperform the next you sell after the years it outperforms then you buy after years that it underperforms

i used to work as a sale support for one of these companies as a sale support i did n't get commission from the sale but a sale manager did and he made good money however i ended up doing a lot of the sales myself and never got any commission for it even though the boss kept promising me that i would get them it 's relatively easy money but i felt like you have to sell your soul a little it 's hard to justify for yourself that a 30 interest for a 6 month term is a great deal so you can get your guests to take the loan most of the clients you will likely get are the ones who 1 have little knowledge about finance and/or 2 can not get a loan anywhere else nobody would get a loan with these companies if they have a better choice i also found it was borderline harassment for my clients because i was forced to constantly call them few times a day to get them into taking our loan offers i did end up leaving the company after three months because the boss was and thought he could do it all himself   back to your question it is not shady mostly because it 's definitely legal but the sales tactics can be that would depend on your management but i would say most companies probably employs similar tactics

depending on how you view the loan it could either be considered an asset or a liability   since you are not charging interest it might seem more intuitive to create an assets cash loan account and transfer money to from it when you receive payments like you would with a bank account personally i prefer to think of all loans as liabilities   whether it 's a debt which you owe someone or a balance which someone else owes you since it 's an unsettled amount i file it under liabilities loan   either way you record the initial balance as a debit from your bank and then record payments as credits back to your primary account the only way that income or expenses ever gets involved would be if you charged interest income or if you some or all of the loan expense at some point in the future

i 'm in agreement with what you write i think these are good questions   from my perspective i think the staggering growth of technology is both the cause and the answer to stagnating wage productivity increase conundrum today a small business will hire a secretary to use email and excel while in 1980 they would have hired a team of accountants with piles of ledger books we are paying less employees while accomplishing more    at the same time technology gives us all in the general public a higher standard of living through better phones more access to cheap free education better health care better infrastructure more cheaply than anyone in 1980 would have imagined   what happens when we get to the point that any person that is halfway capable and not on drugs can survive just fine in a 40 hour if we got to that point the normal of rate of growth and wage stagnation and economic mobility would there would be people happy to live a stress free life at that baseline survive just fine and there would be people working their butts off to acquire more than anyone might need    i think it all comes down to people wanting what someone else has and calling it unfair because they do n't seem to deserve it more than anyone else i think the real goal we should strive for is liberty and opportunity for anyone to pursue their form of improving their quality of life government intervention and distorted views of fairness tend to hinder that

any one of your three options is viable and has its advantages and disadvantages personally i would go for the used option but i am can do kind of person if you do n't like micro managing a car you may prefer leasing a new car is sort of the middle of the road option leasing will be most expensive and most liability if you have an accident the leasing arrangements are designed to extract money from you heavily even a minor accident can require you to pay for expensive repairs usually much more expensive than if you had your own car fixed so not only will you pay more per month but your accident liability will be a lot higher with your own car you will need to sell it or bring it back to the uk obviously a used car will be the cheapest option a non used car from the local area can also make you blend in and be less like to be targeted by a criminal as an outsider as long as you stay away from dealers and buy the car from a private person of good reputation you have an odds on chance of getting a decent car make sure you check out the person and make sure they are real some dealers called try to pretend to be original owners you can always spot such frauds because the title will be new make sure the same owner has had the car for at least 3 4 years and that it says that on the title also try to buy from somebody who is financially well off they have less reason to try to screw you students people under 30 and working class are bad people to buy from married professionals over age 35 are the right kind of person to buy from

my opinion is that 50 savings is the number to shoot for and i strive toward that number as often as possible   10 savings for retirement 10 savings for short term emergency fund 25 payment on mortgage principal 5 savings for planned big purchases i overpay the principal so that 25 of my income goes to principal payments and i separately account for the mortgage interest home owners insurance as another expense in my budget   because of this aggressive payment schedule the house i bought 2 years ago will be payed in full in another 9 years   i own another property outright that i paid down in the same fashion and i collect rent on it as a supplement to my income   i started with a small townhouse that i could easily afford but now i have a much larger home that i can still easily afford the emergency fund does n't need to be more than 6 months of expenses which is 3 months of income if your expenses are only 50 of your income   i keep 6 months of expenses liquid and another 12 in a low risk investment   once you have your emergency fund funded you can add that percentage to a different category say 15 to retirement and 10 to planned big purchases or you can over fund it   i have had a few catastrophes that have depleted that fund so i like having the extra 12 months of income available i set the last 5 aside for wants that are not regular expenses   if i want a car i save 5 of my income until i can pay cash for it   i have an infinite number of these wants so i prioritize them and buy them in order when the cash becomes available the reason i use percentages is to keep me focused when my income increases instead of spending all the additional money that i could afford to spend each time i get a raise i instead only increase my expenses to the 50 mark   it was much harder to save 50 when i got my first job out of college but now i live quite comfortably on that percentage and i could take a large hit to my income before i would need to make significant changes to my lifestyle

publication covers this in a fairly specific manner page 11 section are you covered by an employer plan specifies the form w-2 you receive from your employer has a box    used to indicate whether you were covered for the year    the retirement plan box should be checked if you were    covered so by default if that 's checked you 're covered   590 does go into more detail though assuming you 're covered under a defined contribution plan a 401k for example defined contribution plan generally you are covered    by a defined contribution plan for a tax year if amounts are    contributed or allocated to your account for the plan year    that ends with or within that tax year   tax year tax year your tax year is the annual accounting period    you use to keep records and report income and expenses    on your income tax return for almost all people the tax    year is the calendar year further they cover issues related to an employee leaving dec. 31 very specifically a special rule applies to certain plans in which it is not    possible to determine if an amount will be contributed to    your account for a given plan year if for a plan year no    amounts have been allocated to your account that are attributable    to employer contributions employee contributions    or by the last day of the plan year and    contributions are discretionary for the plan year you are    not covered for the tax year in which the plan year ends if    after the plan year ends the employer makes a contribution    for that plan year you are covered for the tax year in    which the contribution is made example example mickey was covered by a profit sharing plan    and left the company on december 31 2014 the plan    year runs from july 1 to june 30 under the terms of the    plan employer contributions do not have to be made but    if they are made they are contributed to the plan before    the due date for filing the company 's tax return such contributions    are allocated as of the last day of the plan year    and allocations are made to the accounts of individuals    who have any service during the plan year as of june 30    2015 no contributions were made that were allocated to    the june 30 2015 plan year and no had been    allocated within the plan year in addition as of that date    the company was not obligated to make a contribution for    such plan year and it was impossible to determine    whether or not a contribution would be made for the plan    year on december 31 2015 the company decided to    contribute to the plan for the plan year ending june 30    2015 that contribution was made on february 15 2016    mickey is an active participant in the plan for his 2016 tax    year but not for his 2015 tax year mickey is in a similar but different circumstance and it 's clear from the irs 's treatment of his circumstance that you would be in the same boat just a year less off but be aware given mickey 's situation that it 's theoretically possible for them to make another contribution next year as mickey had depending on when their plan year etc ends so from the irs 's point of view everything you said the company did is correct   they paid you in january contributed to your 401k as a result of that paycheck and thus you were officially considered covered for 2015

1 internet is not a regular product or service it 's a utility   2 an unregulated utility market simply leads to regional monopolies because the companies privately own the infrastructure   that 's exactly what we have   the cable companies cut up the country and generally stay out of 's turf because it 's more profitable than competition   this is the opposite of a capitalist market by the way   they are now all billionaires from providing bear minimum service and avoiding any real competition   instead of competing they slowly build enough money until they can simply buy out their competitors   comcast has gotten so rich it bought nbc and is now looking to buy twc   3 fair competition for utilities requires rules that prevent the company from blocking out competitors this is called open wiki this is what they have throughout most of europe this does n't happen here because the monopolies use their billions to buy political influence in washington dc via lobbyists campaign fund raising donations etc   it is so effective that the former chair of the fcc michael powell made a bashing open access competition rules and praising our monopoly system saying it has resulted in the best internet in the world which is of course a bold faced demonstrable lie   video used to be on youtube ca n't find it anymore   4 the root cause is an apathetic voter base who view washington as too corrupt to even reform which keeps the people who care about this issue the most away from the poles   this simply strengthens the power of the corporate lobbyists to control politics even more   5 to take on these giants you need to be a giant yourself with tons of money to burn and a big reason to do it even though you 'll probably lose money since it 's more like charity than a great business opportunity   the only ones who fit the bill are google and only because they have a vested interest in keeping the internet free open fast robust and affordable   it also helps that they spent the past decade buying up fiber optic infrastructure

i am going to assume your location is the us from what i am seeing it is unlikely you will get a loan other than some government backed thing   you are a poor risk at 7k month you have above average household income   the fact that all of your income is being washed off somewhere is a behavior problem not a mathematical one   for example why do you have a car payment   you should purchase a car for cash failing that given reasonable rent 1100 reasonable car payment 400 insurances 300 other expenses 1000 you should clear at least 4000 per month in cash flow   where is that money going   here tracking spending and budgeting is your friend   figure out the leaks in your budget and fix them by cutting back and perhaps working a second job or somehow earning more you could have a down payment for a home in as little as 10 months   that is not a very long time    similarly we can discuss the grocery store   had you prepared for this moment three years ago you could have bought the store for cash   this would have eliminated a bunch of risk and increase the likelihood of this venture 's success   if you had started this one year ago you could have gone in with a significant down payment   the bank would see this as a good risk if you wanted to borrow the remainder instead the bank sees you as a person as a poor risk   you spend every dime you make without much concern for the future or possible negative events by implication of your question   if you can not handle the cash flows of regular employment well how can you handle the cash flows of a grocery business   it is far more complex and there is far less room for error    so how do you get a loan   i would start with learning on how to manage your personal finance well prior to into the world of business

when dividend is announced the stock and option price may react to that news but the actual payout of the dividend on the ex dividend date is what you probably are referring to the dividend payout affects the stock price on the ex dividend date as the stock price will drop by the amount of paid out dividend not taking into account other factors this in turn drives the prices of all options   the amount of change in the option price for this event is not only dependent the dividend payout but also on how far these are in our out of the money and what there time to expiration is the price of a call option that is far out of the money would react less than the price of a put that would be far in the money therefore i would argue that these two will not necessarily offset each other

there seems to be a gap in the internal logic of this story   gt some enterprising person maybe the merchant who runs the trading post comes up with the idea to just issue one note for all the farms in town he calls a meeting with all the farmers and proposes to have the town priest keep a book of certificates and so on and the farmers will get notes just like everyone else in exchange for the crops they contribute to the pool and the merchant will keep a cut of the crops with which to hire some accountants and farm to estimate the total crop yields across town and so on   gap   gt everyone agrees or at least enough farmers agree to kind of force the other ones to get on board if they want to participate meaningfully in the town economy and we now have something like a central bank issuing something like fiat currency that is currency whose value is decided by some central authority as opposed to the kind of straight up exchange certificates that can be traded for an actual apple from the issuer for example   we went from a system where the underlying product apples could actually be obtained to a system in which the underlying product apparently can not be obtained leaving only derivative if that markets of people swapping notes for other products and services   do you mean to say the enterprising person simply ended the ability to get apples and switched cold turkey to a new system in which the underlying product either does not exist or is not redeemable

paying off your house quickly should be a priority behind making sure you have some basic savings but definitely ahead of any investing concerns because your house is not an investment it 's your home   if you 're brave foolish enough to try buying houses as investments in the current climate this obviously does n't apply to you this is n't a financial matter so much as an issue of basic prudence   if something disastrous happens you lose your job get in a serious car accident your kid comes down with cancer etc it will put tremendous strain on your financial resources   if you own your home outright when this happens it means that no matter what else might go wrong you ca n't get foreclosed on and end up out on the streets and that 's worth more than any rate of return you can reasonably expect to find even in the best of times it 's a well known investing to never bet anything that you ca n't afford to lose   in light of that consider this if you have a mortgage that is not paid off that 's exactly what you 're doing   you are placing a bet against a bank that you 'll remain solvent long enough to pay off the mortgage and your home is the wager   mortgages may be a necessary evil with housing prices being what they are but make no mistake they are evil   get rid of yours as quickly as you can

i think you need to realize that regardless of whether they are shady or not owners founders are by and large in it for themselves you as an employee as just a resource why should they divulge their finances to you you wo n't offend them if you and ask for it but they simply are not going to give you the straight up they will give you a bare minimum or some song and dance that beats around the bush without actually telling you what you need to know in regards to whether you should buy the restricted shares why not startups are a gamble anyway so simply decide how much you 're willing to gamble and spend that much buying some shares i mean you 're already taking the gamble by accepting a lower salary in exchange for equity which in all likelihood will never be worth anything anyway

the value of a business without proven profits is really just a guess   but to determine what ownership the vc takes some measure must be used   he is asking the op to start the negotiations   so you start high higher than you will settle for the value of the business should always be way more the $ $ you have put into it because you have also invested your time which has an opportunity cost and assumed huge risk that you will never get those $ $ back    when you need the cash and only one person will give it to you you are over a barrel   you either take the terms they offer or you let the business collapse   so keep a show of strength and invent other or create a business plan showing that you can continue without their $ $ just at a smaller volume

the problem with this story is it 's basically saying run your business like betting on the lotto   just because there 's anecdotal evidence that a bob might grace your company does n't mean you should sell the company trying to please every customer    for every one company that bumps into a bob there are thousands who helping those disgruntled customers drive the business into the ground   this is not to say that companies should n't try to go above and beyond   it 's just above and beyond should be controlled   for example if i were to own a restaurant and i see a customer drop food on the floor i would enable my wait staff to clean it up and give free food as a replacement   but i would also limit this   if the customer starts throwing food at the staff i would also enable the staff to kick the mother fucker out   sure the customer might be a bob and come back later with 4 million dollars to give me but i 'd prefer my staff keep their fucking dignity

you can not get your investment out and leave only the capital gains until they become taxable at the long term rate when you sell some shares after holding them for less than a year you have capital gains on which you will have to pay taxes at the short term capital gains rate that is at the same rate as ordinary income   as an example if you bought 100 shares at $ 70 for a net investment of $ 7000 and sell 70 of them at $ 100 after five months to get your initial investment back you will have short term capital gains of $ 30 per share on the 70 shares that you sold and so you have to pay tax on that $ the other $ 4900 = $ is tax free since it is just your purchase price of the 70 shares being returned to you   so after paying the tax on your short term capital gains you really do n't have your   initial investment back you have something less the capital gains on   the 30 shares that you continue to hold will become long term capital gains income to you only when you sell the shares after having held them for a full year or more the gains on the shares sold after five months are taxable income in the year of sale

i 'm not an attorney or a tax advisor the following is not to be considered advice just general information in the us putting your name on the deed would mean making you a co owner absent any other legal agreement between you e.g. a contract stating each of you owns 50 of the house both of you would then be considered to own 100 of the house jointly and in addition the irs would almost certainly interpret the creation of your ownership interest as a gift from your partner to you making them liable for gift tax the gift tax could be postponed by filing a gift tax return which would reduce partner 's lifetime combined gift estate tax exemption and if you sought to get rid of your ownership interest by giving it to your partner it would again be a taxable gift with the tax or loss of estate tax exemption accruing to you however it is likely that this is all moot because of the mortgage on the house any change to the deed would have to be approved by the mortgage holder and if so approved executed by a title company registered closing agent or similar depending on the laws of your state in my similar case the mortgage holder refused to add or remove any names from the deed unless i refinanced at a higher rate naturally making the new partners jointly liable for the mortgage we also had to pay an additional title fee to change the deed

thinking about the business overall your profit would be since this is a sole proprietorship the taxes are going to depend on your marginal tax rate if you file jointly your income will determine what your marginal tax rate is   if you file separately there likely would n't be any tax on that income since it 's less than the standard deduction but you lose benefits of filing jointly combined exemptions etc so think about how much she would charge what expenses are involved before taxes what the taxes would be on that profit and what the opportunity costs are is it worth time away from the kids hobbies etc for that hobby how much should a hobby business make to make it worth the effort of charging for such services that would fall in the expense section   are you talking about the actual costs tax prep etc or just the hassle of collecting accounting etc   certainly those are a consideration but it 's harder to quantify that   if you can come up with some sort of cost then certainly it would fit in the overall value equation i 'm not sure using additional social security benefits as a gauge is helpful since you would n't see those benefits until you 're of retirement age according to ss and a lot can happen between now and then

you ca n't force a horse to eat carrots you have to make him hungry   it 's good that you 're ready to start saving the hardest part about building wealth is that most people live in denial they think a bigger hat is wealth that said you need to get your husband excited about the idea of saving if you 're capable of a little passion in him for saving then you 'll see your wealth grow almost over night   so how do you make someone excited about something as boring as saving great question if you find a way write a book honestly i think it 's different for everyone for me it was like someone turned on a light i was blind but then i saw if he is a reader then i would suggest the following books in this order if he makes it through those and has any argument at all against saving then write a book about him haha   now i want to be clear the other two answers above mine were also spot on if you ca n't get him passionate about it then you need to take the initiative and start doing it yourself i ca n't stress enough though that you both need to be engaged in order to do it quickly and efficiently   good luck

if you can still work i think a very good course of action would be to invest the majority of the money in low cost index funds for many years the reason is that you are young and have plenty of time to build a sizable retirement fund how you go about this course of action depends on your comfort level with managing your money taxes retirement accounts etc at a minimum open an investment account at any of the major firms schwab fidelity for example they will provide you with a free financial advisor ideally s he would recommend something like open a retirement account and invest as much as you can tax free or tax deferred since you already received the money tax free a roth ira seems like a no brainer pick some low fee equity funds like an s&p 500 index fund for a large chunk of the money avoid individual stocks if you are n't comfortable with them alternatively get a recommendation for a fixed fee financial planner that can help you plan for your future above all do n't spend beyond your means you have an opportunity to fund a very nice future for yourself especially if you are able to work while you are still so young

one common rule of thumb you can probably get 4 or better returns on your investments typical market rate of return is 8 to allow for inflation and off years figure out what kind of income you will want in retirement and divide by 0.04 to get the savings you need to accumulate to support that    this does n't allow for the fact that your needs are also going to increase with inflation you can make a guess at that and use an inflated needs estimate   not sophisticated   not precise but it 's a quick and dirty ballpark estimate and sometimes it 's surprisingly close to what a proper model would say
