another way to look at this is if we separate the owner 's account from the business 's account   at the start of the year the owner puts $ 9 into the business account to get the business started at the end of the first day the business account has $ 10 and at the end of the second day the business account has $ 11   the owner does n't need to add any more of his own money into the business account at the end of the day the business will have $ which is $ 365 profit + $ 9 investment   assuming the business has no other expenses the business will calculate profit for the year like this the author is making a strange point the two numbers he is talking about are two different quantities the business owner 's return on investment is $ 365 $ 9 =   but the business 's profit margin is $ 365 $ = 10   both are useful numbers when running the business i disagree with the author 's that a business is doing something tricky when calculating profit margin remember that in addition to the business owner 's monetary investment he worked every day for a year to earn that $ 365

nothing wrong with the other answers but here 's a trick to hopefully make it totally transparent    imagine that you 're not the one implementing this business plan but someone else is   let 's call this other person your asset manager   so on the first day you give your asset manager $ 9   he takes this and generates $ 1 profit from it recovering the $ 9 which he then reinvests to generate $ 1 profit every day   from your perspective you just gave him $ 9   at the end of the year he gives you $ 365 in addition to your original investment of $ 9 in real life he 'd take the fees of course or perhaps he 's been lending out the money he 's been accumulating and taking the interest from that as pay for his services   so your return on investment is 365 9 100 > 4000 as claimed by your source

your initial investment in this case is $ 9 on the first morning every other morning you are using part of your profits to buy the new piece of jewelry so you are actually not investing any new funds so each day you are effectively keeping $ 1 of your profits and investing $ 9 but your initial investment of your own funds is only the first $ 9 in other words if you only had $ 9 in the bank at the start of the year you could make $ 365 profits during the year and finish up with $ in the the bank at the end of the year
# 444540
you 're confused because the source you cite leaves out one number that is n't relevant to the argument they 're making total costs the number you 're expecting $ 9 x 365 or $ is the total cost of buying the jewelry which when subtracted from the $ sales volume gives us the net profit of $ 365   the investment is the amount of money original put into a system our company in this case the merchant bought his first piece of jewelry for $ 9 sold it for $ 10 took one dollar in profit and used the other 9 to reinvest by buying a new piece of jewelry we can extend the analogy further after 9 days of selling the merchant will $ 18 allowing him to now buy 2 pieces of jewelry each morning and sell them for $ 20 every day his costs will be $ 18 and he 'll turn a $ 2 profit all with the original investment of $ 9
# 8063
not sure if your question is on topic but the investment is only $ 9 because that is maximum amount of money the merchant ever needed to start up the business he put in $ 9 started turning a profit and never looked back

as a landlord for 14 years with 10 properties i can give a few pointers be able and skilled enough to perform the majority of maintenance because this is your biggest expense otherwise   it will shock you how much maintenance rental units require do n't invest in real estate where the locality state favors the tenant e.g. new york city in disputes   a great state is florida where you can have someone evicted very quickly require a minimum credit score of 620 for all tenants over 21   this seems to be the magic number that keeps most of the nightmare tenants out makes sure they have a job nearby that pays at least three times their annual rent every renewal adjust your tenant 's rent to be approximately 5 less than going rates in your area   use zillow as a guide   keeping just below market rates keeps tenants from moving to cheaper options do not rent to anyone under 30 and single   trust me trust me trust me   you ca n't legally do this officially but do it while offering another acceptable reason for rejection there 's always something you could say that 's legitimate bad credit or chose another tenant etc charge a 5 late fee starting 10 days after the rent is due   20 days late file for eviction to let the tenant know you mean business do n't sink yourself too much in debt put enough money down so that you start profitable   i made the mistake of burying myself and i have n't barely been able to breathe for the entire 14 years   it 's just now finally coming into profitability do n't get adjustable rate or balloon loans under any circumstances   fixed 30 only   you can pay it down in 20 years and get the same benefits as if you got a fixed 20 but you will want the option of paying less some months so get the 30 and treat it like a 20 do n't even try to find your own tenants   use a realtor and take the 10 cost hit   they actually save you money because they can show your place to a lot more prospective tenants and it will be rented much sooner   empty place = empty wallet   also block out the part of the realtor 's agreement to lease where it states they keep getting the 10 every year thereafter   most realtors will go along with this just to get the first year but if they do n't find another realtor buy all in the same community if you can then you can use the same vendor list the same lease agreement the same realtor the same documentation spreadsheets etc   much much easier to have everything a clone   they say do n't put all your eggs in one basket but the reality is running a bunch of properties is a lot of work and the more similar they are the more you can duplicate your work for free   that 's worth a lot more day to day than the remote chance your entire community goes up in flames

ditto bill and i upvoted his answer but let me add a bit if everyone knew exactly what the risk was for every investment then prices would be bid up or down until every stock or bond or derivative or whatever was valued at exactly risk times potential profit or more precisely integral of risk times potential profit if company a was 100 guaranteed to make $ 1 million profit this year while company b had 50 change to make a $ 2 million profit and 50 to make $ 0 and every investor in the world knew that then i 'd expect the total price of all shares of the two stocks to stabilize at the same value the catch to that though is that no one really knows the risk the risk is n't like we 're going to roll a die and if it comes up even the company makes $ 1 million and if it comes up odd the company makes $ 0 so we could calculate the exact probability the risk comes from lack of information will consumers want to buy this new product how many what are they willing to pay how capable is the new ceo etc it 's very hard to calculate probabilities on these things how can you precisely calculate the probability that unforeseen events will occur so in real life prices are the risk reward ratio should be roughly sort of approximately linear but that 's about the most one can say

i like this option rather than exposing all 600k to market risk i 'd think of paying off the mortgage as a way to diversify my portfolio expose 400k to market risk and get a guaranteed 3.75 return on that 200k in essence then you can invest the money you were putting towards your mortgage each month   the potential disadvantage is that the extra 200k investment could earn significantly more than 3.75 and you 'd lose out on some money historically the market beats 3.75 and you 'd come out ahead investing everything there 's no guarantee you also do n't have to keep your money invested you can change your position down the road and pay off the house i feel best about a paid off house but i know that my sense of security carries opportunity cost up to you to decide how much risk you 're willing to accept also if you do n't have an emergency fund i 'd set up that first and then go from there with investing paying off house

if a company is valued correctly then paying dividends should lower the share price and buying back shares should leave the share price unchanged   if the share price is $ 100 and the company pays a $ 10 dividend then either its cash goes down by $ 10 per share it is has to borrow money for the same amount or some mixture either way the value of the company has gone down by $ 10 per share   if the share price is $ 100 and the company buys back 10 percent of its shares then it also has to find the money just as for the dividend and the value of the company goes down by 10 percent however the number of shares also goes down by 10 percent so the amount of value per share is the same and the share price should stay unchanged   now there are psychological effects many people like getting paid dividends so they will want to own shares of a company paying dividends so the share price goes up similar with a share buyback the fact that someone buys huge amounts of shares drives the price up both effects are purely psychological   a buyback has another effect if the shares are not valued correctly if the company is worth $ 100 per share but for some reason the is down to $ 50 then after the buyback the value per share has even gone up basically the company buys from stupid investors which increases the value for clever investors holding on to their shares if the were $ 200 then buying back shares would be a stupid move for the company

for various reasons real estate prices exhibit far more memory than stock prices   the primary reason for this is that real estate is much less liquid   transaction costs for stock trading are on the order of 10 basis points 0.1 whereas a real estate transaction will typically have total costs including title lawyers brokers engineers etc of around 5 of the amount of the transaction   a stock transaction can be executed in milliseconds whereas real estate transactions typically take months   thus today 's behavior is a much better indicator of future price behavior for real estate than for stocks

a possibility could be real estate brokerage firms such as or although a brokerage commission is linked to the sale prices it is more directly impacted by sales volume if volume is maintained or goes up a real estate brokerage firm can actually profit rather handsomely in an up market or a down market   if sales volume does go up another option would be other service markets for real estate such as real estate information and marketing websites and sources i.e. furthermore one can go and make a broad generalization such as since real estate no longer requires the same quantity of construction material other industries sensitive to the price of those commodities should technically have a lower cost of doing business but be careful in the us much of the wealth an average american has is in their home in this case this means that the economy as a whole takes a dive due to consumer uncertainty in which case safe havens could benefit may be things like gamble gold or treasuries side note you can always short builders or someone who loses if the housing market declines this will make your investment higher as a result of the security going lower

firstly you should yourself with your options for your pension fund they changed as of 6th april 2015 so it 's all quite new the government 's guidance on it is here if you have n't already taken a tax free lump sum from your pension fund you can take up to 25 totally tax free immediately that makes getting a house for 40 k very accessible beyond the 25 you can take any of it out whenever you want access drawdown or lump sum payment depending on whether you take the 25 out up front or not that 'll be taxed as if you earned it as income so if you did n't have any other income you can take another £ without tax this tax year and then another £ or whatever the allowance goes up to next tax year and so on above that you 'd have to pay 20 tax until you reach the higher rate tax threshold at about £ 40k year you say you do have other income so you 'll have to take that into account as well when calculating what tax you 'd have to pay if you 've reached state pension age that will add some more income of course or as you suggest you can buy an annuity you can do that with some or all of the money and you can still take the 25 tax free first if you do buy an annuity the income from it will all be taxed but again your personal allowance will apply essentially an annuity is the least risky option particularly if you get one that is with inflation with inflation makes the initial income even lower but protects you against cost of living rises as you get older in exchange for avoiding that risk you probably lose out on average compared to some more risky options you might choose to get an annuity large enough to cover your basic needs and take more chances with the rest

all openly traded securities must be registered with the sec and setup with clearing agents   this is a costly process the cost to provide an electronic market for a specific security is negligible   that is why the exchange fees per electronic trade are so small per security   it is so small in fact that exchanges compensate price makers partially at the expense of price takers that exchanges partially give some portion of the overall fee to those that can help provide liquidity the cost to provide an open outcry market for a specific security are somewhat onerous but they are initiated before a security has any continual liquidity to provide a market for large trades especially for futures every individual option contract must be registered and setup for clearing aside from the cost to setup each contract expiration and strike intervals are limited by regulation   for an extremely liquid security like spy contracts could be offered for daily expiration and penny strike intervals but they are currently forbidden

there is one massive catch in this which i found out when i went to nationwide to ask for a loan i 've got a credit card which they kept increasing my credit limit it 's now at something ridiculous nearly £ 10,000 but they keep increasing it i never use that card when i went to nationwide though they said they could n't give me a loan because i had £ 10,000 credit already and if i reduced this credit this would affect my credit rating and they could potentially give me a loan i then realised what had done   i have two cards with this bank one with really low interest and the other with really high interest and a high credit limit even though the other card has a zero balance loan companies still see it as money i could potentially go and spend it does n't matter to them that i 've not spent any money on that card in about 12 months to them it 's the fact that they could give me a loan and then i could go and spend another £ 10,000 on that card as you can see extremely risky    of course this means that what are doing is giving me such a high credit knowing full well that i 'm not going to use it but it also prevents their competitors from offering me a loan even at a lower rate because i 've already got too much credit available so yes there is a catch to giving you a high credit limit on your cards and it 's to prevent you from either leaving that bank or getting a lower interest rate loan out to clear the debt

a breakdown of stock buy backs has this bottom line on it are share buybacks good or bad as is so often the case in finance the question may not have a definitive answer if a stock is undervalued and a buyback truly represents the best possible investment for a company the buyback and its effects can be viewed as a positive sign for shareholders watch out however if a company is merely using buybacks to prop up ratios provide short term relief to an ailing stock price or to get out from under excessive dilution read more what is the reason that a company like aapl is buying back its own    shares   offsetting dilution would be my main thought here as many employees may exercise options putting more stock out there that the company buys back stock to balance things does it have too much cash and it does n't know what to do with it   no as it could do dividends if it wanted to give it back to investors so it is returning the cash back to investors not quite while some investors may get cash from apple i 'd suspect most shareholders are n't likely to see cash unless they are selling their shares so i would n't say yes to this without qualification at the same time the treasury shares apple has can be used to give options to employees or be used in acquisitions for a couple of other purposes

you asked for simple and i promise you this is it just looks a bit math heavy to start with because we have to handle a couple of different scenarios bear with me i find the best way to deal with these kinds of questions is to put together a total cost for each option for a sensible amount of time and see what the difference is we 'll include the current cost for both options plus the subsequent costs for 12 months i find that more useful than a straight which is more expensive right now because it includes the potential costs of the next upgrade and any changes to the plan let 's throw some numbers together for the next 12 months if your current plan is longer than 12 months read the note at the bottom first first write down the cost of these things the above assume that you have two options if you take the repair option and only one option if you use the buy out option the two options we 're assuming here are that you can either   if you 'd choose the same new plan regardless of whether you take the $ 100 or $ 150 option there 's no need to include both options to simplify things you can just use the same numbers for both b c and pu and the calculation below will still work when you 've found and written down the above just do the sums below to find your two total costs over 12 months nothing fancy just plug the numbers above into the equation eg if pe ebay value of the phone is $ 80 replace pe with 80 do n't forget to do the parts in brackets first that 's your total cost for both options for the next year note i 'm assuming that your plan ends within the next 12 months if not just replace 12 in the above calculations with another term you can also do this if you want to find out the price difference over a longer period noting that if you upgrade to the same plan regardless of choice you 'll get the same answer for any period longer than your current contract

let me make sure i understand the point of what adam smith is going on about in discussion of relative poverty he relates the idea that an individual can be considered in poverty if they do not meet the customary amount of goods considered by their society to be the minimum to be polite in public you have thus transferred his meaning of what poor means to be what is considered   basic living you have then taken this concept and tied the cost of basic living which you still have n't actually narrowed down towards the tax rate on income for a citizen of a community this is all in the context that you 're concerned with the community level of price for basic living and whether its too high however you also have n't said what too high is nor why you 're concerned with the literal price which is why i 've said you can only control the price of a good through central authority   i never made the assertion you wanted to invoke a centrally planned economy i simply stated that the only way to control prices across a community is through central authority you 've stated that we collect taxes on local state and federal levels this is true however it does not mean that they control the price they simply modify the price set by the market and only serve to increase the price from the base set by market participants    when i want to buy beer i do n't just pay for the cost of the beer i pay the cost of the beer + the city tax + county tax + state tax + state sales tax on the beer which raises the price also these taxes are not income taxes which is what was being discussed    i still do n't know what your point is because you can not seem to define phrases you 've used that i have stated i do not know if you can not define what you 're talking about how it relates to the actual discussion and why its relevant then please stop as its simply a

i suppose it depends on how liquid you need and if you 're willing to put forth any risk whatsoever   the stock market can be dangerous but there are strategies out there that will allow you to insure yourself against significant loss while likely earning you a decent return   you can buy and sell options along with stocks so that if the stock drops your loss is limited and if it goes up or even stays where it 's at you make money a lot more than 1 annually of course there 's risk of loss but if you plan ahead you can cap that risk wherever you want maybe 5 maybe 10 whatever suits your needs   and as far as liquidity goes it should be no more than a week or so to close your positions and get your money if you really need it but even so i would only recommend this after putting aside at least a few thousand in a cash account for emergencies

usually points have different value depending on what you use it for and how much of them you convert for many providers if you have enough 10000 + usually points it is possible to convert them 1:1 which means 1 point converted to 1 cent to either cash or something that is almost as good as cash $ 100 gift card for some popular store or $ 100 amazon.com certificate etc some cards have more exotic ways of getting best value such as transferring money to pay student loans retirement accounts etc so to get the best value i 'd recommend to make a list of what you can get from your program most types of reward are uniform i.e. many gift cards with the same price so the work may be less than it seems and calculate point values of each of those if you want to be really precise take into account that if you buy something with points you do not earn points on that which reduces the value a little in general these days it is very rare to get a card that produces more than 1 back though some have up to 5 for certain categories of purchases

you are suggesting something called dollar cost averaging or its cousin dollar value averaging   this is certainly a valid investment strategy although personally i feel that for long term investment it is not necessary unless you plan on being an active trader i still strongly encourage you to research these two methods and see if they would work well for your personal investment strategy and goals as far as what sorts of investments for a taxable account i have three general recommendations as far as which company to use for your brokerage i personally have accounts at price and fidelity i would strongly recommend fidelity out of those three mostly due to customer service and quality and ease of use of their website vanguard is a great brokerage but you do n't have to choose them just because you plan to mostly invest in vanguard funds i also recommend you research how capital gains and dividend taxing works and things like lost harvesting so that you can structure your investments with taxes in mind do this ahead of time do n't wait until april of 2016 because it will be too late to save on taxes by then

one big factor that no one has mentioned yet is whether you believe in a deflationary or inflationary future right now we are leaning towards a deflationary environment so it makes sense to pay off more of the debt if you make just one extra payment a year you will have paid off your house 7 years early however should this change depending on government and central bank policy you may be better off putting down the very minimum   in a year or three from now you should have a clearer picture in the meanwhile here is a recent business week article discussing both sides of the argument

question is what do we need to do as far as the irs is concerned i    mean we 'll get the money from them and pay it back less than two    months later you 're probably worried about the gift tax since you 're a couple the maximum exclusion amount is calculated like this the reason the pg multiplier stands separate is that gift splitting does require form 709 filed even if no tax is due unless they actually write separate checks for their respective portions so the math shows that you and your wife can get at least $ 28 k from anyone without the need of gift tax to be paid or gift tax return to be filed you can get up to $ 56 k from your parents but the gift splitting may need to be documented on form 709 since you 're in fact talking about a loan you 're going to repay you 'll need to document it with a note and everything and document the repayment if interest is being paid your parents must declare it on their tax return for the year obviously in this case if the loan is properly documented repaid and the interest is declared the irs wo n't even bother claiming it was a gift even if there 's no real interest it should n't be an issue the irs might assign some deemed interest at their rates that would be considered a gift but assuming no other gift transactions between you exist for the year the amount would be miniscule and way below the $ 14 k exclusion level of course as with any tax concern you get here what you paid for for a proper advice talk to a tax adviser ea cpa licensed in your state

if i had to guess i think chipotle 's queso is the way it is because chipotle is trying to maintain their wholesome quality ingredients approach to queso   but that 's the problem naturally made cheeses do n't melt into if anyone has worked in the pizza business for any period of time then they might know at least one thing about cheese melted cheese has a very high oil content   mix your cheese with a shit load of oil and it can melt beautifully want your cheese to stay in a liquid state at a lower temperature add more oil   so if you want to maintain wholesome arguably healthy ingredients and make queso at the same time then you 've got a problem because it 's damn hard to make liquid cheese without having it be the worst thing imaginable for your health   after trying chipotle 's queso last week i guessed that they were trying to make a not so miserable for your health version of queso so they made a queso without all of the added oil   but that 's the problem oil is fucking delicious pretty much anything that is high in fats like oil or sugars tastes amazing the higher the fat and/or sugar content the better it tastes but also the worse it is for your health generally   so chipotle has a queso that is n't for your health but it also tastes like it   i applaud chipotle 's willingness to experiment with new products and try new things but i 'm projecting that this queso wo n't have mass appeal because it does n't taste great a group of us bought a cup of it and we did n't finish it   sorry chipotle i like the effort but if i want chips amp queso my ass is across the street to to get some of that terrible for my health zero nutritional value yellow oil cheese product

as far as i know it 's not barred by the primary anti discrimination statute title vii of the civil rights act of 1964   there are some state and local protections against being fired or discriminated against based on this but the long and short of it is that it 's pretty few and far between   if the ceo in question fired people who were all affiliated with the democratic party and did n't fire people who were n't affiliated with said party those who were terminated may have a case at that point   this is from a linkedin answers law legal employment labor law   gt for private situations there is also a federal statute 42 usc that prohibits to deprive persons of equal rights and privileges that has been raised in various contexts the statute which is a era law is broadly drafted to correct some of the abuses that arose after the civil war for blacks trying to exercise their rights however it addresses any person or class of persons of the equal protection of the laws which could include party affiliation or a particular political viewpoint the class must be one that is sufficiently defined so it is more likely to apply to party affiliation such as democrat rather than an amorphous group such as liberal there are a number of nuances to this statute so if you have a belief that it may apply to your situation seek competent legal advice

the advice is always to not get a big refund from the irs because that is giving them an interest free loan you actually have an opportunity to get an interest free loan from them   when you file your taxes for 2013 note how much you paid in taxes not the check you had to send in with your tax form or the refund you received but the total amount in taxes you paid multiply that amount by 1.1 or 110 for example $ 8,000 1.10 = $ when you get your paychecks in 2014 you goal is to make sure that your federal taxes not state social security or medicare taken from your paycheck will get you over that number $ or a paycheck keep in mind that the later you start the more each check needs to be you will owe them a big check in april 2015 but because of the 110 rule you will not owe interest penalties or have to deal with quarterly taxes the 110 rule you from these if you end them 110 as much a you paid in taxes the previous year note that no matter how you pay your taxes for 2014 big check now extra per paycheck or minimum now you will have to watch your withholding during 2015 because the 110 rule wo n't protect you

there 's no free lunch here are some positions that should be economically equivalent same risk and reward in a theoretically pure universe with no regulations or transaction costs you 're proposing to buy the call if you look at the equivalent stock plus protective put you can quickly see the catch the protective put is expensive that same expense is embedded in the call option see put call parity on wikipedia for more you could easily pay 10 a year or more for the protection which could easily eat up most of your returns if you consider that average returns on a stock index might be about 10 nominal not real another way to look at it is that buying the long call and selling a put which is a synthetic long position in the stock would give you the put premium so by not selling the put you should be worse off than owning the stock worse than the synthetic long by about the value of the put premium or yet another way to look at it is that you 're repeatedly paying time value on the long call option as you roll it in practical world instead of theory world i think you 'd probably get a noticeable hit to returns just from bid ask and commissions even without the cost of the protection options cost more a bit some practical complications of equivalency between different combinations of options and underlying are anyway roughly speaking any position without the downside risk is going to have an annual loss built in due to the cost of the protection occasionally the options market can do something weird due to supply demand or liquidity issues but mostly the parity relationships hold or hold closely enough that you ca n't profit once expenses are considered update one note i 'm talking about vanilla options as traded in the us here i guess there are some somewhat different products elsewhere i 'm not sure exactly which derivatives you mean all derivatives have a cost though or nobody would take the other side of the trade

is it true that due the to the increase in interest rates that inflation is likely to increase as well it is typically the reverse where inflation causes interest rates to rise interest rates fundamentally reflect the desire for people to purchase future goods over present day goods   if i loan money to someone for 5 years i lose the ability to use that money   in order to entice me to loan the money the borrower would have to offer me an incentive that is they would have to give me additional money at the end of that 5 years   this additional money is the interest rate and it reflects the desire of people to spend money in the future versus the present day   if offered the same amount of money today versus 5 years from now almost everyone would chose to take the money now   money in the present is more valuable than the same amount of money in the future interest rates would still exist even with a currency that could not be printed i would still prefer to have the currency today than in the future if the currency is continually devalued i.e. the issuer is printing more of the currency than borrowers may charge additional interest to compensate for the loss in purchasing power when they make a loan also it is hard to compare interest rates and inflation   inflation is very difficult to calculate new products and services as well as ever changing consumer desires continually change the mixture of goods in the market so it is nearly impossible to compare a basket of goods today to a basket of goods 5 10 20 or 30 years ago

technically you owe self employment taxes not fica taxes because they are imposed under a different law however since se taxes are by design exactly the same rates as combining the two halves of fica employer and employee it is quite reasonable to treat them as equivalent se taxes and income tax also are based on your net self employment income after deducting business expenses but not non business items like your home mortgage dependent exemptions etc which factor only into income tax you owe se medicare tax 2.9 on all your se net income unless it is under $ 400 adjusted down by 7.65 to compensate for the fact that the employer half of fica is excluded from gross income before the employee half is computed you owe se social security tax 12.4 on your adjusted se net income unless and until the total income subject to i.e. your w-2 wages plus your adjusted se net income exceeds a cap that varies with inflation and is $ for 2017 otoh if income exceeds $ 200k single or $ 250k joint you owe additional medicare tax 0.9 on the excess if your w-2 income alone exceeds this limit your employer should withhold for it however the additional medicare tax is part of obamacare ppaca which the new president and republican have said they will repeal and replace whether any such replacement will affect this for ty 2017 is at best uncertain at this point yes se taxes are added to income tax on your 1040 with schedule se attached and schedule c e f as applicable to your business virtually so if you file electronically and paid together you are supposed to pay at least 90 during the year by having withholding increased on your w-2 job or by making quarterly estimated payments irs quarters are not exactly quarters but close or any combination but if this is your first year which you do n't say but someone who had gone through this before probably would n't ask you may get away with not paying during the year as normally required specifically if your w-2 withholding is not enough to cover your increased taxes for this year because of the additional income and se taxes but it is enough to cover your tax for the previous year and your agi that year was n't over $ 150k then there is a safe harbor and you wo n't owe any penalty although you must keep enough money on hand to pay the tax by april 15 but for your second year and onwards your previous year now includes se amounts and this does n't help similar related

you are comparing a risk free cost with a risky return if you can tolerate that level of risk the ups and downs of the investment for the chance that you 'll come out ahead in the long run then sure you could do that    so the parameters to your equation would be if you assume that the risky returns are normally distributed then you can use normal probability tables to determine what risk level you can tolerate to put some real numbers to it take the average s&p 500 return of 10 and standard deviation of 18   using standard normal functions we can calculate the probability that you earn more than various interest rates so even with a low 3 interest rate there 's roughly a 1 in 3 chance that you 'll actually be worse off the gains on your investments will be less than the interest you pay   in any case there 's a 3 in 10 chance that your investments will lose money

earnings per share is the company profit or loss divided by the number of outstanding shares the number should always be compared to the share price so for instance if the eps is $ 1 and the share price is $ 10 the eps is 10 of the share price this means that if the company keeps up this earning you should expect to make 10 yearly on your investment long term the stock price may fluctuate but if the company keeps on making money you will eventually do so too as investor if the eps is low it means that the market expects the earnings to rise in the future either because the company has a low profit margin that can be vastly improved or because the business is expected to grow especially the last case may be a risky investment as you will lose money if the company does n't grow fast enough even if it does make a healthy profit note that the listed eps like most key figures is based on the last financial statement recent developments could mean that better or worse is generally expected also note that the earnings of some companies will fluctuate wildly for instance companies that produce movies or video games will tend to have a huge income for a quarter or two following a new release but may be in the negative in some periods this is fine as long as they turn a profit long term but you will have to look at data for a longer period in order to determine this

gt why should i have to pay someone more to do a shittier job just because they 're in a members only club   uh you might not have to pay more since many employers can just take a modest hit to their profit margin to treat their workers better than cattle and given the amounts they 're paying their workers to begin with i doubt your wallet will scream in pain if prices inch up a tiny bit to pay these so they may live lives of regular poverty instead of grinding poverty getting beyond the liquid bullshit your sentence has been in i 'll assume you 're merely asking why you should have to pay someone more to do the same job   essentially the answer lies in the power employers usually have to to lower wages because there are always fewer usually far fewer employers in any industry than there are employees so the employers are always in an exclusive members only club the examples of employers combining to lower wages and salaries are so numerous that it 's an embarrassment of riches as to which to choose but i 'll pick the refusal of major league baseball to sign free agents in 1979 just to teach the players a lesson this ended rod 's career among other things even though the owners were later punished in court so it does not please me   in some industries unions are unnecessary medicine and law come to mind but these workers still have wage hiking and incompetence protecting mechanisms consider the ama 's efforts to close teaching hospitals and limit doctor supply or the seeming inability of state bar associations to investigate anything less than the incompetence of their members it 's just that the ama and the bar association are not called unions   but back to the issue of walmart unionization unions though prone to excess when they are too strong have been the only means of leveling the playing field between ownership and employees in ways that have made life livable for all of us today want an example the 40-hour week which would never have become customary let alone been given legal force if it were up to the employers and the free market fairy with her magical market dust today employees in industries never unionized enjoy the benefits of overtime pay decent working conditions saturdays off and healthcare such as it is thanks to union representatives who were beaten by thugs and then returned to be beaten so many times that the bosses finally gave in and made america a decent place to live for those who were labor and not just capital   it has been proven over and over again throughout history that given the chance the wealthy will treat the rest of us like s h i t unless we occasionally fight back collectively if labor becomes cheaper under the free market employers will eventually attempt to pay workers only enough to reproduce unless there are so many workers already that this is unnecessary and nothing more knowing what societies are like when this occurs think 19th century industrial europe or modern venezuela i 'm not eager to live in such a society   when workers are treated like dirt you usually end up paying more anyway in home security systems public safety costs and salaries for corpse removal crews to keep the city streets clean   tldr fuck you you ignorant fuck

generally if you watch for the detail in the fine print and stay away from non fdic insured investments there is little difference so yes pick the highest you can get the offered interest rate is influenced by what the banks are trying to accomplish and how their current and desired customer base thinks some banks have customer bases with very conservative behavior which will stick with them because they trust them no matter what so a low interest rate is good enough the disadvantage for the bank is that such customers prefer brick and mortar contact which is expensive for the bank or maybe the bank has already more cash than they need and has no good way to invest it other banks might need more cash flow to be able to get stronger in the mortgage market and their way of getting that is to offer higher interest rates so new customers come and invest new money which the bank in turn can then mortgage out they also may offer higher rates for online handling only overall there are many different ways to make money as a bank and they diversify into different niches with other focuses and that comes with offering quite different interest rates

you are probably going to hate my answer but if there was an easy way to id stocks like fb that were going to do what fb did then those stocks would n't exist and do that because they would be priced higher at the ipo the fact is there is always some doubt no one knows the future and sometimes value only becomes clear with time everyone wants to buy a stock before it rises right it will only be worth a rise if it makes more profit though and once it is established as making more profit the price will be already up because why would n't it be that means to buy a real winner you have to buy before it is completely obvious to everyone that it is going to make more profit in the future and that means stock prices trade at speculative prices based on expected future performance not current or past performance now i 'm not saying past and future performance has nothing in common but there is a reason that a thousand financially oriented websites quote a disclaimer like past performance is not necessarily a guide to future performance now maybe this is sort of obvious but looking at your image excluding things like market capital that you 've not restricted the pe ratio is based on current price and past earnings the dividend yield is based on past publications of what the dividend will be and current price the price to book is based on past publication of the company balance sheet and current price the eps is based on past earnings and the published number of shares and the roi and net profit margin in based on published past profits and earnings and costs and number of shares so it must be understood that every criteria chosen is past data that analysts have been looking at for a lot longer than you have with a lot more additional information and experience with it the only information that is even current is the price thus my ultimate conclusive point is you ca n't based your stock picks on criteria like this because it 's based on past information and current stock price and the current stock price is based on the markets opinion of relative future performance the only way to make a good stock pick is understand the business understand its market and possibly understand world economics as it pertains to that market and business you can use various criteria as an initial filter to find companies and investigate them but which criteria you use is entirely your preference you might invest only in profitable companies ones that make money and probably pay regular dividends thus excluding something like an oil exploration company which will just lose money and lose it and lose some more forever unless it hits the jackpot in which case you might suddenly find yourself sitting on a huge profit it 's a question of risk and preference regarding your concern for false data google defines the return on investment ttm as trailing twelve month income after taxes divided by the average total long term debt + long term liabilities + shareholders equity expressed as a percentage if you really think they have it wrong you could contact them but it 's probably correct for whatever past data or last annual financial results it 's based on

you 'd be mistaken to this there is any morality involved in most corporations neither positive nor negative running a business is amoral some business missions have a moral intent such as pharmaceuticals health organization etc but all have an amoral   it 's fairly simplistic the purpose of a business is to produce a profit at some point all successful well functioning businesses will work down their list of ways to produce a profit after they 've established market share a lasting brand customer loyalty finances well in the black and eventually look towards capital preservation in most bodies with a large monetary wealth capital preservation becomes a key focus in other words once you master the art of making money you then need to master the art of keeping it   thus the ability to then focus on these things to continue to just pay taxes is like running an efficient but leaky ship the more you preserve the longer you 'll be around and the more power you 'll yield to stick around    this last point is also important to keep in mind unlike you or i a company will basically last forever well at least until society collapses you or i are only here until we die and whatever wealth we have we may try to preserve for our kids or next of kin a corporation is always here the people in the corporation amp it 's owners change hands but the corporation survives frankly any business that is n't aiming to make a profit is either going to fail quickly or is by definition a non profit   here is where i would believe the government plays a balancing role to reign in the power of corporations lest they rival their own but any good corporation will handle that problem as well regulatory capture anyone   also consider that for the most wealthy among us it 's probably not about the money anymore it 's now probably about the game this is certainly where the get that manic edge on the rest of us

i separate them out simply because they 're for different purposes with different goals and time frames and combining them may mask hidden problems in either the retirement account or the regular account consider an example a young investor has been working on their retirement planning for a few years now and has a modest amount of retirement savings say $ 15,000 allocated carefully according to one of the usually recommended schemes a majority exposure to large cap u.s. stocks with smaller exposures to small cap international and bond markets years before however they mad an essentially emotional investment in a struggling manufacturer of niche personal computers which then enjoyed something of a renaissance and a staggering growth in shareholder value lets say their current holdings in this company now represent $ 50,000 combining them their portfolio is dominated by large cap u.s. equities to such an extent that the only way to rebalance their portfolio is to pour money into bonds and the international market for years on end this utterly changes the risk profile of their retirement account at the same time if we switch the account balances the investor might be that their asset allocation is fine and diversified even though the assets they have access to before retirement are entirely in a single risky stock in neither case is the investor well served by combining their funds when figuring out their allocation especially as the goal allocations may very well be different

our mortgage has been sold to a secondary market player there are multiple ways in which the deal is struck at times the risk of default is with original fi with recourse at times it is with secondary fi without recourse the rate can be discounted so the original fi collects the emi as per 3.75 and pays to the secondary fi at 3.25 or it can also be one time fixed amount how could this possibly be financially beneficial for the original loan holder as indicated there are multiple ways the original fi makes money either one time or over the period depending on how the deal is struck are they truly making enough money from the mortgage fees and first payment 's interest to to warrant their need to clear up their credit line for new mortgages    are mortgages always sold for less than the remaining principal no broadly speaking the mortgage fees cover the cost for initiating the loan there may be a very small amount banks may make this is incidental the actual money is made in the interest that is collected every month if a bank as say 5 loans for 100 k each it is very reputed brand and 10 people need 100 k loans then it makes sense for the first fi to give loan to 5 people for 100 k each and sell this at profit to secondary fi take the 100 k 5 and give it off to new 5 people effectively making more money on the original 500 k the bank had

this is actually a very good point any money that is spent on an employee in excess of the bare minimum required for them to perform their job should be viewed as a component of total rewards you can directly extend op 's logic to any other form of compensation or benefits why let public employees take pto except for when mandated by federal or state law why not target the 10th percentile of the market for all federal jobs why provide employees with retirement benefits the answer to all of the above is that all elements of a total rewards package are necessary to attract retain and develop good employees       i 've done consulting in the sphere of organizational structure design and development i 've seen the type of employees that a bare bones total rewards philosophy attracts and i 'm not sure that i want them working for the public

ultimately the bank will have first call on the house and you will be the only one on the hook directly to the bank if you do n't make the mortgage payments there 's nothing you can do to avoid that if you ca n't get a joint mortgage what you could do is make a side agreement that your girlfriend would be entitled to half the equity in the house and would be required to make half the payments via you you could perhaps also add that she would be part responsible for helping you clear any arrears but in the end it 'd just be a deal between you and her she would n't have any direct rights over the house and she would n't be at risk of the bank pursuing her if you do n't pay the mortgage you 'd probably also need legal advice to make it but you could also not worry about that too much and just write it all down as formally as possible it really depends if you 're just trying to improve your feelings about the process or whether you really want something that you could both rely on in the event of a later split i do n't think getting married would make any make any real difference day to day in law with rare exceptions the finances of spouses are independent from each other however in the longer term being married would mean your now wife would have a stronger legal claim on half the equity in the house in the event of you splitting up

generally to be able to write off worthless securities you need to show that they 're indeed worthless it 's not necessarily easy as you need to prove that there 's no way they will regain any value in the future what is usually done instead is very simple you sell them many brokers are aware of this problem and will assist by buying these securities from you at a nominal price e*trade for example for $ 0.01 scottrade for $ 0.00 and providing a proper trade confirmation this is a bona fide sale so if the stock does regain value it will be a profit for the broker in this case you just report it as a sale at loss check with your broker if they support such a solution

4000 miles a year is not a few european average is about 9000 but nevertheless but when it comes to risk then 1 nothing stops you from changing circumstances and drive 10 times as much as in previous the insurance remains the same the only thing the insurance company can do is to charge you more next year taking the miles you 've made this year as a basis for calculations 2 drivers who drive very seldom are a huge risk because of their low experience i know a few people that drive more than 100 miles only a few times a year and on average once a year have accident during that drives it does n't mean that an average sunday driver have similar risk of accident as daily driver but it 's in no way similar   germany switzerland based the whole eu is likely to be the same

how do i determine what to pay the person you pay them either what you believe the work is worth to have done for you vs doing it yourself or how much they ask for after negotiation there 's no rule of thumb because it 's driven by the market   there will always be people who are willing and able to do the work for less than you but ca n't always get work which is the reason they are charging less just as there will always be people who charge much more than you and have to turn work away you are at a comfortable medium where you have enough work to charge a moderate rate and can amplify your reputation network client by the work out as an example if i charge $ to do engineering work but i want to subcontract it out then i have to take into account that so let 's say i have a contract for 20 hours of work at $ $ 2,400 and i figure that i can subcontract out all of it   however it 's going to cost me about 4 hours of work to review their 20 hours of work deal with administrative overhead interpret and pass along requirements etc so if i work 4 hours then the maximum i can pay the contractor for 20 hours of work is the remaining 16 hours x $ 120 the contractor would be doing 20 hours for $ to break even on cash and i only make worth of profit for 4 hours worth of work   that 's actually a net loss unless you can already fill those other 16 hours with paying work i do n't think that would be worth it but if the contractor only required $ then you 're paying him $ 1,200 for 20 hours of work and you get to keep $ 1,200 for only 4 hours of your time   the subcontractor has turned your $ rate into $ now you still only net $ 1,200 rather than the full $ 2,400 so your revenue is down but if you can find work for that other 16 hours at your normal rate then you 're still ahead   alternately you might find that working only 12 hours a week is a fine way to live and choose to forgo that revenue for personal time the costs and break even point vary greatly from situation to situation but hopefully this gives you a framework to evaluate the decision for yourself

whoa these things are on two dimensions   it 's like burger and fries you can also have chicken sandwich and fries or burger and onion rings    you can invest in an taxable brokerage account and/or an ira   and then within each of those   you can buy index funds and/or anything else all 4 combinations are possible   if someone says otherwise take your money and run   they are a shady financial advisor who is ripping you off by steering you only into products where they get a commission those products are more expensive because the commission comes out of your end   not to mention any names       if you want financial advice that is honest find a financial advisor who you pay for his advice and who does n't sell products at all   or just ask here   but i would start by listening to suze orman dave ramsey whomever you prefer   and read john bogle 's book    they can tell you all about the difference between money market bonds stocks managed mutual funds ripoff and index funds ira accounts roth ira accounts and taxable accounts are all brokerage accounts   within them you can buy any security you want including index funds   the difference is taxation   suppose you earn $ 1000 and choose to invest it however   later you withdraw it and it has grown to $ 3000   investing in a taxable account you pay normal income tax on the $ 1000 when you later withdraw the $ 3000 you pay a tax on $ 2000 of income   if you invested more than a year it is taxed at a much lower capital gains tax rate   with a traditional ira account you pay zero taxes on the initial $ 1000   later when you take the money out you pay normal income tax on the full $ 3000   if you withdrew it before age 59 1/2 you also pay a 10 penalty $ 300   with a roth ira account you pay normal income tax on the $ 1000   when you withdraw the $ 3000 later you pay nothing in taxes   provided you followed the rules    you can invest in almost anything inside these accounts money market funds terrible return   you wo n't keep up with the market   bonds   low return but usually quite safe   individual stocks   good luck    managed mutual funds   you 're paying some genius stock picker to select high performing stocks he has a huge staff of researchers and   good social connections   he also charges you 1.5 per year overhead as an expense ratio which is a total loss to you   the fact is he can usually pick stocks better than a monkey throwing darts   but he 's not 1.5 better   index funds   these just shrug and buy every stock on the market   there 's no huge staff or genius manager just some intern making small adjustments every week   as such the expense ratio is extremely small like 0.1     if any of these investments pay dividends you must pay taxes on them when they 're issued if you 're not in an ira account   this problem gets fixed in etf 's   index etf 's   these are index funds packaged to behave like stocks   dividends increase your stock 's value instead of being paid out to you which simplifies your taxes   if you buy index funds outside of an ira use these   too many other options to get into here

i can see the point of it but you also have to remember what kind of people are working here to begin with they are often people with a high school education or equivalent with no additional training or education that does n't leave a lot of jobs open and pretty much regardless of where they work the market wage is going to be low because they are extremely interchangeable that is to say this is the working poor the people that the government targets quite a bit so they 'll have a negative external impact on the rest of the economy as a whole    so while it does cost you money per year really the more important question is if these people were employed elsewhere or not employed what would the cost be and if there is any difference to where the government is paying more then they should be taxed by that amount to pay for the externality

brendan the short answer is no there is no need to get into any other funds for all intents and purposes the s&p 500 is the stock market the news media may quote the dow when the market reaches new highs or crashes but all of the dow 30 stocks are included in the s&p 500   the s&p is also weighted which means that it owns in higher proportion the big blue chip stocks more than the smaller less known companies to explain the top 10 holdings in the s&p represent 18 of the total index while the bottom 10 only represent 0.17 less than 1 percent they do have an equal weighted s&p in which all 500 companies represent only of the index and that is technically even more diversified but in actuality it makes it more volatile because it has a higher concentration of those smaller less known companies so it will tend to perform better during up markets and worse during down markets as far as diversification into different asset classes or other countries that 's non sense the s&p 500 has companies in it that give you that exposure for example it includes companies that directly benefit from rising oil prices rising gold prices etc known as the energy and materials sector it also includes companies that own malls apartment complexes etc known as the real estate sector and as far as other countries most of the companies in the s&p are multi national companies meaning that they do business over seas in many parts of the world apple and facebook for example sell their products in many different countries so you do n't need to invest any of your money into an emerging market fund or an asia fund because most of our companies are already doing business in those parts of the world likewise you do n't need to specifically invest into a real estate or gold fund   as far as bonds go if you 're in your twenties you have no need for them either why because the s&p 500 also pays you dividends and these dividends grow over time so for example if microsoft increases its dividend payment by 100 over a ten year period all of the shares you buy today at a 2.5 yield will in 10 years have a higher 5 yield a bond on the other hand will never increase its yield over time if it pays out 4 that 's all it will ever pay you want to invest because you want to grow your money and if you want to invest passively the fastest way to do that is through index etfs like the $ spy $ ivv and $ rsp also look into the $ xiv it 's an inverse vix etf it moves 5x faster than the s&p in the same direction if you want to actively trade your money you can grow it even faster by getting into things like options highly volatile penny stocks shorting stocks and futures do n't get involved in fx or currency trading unless it through futures

first paragraph is very true but you also have to take into consideration that the adviser and the company are 2 different things to look into for the adviser quickest and easiest way is to do a facebook search the point of this is to see how transparent they are with their personal life even companies are now relying on facebook to see how they really are i would n't care if the person has lots of photos with booze and girls but i would be concerned if they are using fb for spamming purposes have pictures with drugs or hints that they do n't like their job and want to move on to something else   second paragraph is spot on as well but i would rather want to know if the company cold calls or not which leads in to your last statement   for one adviser more than 100 clients is a red flag this could mean that they push savings plans left and right they do n't contact their current clients and/or they may not have the ability to assist clients should they get many queries   a few good questions to ask   1 how do you make your salary   2 besides this plan you are selling me what other types of products do you work with and show me several examples   3 how many other advisers are in your firm   4 how many clients does your colleagues and boss have   5 how often do you cold call   6 who else cold calls in your office   7 how does your company get new clients other than referrals    go style and ask the above questions several times using different phrases

based on your question i am going to assume your criterion are based on these i believe you 'd be interested in a different savings account a cd or money market account savings account can get you up to 1.3 and money market accounts can get up to 1.5   cds can get you a little more but they 're a little trickier for example a 5 year cd could get up to 2 however now you 're money is locked away for the next few years so this is not a good option if this money is your emergency fund or you want to use it soon also if interest rates increase then your money market and savings accounts interest rates will increase but your cd 's interest rate misses out conversely if interest rates drop you 're still locked into a higher rate

comparing index funds to long term investments in individual companies a counterintuitive study by jeremy siegel addressed a similar question would you be better off sticking with the original 500 stocks in the s&p 500 or like an index fund changing your investments as the index is changed the study long term returns on the original s&p 500 companies siegel found that the original 500 including spinoffs mergers etc would do slightly better than a changing index this is likely because the original 500 companies take on a value rather than growth aspect as the decades pass and value stocks outperform growth stocks index funds main strength may be in the behavior change they induce in some investors to the extent that investors genuinely set and forget their index fund investments they far outperform the average investor who mis times the market the average investor enters and leaves the market at the worst times underperforming by a few percentage points each year on average this buying high and selling low timing behavior damages long term returns paying active management fees e.g. 1 per year makes returns worse returns compound on themselves a great benefit to the investor fees also compound to the benefit of someone other than the investor paying 1 annually to a financial advisor may further dent long term returns but robert shiller notes that advisors can dissuade investors from market timing for clients who will always follow advice the 1 advisory fee is worth it

while it 's definitely possible and likely that a diversified portfolio generates higher returns than the s&p 500 that 's not the main reason why you diversify diversification reduces risk   modern portfolio theory suggests that you should maximize return while reducing risk instead of blindly chasing the highest returns think about it this way say the average return is 11 for large cap us stocks the s&p 500 and it 's 10 for a diversified portfolio say 6 8 asset classes the large cap only portfolio has a 10 chance of losing 30 in a given year while the diversified portfolio has a 1 chance of losing 30 in a year for the vast majority of investors it 's worth the 1 annual gap in expected return to greatly reduce their risk exposure of course i just made those numbers up read what finance professors have written for the data and proof but modern portfolio theory is believed by a lot of investors and other finance experts there are a ton of studies and therefore data on mpt including many that contradict it

for personal investing and highly risky securities wasting assets which is exactly what options are it is better to think in terms of sunk costs do n't chase this trade trying to make your money back you should minimize your loss unwind the position now while there is still some remaining value in those call options and take a short term loss or you could try this   let 's say you own an exchange traded call option on a listed stock very general case i do n't know how much time remains before the option 's expiration date be that as it may i could suggest this to effect a recovery   you 'll be long the call and short the stock this is called a delta hedge as you would be delta trading the stock delta refers to short term price volatility   in other words you 'll short a single large block of the stock then buy shares in small increments whenever the market drops slightly on an intra day basis when the market price of the stock rises incrementally you 'll sell a few shares back and forth in response to short term market price moves while maintaining a static hedge ratio as your original call option gets closer to maturity roll it over into the next available contract either one month or preferably three month time to expiration if you do n't want to or ca n't borrow the underlying stock to short you could do a synthetic short a synthetic short is a combination of a long put and a short call whose pay off replicates the short stock payoff   i personally would never purchase an unhedged option or warrant but since that is what you own right now you have two choices get out or dig in deeper with the realization that you are doing a lot of work just to trade your way back to a net zero   while you can make a profit using this sort of strategy i 'm not certain if that is within the scope of the website

sure thing   treasuries bonds bills are what the us gov uses to borrow however it 's slightly different than taking out a loan it 's basically an agreement to give repay a set sum of money at a certain time in the future in exchange for a sum of funding that 's determined by market forces supply amp demand the difference between today 's price and the payment in the future is the interest    for example completely made up numbers   today is the government issues a bond that say it will pay who ever owns this bond $ 105 on the market decides that $ 105 from the us government paid a year from now is worth $ 100 today    in other words the us government is borrowing for one year at a rate of 5        105 100 100 = .05 = 5   now consider saudi arabia 's petroleum company aramco   because petroleum is traded in dollars when aramco makes a sale its paid in usd some of that is going to be reinvested into the company some paid out in dividends to share holders but inevitably some of that will be saved someplace where it can make interest because treasuries are traded issued in dollars and because aramco 's businesses deals primarily in dollars treasuries are the natural place to store that savings especially because the market considers them extremely safe    if they exchange the usd into the saudi currency to store the money in saudi assets aramco is subject to   exchange rate if the depreciates relative to the dollar aramco will lose wealth on the exchange back to dollars when they go to move those funds back into their business it 's in their interest to deal with assets denominated in usd i.e. t bonds in order to avoid this   so now because the saudis want t bonds as well the additional demand pushes the market price of our bond from $ 100 to $ 102 and the effective one year borrowing rate for the government goes from 5 to 2.9       105 = = 2.9   and there you have it cheaper borrowing it 's also worth noting how this encourages business around the world to deal in dollars which are directly controlled by the federal reserve this makes the us 's position extremely powerful

whether you contribute to an ira traditional or roth and whether you contribute to a 401k traditional or roth are independent iras have one contribution limit and 401ks have another contribution limits and these limits are independent i see no reason why you would n't maximize the amount of money in tax advantaged accounts if you can afford to in your first year of work especially if you only work for part of the year you 're likely in a lower tax bracket than in the future so roth is better than traditional another thing to note is that the money in the roth ira can be part of your safety net contributions to a roth ira but not earnings can be withdrawn at any time without tax or penalty so if there is an emergency you can withdraw it and it would n't be any worse than in a taxable account and if you do n't need it then it will enjoy the tax benefits of being in the ira

insurance is for events that are both and unexpected and for many people catastrophic events are for example sickness disability death car accidents house fires and for which you may buy health disability life auto home and renter 's insurance   it may be catastrophic for a family relying on a very old earner for that earner to die and you can buy life insurance up to a very old age but the premiums will reflect the likelihood of someone of that age dying within the covered period   the more expected an event is the more anything referred to as insurance is actually forced savings health insurance with no copays on regular checkups expects the insured to use them so the cost of those checkups plus a profit for the insurance company is factored into the premiums ahead of time   a wooden pencil breaking may be unexpected regardless of no one buys insurance on wooden as the loss of a pencil is not catastrophic what is catastrophic can be context dependent health care needs are typically as you do n't know when you 'll get sick for a billionaire needing health care while the situation would not be catastrophic and the billionaire can easily self insure his or her health to the same extent as most caps offered by health insurance companies if you 're on a fixed budget buying a laptop if it unexpectedly failed that would be catastrophic to you so budgeting in the cost of insurance or an extended warranty while buying your laptop would probably make sense especially if you need that $ 2000 laptop spending an extra 17.5 would safeguard against you having to come out of pocket and depleting your savings to replace it even though that brings you to a grand total of $ before taxes however if you 're in that tight of a situation i would strongly recommend you to find a less expensive option that would allow you to self insure if you found a used laptop for much less i can even see apple selling macs for less than $ 1000 you might decide that your budget allows you to self insure and you could profit from being careful with your hardware and resolving to cover any issues with it yourself

j approaching the answer from the w4 perspective for calculation purposes may be more trouble that it 's worth i 'd strongly suggest you use tax software whether it 's the 2016 sw or a current year one on line to get an estimate of your total tax bill for the year you can then look at your current run rate of tax paid in to see if you are on track if you have a large shortfall you can easily adjust your withholdings if you are on track to get a large refund make the adjustment so next year will track better note a withholding allowance is equal to a personal exemption some think that 4 means 4 people in the house but it actually means do n't tax 4 x $ 4050 as i have $ in combined people or tax deductions

from your question it seems your problem is that you have a company that wants to make a deal but does not currently have enough money to go through with it therefore it needs to raise capital assuming that you can not get a loan from a bank and you do not want to seek funding from other sources the two owners must provide the funds themselves somehow option a the easiest and fairest way to do this is for the two shareholders to provide 75 and 25 of the funding as a loan to the company they will provide this loan knowing it may not be paid back if the company goes under note that it would not be fair for one of the shareholders to provide more as that shareholder would be taking all the risk while the other still the rewards although you could add a large interest rate to account for this option b but say one of the shareholders can not provide additional funds in that case the company should issue new shares and each shareholder can purchase however many of the new shares he she wants each shareholder is entitled to purchase at least 75 or 25 respectively but does not have to the result of this may be that company ownership percentages have changed after the capital raising this is more complex as it require valuing the company accurately to be fair and probably requires reporting to a government depending on the jurisdiction

your idea is a good one but as usual the devil is in the details and implementation might not be as easy as you think   the comments on the question have pointed out your steps 2 and 4 are   not necessarily the best way of doing things and that perhaps   keeping the principal   amount invested in the same fund instead of taking it all out and re investing it in a similar but different fund might be better the other points for you to consider are as follows how do you identify which of the thousands of conventional mutual   funds and etfs is the average risk high gain mutual fund into which you will place your initial investment   broadly speaking most actively managed mutual fund with average risk are likely to give you   less than average gains over long periods of time   the   unfortunate truth to which many pay only service is that   x% of actively managed mutual funds   in a specific category failed   to beat the average gain of all funds in that category or the   corresponding index e.g. s&p 500 index for large stock mutual funds over the past n years where x is generally between 70 and   100 and n is 5 10 15 etc   indeed one of the arguments in   favor of investing in a very low cost index fund is that you are effectively guaranteed the average gain or loss do n't forget the possibility of loss this of course is also the argument used against investing in index funds   why invest in boring index funds and settle for average gains at essentially no risk of not getting the average performance average performance is close to guaranteed when you can   get much more out of your investments by investing in a fund that is among the funds that had better than average returns   the difficulty is that which funds are x rated and which non x rated i.e. rated g = good or pg = pretty good is known only in hindsight whereas what you need is foresight as everyone will tell you past performance does not guarantee future results   as someone john bogle said   when you invest in a mutual fund you are in the position of a in you can see where you have been but not where you are going   in summary implementation of your strategy needs a good crystal ball to look into the future there is no such things as a guaranteed bond fund they also have risks though not necessarily the same as in a stock mutual fund you need to have a plan b in mind in case your chosen mutual fund takes a longer time than expected to return the 10 gain that you want to use to trigger profit taking and investment of the gain into a low risk bond fund and also maybe a plan c in case the of the market cause your chosen mutual fund to have negative return for some time what is the exit strategy

rule of thumb to retire with a yearly income of $ x you need to save $ in other words the safe assumption is that you 'll average 4 returns on your stabilized savings investments in the case of retiring with a $ 50k passive pretax income that means you need savings of $ 1 m by the time you retire if you want the $ 50,000 to be real post tax spendable dollars and your savings are n't in something like a roth 401k or roth ira increase that proportionately to account for taxes how you get there depends on what you start with how much you put into it every year how you invest it and how many years you have before your retirement date passive investment alone will not do it unless you start with a lot of money passive ongoing investment may depending on how much you can make yourself save when to find out whether any specific plan will do what you need you have to work with real numbers

a minor tangent one can claim the s&p has a mean return of say 10 and standard deviation of say 14 or so but when you run with that you find that the actual returns are n't such a great fit to the standard bell curve market anomalies producing the flood far more often than predicted over even a 20 year period this just means that the model does n't reflect reality at the tails even if the + 2 standard deviations look pretty this goes for the black i almost abbreviated it to then thought better i actually like the model as well the distinction between american and european is small enough that the precision of the model is wider than the difference of these two option styles i believe if you look at the model and actual pricing you can determine the volatility of a given stock by using prices around the strike price but when you then model the well out of money options you often find the market creating its own valuation

if you are looking for an advisor to just build a portfolio and then manage it a robo advisor can be beneficial especially if the alternative is doing it your self assuming that you are not well versed in the markets the primary risk with one is that it does not build a portfolio that accurately represents your needs and risk tolerance some firms base the number of questions they ask you on sign up based not on what is needed to get a good profile but on how many before people decide that it is too much hassle and bail that usually results in poorer profiles also a live advisor may be better at really getting at your risk tolerance many of day our risk tolerance is one thing but in reality we are not so risk tolerant   once the profile is built the algorithms maintain your portfolio on a day by day basis if rebalancing opportunities occur they take advantage of it   the primary benefit of a robo advisor is lower fees or smaller minimum account balances the downside is the lack of human interaction and financial advise outside of putting together a portfolio

you are entirely correct that it is an assumption so i will not argue the point any further other than to say that i do n't think it 's a very large stretch of the imagination to say that a more robust bitcoin economy and a larger user base would smooth it out the volatility it seems pretty reasonable to me that the instability in prices ca n't be accounted for from the technology that runs bitcoin and yet it is obvious that the current bitcoin economy is borderline abysmal it 's the things bitcoin allows you to do outside of financial institutions that give it a over typical government backed fiat currencies when we utilize this advantage real people will use the technology and a genuine economy could flourish    as a caveat to this i 'm not 100 convinced that bitcoins are the answer to me bitcoins are one particular brand of free as in speech decentralized crypto currencies when i speak of bitcoins i 'm promoting the idea it represents more than this particular implementation although i do believe the exact software you can download and run at this moment have the potential for tremendously more use than they 're currently being used for

in a retirement portfolio is usually a function of your age and your risk tolerance your portfolio is usually a mix of the following asset classes you can break down these asset classes further but each one is a topic unto itself if you are young you want to invest in things that have a higher return but are more volatile because market fluctuations like the current financial meltdown will be long gone before you reach retirement age   this means that at a younger age you should be investing more in stocks and foreign developing countries if you are older you need to be into more conservative investments bonds money market etc   if you were in your and still heavily invested in stock something like the current financial crisis could have ruined your retirement plans   a lot of baby boomers learned this the hard way for most of your life you will probably be somewhere in between these two   start aggressive and gradually get more conservative as you get older   you will probably need to re check your asset allocation once every 5 years or so as for how much of each investment class there are no hard and fast rules   the idea is to maximize return while accepting a certain amount of risk   there are two big unknowns in there 1 how much return do you expect from the various investments and 2 how much risk are you willing to accept   1 is a big guess and 2 is personal opinion a general portfolio guideline is 100 minus your age   this means if you are 20 you should have 80 of your retirement portfolio in stocks   if you are 60 your retirement portfolio should be 40 stock   over the years the 100 number has varied   some financial advisor types have suggested 150 or 200   unfortunately that 's why a lot of baby boomers ca n't retire now above all re balance your portfolio regularly   at least once a year perhaps quarterly if the market is going wild   make sure you are still in line with your desired asset allocation   if the stock market tanks and you are under invested in stocks buy more stock selling off other funds if necessary   i 've read interviews with fund managers who say failure to rebalance in a down stock market is one of the big mistakes people make when managing a retirement portfolio as for specific mutual fund suggestions i 'm not going to do that because it depends on what your 401k or ira has available as investment options   i do suggest that your focus on selecting a passive index fund not an actively managed fund with a high expense ratio personally i like total market funds to give you the broadest allocation of small and big companies   this makes your question about large small cap stocks moot   the next best choice would be an s&p 500 index fund you should also be able to find a low cost bond index fund that will give you a healthy mix of different bond types however you need to look at expense ratios to make an informed decision   a better performing fund is pointless if you lose it all to fees also watch out for overlap between your fund choices   investing in both a total market fund and an s&p 500 fund undermines the idea of a diversified portfolio an aggressive portfolio usually includes some foreign developing nation investments   there are n't many index fund options here so you may have to go with an actively managed fund with a much higher expense ratio   however this kind of investment can be worth it to take advantage of the economic growth in places like china

i mean it does n't really apply to a lease buy decision in a home   the variability due to the variables i discussed makes it not worth the analysis when you 're talking about return differences of maybe 1 2   even if your house costs $ 1 million that 's only a difference of $ 10,000 maybe if there 's no difference in the other variables but there will be   my point is that it 's not worth doing   dcf models are used for valuation of large projects not simple home buying problems   there are way better ways to evaluate such a simple problem

the simple answer is to get a residential mortgage first and once you have secured the loan do whatever you want   the bank only cares about what risk they are taking on the day of closing and wo n't care afterwards so long as you pay the mortgage on time residential mortgages are going to give you better rates than rentals generally

i 've never heard of an employer offering this kind of arrangement before so my   answer assumes there is no special tax treatment that i 'm not aware of utilizing the clause is probably equivalent to exercising some of your options selling the shares back to your employer at fmv and then exercising more options with the proceeds in this case if you exercise 7500 shares and sell them back at fmv your proceeds would be 7500 x $ 5 = $ with which you could exercise the remaining 12,500 options the tax implications would be 1 short term capital gains of 7500 x $ 5 $ 3 = $ 15,000 and 2 amt income of 12,500 x $ 5 $ 3 = $ 25,000 assuming you do n't sell the shares within the calendar year

operation twist is just an asset swap the balance sheet is n't being expanded money is n't being printed to buy treasuries the fed is just selling short term assets and buying longer term assets if more longer term treasuries are bought this brings the yield down for bonds the more you buy them the lower the yield goes lower long term interest rates means people can borrow at low rates and this is supposed help the economy    no printing of money means that gold does n't get more precious    i do think gold will do well though if the ecb wants to save the eu they 're going to have to print and print a lot the bank of england is doing some qe too lots of countries will are easing

when purchasing a condo in a university town it is almost guaranteed that the prices will be inflated as a result   this is because you are competing not only with single home primary residence homeowners but also with a multitude of investment buyers and landlords who want to purchase a rental property   universities are popular rental markets due to their stability there will always be students looking for a place to live and as a result the areas attract investors more than other markets this can work in your favor however   if you do n't mind sharing your residence with other students and you do n't mind the part time work that being a landlord requires you can live much cheaper and even make money over the next few years as your roommates pay your bills   owning a primary residence rental property also brings a lot of tax benefits because you can claim expenses and depreciation against your income   this could benefit your father who could be a co owner and would certainly benefit from the write offs against his higher tax bracket the real trick that makes or breaks the experience is finding mature responsible roommates who will cause the minimum amount of headache   if this part of the equation is missing it can lead to distractions from school and even legal worries when you have to think about things like unpaid rent and/or

newspapers write a lot about the central bank stopping cheap money in the us what is that exactly and what are the implications for the stock market an interest rate is simply defined as the price of money   so if money is cheap it must mean there is a low interest rate compared to normal   if milk is cheap we 're comparing it to past prices or prices at competitors stores   same with money i do n't think its fair to say just because the supply of dollars rises that the value of dollars will go down   value or price is determined by supply and demand not just supply   its possible for the demand for dollars to be stronger than the rising supply which would drive the price higher   a good example of this is to look at the value of the dollar recently   the fed has been printing $ 85 billion per month yet the value of them is going up compared to foreign currencies gold and just about everything   why because the fed has merely threatened to stop but it has n't stopped   that alone was enough to increase demand above supply   so if you want to know what will happen take a look at what is happening when cheap money ends the value of the dollar will go up interest rates will go up   this will be a drag on the economy   it will be more difficult for companies to show profits and earnings should decline   in addition those who have grown to the easy money and have over leveraged themselves ie reits could go bankrupt

if i understand your question you 're misunderstanding the buy sell spread and at least in this instance seem to be in an unfortunate situation where the spread is quite large the polish zloty gbp ideal exchange rate is around   thus when actually exchanging currency you should expect to pay a bit more than zloty to get one pound sterling and you should expect to get a bit less than zloty in exchange for one pound sterling   that 's because you 're giving the bank its cut both for operations and so that it has a reason to hold onto some zloty that it ca n't lend out   it sounds like barclay 's has a large spread buy sell   i would guess british banks do n't need all that many zloty so you have a higher spread than you would for usd or eur other currency exchange companies or banks particularly those who are in the primary business of converting money may have a smaller spread and be more willing to do it for you   also it looks like the polish banks are willing to do it at a better rate certainly they 're giving you more zloty for one pound sterling so it seems likely the other way would be better as well though since they 're a polish bank it 's certainly easier for them to give you zloty so this may be less true   barclay 's is certainly giving you a better deal on pounds for a zloty than they are zloty for a pound in terms of how far off their spread is from the ideal

there are two reasons you would get a higher yield for savings accounts either because it is not guaranteed by a national deposit insurance fund i presume in canada or you have to hold it for a longer term money market accounts are insured in the u.s. and are also very liquid since you can debit from it any time because of this they offer much lower rates of interest than comparable products   if you look at the savings products such as the 1.50 momentum savings account offered by scotiabank you actually have to hold a $ 5000 balance and not make any debit from it for 90 days in order to get the extra 0.75 that would get you to 1.50 essentially this is roughly equivalent to offering you a 1.50 gic with a 0.75 withdrawal penalty fee but simply presented in more positive terms as for the financial financial 1.75 offering it looks like it is not insured by the

as stated tracking fractional transactions beyond 8 decimal places makes no sense in the context of standard stock and mutual fund transactions   this is because even for the most expensive equities those fractional shares would still not be worth whole cent amounts even for account balances in the hundreds of thousands of dollars one important thing to remember is that when dealing with equities the total cost number of shares and share price are all 3 components of the same value   thus if you take 2 of those values you can always calculate the third price shares = cost cost price = shares etc   what you 're seeing in your account 9 decimal places is probably the result of dividing uneven values such as $ invested in a commodity which trades for $ results in shares   most brokerages will round this value off somewhere yours just happens to include more decimal places than your financial software allows since your brokerage is the one who has the definitive total for your account balance the only real solution is to round up or down whichever keeps your total balance in the software in line with the balance shown online

if one has established a liquid emergency fund of 3 to 6 months income as suggested in several places here as well as being recommended by many financial planners then a savings account is a great place to keep that money all things being equal between the savings and checking account the limited transfers should be a non issue since ideally you wo n't be using that money and if you need to in an emergency you could move a whole months worth of expenses to checking in one transfer   the savings account gives you a place to keep the emergency fund segregated from your normal funds out of sight out of mind as it were a savings account also gives you a place to stash funds intended for short term goals away from normal use funds one such example i can use is that i am purchasing several plane tickets for various family members to come visit for christmas i have those funds set aside in a savings account so they do n't interfere with my budgeting of my normal living expenses while these are just examples and your situation may vary they are both examples of where a savings account would be useful even if it is identical to a checking account   edit   using other types of accounts can also accomplish the same thing since we are using the assumption that the checking and savings accounts are identical the benefit of using a savings account is that it is usually inherently linked to the associated checking account without any additional effort on the part of the account holder any other account type would require additional effort however minor on the part of the account holder to link them in such a way that would make transfers between accounts as easy as possible

first if you live in around a reasonably populated urban area and you 're in the united states i ca n't see why you would choose to bank with chase b of a or another large commercial bank i think you would be much better served by banking at a reasonably large credit union there are many differences between banks and credit unions but in a nutshell credit unions are owned by the members and operate primarily to provide benefits to their members whereas a bank is owned by the shareholders and operates primarily to make profits for the shareholders not to benefit the customers the banking industry absolutely hates the credit unions so if you 've ever been and with this fee and that charge by your bank i have to ask why you 're still banking with a company that irritates you and/or actively tries to screw you out of your money i live in california and i 've banked at credit unions almost exclusively since i started working nearly 30 years ago every time i 've and started banking at a for profit bank i 've regretted it for example a few years ago i opened a checking account at a now defunct bank just for online use ebay and so forth it was a free checking account when chase bought the account became a chase account and it seemed that every other statement brought new fees new restrictions and so forth i finally closed it when they imposed some stupid fee for not carrying enough of a balance i found out by logging in to their web site and seeing a balance of zero dollars they had imposed the fee a few statements back and i had missed it so they kept debiting my account until it was empty at this point i do about 90 of my banking at a fairly large credit union i have a mortgage with a big bank but that was out of my hands as the lender originator sold the mortgage and i had no say in the matter my credit union has a highly functional web site permits me to download my account activity to quicken and even has mobile apps which allow me to deposit a check by taking a picture of it or check my account activity etc they my credit union are part of a network of other credit unions so as long as i am using a network atm i never pay a fee in sum i ca n't see any reason to go with a bank regarding checks i write a small number of checks per year but i recently needed to reorder them my credit union refers members directly to a major league player in the check printing business four boxes of security checks was around $ 130 plus shipping which is not small money however i was able to order the very same checks via costco for less than half that amount costco refers members to a check printing service which is a front subsidiary of and using a promo code plus the discount given for my costco membership i got four boxes of security checks shipped to me for less than $ 54 my advice would be to look around if you 're a costco member use their check printing service offers a similar service to anyone as does sam 's club and you can search around to find other similar services bottom line if you order your checks via your bank or credit union chances are you will pay full retail shop around and save a bit i 've not opened a new account at a credit union in some time but i would not be surprised if a credit union offered a free box of checks when you open a new account with them

agreed but often it seems that gray area is exactly what these innovations are looking for   repeatedly pushing down onto the struggling individual the past responsibilities of the wealthy corporation     say this thing picks up steam and is walmart   john is walking out the door and critical deliveries need to be made   john was a bit short last month and could n't wait for the 2 week insurance reimbursement process   so despite the team lead 's did n't upgrade his insurance coverage this month   he did n't want to be that guy so did n't confirm deny getting modifying coverage to the lead   the team lead asks john to take the packages but does n't really follow through on the insurance check   john wrecks his car and his back   john 's insurance company rejects the claim   the team lead and john are fired because not checking having the insurance was against written policy but and away all the way back up to the 1 online retailer spot   so often obstacles are easily   i get the personal responsibility angle for all involved but social financial pressure can be brutal   the problem is that situations are left as is and the moneyed parties are ignorant   my guess is few compile stats on sol uber lyft drivers in similar situations

the first thing is to look at the monthly cost of the loan the one from the company is interest free while it is unlikely that a bank will have a zero percent loan you will also have to look at what the seller will offer   the next thing to look at is the term of the loan when comparing two loans with the same interest rate the shorter term loan will cost more per month many times when an auto dealer offers a zero percent loan they also   have a very short term 12 24 months many people ca n't afford the monthly payments with that short a term   you said you could afford to save the other $ 2000 in about six months that means you could set aside $ a month to do it in six months if the loan from the employer has a term longer than 6 months you should be able to afford the loan keep in mind that the employer will probably be taking the money right out of your paychecks   you do have to look at the conditions attached to the loan what does accepting the loan do to your employment situation if you leave early do they want you to pay it back in 30 days or will they take the rest from the final paycheck or do you have longer   you do have to look at the term of the loan and see if you can pay it off early if they require a 12 month term can you end it earlier or change the monthly payment to end it early the reason why you care about the term is that if the term is 24 months then after a year you still owe them $ 1000 which if you have to pay back immediately if you quit it may make it hard for you to leave the company a minor note they probably are not reporting it to the credit reporting agencies therefore it wo nt help your credit score this is probably not a big issue since you are considering going without a loan

it has to do with return i do n't know if canada has a matching feature on retirement accounts but in the us many companies will match the first x% you put in so for me my first $ 5000 or so is matched 100 i 'll take that match over paying down any debt beyond that of course it 's a simple matter of rate of return why save in the bank at 2 when you owe at 10 18   one can make this as simple or convoluted as they like my mortgage is a tax deduction so my 5 mortgage costs me 3.6 i 've continued to invest rather than pay the mortgage too early as my retirement account is with pre tax dollars so $ 72 will put $ 100 in that account even in this last decade bad as it was i got more than 3.6 return

every company has stocks    for the stocks to be traded via some stock exchange the companies must follow the eligibility criteria and guidelines once done these are then listed on the stock exchange and can be traded the advantage amongst others of listing is liquidity and stocks can easily be bought and sold   some small companies or closely held companies may not want to list on stock exchange and hence are not traded this does not mean they ca n't be bought and sold they can be outside of the market however the deals are complex and every deal has to be worked out during the course of time a stock that is traded on a stock exchange would either fail to meet the criteria or voluntarily choose not to be traded and follow the delisting process either by stock exchange or by company after this the stocks are no longer traded on the exchange

how is it possible for the average investor to underperform the market the average investor probably makes some bad decisions you also might need to take transaction costs into play including borrowing on margin so that there 's a natural erosion of returns across the market   meaning if transaction borrowing costs are 1 and the market return is 5 the average investor   alternatively if by average they mean the average of the population not weighted by amount it 's plausible that the mass of smaller investors perform slightly worse than the smaller number of large investors and have larger relative transaction costs thus having a lower average on a per capita basis does n't the fact that investors can consistently underperform the market by making poor decisions imply that an investor could consistently outperform the market by making the opposite decisions no   if my investment decisions cause me to earn only a 10 return compared to the average 12 return then making the opposite decision will cause me to lose 10 not to make 14

if you look at a trade grid you can see how this happens if there are enough bids to cover all shares currently on the sell side at a certain price those shares will be bought and increased price quotes will be shown for the bids and ask if there are enough bids to cover this price those will get bought and higher prices will be shown and this process will repeat until the sell side has more power than the buy side it seems like this process is going on all day long with momentum either on the upside or downside but i think that much of this bidding and selling is automatic and is being done by large trading firms and high tech computers i also feel that many of these bids and asks are already programmed to appear once there is a price change so once one price gets bought computers will put in higher bids to take over asks it 's like a virtual war between trading firms and their computers when more money is on the buy side the stock will go up and vice versa i sort of feel like this high frequency trading is detrimental to the markets and does n't really give everyone a fair shot retail investors do not have the resources and knowledge in order to do this sort of high frequency trading it also seems to go against certain free market principles in my opinion

i was in a very similar place 10 years ago i was in my mid 20 's with 45 k in combined school + personal business related debt and working in it for not very much i already had 10 15 k in debt when my college loans first came due and it was the first time i really had to come to terms with the hole i had dug myself and i spent weeks at a time obsessing over plans that would help me get out of debt it effected my health and my relationships i felt like i was never going to come out from under it my family was very much lower middle class k household income and i was n't going to get or expect any help there so i went to work and made it a point to make sure every personal and professional decision i made was conducive to my long term goals and before i knew it they became short term goals    find out what your basic monthly need is be brutally honest cut back on things like cable tv i still do n't have it reduce your phone plans borrow things when you do n't have to buy them and send that money to your debt pick up some hobbies that do n't cost much these are all minor sacrifices i got back in to playing the piano and spent a lot of time at the beach in the summer and up on books i 'd always meant to read in the winter    i ran a lot of numbers in a spreadsheet but you can play with the numbers with online loan calculators to put some real numbers behind your goals here is one that i just tried out   you 'll probably be surprised how much effect a little bit of extra towards a loan can make in the long term   put your current college loan details in to it and then see what the effect of an extra 150 a month is i know you 've implied that you really do n't have anything extra each month and that is fine figure out an amount that gets you moving towards your goals and then start working on a way to make it figuring out how to make or squeeze an extra n dollars out of your budget every 30 days is much less daunting than thinking about paying off 50k. you said you are working in it i do n't know where you live but in my city there are lots of decent it related jobs your first goal might need to be to find a better one     if possible move around balances until you 've got interest rates you can deal with and now that you have solid numbers to plan with consider the effect of making smaller goals would you feel as bad if you had half as much debt how about if you got rid of 10 k of debt or just your credit cards   i know i felt a huge relief when i cut my overall debt in half it felt like a huge part of my burden had lifted and it had i could start seeing the end of the tunnel     i think that one of the biggest changes in my life since then has been the way i look at and think about money and debt   i did n't really have to sacrifice much i learned to travel cheaply and whenever i met    a goal i 'd reward myself with a small trip today i have a very low mortgage payment and i pay my full credit balances each month so i have no revolving bad debt    i wish you luck and i know exactly where you are standing right now

the preferred accounts are designed to hope you do one of several things pay one day late   then charge you all the deferred interest many people think if they put $ x a month aside then pay just before the 6 months 12 or no payment before 2014 period ends then i will be able to afford the computer carpet or furniture the interest rate they will charge you if you are late will be buried in the fine print but expect it to be very high pay on time but now that you have a card with their logo on it   so now you feel that you should buy the accessories from them they hope that you become a long time customer they want to make money on your next computer also their bill me later option on that site as essentially the same as the preferred account in the end you will have another line of credit they will do a credit check the impact both positive and negative on your credit picture is discussed in other questions   because two of the three options you mentioned in your question cash debit card imply that you have enough cash to buy the computer today there is no reason to get another credit card to finance the purchase the delayed payment with the preferred account will save you about 10 dollars 2000 1 interest 0.5 years   the choice of store might save you more money though with apple there are fewer places to get legitimate discounts here are your options how to get the limit increased you can ask for a temporary increase in the credit limit or you can ask for a permanent one some credit cards can do this online others require you to talk to them if they are going to agree to this it can be done in a few minutes some individuals on this site have even been able to send the check to the credit card company before completing the purchase thus increasing their credit limit ymmv i have no idea if it works   a good reason to use the existing credit card instead of the debit card is if the credit card is a rewards card the extra money or points can be very nice just make sure you pay it back before the bill is due in fact you can send the money to the credit card company the same day the computer arrives in the mail   having the transaction on the credit card can also get you purchase protection and some cards automatically extend the warranty

not so much a scam if you fill the required paperwork and actually take time to mail it in assuming it 's done correctly you will get your money that being said having a mail in rebate program is usually a win win for the seller while they may have to pay a small fee to a third party who handles the rebate almost always this influences a potential buyer to choose a specific product over the alternative the seller knows very well that very few people will actually go through with it and yes they do often make the process needlessly complicated and long as a deterrent   plus let 's be real no one likes sending out physical letters anymore from a marketing standpoint the mail in rebate is a brilliant idea however it 's usually more of an annoyance for the consumer

gt;i think you mean 60 of all mortgages on homes in nevada are underwater not every home has a mortgage so it 's not 60 of the homes it 's 60 of the mortgages   spot on in the us typically somewhere around 30 to 40 of homes have no mortgage at all i.e. 100 equity by the owners   so if nevada follows the us average which it may not having a lot of new developments then 60 of would be somewhere between 36 to 42 of homes   that of course is still huge if even 10 of homes in a locale are distressed sales it is enough to drive prices down   but another caveat is that just because a place is underwater does not mean that it has a high negative equity point of fact is that any home bought with an ltv mortgage or a really low down payment i.e. 0 to 10 down payment is probably underwater from day one and remains pretty close to that for the first couple of years    why because typical realtor fees are around 6 and closing costs are easily another couple of percent add in that with a self amortizing loan that very little equity is built up in the first few years and any loss for aging and owner cash out equity can easily be near zero or negative   that 's one of the reasons you should n't buy unless you are planning on living somewhere for at least 5 years because it takes that long to recoup the realtor amp closing costs ergo the whole flipping is in and of itself a sign that a market is in a speculative bubble

there is a measure of protection for investors it is not the level of protection provided by fdic or ncua but it does exist securities investor protection corporation what sipc protects sipc protects against the loss of cash and securities such as stocks    and bonds held by a customer at a financially troubled sipc member    brokerage firm the limit of sipc protection is $ 500,000 which    includes a $ 250,000 limit for cash most customers of failed brokerage    firms when assets are missing from customer accounts are protected    there is no requirement that a customer reside in or be a citizen of    the united states a non u.s. citizen with an account at a brokerage    firm that is a member of sipc is treated the same as a resident or    citizen of the united states with an account at a brokerage firm that    is a member of sipc sipc protection is limited sipc only protects the custody function of    the broker dealer which means that sipc works to restore to customers    their securities and cash that are in their accounts when the    brokerage firm liquidation begins sipc does not protect against the decline in value of your securities    sipc does not protect individuals who are sold worthless stocks and    other securities sipc does not protect claims against a broker for    bad investment advice or for recommending inappropriate investments it is important to recognize that sipc protection is not the same as    protection for your cash at a federal deposit insurance corporation    fdic insured banking institution because sipc does not protect the    value of any security investments in the stock market are subject to fluctuations in market    value sipc was not created to protect these risks that is why sipc    does not bail out investors when the value of their stocks bonds and    other investment falls for any reason instead in a liquidation sipc    replaces the missing stocks and other securities when it is possible    to do so

there are a couple of cases where i 'd argue in favor of the 401k employer matching if the employer matches your contributions then it makes sense to get these additional investments which if you are in a low bracket may exist as highly compensated employees may want those in the lower brackets to contribute as much as they can investment options if the employer has enough assets in the plan there could be access to institutional versions of those funds   for example compare vanguard institutional index viiix with vanguard 500 index vfinx where the expense ratio in the former is just .02 while the latter is .17   granted this is a minor difference in expenses there is something to be said for how much a .15 drag year over year could add up

you should always invest if your investment rate of return is higher    than your interest rate your next line about standard deviation is dead on   there are too many variables to give an exact answer here in my opinion the main reason is that one variable is n't easy to quantify one 's risk tolerance   clearly there 's one extreme the 18 credit card unless you are funding type rates of it 's safe to say that 18 debt should take priority over any investments except for the matched 401(k deposits   what i think you 're talking about is something we 've addressed here in multiple threads   do i prepay my sub 4 mortgage or invest in this case and to noah 's comment the question is whether you can expect a post tax return of over 3 during your time horizon i look at the return for 15 years from 1998 2013 and see a 6 cagr for the s&p. i chose 15 years as the choice is often one of paying a 30 year mortgage faster as fast as 15 the last 15 years offer a pretty bad scenario 2 crashes and a mortgage crisis 6 after long term gains would get you 5.1 net   you can pull the data back to 1871 and run cagr numbers for the timeframe of your choosing i have n't done it yet but i imagine there 's no 15 year span that lags the 3 target i cite   what makes it more complex is that the investment is n't lump sum it may not be obvious but cagr is a dollar invested at t=0 and returns calculated to t = final year it would take a bit of to invest the extra funds every month year over your period of analysis   in the end there are still those who will choose to pay off their 4 mortgage regardless of what the numbers show even if the 15 year result showed worst case 3.5 almost no profit and an average 10 the feeling of risk is more than many will want

you would think so would n't you after all it 's your money in practise though it 's not as easy as you might think because anti money laundering and anti fraud laws mean you generally have to withdraw money to the same account you funded your trading from some forex trading account providers will allow you to fund from multiple sources but then insist on putting money back to those sources in some proportion or some order or other some forex trading account providers at least claim that they may at their discretion let you do it if the destination account is in the same name but i would n't be surprised if they charged you for it and actually the charges might be somewhat justified if they have to invoke identification procedures to make sure the other account is indeed actually you you would have to talk to a specific service provider and see if they agree to do what you want they all have faqs about funding and withdrawal so you can scan around online for the slightly more flexible ones and then give them a call you might find it difficult to get any guarantees out of them though

former wfm team member here about a decade and still have a lot of store management staff as friends   wfm has always wanted to be the tech company of grocery stores but their implementation strategy has been absolutely worthless and piecemeal due to their method of expansion in in the 90s and early 2000s where they would buy up regional organic grocery chains across the nation and pretty much just integrate them into the company as a separate entity   imagine wfm as really 7 different companies that have almost zero in common with each other from policies to product selection to buyers to computer systems so they 've never been able to get the it part of their business to be effective even though they 've desperately wanted to because every region has had different it that was n't entirely compatible with the others   on top of that they tried to upgrade the current systems to a perpetual inventory system that did not work you ca n't just modify current systems to be fundamentally different from what their original intended function was   with amazon coming in hopefully they can gut the system and start over fresh using wfm 's current regional distribution as a hub for expanding their own product offerings honestly i think amazon was looking at its seattle store with no employees as a prototype for what they could achieve with an actual chain   a lot of what 's holding wfm back on the price of their products is that they huge distribution costs they 're relying on which is in my experience not exactly great if amazon can utilize what they do well inventory management shipping technology and business support services i think they can decrease the cost of their products by the 20 25 target they need to hit to remain competitive in natural and organic foods because right now they 're getting absolutely by kroger trader joe 's walmart sprouts and so many others

note   this is not professional tax advice   if you think you need professional tax advice find a licensed professional in your local area what are the expected earnings year us$ 100 us$ 1,000   us$ 100,000   i would say if this is for us$ 1,000 or less that registering an ein and consulting a cpa to file a partnership tax return is not going to be a profitable exercise all the earnings perhaps more will go to paying someone to do or help do the tax filings the simplest taxes are for a business that you completely own   corporations and partnerships involve additional forms and get more and more and complex and even more so when it involves foreign participation   partnerships are often not formal partnerships but can be more easily thought of as independent businesses that each participants owns that are simply doing some business with each other schedule c is the irs form you fill out for any businesses that you own on schedule c you would list the income from advertising   also on schedule c there is a place for all of the business expenses such as ads that you buy a server that you rent supplies employees and independent contractors   amounts paid to an independent contractor certainly need not be based on hours but could be a fixed fee or based on profit earned    finally if you pay anyone in the usa over a certain amount you have to tell the irs about that with a form 1099 at the beginning of the next year so they can fill out their taxes   but according to an article in international tax blog you might not have to file form 1099 with the irs for foreign contractors if they are not us persons not a us citizen or a resident visa holder

i held shares in bind a small biotechnology company on the nasdaq that was liquidated on the chapter 11 auction block in 2016 there were sufficient proceeds to pay the debts and return some cash to shareholders with payments in 2016 and 2017 some payments have yet to occur the whole process is counter intuitive and full of both for tax preparation planning and receiving payments landmine 0 some shareholders will sell in a panic as soon as the chapter 11 is announced   this would have been a huge mistake in the case of bind because the eventual liquidation payments were worth 3 or so times as much as the share price after chapter 11   the amount of the liquidation payments was n't immediately because the company 's intellectual property had to be auctioned landmine 1 the large brokerages vanguard fidelity tda and others the distributions to shareholders on form 1099 distributed to both shareholders and the irs the bankruptcy trustee considered this to be their responsibility according to the tax code and to the irs website the liquidation is taxed like a sale of stock rather than a dividend on the shareholder level a complete liquidation can be thought of as a sale of all outstanding corporate stock held by the shareholders in exchange for all of the assets in that corporation like any sale of stock the shareholder receives capital gain treatment on the difference between the amount received by the shareholder in the distribution and the cost or other basis of the stock the distributions as dividends makes them wrongly ineligible to be wiped out by the enormous capital loss on the stock   vanguard 's error appeared on my own 1099 and the others were mentioned in an investor discussion on   however l the bankruptcy trustee stated on twitter that while the payments are not dividends the 1099s were the brokers responsibility landmine 2 many shareholders will wrongly attempt to claim the capital loss for tax year 2016 or they may have failed to understand the law in time for proper tax planning for tax year 2016 it does not matter that the company 's shares were cancelled in 2016   according to the irs website when a shareholder receives a series of distributions in liquidation gain is recognized once all of the shareholder 's stock basis is recovered a loss however will not be recognized until the final distribution is received in particular shareholders who receive the 2017 payment will not be able to take a capital loss for tax year 2016 because the liquidation was n't complete   late discovery of this timing issue no doubt resulted in an end of year of 2016 overall capital gains for many causing a failure to preemptively realize available capital losses elsewhere i 'm not going to carefully consider the following issues which may or may not have some effect on the timing of the capital loss landmine 3 surprisingly it appears that some shareholders who sold their shares in 2016 still may not claim the capital loss for tax year 2016 because they will receive a liquidation distribution in 2017 taken at face value the irs website 's statement a loss however will not be recognized until the final distribution is received appears to apply to shareholders of record of august 30 2016 who receive the payouts even if they sold the shares after the record date   however to know for sure it might be worth carefully parsing the relevant tax code and treasury regs landmine 4 some shareholders are completely cut out of the bankruptcy distribution the bankruptcy plan only provides distributions for shareholders of record aug 30 2016   those who bought shares of afterwards are out of luck landmine 5 according to the discussion on many shareholders have yet to receive or even learn of the existence of a form more secure link showing brokers served here required to accept 2017 payments   to add to confusion there is apparently ongoing legal over whether the trustee is able to require this form worse shareholders report difficulty getting brokers required cooperation in submitting this form landmine 6 hopefully there are no more boom disclaimer i am not a tax professional consult the tax code treasury regulations irs publications when preparing your taxes   they are more trustworthy than accountants or at least more trustworthy than good ones

for stock splits let 's say stock xyz closed at 100 on february 5   then on february 6 it a 2-for-1 split and closes the day at 51   in yahoo 's historical prices for xyz you will see that it closed at 51 on feb 6 but all of the closing prices for the previous days will be divided by 2   so for feb 5 it will say the closing price was 50 instead of 100 for dividends let 's say stock abc closed at 200 on december 18   then on december 19 the stock increases in price by $ 2 but it pays out a $ 1 dividend   in yahoo 's historical prices for xyz you will see that it closed at 200 on dec 18 and 201 on dec 19   yahoo adjusts the closing price for dec 19 to factor in the dividend

a company typically goes public in order to bring in additional capital in an ipo the company through its officials will typically do so by issuing additional shares and offering to sell those to investors if they did not do that then there would be no net capital gain for the company if person a sells share in company c to person b then company c does not benefit directly from the exchange by issuing and selling additional shares the total value of all stock in the company can increase being publicly traded also greatly increases the confidence in the valuation of the company as a consequence of the perfect market theory there is nothing in this that says that initial investors cofounders employees etc need to sell their shares in the process they might choose to do so or they might not or they might be prevented from doing so by terms of any agreements that they have signed or by insider trading laws compare what happens to internal stock when a company goes public depending on specifics it might be reasonable for the company to perform a share split prior to the initial public offering that however does n't affect the total value of the shares only the price per share

always use limit orders never market orders period do that and you will always pay what you said you would when the transaction goes through whichever broker you use is not going to negotiate for the best price on your trade if you choose a market order   their job is to fill that order so they will always buy it for more than market and sell it for less to ensure the order goes through it is not even a factor when choosing between tradeking and scottrade i use trade king and my friend uses   besides the transaction fee tk is a few $ $ cheaper the only other things to consider are the tools and research and customer service if you need it that each site offers i went with tk and the lower transaction fee since tools and research can be had from other sources i basically only use it when i want to make a trade since i do n't find the tools particularly useful and i never take an analyst 's opinion of a stock at face value anyway since everybody always has their own agenda

well i mean yea it 's absolutely possible to be making as much i was talking about teaching the people you sponsor into business from you you teach those people to stop shopping from and red bull and instead buy similar products from amway it 's money they are already spending and you teach them to shop through their own store to keep the profit some people just want to make a little bit of money on the side selling their products without sponsoring people    that 's not what i 'm talking about the whole idea is to build a business asset that will give you time it 's about creating cash flow so you can stop trading your time working for a boss and building his company then you find other people who want that lifestyle and teach them how to accomplish those dreams

they borrowed it from the people and typically to finance wars and military spending for example wikipedia suggests that the bank of england was set up to supply money to the king £ 1.2 m was raised in 12 days half of this was used to rebuild the navy it 's a game that everyone has to play once started if napoleon buys an army on credit you 'll have to raise an equal amount or face quite a problem as for why they 've grown so large it 's because governments are quite skilled at owing large sums of money only a small portion of the debt comes due in full at a given moment and they constantly reissue new debt via auction to keep it rolling so as long as they can make coupon interest and the lump sum at maturity it 's not difficult to keep up imagine how much credit card debt you could rack up if you only ever had to pay interest this game will continue for as long as people lend and there are plenty of lenders there 's pensions mutual funds and endowments which find public debt typically safer than stocks and money market funds which target 1 dollar nav and only invest in the safest aaa rated bonds to protect it there 's central banks which can buy and sell public debt to manipulate inflation and exchange rates   absent some kind of un resolution to ban lending or perhaps a eu mandated balanced budget these debts will likely continue to grow you think they collectively owe more money than can exist but there 's a lot of wealth in the world most nations owe less than a year 's gdp for example the us 's total wealth is in the neighborhood of 50 trillion

i 've had a hard time finding out details on remortgaging help to buy loans myself but found one article which points out it is possible   but also that there are n't many lenders offering such deals out there   the article lists a number of lenders that do offer these programs and the extra requirements on equity you might have to have it sounds like it 's going to be critical to know how much equity you 've built up    since part of the valuation increase will be credited to help to buy you wo n't get all the £ 30k increase you 've mentioned   instead i believe you 'll only get 80 so £ 24k    which would mean your total equity is £ 24k + £ 7k = £ plus whatever you might have already paid off   i 'm going to assume there is n't much you 've paid off so will assume just over 18 while this is higher than most of the equity limits mentioned in the above article keep in mind you 'd only get cash out corresponding to the difference between your current equity amount and the equity required for the loan   for example if you went with a loan requiring 15 equity to qualify you 'd only have 3 over that and thus get £ out    and that 's before any fees you might have to pay   you might have new origination fees but you also might have early repayment fees maybe you could pursue a lower money down refi and get to keep more but the same article points out that help to buy might consider that too risky for you and refuse to allow the refi i think it 's worth shopping around to get actual numbers for your exact situation but personally it does n't sound like you have enough equity yet to get much cash out of a refi   perhaps you 'll get lucky though   best of luck

at a very high level the answer is yes that 's a good idea for money that you want to invest on the scale of decades putting money into a broad market based fund has historically given the best returns something like the vanguard s&p 500 automatically gives you a diverse portfolio with super low expenses as it sounds like you understand the near term returns are volatile and if you really think you might want this money in the next few years then the stock market might not be the best choice as a final note as one of the comments mentioned it makes sense to hold a broad market based fund for your ira as well if possible

our compensation is pretty typical for a study like this   and it 's actually frowned upon by the to offer too much because it runs up against ethical concerns for coercion to participate in studies   given the population for this study of course we also added the for the rift as something that might actually interest people   and along with the value of supporting research to improve financial decisions we hope this is sufficient motivation for some people to enroll   so far so good     in my experience people have all sorts of reasons for participating in research   a lot of people who do our studies tell us that its just kind of fun and the small monetary compensation is a nice quantitative indicator of how well they perform   one related topic is amazon where people do tasks for incredibly small amounts   surprisingly statistics show a very wide distribution of education and income levels for these participants   honestly i 'm not quite sure why people sign up for that site   people just have all sorts of reasons for doing things   in sum   we 're not embarrassed by the size of our compensation   but seriously we really appreciate the feedback and i 'll definitely be sharing your comments with our lab director for the next time

walmart is doing nothing illegal and every other business is playing against the same laws   nobody is forced to work there and nobody is forced to shop there   that all said anyone who actually cares about this has a solution update the laws and convince people to update their choices in where to work and where to shop   think long and hard about how you would like other people treated and how complex you would like that to be hint the us health system is complex and inefficient     realise that every law has other consequences and just because you want something to happen a particular way does n't mean it will   for example increasing minimum wages does n't magically increase average wages or provide new jobs for the unemployed   there is a lot of debate over the actual wiki but it is never simple

you have the 2 properties and even though the value of property b is less than the amount you owe on it hopefully you have some equity in a. so if you do have enough equity in property a why do n't you just go to the one lender and get both property a and b refinanced under the same mortgage this way hopefully the combined equity in both properties would be enough to cover the full amount of the loan and you have the opportunity to refinance at favourable rate and terms sounds like you are in the usa with an interest rate of 3.25 i am in australia and my mortgage rates are currently between 6.3 to 6.6

who computes the s&p 500 standard and poor 's why are they sharing this information and because that 's what they do this is a financial research company how do they recuperate the costs inherent in computing the s&p 500 by charging clients for other information the computing of the index itself is not all that complicated its coming up with the index that 's a problem once they 've come up with the formula and it became widely accepted the computation itself is not an issue but the fact that its so popular leads to the s&p brand recognition and people come and pay good money for their other services ratings and financial analysis of securities they do more work for free for example the ratings of various government debts are being done by s&p for free governments do n't pay for that while private bonds are rated for a fee corporations pay to have their bonds rated also as noted by there are probably some licensing fees for using the index name in the fund name and other users are probably paying the licensing fee like the news agencies and the exchanges s&p500 is a registered trademark and as such can not be used without the owner 's permission why is then active management not required for indexed funds because no research and stock picking is required in fact these funds do n't really require a manager they can be managed by a simple script and how does it lower taxes perhaps this could be a different    question if this has become too broad actively managed funds perform a lot more buy sell operations each leading to tax consequences to the fund which rolls them over to the investors index funds only buy and sell to re balance back to the index or when the makeup of the index changes usually once a year or half a year leading to much lesser realized capital gains to the fund thus much lesser tax consequences

if a stock is trading for $ 11 per share just before a $ 1 per share dividend is declared then the share price drops to $ 10 per share immediately following the declaration if you owned 100 shares valued at $ 1100 before the dividend was declared then you still own 100 shares now valued at $ 1000 generally if the dividend is paid today only the owners of shares as of yesterday evening or the day before maybe get paid the dividend if you bought those 100 shares only this morning the dividend gets paid to the seller who owned the stock until yesterday evening not to you you just bought a dividend paying $ 1100 for 100 shares that are worth only $ 1000 at the end of the day whereas if you had just been a little less eager to purchase right now you could have bought those 100 shares for only $ 1000 but looking at the bright side if you bought the shares earlier than yesterday you get paid the dividend   so assuming that you bought the shares in timely fashion your holdings just lost value and are worth only $ 1000   what you do have is the promise that in a couple of days time you will be paid $ 100 as the dividend thus restoring the asset value back to what it was earlier   now if you had asked your broker to re invest the dividend back into the same stock then assuming that the stock price did not change in the interim due to normal market fluctuations you would get another 10 shares for that $ 100 dividend making the value of your investment $ 1100 again 110 shares at $ 10 each exactly what it was before the dividend was paid if you did n't choose to reinvest the dividend you would still have the 100 shares worth $ 1000 plus $ 100 cash so regardless of what other investors choose to do your asset value does not change as a result of the dividend   what does change is your net worth because that dividend amount is taxable regardless of whether you chose to reinvest or not and so your tax liability just increased

b 's answer hits most of it but leaves out one thing most companies control who can own their non public shares and prohibit transfers sales or in some cases even ongoing ownership by ex employees so it 's not that hard to ensure you stay under 500 investors    remember that is n't an exchange or clearinghouse it 's basically a bulletin board with some light contract services and third party escrow services    i 'd guess that many of the companies on their hot list explicitly prohibit the sale of their non public shares

the portfolio described in that post has a blend of small slices of vanguard sector funds such as vanguard pacific stock index   and the theory is that rebalancing across them will give you a good risk return tradeoff   caveat i have n't read the book only the post you link to similar etfs are available from vanguard ishares and state street   if you want to replicate the exactly pick from them   if you have questions about how to match specific funds in australia just ask another question   so i think you could match it fairly exactly if you wanted to however i think trying to exactly replicate the gone portfolio in australia would not be a good move for most people for a few reasons brokerage and management fees are generally higher in australia smaller market so dividing your investment across ten different securities and rebalancing is going to be somewhat more expensive if you have a middle class sized portfolio of somewhere in the tens of thousands to low millions of dollars you 're cutting it into fairly small slices to manually allocate 5 to various sectors   to keep brokerage costs low you probably want to buy each etf only once every one two years or so   you also need to keep track of the tax consequences of each of them if you are earning and spending australian dollars and looking at the portfolio in australian dollars a lot of those assets are going to move together as the australian dollar moves regardless of changes in the underlying assets   so there is effectively less diversification than you would have in the us the post does n't mention the 's approach to tax   i expect they do consider it but it 's not going to be directly applicable to australia if you are more interested in implementing the general approach of rather than the specific details what i would recommend is the vanguard and superannuation diversified funds have a very similar internal split to the with a mix of local first world and emerging market shares bonds and property trusts   this is pretty much fire and forget contribute every month and they will take care of rebalancing spreading across asset classes and tax calculations   by my calculations the cost is very similar the diversification is very similar and it 's much easier the only thing they do n't generally cover is a precious metals allocation and if you want that just put 5 of your money into the asx gold etf or something similar

customers also have different needs and the more extreme the need the more likely they 're going to rate you so even if you completely fulfill a customer 's need unless it was an extreme need or they were in a predefined emotional state you 're not likely to get a review   as an example we used to actually fix things at our radio shack with and such in store a few people would give us feedback about that we were also allowed leeway on what we could take for returns receipt 30 day limit etc so if the customer came in and started telling me how our products sucked and they were calling the bbb it 's unlikely they would receive the queen bee treatment they also gave reviews yelp was n't around at the time   in short despite the fact we gave the vast majority of our customers way above par treatment the people most likely to give reviews were self entitled despite what people say about turning customers around from angry to nice this only happened with maybe 1 out of every 5 pissy customers another two would probably be shown to be attempting to scam the store in some manner and a fourth would likely have to be shown the door

the worst offender is the apple logo on iphone cases   i mean do n't get me wrong i actually love apple products but jesus christ why does every case have a hole cut away from the case so people can see the apple logo underneath the case   images beautiful flower back cover case back protector for 4s silver   shop media catalog product   entertainment    s   images soft back cover case for red   storage product images   it does n't make any sense i mean i guess people want to show off the fact that they have an iphone but iphones cost the same as their equivalent android everytime i see one of those cases with the logo cut out i just shake my head    people literally go up and out of their way to make sure they can advertise a company they have no stake in

mission is easily the toughest item on this list to get right and not look like a corporate douchebag especially since office space listening to eight different bosses drone on about mission statements 13 years ago and it really stuck   it seems mission and strategy are somewhat interchangeable and strategy is n't as tainted with either way to me the important point here is clarity of overall vision for the company from the top and communicating that strategy all the way down the chain other points like 1 target 5 expectations and 8 future fall out of that if it 's done right   and plastering some branded version of that strategy on a bunch of trinkets is definitely not right

unless i am missing something subtle nothing happens to the buyer suppose alice wants to sell short 1000 shares of xyz at $ 5   she borrows the shares from bob and sells them to charlie   now charlie actually owns the shares they are in his account if the stock later goes up to $ 10 charlie is happy he could sell the shares he now owns and make a $ 5000 profit alice still has the $ 5000 she received from her short sale and she owes 1000 shares to bob   so she 's effectively $ 5000 in debt   if bob calls in the loan she 'll have to try to come up with another $ 5000 to buy 1000 shares at $ 10 on the open market    if she ca n't well that 's between her and bob   maybe she goes bankrupt and bob has to write off a loss    but none of this has any effect on charlie   he got the shares he paid for and nobody 's going to take them away from him   he has no reason to care where they came from or what sort of complicated transactions brought them into alice 's possession   she had them and she sold them to him and that 's the end of the story as far as he 's concerned

every car model type has a know interval when things need maintenance or replacement this info comes mainly from the manufacturer and the rental companies use these info to determine how long and at what rate a car should be rented i mean in total not rented to an individual this is easiest calculated with a long term rental 3 or 4 years time leasing business but is also used for short term rental   there is a point in time were a car gets to have more maintenance and replacements then before the rental company will always try to sell the car just before big replacements or maintenance are necessary of course your local mechanic can also now when those big events need to take place so he can know what to expect the next i 'm talking about foreseen replacements and maintenance like every x km replace drive belt replace oil i 'm not referring to the these latter are the risk the rental companies take during the rental period

i think your understanding is correct as far as you describe but you do n't mention a critical detail to me   you also imply some penalty details for early withdrawal cancellation but you do n't state those terms in detail where and when is the interest paid   does it go into the same cd for compounding   does it get paid to another account   the description does say that it is priced at par so we at least know that the interest does n't have to be stuck unpaid within the cd until maturity but it also means you do n't necessarily get compounding at the cd rate without knowing where the interest goes and if it 's available for compounding be careful in how you compare it to other cds savings accounts   a structure might be a better option even at a lower apy

not minutes but hours   the ex dividend date is the deadline for acquiring a stock to receive a dividend if you hold a stock at the beginning of this day you will receive the dividend so you could buy a stock right at the end of the day on the day before the ex dividend date and sell it the next day on the ex dividend date and you would get your dividend see this page from the sec for more information   the problem with this strategy however is that the value of the stock typically drops by the same amount as the dividend on that day if you take a look at the historical price of the stock you are interested in you 'll see this of course it makes sense why a seller knows that selling before   the date results in a loss of the dividend so they want a higher price to compensate likewise a buyer on or after the date knows that the dividend is already gone so they want to pay a lower price

you 'll likely see several more scary market events before your autumn years everyone has an opinion on this so here is mine if you are constrained to picking canned mutual fund products then i would target something with decent yield for two points the third is to keep some in cash for an event    i would say at this point so invest 65 and have some liquidity for an opportunity   because the next crisis is right around the corner but stay invested

the main reason for an ubi is to provide atleast some sort of income since a lot of people are projected to be out of a job due to automation hence that source of income for the large part will go to the basic needs first like housing power food   atleast that 's what i suspect   so if a landlord knows people can afford atleast x amount for housing why would they offer it any cheaper
