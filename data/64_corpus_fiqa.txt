it would be unusual but it is possible that the expenses could be very high compared to your income the irs in pub 529 explains the deduction you can deduct only unreimbursed employee expenses that are paid or incurred during your tax year for carrying on your trade or business of being an employee and ordinary and necessary an expense is ordinary if it is common and accepted in your trade    business or profession an expense is necessary if it is appropriate    and helpful to your business an expense does n't have to be required    to be considered necessary the next part lists examples i have cut the list down to highlight ones that could be large you may be able to deduct the following items as unreimbursed employee    expenses damages paid to a former employer for breach of an employment contract job search expenses in your present occupation legal fees related to your job licenses and regulatory fees malpractice insurance premiums research expenses of a college professor rural mail carriers vehicle expenses tools and supplies used in your work work clothes and uniforms if required and not suitable for everyday use work related education if the term of employment was only part of the year one or more of the these could dwarf your income for the year before deducting something that large be sure you can document it i believe the irs computers would flag the return and i would n't be surprised if they ask for additional proof

it is possible to consolidate mortgages with nationwide in some circumstances quote from their website it is possible to consolidate different mortgages and other debts such as personal loans and credit cards however it does depend on your individual circumstances including the exact type of loans you want to consolidate and whether you are still in a special deal period i personally would be amazed if you could n't get them all in one mortgage without changing provider but i would n't be at all surprised if they forced you to have this one mortgage as a new mortgage rather than adding balances to an existing one my reasoning is as follows coming at it from a different angle whatever there was that required your further borrowing to be in new mortgages rather than added to your existing mortgage will also preclude your multiple mortgages being added to one of your existing mortgages

the standard low risk gain very short term parking spot these days tends to be a money market account   however you have only mentioned stock for good balance your portfolio should consider the bond market too consider adding a bond index fund to diversify the basic mix taking up much of that 40 this will also help stabilize your risk since bonds tend to move opposite stocks just because everyone else is also using them as the main alternative though there are theoretical arguments why this should be so eventually you may want to add a small amount of reit fund to be mix but that 's back on the higher risk side by the way trying to guess when the next correction will occur is usually not a winning strategy guesses tend to go wrong as often as they go right even for pros rather than attempting to time the market pick a strategic mix of investments and rebalance periodically to maintain those ratios there has been debate here about dollar cost averaging see other answers but that idea may argue for investing and rebalancing in more small chunks rather than a few large ones i generally actively rebalance once a year or so and between those times let the balance suggest which fund(s new money should go into minimal effort and it has worked quite well enough

first i 'm not a cpa or international tax accountant my entire understanding of the french tax system is entirely from what i 've read in places like the wsj wapo etc    however my understanding is that french tax law works something like this let 's say france has a tax rate of 35 first it must be assessed where the controlling entity is in this case if the majority of production and labor or if the corporation is primarily based in france it would proceed as follows taxes are initially paid based on transfer pricing to the original local entity this avoids double taxation so in the example above you would pay 10 to india on the $ in profits $ 300,000 you would then reduce the 35 french tax rate by the 10 already paid this means you would pay an additional 25 to france $ 750,000 the premise is that you have an effective minimum tax threshold for being in france in the case above companies like ge would have to pay the difference this does n't get into tax breaks shelters on previously recorded losses etc    again i am not sure on this is my basic understanding and am by no means a tax accountant lawyer etc from what i understand however this has n't necessarily been a good thing for france either california is likely a similar case study with the return requirement the fact is the world is very global nowadays its easier and cheaper for the companies to just leave instead of being forced to pay higher taxes   imo germany hit it right on the head low corporate tax rates with high personal tax rates this maintains a very business friendly environment business move there because of the skilled labor and low corporate taxes but they effectively pass the burden on to individuals who also benefit from the pro business environment you 'd be hard pressed to find an economist that does n't think germany 's economy has been very strong over the past decade very good soros speech that was recently posted about his analysis of the euro and germany 's unfair benefits but that 's a whole different gear    what i find the issue to be is the whole concept is complex enough that 's difficult to explain to the average person with a 2 second attention span that 's why i like writing posts like this to try to help people understand how finance and businesses operate behind the scenes

the location that you are purchasing from is not really relevant   if you use either a visa or mastercard to make a payment in a foreign currency of any kind then your payment will automatically use visa mastercard 's fx platform whilst fees can vary between issuers the fee is generally fixed at 2.5 there are occasionally credit card issuers who have special deals to remove these fees but they tend to come and go and availability will depend on your country of residence the only real way to avoid the fee is to get access to a debit or credit card denominated in the currency you wish to use for your purchase   this is often achievable for usd or eur but much harder for smaller currencies   you would have to try contacting a bank in that country to see if they would open an account for you or attempting to purchase a pre paid credit card online

it would help if we had numbers to walk you through the analysis current balance rate remaining term and the new mortgage details   to echo and elaborate on part of ben 's response the most important thing is to not confuse cash flow with savings if you have 15 years to go and refinance to 30 years at the rate rate your payment drops by 1/3 yet your rate is identical in this example   the correct method is to take the new rate plug it into a mortgage calculator or spreadsheet using the remaining months on the current mortgage and see the change in payment this savings is what you should divide into closing costs to calculate the breakeven it 's up to you whether to adjust your payments to keep the term the same after you close   with respect to keshlam rules of thumb often fail there are mortgages that build the closing costs into the rate not the amount loaned the rate this means that as rates dropped moving from 5.25 to 5 made sense even though with closing costs there were 4.5 mortgages out there because rates were still falling and i finally moved to a 3.5 loan at the time i was serial refinancing the bank said i could return to them after a year if rates were still lower in my opinion we are at a bottom and the biggest question you need to answer is whether you 'll remain in the house past your own breakeven time last with personal finance focusing on personal the analysis should n't ignore the rest of your balance sheet say you are paying $ with 15 years to go your budget is tight enough that you 've chosen not to deposit to your 401(k assuming you are in the us or country with pretax retirement account options in this case holding rates constant a shift to 30 years frees up about $ 500/mo in a matched 401(k your $ is doubled to $ 12k year   of course if the money would just go in the market unmatched members here would correctly me for suggesting a dangerous game in effect borrowing via mortgage to invest in the market the matched funds however are tough to argue against

if a company earns $ 1 million in net profit let 's say all cash which is not entirely realistic it can do one of three things with it on the balance sheet profits that have not been distributed show up as retained earnings   when dividends are paid retained earnings and cash are reduced none of the other options change the fact that it is still profit they all just affect the balance sheet not the income statement note that when a company issues dividends it reduces its per share value since cash is leaving the door with nothing in return    in apple 's case since a significant amount of its profit was earned in other countries where it was not taxed by the us it would pay a significant amount in us corporate tax by bringing it back to the us by investing it or paying dividends they are betting that at some point the us will change the rules to make it more favorable to repatriate the money and reduce their tax significantly

that of arbitrage free pricing sounds a bit like the relative vs. fundamental approaches to asset pricing that cochrane outlines in his text asset pricing also makes this distinction with regard to term structure models in volatility and    on one extreme you have capm style models in which asset prices are completely determined by investors risk preferences on the other extreme you would have something like a sabr libor market model where you take everything up to and including the volatility surface as given    what 's interesting to me is the way in which these different classes of models get used in various parts of the financial industry so buy side firms tend to rely a lot more on equilibrium style models since they ultimately care about things like how the equity risk premium or the bond risk premium affect asset prices in contrast derivatives quants working at a big sell side bank who are pricing exotics do n't care about what the fundamental value of their underlying assets is they just take that as given and price the exotic accordingly

when your debt is forgiven you have to consider the amount written off as an ordinary income item with the exclusion of the debt originated from the purchase of primary home if you 're trying to write the debt off from your taxes then it wo n't work even if you can expense the debt forgiveness you will incur tax liability on your personal taxes side and in addition you 'll be out of cash in your business so basically you 'll end up paying it with after tax money exactly the thing you 're trying to avoid in addition you 're dealing with related persons here which means that the loss deduction might not be allowed depends on the actual details of the transaction so you might actually end up paying more taxes with this scheme that just paying off the loan directly if your business pays taxes separately from your person a loss on the sale or exchange of property between related persons is    not deductible this applies to both direct and indirect transactions    but not to distributions of property from a corporation in a complete    liquidation for the list of related persons see related persons    next

the obligation is contractual so you need to read the contract to answer your question however since you paid for the service provided i see no way they can force you buy any other service from them they can not file your tax returns without your explicit consent on a form dedicated to that dated and having the numbers matching the return filed not something you can sign before the actual return is ready worst case they can claim you owe them more money but since you paid for the services provided i ca n't see how they can have that stand in court as well bottom line even if the contract has such an obligation i can not see how it can be enforced as to the mistake they noted i would n't rely on h&r block advice in any matter very likely the person you were talking to was not even licensed to provide tax advice you 're lucky if the person has passed exams in california they 're legally required but i seriously doubt their clerks are eas or cpas the only designations other than a lawyer legally allowed to provide tax advice tax preparers included are only allowed to provide advice pertaining to the preparation of the tax return they 're currently engaged to prepare claiming income is sourced or not sourced in ny is borderline imho if they got it wrong and to me it sounds as they did you can sue them for damages if your situation is tricky and it is too late to get an appointment with a proper adviser file an extension form 4868 and deal with it after the april busy season

i took a second mortgage when i moved house because i had a long term fixed rate mortgage that would have incurred punitive fees if i had cancelled it rather than doing that i took a second mortgage over the same term for the difference as my second mortgage was with the same lender they still had first charge on the property this means that in the event of default they have first call on the property to recoup their losses so the interest rate was not higher actually it was slightly less than my first mortgage my case is not that usual normally a second mortgage is with a separate provider that takes a second charge on the property the interest rates are normally higher as a result as there is more chance that the lender will not recoup their money in case of a default as the first charge has priority the second mortgage may still be cheaper than an unsecured loan as the second charge provides some collateral this might make it attractive if a sudden expense needs to be covered

if you are trading cfds which are usually traded on margin you will usually be charged an overnight financing fee for long positions held overnight and you will receive an overnight financing credit for short positions held overnight most cfd brokers will have their overnight financing rates set at + or 2.5 or 3 from the country 's official interest rates so if your country 's official interest rate is 5 and your broker uses + or 2.5 you will get a 2.5 credit for any short positions held overnight and pay 7.5 fee for any long positions held overnight in australia the official interest rate is 2.5 so i get 0 for short positions and pay 5 for long positions held overnight if you are looking to hold positions open long term especially long positions you might think twice before using cfds to trade as you may end up paying quite a bit in interest over a long period of time these financing fees are charged because you are borrowing the funds to open your positions if you buy shares directly you would not be charged such overnight financing fees

hitting the 25 marginal rate does not mean all of your earnings are taxed at 25 only those that exceed the top of the 15 bracket you can deduct any expenses for upgrading or repairing your apartments those are subtracted from the earnings before tax is calculated as income so you will probably stay in a lower marginal rate property tax will hit you annually and capital gains tax will hit you when you sell them at the end if you already have experience with this business in your home country then this sounds like a good option for you the only caution that i would give you is to find an accountant to help you with your taxes and pay for a consultation before you get started so that you know what to track that will help him her minimize your tax bill

unfortunately not directly   for iras and hsas we have an annual maximum contribution limit what you can do which does n't initially seed it is to put the money aside in a savings account that you want to contribute to your hsa or ira and then put it in the ira or hsa when the timing is right for you   the key here though is that the contribution can not exceed the maximum limit for the year another way around this which really is n't because it just means that you 'll have a new higher limit is to become self employed see this from the irs about contribute as much as 25 of your net earnings from self employment    not including contributions for yourself up to $ for 2013    $ for 2014 still none of these methods are pre an account as the maximum contribution limit is never exceeded

i do n't know much about new zealand but here are just some general thoughts on things to consider the big difference between buying a house and investing in stocks or the like is that it is fairly easy to invest in a diversified array of stocks via a mutual fund but if you buy a house you are investing in a single piece of property so everything depends on what happens with that specific property   this in itself is a reason many people do n't invest in real estate   shares of a given company or mutual fund are fungible if you buy into a mutual fund you know you 're getting the same thing everyone else in the fund is getting   but every piece of real estate is unique so figuring out how much a property is worth is less of an exact science   also buying real estate means you have to maintain it and manage it or pay someone else to do so   it 's a lot more work to accurately assess the income potential of a property and then maintain and manage the property over years than it is to just buy some stocks and hold them    another difficulty is if and when you do decide to sell the property doing so again involves work   with stocks you can pretty much sell them whenever you want although you may take a loss   with a house you have to find someone willing to buy it which can take time so a big factor to consider is the amount of effort you 're prepared to put into your investment   you mention that your parents could manage the property for you but presumably you will still have to pay for maintenance and do some managing work yourself at least discussing things with them and making decisions   also if you own the property for a long time your parents will eventually become too old to take care of it at which point you 'll have to rethink the management aspect so that 's sort of the psychological side of things   as for the financial you do n't mention selling the house at any point   if you never sell it the only gain you get from it is the rent it brings in   so the main factor to consider when deciding whether to buy it as a rental is how much you can rent it for   this is going to be largely determined by where it is located so from the perspective of making an investment the big question which you do n't address in the info you provided is how much can you rent this house for and how much will you be able to rent it for in the future   there is no way to know this for sure and the only way to get even a rough sense of it is to talk with someone who knows the local real estate market well e.g. a broker appraiser or landlord   if the property is in an up and coming area i.e. more people are going to move there in the future rents could skyrocket if it 's in a rents could remain stagnant indefinitely basically if you 're going to buy a piece of real estate as a long term investment you need to know a lot about that property in order to make any kind of comparison with another investment vehicle like a mutual fund   if you already live in the area you may know some things already like how much you might be able to rent it for   even so though you should try to get some advice from trustworthy people who know the local real estate situation

if you want to offset current 2016 income only deductible contribution to a traditional ira does that you can make nondeductible contributions to a trad ira and there are cases where that makes sense for the future and cases where it does n't but it does n't give you a deduction now similarly a roth ira has possible advantages and disadvantages but it does not have a deduction now currently he maximum is $ 5500 per person $ 6500 if over age 50 but you are n't which with two accounts barely covers your $ 10k   to be eligible to make this deductible traditional contribution you must   have earned income employment or self employment but not the distribution from another ira at least the amount you want to contribute not have combined income specifically magi modified adjusted gross income exceeding the phaseout limit starts at $ 96,000 for married joint if you were covered during the year either you or your spouse by an employer retirement plan look at box 13 on your w-2 's with whom pretty much any bank brokerage or mutual fund family can handle iras to be technical the bank 's holding company will have an investment arm to you it will usually look like one operation with one name and logo one office one customer service department one website etc but the investment part must be legally separate from the insured banking part so you may notice a different name on your legal and tax forms if you are with the custodian of the inherited ira you already have you might just stay with them they may not need as much paperwork you do n't need to meet and get comfortable with new people you do n't need to learn a new website but if they sold you an annuity at your age as opposed to you inheriting an already ira i 'd want a lot of details before trusting they are acting in your best interests most annuities sold to ira holders are poor deals in what since you want only moderate risk at least to start and also since you are starting with a relatively small amount where minimum investments expenses and fees can make more of an impact on your results i would go with one or a few broad (= lower risk index (= lower cost fund(s every major fund also offers at least a few balanced funds which give you a mixture of stocks and bonds and sometimes some alternatives in one fund   remember this is not committing you forever any reasonable custodian will allow you to move or spread to more adventurous but not wild and crazy investments which may be better for you in future years when you have some more money in the account and some more time to ponder your goals and options and comfort level

as i understand it us federal gift tax does n't kick in at all until one person gives more than about $ 14,000 in a single year so a couple can give someone $ 28,000 if you want to give more than that in a lump sum while avoiding gift tax one workaround is to structure it as an intra family loan basically you write and formally register a loan for the amount then gift them with up to the limit for them to pay off that loan the irs requires that you charge interest on this loan but the rates are pretty minimal and of course you can incorporate that in the gift the downside is that the interest income you 're required to take is taxable but that 's a small sum on the other hand if the loan is a mortgage against real property and properly filed as such the interest paid may be deductable for the person you 're giving the money to doing this properly requires a tax accountant or lawyer who has a clue about the right legalese to make it work however there are starting to be some services which specialize in this doing it for a fixed fee i used one of those recently which is why i 'm somewhat familiar with this process they made it about as much of a fill out the forms process as they could but it still took a few weeks for me to figure out which options were best for my needs

i tend to agree with rocky 's answer   however it sounds like you want to look at this from the numbers side of things   so let 's consider some numbers i 'm assuming you have the money to buy the new car available as cash in hand and that if you do n't buy the car you 'll invest it reasonably   so if you buy the new car today you 're $ 17 k out of pocket   let 's look at some scenarios and compare   assuming if you buy the new car today then after 1 year you 'll have if you keep the old car after 1 year you get after 2 years you have and after 3 years you 're at or in other words nothing depletes the value of your assets faster than buying the new car after 1 year you 've essentially lost $ 5 k to depreciation     however over the short term the immediate cost of the tires combined with the continued depreciation of the old car do reduce your purchasing power somewhat you wo n't be able to muster $ 25 k towards a new car without chipping in a bit of extra cash and inflation will tend to drive the cost of the new car up as time goes on   so the relative gap between the value of your assets and the cost of the new car tends to increase though it stays well below the $ 5k that you lose to depreciation if you buy the new car immediately   which is something that you could potentially spin to support whichever side you prefer i suppose though note that i 've made some fairly pessimistic assumptions   in particular the current u.s. inflation rate is under 1 and a new car may depreciate by as much as 25 in the first year while older cars may depreciate by less than the 8 assumed   and i selected the cheapest new car price cited and did n't credit the tires with adding any value to your old car   each of those aspects tends to make continuing to drive the older car a better option than buying the new one

first to mention one thing better analysis calls for analyzing a range of outcomes not just one assigning a probability on each and comparing the expected values then the choice based on risk tolerance but now just look at the outcome or scenario of 3 and time frame of 2 days let 's assume your investable capital is exactly $ 1000 multiply everything by 5 for $ 5,000 etc a. buy stock the value goes to 103 your investment goes to $ net return is $ 30 minus let 's say $ 20 commission you should compare these between brokers i use one that charges 9.99 plus a trivial government fee b. buy an call option at 100 for $ 0.40 per share with an expiration 30 days away december 23 this is a more complicated to evaluate this you need to estimate the movement of the value of a 100 call $ 0 in and out of the money 30 days remaining to the value of a 100 call $ 3 in the money 28 days remaining that movement will vary based on the volatility of the underlying stock an advanced topic but there are techniques to estimate that which become simple to use after you get the hang of it at any rate let 's say that the expected movement of the option price in this scenario is from $ 0.40 to $ 3.20 since you bought 2500 share options for $ 1000 the gain would be 2500 times 2.8 = 7000 c. buy an call option at 102 for $ per share with an expiration 30 days away december 23 to evaluate this you need to estimate the movement of the value of a 102 call $ 2 out of the money 30 days remaining to the value of a 102 call $ 1 in the money 28 days remaining that movement will vary based on the volatility of the underlying stock an advanced topic but there are techniques to estimate that which become simple to use after you get the hang of it at any rate let 's say that the expected movement of the option price in this scenario is from $ to $ 1.50 since you bought 8000 share options for $ 1000 the gain would be 8000 times = d. same thing but starting with a 98 call e. same thing but starting with a 101 call expiring 60 days out f. etc other option choices again getting the numbers right for the above is an advanced topic one reason why brokerages warn you that options are risky if you do your math wrong you can lose even doing that math right with a bad outcome loses anyway you need to score as many options as needed to find the optimal point but back to the first paragraph you should then run the whole analysis on a 2 gain or 5 or 5 in 4 days instead of 2 days do as many as are fruitful assess then pull the trigger and buy it try these techniques in simulation before diving in please one last point you do n't have to understand how to evaluate projected option price movements if you have software that   does that for you i 'll on that process except to mention it get the general idea edit p.s. i forgot to mention that brokers need love for handling options too check those commission rates in your analysis as well

your funds are in a retirement account   withdrawals from your ira will be penalized if you withdraw before you turn 59.5 years old and you appear to be decades away from that age the general advice i would give you is to pick a target year fund that targets the year you turn 59.5   the stock market is more volatile but its average gains will protect you from inflation just eating your funds   bonds are in counterpoint to your stocks more stable and protecting you from the chance that stocks dip right before you want to withdraw target year funds start with higher amounts of stock and gradually rebalance towards bonds over time   thus you take your market risks earlier while you can benefit from the market 's gains and then have stability when you actually would want to retire and depend on the savings

i do this often with shares that i own mostly as a learning experience building exercise since i do n't own enough individual stocks to make me rich and do n't risk enough to make me broke suppose i own 1,000 shares of x.   i do n't expect my shares to go down but i want to be compensated in case they do go down   sure i could put in a stop loss order but another option is to sell a call above where the stock is now out of the money    so i get the premium regardless of what happens   from there three things can happen so a covered call essentially lets you give up some upside for some compensation against downward moves   mathematically it 's roughly equivalent to selling a put option you make a little money from the premium if the stock goes up but can lose a lot if the stock plummets so you would sell call options if

being underwater a little is not all that scary but those who talk of being underwater are typically underwater by quite a lot   the amount of money they owe is large compared to their yearly income consider a metaphor   i put you in a hole   its only 1 foot deep   you 're not too concerned   if you want to leave you can step out of it   now we look at a deeper hole 3 feet   now you 're still not too concerned   you ca n't just walk out but if you need to get out you can wiggle your way up   6 feet   now you start getting nervous   climbing out is getting trickier and trickier   you may not be able to move in response to a changing around you because you 're stuck in a hole now make the hole 10 feet   now you ca n't reach the edges   now you 're in trouble   you have lost all mobility   you ca n't get out under your own power   now if something bad happens such as losing your job or a sudden health issue you ca n't move around to solve the problem this is the issue that arise from underwater mortgages   say you lose your job because the job market in your area dried up think detroit in the big auto manufacturer crash   you need to move   you are legally to a lender for your existing underwater house by more than you can sell it for   you need to pay for the privilege to sell it   you still owe payments on it so if you just buy a new house or rent in the new state you 're paying for twice as much property   you ca n't just shuffle the from your old house to your new house because the new lender has no interest in giving a loan for more than the value of the new home the only options you have to play with is renting the old house which many underwater families did or bankrupcy   if the area you were in is depressed you may not be able to rent the house for enough to cover your mortgage   this is the fear of being underwater   you have a piece of paper which claims some lender can take money from you that you may or may not have and that the us government will allow them to take your assets if need be to settle the score if you 're underwater by a few thousand it 's typically not a big deal   if you 're underwater by 80 or 90 thousand dollars which some people were that 's a lot of money to be for without the assets to recover them if you subscribe to the realtor story that the market will recover all you have to do is scrape by holding on until the market rises again   however those who are underwater recognize that the reason much of this occurred is that we entered a bubble because realtors kept saying the market could only go up   fool me once

long term capital gains are taxed at 15 this year so the most you stand to save is $ 150 i would n't sell anything at a loss just to offset that unless you planned on selling anyways   a few reasons the long term capital gains rate will go up to 20 next year so your losses will be worth more next year than this year short term capital gains rates will go up next year as well so again better off saving your losses for next year you must use capital losses to offset capital gains if you have them but if you do n't have any capital gains you can use capital losses to offset ordinary income up to a limit $ 3,000 a year iirc   so if you just bite the bullet and pay the 15 on your gains this year you could use your losses to offset your likely higher rate ordinary income next year fyi complete chart for capital gains tax rates is here i also posted another answer about capital gains to this question a while back that might be useful

i think you should evaluate the value of these so called penny auction websites very carefully   going to a random site .com which is british with uk prices but it works just the same with us prices they claim that someone has bought an ipod touch 64 gb for £ it is £ directly from apple sold for £ means there were bids i 'd have to log in to their site to find the cost of a bid for packages but you can multiply the cost of a single bid by add another £ and you 'll know what all bidders trying to receive this item paid i 'll bet the total is substantially more than £   people taking part in these scams obviously convince themselves that they are the clever ones who will get an item cheaply apart from the possibility that a single bidder can easily make more bids than the value of the item if you think you are more clever than everyone else you are kidding yourself if you think you are indeed more clever than everyone else go ahead and donate your money to these companies   the packages are most likely designed to give you the false impression that you get some value for money years ago when i checked a single bid was £ 1 but in bigger packages the bids would cost say 50 pence they also want many bidders to make sure the number of bids will be high although there is nothing other than the website 's honesty that prevents them from automatically adding bids if an item would otherwise sell too cheap   just to clarify these are not auction sites in an auction the highest bidder pays the price they bid usually plus some commission on ebay the commission is paid by the seller and gets the goods while everyone else keeps their money in this auction every bid costs money and by increasing the bid by one penny each time they make sure there are usually thousands of bids they also offer the products at a reduced price if you do n't win the auction the reduced price is substantially higher than buying from the manufacturer or any reputable retailer directly

do you know if you were approached by a carrier or a tower vendor   edit addendum   as someone in the telecommunications industry i will say that you should not lease to a vendor who will the space to the phone companies for a profit   depending on the availability of space the population of the area and the value of the location and the amount and size of hardware to be installed the rental pricing can vary wildly   a cell site on a choice tall building in chicago nyc boston la etc can go for over $ 25000 per year more in the case of rental of inside equipment room   on the other hand renting space on a church in the middle of a low population rural town with the equipment installed in a at ground level may only net around $ 1500 per month   a small cell site which is actually small enough to put on a lamp post or utility pole can go for around $ 250 750 per month   a turf contractor tower vendor actually leasing a chunk of land to build a structure whose space will be leased out to telecoms should be expected to pay between $ 2500 and 8000 per month depending on the value of your site   this value is determined by land form details like nearby tall forests can the tower see over the tree line terrain and need local population tourist traveler numbers   carriers prefer to lease from vendors rather than building their own structures but roof top sites are a different story   carriers are generally more than happy to work with you to lease a portion of your tall building 's roof   fyi   if they offer to compensate you for the electrical requirements if they can not get their own meter in do n't worry   a cell site uses less than 1000 watts which translates to about $ .10 15 per hour in most locations

did it show just your address or was your name on it as well    you did n't share how long you 've lived at the address either so it makes me wonder whether a former tenant is the one who filed that paperwork   it 's also possible that someone used your address when making a filing   whether that was deliberate or accidental is hard to discern as is their intent if it was intentional it could be accidental someone picked ca for california when they meant to pick co for colorado or ct for connecticut these things do happen   it ca n't make you feel any better about the situation though you should be able to go online to the california secretary of state 's website here and look up everything filed by the llc with the state   that will show who the founders were and everything else that is a matter of public record on the llc   at the very least you can obtain the registered agent 's name and address for the llc which you can then use to contact them and ask why your address is listed as the llc 's business address once you have that info you can then contact the secretary of state and tell them it is n't you so they can do whatever is necessary to correct this this does n't sound like a difficult matter to clear up but it 's important to do your homework first and gather as much information as you can before you call the state   answering i do n't know wo n't get you very far with them compared to having the best answers you can about where the mistake started i hope this helps good luck

this may be relevant it suggests that irs is lenient with the attachment of the form with 1040 to paraphrase the ruling involved a taxpayer who timely filed the election with the irs within 30 days of the property transfer but who did not attach a copy of the election to his or her form 1040 for the year of the transfer   fortunately for the taxpayer in question the ruling indicated that the submission of the election to the irs within 30 days of the property transfer fulfilled the requirements for a valid election and the failure to attach the copy to the tax return did not affect the validity of the election   the irs requested that the taxpayer forward a copy of the election to the irs to be associated with the processing of the tax return see more at if someone wants to the irs ruling and this is the article where i saw the above referenced

there can be the question of what objective do you have for buying the stock if you want an income stream then high yield stocks may be a way to get dividends without having additional transactions to sell shares while others may want capital appreciation and are willing to go without dividends to get this you do realize that both pfizer and are companies that the total stock value is over $ 100 billion yes thus neither is what i 'd see as a growth stock as these are giant companies that would require rather large sales to drive earnings growth though it may be interesting to see what kind of growth is expected for these companies in looking at current dividends one is paying 3 and the other 5 so i 'm not sure either would be what i 'd see as high yield reits would be more likely to have high dividends given their structure if you want something to research a bit more

if you are just starting out learning to code then really just pick a language you 'll learn some principles that can be transfered to other languages and with experience that becomes easier every time    python is easy great for beginners since it is free has a great community and support online and is pretty well suited for data analysis there are several books for using python for finance google that phrase python is also quite popular for web development which might be another way to learn to code it will require learning html and sql databases besides python but even so might be more accessible rather than jumping into data analysis while learning how to code depends on the person though

if they own the old house outright they can mortgage it to you in many jurisdictions this you of the obligation to chase for payment and of any worry that you wo n't get paid because a transfer of ownership to the new owner can not be registered until any charge against a property ie a mortgage has been discharged the cost of to your friends of setting up the mortgage will be less than the interest they are offering you and you will both have peace of mind even if the sale of the old house falls through you will still be its mortgagee and still assured of repayment on any future sale or even inheritance complications arise if the first property is mortgaged although second mortgages are possible and rank behind first mortgages in priority of repayment the first mortgagee generally has a veto on the creation of second mortgages

if your father is still able to make financial decisions and sign contracts i see a better option have your father borrow against his equity to finance the renovation   example the house is worth 400 now he can borrow 100 against that he spends it on the addition making the house worth 500 with the same 400 of equity as before in some cases spending 100 might add 150 to the house value but let 's assume here the increase is just what was spent when he dies the mortgage has to be repaid if he has no other money that the two of you would otherwise split then the mortgage has to be repaid by the two of you putting in cash so you pay your brother 250 half the new total value of the house but he gives 50 of that to the bank for the mortgage you also give 50 of your own money to the bank for the mortgage net result your brother has 200 the same as if he had inherited half the house and you have a 500 house after paying out 300 your gain is also the same as if the house was now if the house went up 150 by spending 100 or went up 60 by spending 100 you and your brother would also be sharing this profit or loss if you do n't want that to happen you will need a different agreement the advantage of the approach i 'm suggesting is you just need one appraisal after your father dies   not accounted for in this is that you lived without paying rent in your father 's house for some time and that you worked without being paid as a caregiver to your father for that time some families might think those two things balanced others might feel you need to be compensated for caring for him and others that you need to compensate the others for your benefit of living in the large house be sure to discuss this with your brother so that you agree in advance whether a plan is fair or not

i 'm the contrarian in the crowd i think credit scores and debt are the closest thing to evil you 're in good company the absence of a credit score simply means the agencies have insufficient data in their behavioral model to determine how profitable your business would be to the bank the higher your score the more likely the bank is to make a profit from your loan   imho you 're better off building up cash and investment reserves than a credit history with sufficient reserves   you will be able to shop around for a bank that will give you a good rate if you ever do need a loan   you 'll be surprised at how quickly you get in a position where you do n't need a loan if you save and invest wisely i used to have a high credit score   and i was miserable about it because there were always bills due i gave up debt 14 years ago paid the last debt 7 years ago and have never been happier raising kids without debt or credit score is much more fun than with debt

assuming you are in the us and are an average joe the answer to your question is no investment costs do not reduce your taxable income for the year you make the investment they do factor in to the cost basis of your investment and so will affect your taxes in the year you sell the investment if you want to reduce your taxable income you could contribute the $ 5000 to a traditional ira or 401k assuming you qualify depending on where the account is held you may then be able to use that $ 5k to purchase stock in the company you are interested in the stock would be held in your ira or 401k account and would be subject to more restrictions than a normal brokerage account

one reason why you can get a better rate with a cd compared to a regular savings account is that they lock you into that account for the period of the cd you can get out of the cd early but you will forfeit some of the interest you also generally ca n't move a portion of the money out of the cd you have to pull it all out and then start a new cd with the portion you do n't spend you have to check the terms and conditions for that particular cd   some people use them to hold their emergency fund this is the 3 6 months of expenses you set aside in case of a major problem such as a medical emergency or a job loss the rate is better than the regular savings account so it can come closer to inflation the goal is preservation of capital not investing for the future so if you understand the risks and the cd is backed with the same guarantees as the savings account then it is a viable way to store some or all of the emergency fund

buy and hope is a common investment strategy it 's also one that will keep you poor instead of thinking about saving money to put against a credit card or line of credit using your own job and hard earned dollars why not use someone else 's money if you have enough of a down payment for a property of your own consider a duplex or where you live in one of the units since you will be living there you only need 5 down as opposed to 20 down if you do not live there this arrangement gives you a place to live while you have other people paying your mortgage and other debts if done properly you can find a place that is cash flow positive so you basically live rent free   this all assumes you have a down payment and a bank that will work with you your best bet is to discuss your situation with a mortgage broker they know all the rules and which banks have the best deal for you a mortgage broker works on your behalf and is paid by the lending institution not you there are various caveats with this strategy and they all revolve around knowing what to do and how to execute the plan i suggest googling robert kiyosaki and reading rich dad poor dad before taking this journey he offers a number of free and paid seminars that teach people how to purchase real estate and make it pay i have taken the free evening seminar and the $ 500 weekend seminar on how to purchase properties and make money with them note that i have no affiliation with kiyosaki and i do find his methods to work

since these indices only try to follow vix and do n't have the underlying constituents as the constituents do n't really exist in most meaningful senses they will always deviate from the exact numbers but should follow the general pattern you 're right however in stating that the graphs that you have presented are substantially different and look like the indices other than vix are always decreasing the problem with this analysis is that the basis of your graphs is different they all start at different dates we can fix this by putting them all on the same graph   this shows that the funds did broadly follow vix over the period 5 years and this also encompasses a time when some of the funds started the funds do decline faster than vix from the beginning of 2012 onward and i had a theory for why so i grabbed a graph for that period my theory was that since volatility had fallen massively after the of the financial crisis there was less money to be made from betting on investing in volatility and so the assets invested in the funds had fallen making them smaller in comparison to their 2011 2012 basis   here we see that the funds are again closely following vix until the beginning of 2016 where they again lower as volatility fell probably again as a result of withdrawals of capital as vix returns fell a tighter graph may show this again as the gap seems to be narrowing as people look to bet on volatility due to recent events so if the funds are basically following vix why has vix been falling consistently over this time increased certainty in the markets and a return to growth or at least lower negative growth in most economies particularly western economies where the majority of market investment occurs and a reduction in the risk of european countries defaulting particularly portugal ireland greece and spain the pigs countries has resulted in lower volatility and a return to market conditions in summary the funds are basically following vix but their values are based on their underlying capital this underlying capital has been falling as returns on volatility have been falling resulting in their diverging from vix whilst broadly following it on the new basis

one topic that i 've been trying to learn more about is the affects of the low interest rates on businesses and the economy from quantitative easing due to the amount of free money corporations have received over the last 5 years there has been a few interesting consequences there are several corporations that have borrowed money at little to no interest with the feds intentions of seeing it go back into the economy however instead corporations have used it to buy back stock which was not necessarily the plan in the first place you could definitely have a unique thesis written about something within that flow of funds if that makes no sense apologies stupid undergrad here

drips come to mind as something that may be worth examining if you take the microsoft example consider what would happen if you bought additional shares each year by re investing the dividends and the stock also went up over the years a combination of capital appreciation in the share price plus the additional shares purchased over time can produce a good income stream over time the key is to consider how long are you contributing how much are you contributing and what end result are you expecting as some companies can have larger dividends if you look at reits for example

but if increasing demand is brought about by increasing spending and wide ranging increased spending appears when many people have money to spend why not just give everyone some money to spend    why tie it to the hourly rate at a job thereby making tons of positions too expensive for employers to justify    seems like a simple allocation of money to everyone no strings attached would stimulate demand nicely

to add to what other have stated i recently just decided to purchase a home over renting some more and i 'll throw in some of my thoughts about my decision to buy i closed a couple of weeks ago note that i live in texas and that i 'm not knowledgeable in real estate other than what i learned from my experiences in the area when i am located it depends on the market and location you have to compare what renting will get you for the money vs what buying will get you for me buying seemed like a better deal overall when just comparing monthly payments this is including insurance and taxes you will need to stay at a house that you buy for at least 5 7 years you first couple years of payments will go almost entirely towards interest it takes a while to build up equity if you can pay more towards a mortgage do it you need to have money in the bank already to close the minimum down payment at least in my area is 3.5 for an fha loan if you put 20 down you do n't need to pay mortgage insurance which is essentially throwing money away you will also have add in closing costs i ended up purchasing a new construction my monthly payment went up from $ 1200 to $ 1600 after taxes insurance etc but the house is bigger newer more energy efficient much closer to my work in a more expensive area and in a market that is expected to go up in value i had all of my closing costs except for the deposit taken care of by the lender and builder so all of my closing costs i paid out of pocket went to the deposit equity or the bank if i decide to move and need to sell then i will get a lot losing some to selling costs and interest of the money i have put in to the house back out of it when i do sell and i have the option to put that money towards another house to sum it all up i 'm not paying a difference in monthly costs because i bought a house i had my closing costs taking care of and just had to pay the deposit which goes to equity i will have to do maintenance myself but i do n't mind fixing what i can fix and i have a builder 's warranties on most things in the house   to really get a good idea of whether you should rent or buy you need to talk to a realtor and compare actual costs it will be more expensive in the short term but should save you money in the long term

i 'd be tempted to pay off the 35k in student loans immediately but if you have to owe money it 's hard to beat zero percent so i do n't think i would pay it all off maybe cut it in half to make it a more comfortable payment currently you are looking at $ 6 k a year to pay them off which is about 20 of your income cut that in half and you will sleep better definitely pay off the medical and credit cards you 're probably paying 20 on that clean it up if you need a car buy yourself a car you have no savings so i would put the rest in some kind of money market savings account you are at an age where many people go through frequent changes maybe you get your own place and you 'll need to furnish it maybe you go back to school maybe you get married or have kids maybe you take a year off and backpack through europe or asia you have a nice little windfall that puts you in a nice position to enjoy being young so i would not lock it up into a 401k or other long term situation

cfds contracts for difference are basically a contract between you and the broker on the difference in price of the underlying between the time you open a position and close a position you are not actually buying the underlying with share cfds the outcome is a bit like buying the underlying shares on margin you pay interest for every day you hold the cfds overnight for long cfds however with short positions you get paid interest for every day you hold your short position overnight most people use cfds for short term trading however they can be used for medium to longer term trading just as you would hold a portfolio on margin what you have to remember is that because you are buying on margin you can lose more than your initial contract amount a way to manage this risk is by using position sizing and stop loses with your position sizing if you wanted to invest $ 10,000 in a particular share trading at $ 10 per share you would then buy 1000 shares or 1000 cfds in that share your initial expense with the cfds might be only $ 1000 at a margin rate of 10 so instead of increasing your risk by having an initial outlay of $ 10,000 with the cfds you limit your risk to the same as you were buying the shares directly

i fear this question may be impossible to answer beyond the options you already seem to know about   it depends too much on the details of your situation some of which you say you do n't know   if you do n't even know how much debt you have i think you 're going to need some kind of professional advice to assess your situation   one place to start is the national foundation for credit counseling   this organization can provide free or low cost advice about your situation including bankruptcy options that said the main missing piece i see in your question is your expenses   the first thing you should ask yourself is what am i spending money on and can i stop spending on money on that in order to save and/or pay off debt instead   you say that you can live comfortably paycheck to paycheck and routinely put money into savings   can you start living and thus put a lot more into savings or towards debt repayment   whether this will work or not depends on how much debt you have but it definitely needs to be part of your thought process likewise if you continually are wiped out by expenses start budgeting for them

to get rich in a short time it 's more likely what you want to do is go into business you could go into a non investment business such as opening a restaurant or starting a tech company of course warren buffett was working in investing which is quite a bit different than just buying stocks the three ways to get rich investing i can think of are i think the maximum real after inflation return you can really count on over a lot of years is in the 5 6 range at most maybe less here 's a post where david argues 3 4 assuming cash interest is close to zero real return at that rate you can double every 10 15 years   any higher rate is probably risking much lower returns i often post this argument against that on investment questions http://blog.ometer.com/2010/11/10/take-risks-in-life-for-savings-choose-a-balanced-fund/ agree with you that lots of people seem to think they can make up for not saving money by picking a winning investment lots of people also use the lottery as a retirement strategy i 'm not sure this is totally irrational if for some reason someone just ca n't save but i 'm sure it will fail for almost all the people who try it

investing is always a matter of balancing risk vs reward with the two being fairly strongly linked   risk free assets generally keep up with inflation if that these days advice is that even in retirement you 're going to want something with better for at least part of your portfolio a whole market strategy is a reasonable idea but not well defined you need to decide how to weight stocks vs bonds for example and short long term and you may want international or reit in the mix again the question is how much again the tradeoff is trying to decide how much volatility and risk you are comfortable with and picking a mix which comes in somewhere around that point and noting which assets tend to move out of with each other stock bond is the classic example to help tune that the recommendation for higher risk return when you have a longer horizon before you need the money comes from being able to tolerate more volatility early on when you have less at risk and more time to let the market recover that lets you take a more aggressive position and on average higher returns over time you generally want to dial that back in the direction of lower risk if not risk free so a late blip does n't cause you to lose too much of what you 've already gained but see above re risk free that 's the theoretical answer the practical answer is that running various strategies against both historical data and statistical simulations of what the market might do in the future suggests some specific distributions among the categories i 've mentioned do seem to work better than others the mix i use which is basically a whole market with weighting factors for the categories mentioned above was the result of starting with a general mix appropriate to my risk tolerance based on historical data then checking it by running about 100 monte carlo simulations of the market for the next 50 years

correcting keith 's answer you should have read about these details in the terms and conditions of your bank broker orders are like a soft limit order and meaningless without a validity which is typically between 1 and 5 days if you buy silver at an price above market price say x when the market offer is m then parts of your order will likely be filled at the market price   for the remaining quantity there is now a limit the bank broker might fill your order over the next 5 days or however long the validity is at various prices such that the overall average price does not exceed x. this is different to a limit order as it allows the bank broker to partially buy silver at higher prices than x as long as the overall averages is x or less   in a limit set up you might be partially filled at market prices first but if the market moves above x the bank broker will not fill any remaining quantities of your order so you might end up after a day or 5 days with a partially filled order also note that an price below the market price and with a short enough validity behaves like a limit price the 4th order type is sort of an opposite side limit price a stop buy means buy when the market offer quote goes above a certain price a stop sell means sell when the market bid quote goes below a certain price paired with the principle this might mean that you buy sell on average above below the price you give i do n't know how big your orders are or will be but always keep in mind that not all of your order might be filled immediately a so called partial fill   this is particularly noteworthy when you 're in a pro rata market

do n't do debt   after a few years i forget how many the bad history will have rolled off but by then you will probably have no desire to go back into debt again if you do want to build up a credit score then at that point it 's essentially the same as starting from scratch   however from personal experience once you 've lived debt free for a few years you never want to get back on the debt wheel again a credit score is the output of a behavioral model that indicates the chances that a bank will earn money from your business do things that earn the banks money and you will have a high credit score

this is the sad state of us stock markets and regulation t. yes while options have cleared settled for t+1 trade + 1 day for years and now actually clear instantly on some exchanges stocks still clear settle in t+3   there really is no excuse for it if you are in a margin account regulations permit the trading of unsettled funds without affecting margin requirements so your funds in effect are available immediately after trading but are n't considered margin loans   some strict brokers will even restrict the amount of margin funds you can trade with scottrade used to be hyper safe and was the only online discount broker that did this years ago others will allow you to withdraw a large percentage of your funds immediately i think e*trade lets you withdraw up to 90 of unsettled funds immediately if you are in a cash account you are authorized to buy with unsettled funds but you ca n't sell purchases made on unsettled funds until such funds clear or you 'll be barred for 90 days from trading as your letter threatened besides most brokers do n't allow this   you certainly are n't allowed to withdraw unsettled funds by your broker in such an account as it would technically constitute a loan for which you are n't even liable since you 've agreed to no loan contract a margin agreement   i ca n't be sure if that actually violates reg t but when i am i 'll edit while it is true that all marketable options are cleared through one central entity the options clearing corporation with stocks clearing settling still occurs between brokers netting their transactions between each other electronically all financial products could clear settle immediately imo and i 'd rather not start a by giving my opinion why not do n't even get me started on the bond market as to the actual process it 's called clearing settling the general process which can generally be applied to all financial instruments from cash deposits to derivatives trading is the reason why all of the old financial companies were grouped on wall st. is because they 'd have runners physically all of the certificates from building to building   then they discovered netting so slowed down the process to balance the accounts and only cart the net amounts of certificates they owed each other   this is how we get the term bankers hours where financial firms would close to the public early to account for the days trading   while this is all really done instantly behind your back at your broker they 've conveniently kept the short hours

i agree with joe having the money deposited to the us bank account may land you in trouble technically a us business paying a foreigner must withhold 30 of the payment unless a tax treaty says otherwise the us business should do that based on your w8-ben form that you should have given to the business before being paid i 'm guessing that by paying to your us bank account you and your american counterpart are trying to avoid this withholding that may cause trouble for both of you i would suggest you talking to a professional ea cpa licensed in the state where the business is located and having the situation resolved asap you may not be liable for the us taxes at all but because of incorrectly reporting the income expense you and the us business may end up paying way more than the $ 0 you otherwise would have in penalties

i do n't think this is a french thing   it 's like this everywhere   banks always want people to open accounts of every type   a person with a checking account should be easy to sell on a savings account at the same institution given that it does not appear that they will have any chance to recover the money they spend to get customers to open these accounts there are no fees and they have to pay out the interests even if very small oh they recover it   banks make money by having deposits that they can use to lend out   they do pay interest on deposits but not as much as they earn on your money   if they persuade you to have a savings account in addition to your checking account then you might find it convenient and then move your money out of a different institution into their savings account   or you might stop hoarding it under your mattress   or whatever   more money in their accounts means more profit for them i do n't know whether banks make more profit per dollar in savings or checking accounts   i see banks pushing for both   i think they simply view more accounts as a good thing because it can lead to more total savings in their institution   that 's how they make money

ditto just to get concrete i just checked one bank in india and they say they are paying 4 on savings accounts i do n't know what you 're getting or if 4 is typical in india but it 's at least an example so if the bank pays interest based on average daily balance and you left the money in the bank for a week you 'd get = so on rs 95,000 that would be rs 73 i live in the us where typical interest on a savings account today is about 1 so an equivalent amount of money i think that would be about $ 1,500 would get of 1 or 29 cents   do n't leave the lights turned on while you do the calculations you 'll spend more on the electricity than you make on the interest addendum this suddenly reminds me i read a news story a few years ago about a man who was expecting a tax refund check from the irs of a few hundred dollars and when the check arrived it was for several million well obviously it was a mistake but he came up with the clever idea deposit the check in an interest bearing account promptly contact the irs inform them of the mistake and ask how and where to go about returning the money hope that it takes at least a few days for them to figure everything out then keep the interest accumulated on the several million dollars for the time that he had the money and as he contacted them immediately about the error they ca n't say he was trying to hide anything it was a nice try but it did n't work they demanded he send them the interest as well as the principle

highlights from bill 's senate testimony   has a well known reputation for corruption unfortunately i discovered that it was far worse than many had thought   gt;when putin was first elected in 2000 he found that the had much of the president ’s power as well they stole power from him while stealing money from my investors   july 2003 putin arrested russia ’s biggest and richest man after ’s conviction the other went to putin and asked him what they needed to do to avoid sitting in the same cage as from what followed it appeared that putin ’s answer was fifty percent he was n’t saying 50 percent for the russian government or the presidential administration of russia but 50 percent for putin personally from that moment on putin became the biggest in russia and the richest man in the world   amp;nbsp 25 interior ministry officials into my moscow office and the office of the american law firm that represented me the officials seized all the corporate documents connected to the investment holding companies of the funds that i advised i did n’t know the purpose of these raids so i hired the smartest russian lawyer i knew a old named sergei magnitsky i asked sergei to investigate the purpose of the raids and try to stop whatever illegal plans these officials had   went out and investigated he came back with the most astounding conclusion of corporate identity theft the documents seized by the interior ministry were used to fraudulently re register our russian investment holding companies to a man named known criminal convicted of after more digging sergei discovered that the stolen companies were used by the to $ 230 million of taxes that our companies had paid to the russian government in the previous year   amp;nbsp gt;as i thought about it the murder of sergei magnitsky was done to cover up the theft of $ 230 million from the russian treasury i knew that the people who stole that money would n’t keep it in russia as easily as they stole the money it could be stolen from them these people keep their ill gotten gains in the west where property rights and rule of law exist this led to the idea of freezing their assets and banning their visas here in the west   2010 i traveled to washington and told sergei magnitsky ’s story to senators benjamin and john mccain they were both shocked and appalled and proposed a new piece of legislation called the sergei magnitsky rule of law accountability act   gt;despite the white house ’s desire to reset relations with russia at the time this case a bright light on the and impunity of the putin regime and persuaded congress that something needed to be done in november 2012 the magnitsky act passed the house of representatives by to 43 votes and later the senate 92 to 4 votes on december 14 2012 president obama signed the sergei magnitsky act into law   was furious looking for ways to against american interests he settled on the most and evil option of all banning the adoption of russian orphans by american families   amp;nbsp 2012 it ’s emerged that putin was a beneficiary of the stolen $ 230 million that sergei magnitsky exposed   estimate that he has accumulated $ 200 billion of ill gotten gains from these types of operations over his 17 years in power he keeps his money in the west and all of his money in the west is potentially exposed to asset freezes and confiscation therefore he has a significant and very personal interest in finding a way to get rid of the magnitsky sanctions   second reason why putin reacted so badly to the passage of the magnitsky act is that it destroys the promise of impunity he ’s given to all of his corrupt officials   are approximately ten thousand officials in russia working for putin who are given instructions to kill torture extort money from people and seize their property before the magnitsky act putin could guarantee them impunity and this system of illegal wealth accumulation worked smoothly however after the passage of the magnitsky act putin ’s guarantee disappeared the magnitsky act created real consequences outside of russia and this created a real problem for putin and his system of   amp;nbsp gt one of the most shocking attempts took place in the spring and summer of last year when a group of russians went on a lobbying campaign in washington to try to repeal the magnitsky act by changing the narrative of what had happened to sergei   was this group of russians acting on behalf of the russian state two men named and a woman named and a large group of american lobbyists all of whom are described below   amp;nbsp first step was to set up a fake ngo that would ostensibly promote russian although it quickly became clear that the ngo ’s sole purpose was to repeal the magnitsky act this ngo was called the human rights accountability global initiative foundation   a former soviet intelligence officer as an american citizen was hired to lead the magnitsky repeal effort   amp;nbsp also instructed u.s. law firm baker and their washington based partner marc to lobby members of congress to support an amendment taking sergei magnitsky ’s name off the global magnitsky act mr. was in contact with paul a congressional on the house foreign affairs committee at the time as part of the anti magnitsky lobbying campaign   through baker hired glenn simpson of the firm fusion gps to conduct a smear campaign against me and sergei magnitsky in advance of congressional hearings on the global magnitsky act   amp;nbsp gt;as part of ’s lobbying a former wall street journal reporter chris cooper of the group was hired to organize the washington based of a fake documentary about sergei magnitsky and myself this was one the best examples of putin ’s propaganda   amp;nbsp june 13 2016 they funded a major event at the to show their fake documentary inviting representatives of congress and the state department to attend   they were conducting these operations in washington d.c. at no time did they indicate that they were acting on behalf of russian government interests nor did they file disclosures under the foreign agent registration act   cherry on top   from trump 's interview with the new york times   gt;"the meal was going toward dessert trump said i went down just to say hello to and while i was there i said hello to putin really more than anything else it was not a long conversation but it was you know could be 15 minutes just talked about things actually it was very interesting we talked about adoption

the house that sells for $ 200,000 might rent for a range of monthly numbers 3 would be $ or $ 500/mo this is absurdly low and favors renting not buying 9 is $ in which case buying the house to live in or rent out as a landlord is the better choice at this level paying rent should be avoided   i 'm simply explaining the author 's view not advocating it   a quote from the article   annual rent purchase price = 3 means do not buy prices are too    high annual rent purchase price = 6 means borderline annual rent purchase price = 9 means ok to buy prices are    reasonable edit to respond to chuck 's comment mortgage rates for qualified applicants are pretty tight from low to high the 30 year is about 4.4 and the 15 of course a number of factors might mean paying more but this is the average rate and it changes over time but the rent and purchase price in a given area will be different very different based on location see what you 'd pay for 2000 sq feet in manhattan vs a nice town in the mid west one can imagine a heat map when an area might show an $ 800 rent on a house selling for $ 40,000 as a the home price divided by annual rent and another area as a 20 where the $ 200 k house might rent for $ it 's not homogeneous through the us as i said i 'm not taking a position just discussing how the author formulated his approach the author makes some assertions that can be debatable e.g. that low rates are a bad time to buy because they already pushed the price too high in my opinion the us has had the crash but the rates are still low buying is a personal decision and the own rent ratios are only one tool to be added to a list of factors in making the decision   of course the article as written does the math based on the rates at time of publication and the ratio of income to mortgage one can afford is tied to the current rate the $ 60 k couple at 4 can afford just over a $ 260 k mortgage but at 6 $ k and 8 $ the struggle is n't with the payment but the downpayment    the analysis is n't too different for a purchase to invest if the rent exceeds 1 of the home price an investor should be able to turn a profit after expenses

as your main concern seems to be that you are not sure whether you can ever get a house and actually support the expenses it incurs when you have one here is a very simple answer   you say you are currently decreasing your creditcard debt by 2k per month at that rate it will be finished within 2 years try to pay it off completely if this succeeds in the next 2 years you can be confident that you can afford a 500k house paying back 50k high interest debt in 2 years is very roughly equivalent to back 500k low interest debt over 20 years a reasonable time period in my environment so just pay back the creditcard as fast as you can if two years sounds like a long time there is nothing stopping you to pay it back a little bit faster even   note this is written under the assumption that your student loan burden will not increase over time

i 'd say there 's a lot of oversight in the public companies like maintaining transparency to the public by having public consultations and sending out lots of communication there 's also the way budgets are managed in public companies that are very different from a private company so there 's way more oversight into where the money goes the reason public projects take so long generally falls under these considerations   private companies at least where i 'm from also have to follow some pretty strict rules that there is a lot of pushback on but considering that a lot of the oversight boils down to things like do n't increase traffic by x amount without creating a route do n't increase flows to a river that would flood out people downstream do n't build houses so close together that a fire can jump from one to the next etc but i agree with having the strict regulation because it means that in fifty years we wo n't have the same massive problems that there have been before   also it 's a tough sell to get some things done by private investment like a country road so it 's a lot easier to have the government do it that 's why there 's usually a division between capital works and development where capital works will build the roads and in existing areas while development will be and industrial complexes where the developer has to put in all of the infrastructure as part of their development that they 're making sales or rentals to turn a profit on so there is a balance but it 's capital works that gets the most media attention for being horrible and in need of repair

your math is correct as you point out because of the property of multiplication roth and traditional iras offer the same terminal wealth if your tax rate is the same when you pull it out as when you put it in   roth does lock in your tax rate as of today as you point out which is why it frequently does not maximize wealth most of us have a higher tax bracket when we are saving than when we are withdrawing from savings there are a few other potential considerations advantages of a roth roth and traditional iras have the same maximum contribution amount   this means the effective amount you can contribute to a roth is higher $ 5,500 after tax instead of before   if this constraint is binding for you and you do n't expect your tax rate to change roth is better roth iras allow you to withdraw your contributed money not the gains at any time without any tax or penalty whatsoever   this can be an advantage to some who would like to use it for something like a down payment instead of keeping it all the way to retirement   in this sense the roth is more flexible as your income becomes high the deductibility of traditional ira contributions goes to zero if you have a 401(k at work you can still contribute but ca n't deduct contributions   at high incomes you also may be disallowed from contributing to a roth but because of the backdoor roth loophole you can make roth contributions at any income level and preserve the full roth tax advantage which type of account is better for any given person is a complex problem with several unknowns like future tax rates   however because tax rates are generally higher when earning money for most people who can contribute to them traditional iras maximize your tax savings and therefore wealth edit note that traditional ira contributions also reduce your agi which is used to compute eligibility for other tax advantages like the child care tax credit and earned income credit   agi is also often used for state income tax calculation in retirement traditional ira distributions may or may not be state taxable depending on your state and circumstances

income from a hobby is tax exempt under dutch law to consider whether it 's hobby a few rules are applied such as how much time do you spend on the activity and is the hourly wage low obviously having a boss is a sure sign of it not being a hobby the typical example is making dolls and selling them on a crafts fair if you travel the country and sell each weekend on a different fair that 's a lot of time if you only sell them on the fair in your home town it 's a hobby   situation 3 is the most difficult if you just happened to luck out it 's still a hobby if you spent significant time to improve the value of your holdings e.g. by trading in game then it might be seen as work in the latter case you simply file it as income from other sources not yet taxed   for the purpose of determining income from a hobby you may deduct actual expenses so in your case they 'd look at the net income of $ which is not unusual for a hobby it would n't be any different if you took up horse riding decided that you did n't like it and sell your horse at a loss

the liquidity primarily depends on the specific equity type position you are looking at you want to look for stocks or etfs that have significant volume themselves before trying to jump into an option contract the most important things you should look at are volume and open interest for the specific contracts strikes and expiration near the money in the money contracts from near term expiration tend to have the highest liquidity and the smallest relative spreads

what you are describing is lifestyle creep no where did you mention how to apply a living wage per person let alone per situation    what if i was hired at a wage of and only used 1500 for living expenses would that be a livable wage what if i then decide to have 4 children over the next 4 years should the employer be forced to pay more on the aspect of having children alone if that is the case what are you incentivizing child production or productivity unless those children work too which is bad they are at a net loss to the employer and he she has no ability to put you in a more productive spot so what should this employer do   at what point do you stop raising the ubi minimum wage whatever form of inflationary behavior and or redistribution you are trying to achieve fairness across a wide spectrum of individuals and situations and there is zero that all of them or even most of them will benefit in a positive manner

there is a term for this if you google house hacking you will get lots of articles and advice   some of it will pertain to multifamily properties but a good amount should be owner occupied and renting bedrooms i would play with a mortgage calculator like what s my payment   include principle interest taxes and insurance see how much it will cost   at 110k your monthly fixed payments will depend on a number of factors down payment interest real estate tax rate and insurance cost but $ would be a decent guess in my area   going off that with two roommates willing to pay $ 500 a month you would have no living expenses except any maintenance or utilities   with your income i would expect you could make the payment alone if needed and it may be needed so it seems fairly low risk from my perspective you need somewhere to live you are used to roommates and you can pay the entire cost yourself in a worst case some more things to consider insurance will be more expensive you want to ensure you as the landlord you are covered if anything happens   if a tenant burns down your house or trips and falls and decides to sue you insurance will protect you    capital expenses capex replacing things as they wear out on a home the roof siding flooring and all water heater etc have a lifespan and will need to be replaced   on rental properties a portion of rent should be set aside to replace these things in the future   if a roof lasts costs $ 8,000 and your roof is old you should be setting aside $ 70 a month so in the   future when this know expense comes up it is not a hardship taxes yes there is a special way to report income from an arrangement like this   you will fill out a schedule e form in addition to your regular tax documents you will also be able to write off a percent of housing expenses and depreciation on the home   i have been told it is not a simple tax situation and to consult a cpa that specializes in real estate

assuming this to be in the uk and i suspect   the rules are similar elsewhere this indeed may be true there is a threshold beneath which a business does not have to register for vat currently a turnover of £ a non vat registered business does not charge vat but also can not reclaim the vat on their business expenses for some businesses below the threshold it is worthwhile registering because the amount they can reclaim is significant however there are also many small businesses that do a lot of cash only jobs so as to not put the money through the books and therefore avoid any tax liability there are also many who will get the the customer to buy materials direct to avoid including these in their turnover   like every type of tax rule there is a grey area between people trying to avoid paying more tax than is needed and dodgy deals to avoid paying their fair share of tax

your post seems to read as if you want to invest only in real estate rental properties as a start because they will be a reliable investment guaranteed to generate profits that you will be plowing back into buying even more rental properties but you are willing to consider possibly in later years other forms of investment in real estate that will not require active   participation in the management of the rental properties while many participants here do own rental real estate and even manage it entirely for most people that is only a small part of their investment portfolio and i suspect that hardly any will recommend real estate as the only investment the way you seem to want to do also you might want to look more closely at the realities of rental real estate   operations before jumping in things are not necessarily as rosy as they appear to you now   not all your units will be rented all the time and the rental income might not always be enough to cover the mortgage payments and the property taxes and the insurance payments and the repairs and maintenance and depreciation of the property is another matter that you might not have thought about that being said you can invest in real estate through real estate investment trusts reits or through limited partnerships where you have only a passive role   there are even mutual funds that invest in reits or in reit indexes

not to detract from the other answers at all which are each excellent and useful in their own right but here 's my interpretation of the ideas equity is the answer to the question where is the value of the company coming from   this might include owner stakes shareholder stock investments or outside investments   in the current moment it can also be defined as equity = x + current income current expenses i 'll come back to x this fits into the standard accounting model of assets liabilities = value equity where assets includes not only bank accounts but also warehouse inventory raw materials etc liabilities are debts loans shortfalls in inventory etc   both are abstract categories whereas income and expense are hard dollar amounts   at the end of the year when the books balance they should all equal out equity up until this point has been an abstract concept and it 's not an account in the traditional gnucash sense   however it 's common practice for businesses to close the books once a year and to consolidate outstanding balances   when this happens equity ceases to be abstract and becomes a hard value how much is the company worth at this moment which has a definite numeric value when the books are opened fresh for a new business year the current income and current expense amounts are zeroed out   in this situation in order for the big equation to equal out assets liabilities = x + income the previous net value of the company must be accounted for   this is where x comes in the starting previous year 's equity   this allows the assets and liabilities to be non zero while the current income and expenses are both still zeroed out   the account which represents x in gnucash is called equity and encompasses not only initial investments but also the net increase decreases from previous years   while the name would more accurately be called starting equity the only problem caused by the naming convention is the confusion of the concept equity x + income expenses with the account x named equity

first thing to note is that contributions i.e. the total of all the amounts that you directly contributed into roth ira at any point in time to a roth ira can be withdrawn at any time without needing any reason without any tax or penalty early withdrawal early because you are under 59.5 of earnings on the other hand will incur tax and penalty i did n't go into withdrawal of conversions as those are a little more complex when you withdraw contributions come out first so as long as you do n't withdraw more than the amount of past contributions you wo n't have any tax or penalty and if it 's not going to have tax it does n't really matter if you do it this year or next year if you need to dip into the earnings however then maybe it would be better to do this year so it will be taxed at lower rates

3 reasons i can think of i once worked for a bank and when credit scoring for loans if you had been approved by different institutions you were given a better score so if you held a visa and mastercard as opposed to two visa cards your credit score would go higher more than 6 cards though looked suspicious and your score would take a big hit having more than card has helped me when getting special offers multiple times from some websites where it was limited to one per customer though most just used your address or email account if you owed $ 1000 in total which you ca n't pay off in one go it is better to have that split across two cards you would be paying interest on $ 500 on each card but when you have one card paid off the interest you would be paying on the other would be based on the original debt to that one card of $ 500 not $ 1000 i hope that makes sense

are financial institutions less likely to lend me money because of my age yes   but they are especially unlikely to loan you money because you have little income    or because they know i avoid interest by paying things off aggressively this wo n't affect them   but you might ask yourself how much credit history you have   credit history can include all of loans credit cards rent utilities etc   you mention three loans   but you do n't mention rent or utilities   you may simply not have much credit history even if what you do have is good    but again the biggest thing that they will look at is your income history   if you have a small income then it does n't matter what your payment history is   they do n't want to loan money to people who need money   they want to loan money to people who do n't need to borrow but are instead bringing a future purchase into the present    the ideal recipient is someone who has a high income and spends it all every month   such a person is likely to borrow heavily but be able to keep up the payments    obsessing about your ability to borrow is probably the wrong approach   instead focus on how you can meet your goals without borrowing   eventually your ability to pay will catch up   then they 'll offer you money   of course you might not need it then    note that when i say little income i 'm talking about their perspective   you may be fully on track and making decent money or even very good money for your age   but they 're looking for people who are mature in their careers and regularly bringing home large sums but who spend it faster than they can get it

do n't mind the percentages they are highly misleading first saving is making available for future use it might be hoarding investing or a combination thereof it might be for a specific use a car a college education retirement etc or for a non specific use for an emergency for when you decide to spend some of those savings or just for lack of a compelling use as of the moment in first case whatever you save should be available by the date you intend to use it in second case it might be prudent to have savings and investments see below of various liquidity cash you have at hand bank account you can draw next day mutual fund account you can draw in a month maybe something you can only cash in a year etc you will see that the actual percentages you save fluctuate enormously throughout your life varying with the progress of your career changes of marital status and family etc etc what you should really do is to come up with a rough plan of how you expect from right now and to the end of your life at whatever age have enough money for whatever level of comfort you plan for each period of your life allowing for some specified level of then you just execute that plan or change it as you go

first i would point you to this question   oversimplify it for me the correct order of investing with the $ 50k that you have inherited you have enough money to pay off all your debt $ 40k purchase a functional used car $ 5k and get a great start on an emergency fund with the rest   there are many who would tell you to wait as long as possible to pay off your student loans and invest the money instead however i would pay off the loans right away if i were you even if it is low interest right now it is still a debt that needs to be paid back pay it off and you wo n't have this debt hanging over your head anymore   your grandmother has given you an incredible gift this money can make you completely debt free and put you on a path for success however if you are n't careful you could end up back in debt quickly learn how to make a budget and commit to never spending money that you do n't have again

the homeowner gets all the profit from the price rise because it 's their asset the bank will charge early repayment fees but these are often a small fraction of the profits this is why homeownership in rising markets is so popular it offers the benefits of gearing a financial investment so that you can make profits that are a very large fraction of your principal initial equity

i respectfully disagree with @johnfx 's comment regarding new vs used   john knows what is talking about though he gave an awesome answer on buying a car   what are some tips for getting the upper hand in car price negotiations the answer to your question is based on whether or you not you can stand to have a small loud cheap but reliable car for the next 10 or 15 years if you plan to keep your new car until it dies 20 years from now then a new car can be a fine choice   i just bought a car and the difference between my 2013 hyundai and a comparable 2012 hyundai was n't much   furthermore it was hard to even find a 2012 which justifies the higher price from dealerships and the private market   doing math in my head told me the reduced usage i will get out of the car was n't offset by the slightly lower price depending on the specific age insurance on newer cars can be cheaper than insurance on older cars but you have to have carry more insurance so consider that as well   there might not be a different between a 2010 and a 2012 but there will likely be for a 2005 and the 2013 new cars can be cheaper to operate   lower fuel costs better safety and possibly pollution costs   they are tuned up and you know everything about their history repairs and factory warranties might not be available on a used car so if you car turns out to be a problem your out of pocket is limited these programs do n't mean anything   get an independent certified mechanic to check out any used car you buy   if the dealer wo n't let you get the car checked out then they are n't worth your business   certified cars do n't justify their cost according to consumer reports they are more for marketing than reliability do n't waste money on a third party warranty   either the car is good and does n't need it or it needs a warranty and you should n't buy it   if you new car comes with a factory warranty that is fine   radio host clark howard is indifferent if you want to purchase a factory warranty separately but never a third party just out of college you probably will be better off spending the least amount of money you can for a good used car if for no other reason this likely is n't going to be your car in the near future   only you can answer that if you have a feeling you wo n't keep your tiny car well into your 30s then definitely do n't buy a new car    also my experience only applies to my make and model   certain models of cars keep their value and the difference between new and used is n't much for the most recent model years but there are many more makes and models that do n't pan out that way

if you download the historical data from yahoo you will see two different close prices the one labeled close is simply the price that was quoted on that particular day the one labeled adj close is the close price that has been adjusted for any splits and dividends that have occurred after that date   for example if a stock splits 10:1 on a particular date then the adjusted close for all dates prior to that split will have been divided by 10 if a dividend is paid then all dates prior will have that amount subtracted from their adjusted quote using the adjusted close allows you to compare any two dates and see the true relative return

it depends on what your investment goals are   are you investing for the short term or the long term   what was your reason for investing in these stocks in the first place   timing short term fluctuations in the market is very difficult so if that 's your goal i would n't count on being able to sell and buy back in at exactly the right time   rather i think you should think about what your investment rationale was in the first place and whether or not that rationale still holds   if it does then hold on to the stocks   if it does n't then sell

the simplest way to consolidate the funds your old 401(k plans is by doing what 's called a direct rollover whereby the funds go directly into the new plan and skips you completely from each of the old plans into either an ira that you establish with a provider of your choice or even into your current employer 's 401(k plan if that is available that way the funds are in one central account and available to invest plus it eliminates the mandatory 20 withholding if the rollover is indirect and is sent to you first before the deposit into the new plan it is important to bear in mind that you have 60 calendar days from the date of distribution to get the full amount into the new plan and a rollover is considered a tax reportable but not necessarily a taxable event provided you deposit the funds within the time frame allotted

ah i got ya i partially agree with you but it 's far more complex i think that is simplifying the debate a bit too much when people go passive you are making the assumption that they are able to stay fully invested the full time period say 30 40 years until retirement when you might change the asset allocation this is not a fair assumption because many studies on behavioral finance have shown that people 90 plus are not able to sit tight through a full market cycle and often sell out during a bear market i 'm not debating you 're point that passive often outperforms due to the fees although there are many managers that do outperform but the main issue with self managing and passive investing is people usually make emotional decisions which then hurts their long term performance this would be the reason to hire an adviser assuming that people are able to stay passive the entire time and not make a single active decision is a very unfair assumption there was a good study on this referenced in forbes article below   another issue is that there are a lot active managers that really just replicate their benchmarks and do n't actually actively manage if you look at active managers who really do have huge under weights and over weights relative to their benchmarks they actually tend to outperform them look at the study below by martin he 's one of the most highly respected researchers when it comes to investment performance research and the active vs passive debate     i guess what i 'm trying to say is that for most people having an adviser and paying them a 1 fee is usually better than going it alone where they are going to a. chase heat i bet they always choose the hottest benchmark from the past few years and b. make poor emotional decisions relating their finances

apples and oranges the stock market requires a tiny bit of your time perhaps a lot if you are interested in individual stocks and pouring through company annual reports but close to none if you have a mix of super low cost etfs or index fund   the real estate investing you propose is at some point a serious time commitment unless you use a management company to handle incoming calls and to dispatch repair people but that 's a cost that will eat into your potential profits if you plan to do this for real i suggest using the 401(k but then having the option to take loans from it the ability to write a check for $ 50 k is pretty valuable when buying real estate when you run the numbers this will benefit you long term   edit on re reading your question rental property what is considered decent cash flow with example i withdraw my answer above you overestimated the return you will get the actual return will likely be negative it does n't take too many years of your one per year strategy to wipe you out   per your comment below if bought right rentals can be a great long term investment glad you did n't buy the loser

paying off your student loan is an investment and a completely risk free one   every payment of your loan is a purchase of debt at the interest rate of the loan    it would be extremely unusual to be able to find a cd bond or other low risk play at a better rate   any investment in a risky asset such as stocks is just leveraging up your personal balance sheet which is strictly a personal decision based on your risk appetite but would nearly universally be regarded as a mistake by a financial advisor   the only exception i can think of here would be taking out a home mortgage and even that would be debatable unless your loan interest rate is in the range of corporate or government bonds and i 'm sure it is n't do n't think twice about paying them off with any free cash you have

this is a great question precisely because the answer is so complicated it means you 're starting to think in detail about how orders actually get filled executed rather than looking at stock prices as a mythical the market the market price is a somewhat deceptive term the price at which bids and asks last crossed filled is the price that prints i.e. that is what you see on a market price data feed in reality there is a resting queue of orders at various bids asks on various exchanges   source larry harris a size of 1 is = 100 shares so at first your order will sweep through the standing queue of fills let 's say you are trading a low volume stock and let 's say someone from another brokerage has set a limit order at a ridiculous price part of your order may sweep through and part of it get filled at a ridiculously high price or maybe either the exchange or your broker execution mechanism somehow will protect you against the really high fill let 's say your broker hired who guarantees a certain vwap also people change their bids asks in response to what they see others do your size will likely be marked as a human counterparty by certain players other players might see that order differently let 's say it was a 100 size maybe people will decide you must know something and decide they want to go the same direction as you rather than take the opportunity to exit and maybe some super fast players will in and out of the filling process itself there is more to it because what if some of the resting asks are on other venues what if both you and some of the asks match with someone who uses the same broker as you not only do exchange rules come into play but so do national regulations tl;dr you will get filled with price slippage if you send in a big buy order it will sweep through the resting asks but also there are complications

when you buy a property the house or the building goes down in value every year it gets depreciated similar to when you drive a new car out of the lot however it is the land that increases in value over time as land becomes the value of land in that area will increase in value as does land in sought after areas if more people want to live in a particular suburb the land value will keep on increasing year after year sometimes established areas with houses built in the 1980s or even earlier can be worth much more than newly built areas it comes down to the supply and demand of land and houses in a particular area you might even get a situation where a run down dilapidated house in a very sought after suburb sells for more than a brand new house in a less sought after suburb nearby properties can be a very good investment and they can be a very poor investment it can largely depend on the decisions you make in buying your investment property the first thing you need to make a decision on is the location of the property if you buy a property in a good area that is well sought after you can make good capital and rental returns over the long run if you buy poorly in an area no one wants to live in then you might have problems renting it out or only be able to rent it out to bad tenants who cause damage and you may not get any capital gains over many years the second thing you need to decide on is when in the property cycle you buy the property if you buy at the right time you can get higher rents and make some quick capital gains over a relatively short time i can provide a personal example of this situation i had bought a house in australia in 2007 for $ 240,000 at a time when interests where at their highest 9 no one was buying property and rents were on the increase with low vacancy rates today eight years after we are getting $ 410 per week rent and the house next door in worse condition than ours has been put on the market asking for between $ 500,000 to $ most houses in the area had been selling during this year for over $ 500,000 so you can say that our house has more than doubled in 8 years however up to a few months ago houses were selling within 2 weeks of being listed the house next door however has been listed for over a month and has not had very much interest so from this you can conclude that in 2007 we had bought near the bottom of the market whilst now we are near the top of the market what you also need to remember is that different areas of a country can have different cycles so there is not just one property cycle but many property cycles in the same country

now company a has been doing ok for couple of weeks but then due to some factors in that company its stock has been tanking heavily and does n't appear to have a chance to recover in this kind of scenario what does happen   in this scenario if that company is included in the index being tracked you will continue holding until such time that the index is no longer including that company    index funds are passively managed because they simply hold the securities contained in the index and seek to keep the allocations of the fund in line with the proportions of the index being tracked   in an actively managed fund the fund manager would try to hedge losses and make stock security picks   if the manager thought a particular company had bad news coming maybe they would offload some or all the position   in an index fund the fund follows the index on good days and bad and the managers job is to match the asset allocations of the index not to pick stocks

there is no one solution to every project finance problem two models might make sense in this situation however in this case you would count all the money that you give to your friend as a loan which he will pay back with interest the interest rate and loan amounts will have to be agreed on by both of you one one hand the interest should be high enough to reward you in a successful outcome for the amount of risk that you take on if things do n't work out on the other the interest rate needs to be low enough where his earnings after loan repayment justify your friend 's effort in addition to being competitive to rate your friend could secure from a bank the downside to this plan is you do n't directly benefit from the franchise 's profits in this model you will record the cash that each of you invests since your friend is also adding sweat equity by setting up and operating the franchise you will need to quantify the work that your friend and you invest into the franchise then you can determine how much each of you has invested in terms of dollars and split any franchise profits based on those proportions the downside of this plan is that it is difficult to estimate how much time each of you invests and how much that time is worth

yes just set aside the amount of money if you buy a cfd long in a stock for a 1000 $ set aside if you buy a cfd short set aside the same amount and include a stoploss at the value at which the money is depleted in this case however you can lose more because of opening gaps by doing this you replicate the stock return apart from the charged interest rate

this essentially depends on how you prefer to measure your performance i will just give a few simple examples to start let me know if you 're looking for something more if you just want to achieve maximum $ return then you should always use maximum margin so long as your expected return is higher than your cost to borrow for example suppose you can use margin to double your investment and the cost to borrow is 7 if you 're investing in some security that expects to return 10 then your annual return on an account opened with $ 100 is 2 $ 100 10 $ 100 7 $ 100 = 13 so you see the expected return amount of leverage and cost to borrow will all factor in to your return suppose you want to also account for the additional risk you 're incurring then you could use the sharpe ratio for example suppose the same security has volatility of 20 and the risk free rate is 5 then the sharpe ratio without leverage is 10 5 20 = 0.25 the sharpe ratio using maximum margin is then 13 5 2 20 = 0.2 where the 13 comes from the above formula so on a risk adjusted basis it 's better not to utilize margin in this particular example

first of all any loan will have the last payment be slightly different than the rest even if the interest rate is zero it is hard to have a perfect monthly payment amount by perfect i mean the amount of the loan divided by the number of months would be $   when looking at the amortization table the last payment will either be slightly higher or lower to adjust for the rounding that was done my suspicion is that the rounding would have resulted in a left over 12 cents it is also possible that you are paying it off slightly early and the computer is simply taking the leftover amount an spreading it over the remaining period of the loan you could be paying it early because for the main part of the loan was paid to a company that rounds all payments to the higher dollar or has a minimum monthly payment amount i looked at the company you mentioned in the question and searched the site for an amortization tool i found it and used the pre filled in example if that last payment is not adjusted the borrower will still owe $ 0.12 the fact it equals your situation is a coincidence but is does show what can happen

ugh yes you have to tell us what information you have available it would be a completely different answer if for example you had a balance sheet for a prior period and an income statement for the current period and had to estimate the working capital accounts if you ca n't be bothered to want to give the problem nobody is going to be bothered to help you with it    inventory days = days of cogs in inventory 15 360 times cogs ar is 35 days of sales in ar sales vendor credit is accounts payable 40 cogs    if your sales and cogs are given by operating cycle rather than annually use 50 instead of 360 for whatever reason convention says use 360 instead of 365

while i guess you can never tell for sure i think it is a potential problem why buy from you ship it from the us when probably a similar computer is available nearer to them   i mean this person is using a computer and the internet somewhere so it ca n't be that far to a new computer store   certainly somewhere in their province if not country or continent i suspect they will offer to pay with a cashiers check or a money order or something   then you will ship the item and the funds will be found out to be bogus a couple of months after you try to cash it   you have no computer and no money for it it really makes no sense for this person to go so far out of their way for your standard laptop unless they are trying to steal it

high frequency trades are intra day the would buy a stock for 100 and sell for multiple times so if you start with 100 in your broker account you buy something it takes 2 3 days to settle you sell for it takes 2 3 days to settle you again buy something for 100 it is the net value of both buys and sells that you need to look at trading on margin accounts most brokers offer margin accounts the exact leverage ratios varies what this means is that if you start with 10 or 15 or 25 in your broker you can buy stock of 100 of course legally you wo nt own the stock unless you pay the broker balance etc

although there are some good points made here as to the cause of inflation mostly related to supply and demand does head in a different direction one which i myself was going to take let me give a different angle however another cause of inflation is the printing of money by the government not simply replacing old money with new but adding to the total money in circulation if the government doubles the amount of currency in circulation for the sake of argument and easy math the value of all money decreases by a factor of 2 that 's inflation and the way g. edward in the creature from island puts it it 's really tantamount to a hidden tax in a nutshell the federal government wants to buy some cool stuff like new tanks or planes or they want to give a bunch of food stamps to poor people or they want to fly their private jets around but they do n't have enough money from taxes so they print money and spend it and buy their stuff because they 've just increased the money in circulation however money loses its value for example your savings has dropped in value by half despite the fact that the same number of dollars is in your savings account this is just a way the government can tax you without taxing you they buy stuff and you now have less money i.e. your retirement is worth less and you do n't even know you just got taxed makes me sick that we let our leaders get away with this

401(k can come in traditional and roth forms as can iras roth ira money is not locked away for 40 years only the earnings are locked away and earnings can also be withdrawn for special cases you might not be able to invest in an ira if your income is too high and if you do n't get a match for your 401(k that might not be the best option either the biggest advantage of the 401(k is the match if it exists if there 's no match the second biggest advantage is the tax deferral if you are in a low tax bracket that is n't as big of an advantage either i would say that there are plenty of reasons why you might not max out the 401(k for savings but it 's pretty easy to max out the roth ira if that makes more sense so there are n't a lot of reasons why not

apologize replied without actually looking at the financials after reviewing 's financial statements use the line item cost of sales including occupancy costs this is very different than hiding rent in cogs as they plainly describe what it represents anyone who wants to derive true cost of goods sold without occupancy costs can look in the footnotes of the financials to find the lease expense for the year and subtract it this line item is used by multiple public companies whole foods is one that comes to mind and regardless of their true motives they have convinced the sec that they think it gives the consumer the most accurate view of their business operations as with all financial statements the footnotes play a crucial role in understanding how a business works if you want to find opportunities for future value or an look in the notes

no it 's not high frequency trading specifically aims to take a profit without speculating on the movement of price using technological advantages and exploiting arbitrage opportunities rather than anything else    big firm trading i agree to an extent that 's why i made the comment that markets may or may not be efficient but i think it 's more nuanced than run a projection and see if the price goes up and as i say traders at big trading firms generally have access to information and tools that we do n't at home so if you want to invest in something invest in it do n't try and guess where the price is going to go because people do that professionally and often still get it wrong

a reit is a real estate investment trust it is a company that derives most of its gross income from and holds most of its assets in real estate investments which in this case include either real property mortgages or both   they provide a way for investors to get broad exposure in a real estate market without going to buy a bunch of properties themselves   it also provides diversification within the real estate segment since reits will often but not necessarily have either way more properties than an individual could get or have very large properties like a few resorts that would be too expensive for any one investor   by law they must pay at least 90 of their taxable income as dividends to investors so they typically have a good dividend rate possibly but not necessarily at the expense of growth of the stock price   some of those dividends may be tax advantaged and some will not an mlp is a master limited partnership   these trade on the exchange like corporations but they are not corporations although often used in common language as synonyms corporation and company are not the same thing   corporation is one way to organize a company under the law   they are partnerships and when you buy a share you become a partner in the company   this is an alternative form of ownership to being a shareholding   in this case you are a limited partner which means that you have limited liability as with stock   the shares may appreciate or not just like a stock and you can generally sell them back to the market for a capital gain or loss under the same rules as a stock   the main difference here from a practical point of view is taxes   partnerships of any type do no pay tax instead their income and costs are passed to the individual partners who must then include it on their personal returns form 1040 schedule e   the partnership will send each shareholder a schedule k-1 form at tax time   this means you may have phantom income that is taxable even though cash never flowed through your hands since you 'll have to account for the income of the partnership   many partnerships mitigate this by making cash distributions during the year so that the partners do actually see the cash but this is not required   on the other hand if it does happen it 's often characterized as a return of capital which is not taxable in the year that you receive it   a return of capital reduces your cost basis in the partnership and will eventually result in a larger capital gain when you sell your shares as with any investment there are pros and cons to each investment type   of the two the mlp is probably less like a regular stock since getting the schedule k-1 may require some extra work at tax time especially if you 've never seen one before   on the other hand that may be worth it to you if you can find one that 's appreciating in value and still returning capital at a good rate since this could be a best of everything situation where you defer tax and when you eventually do pay you pay at favorable capital gains rates but still manage to get your cash back in hand before you sell in case not clear my comments about tax are specific to the us   no idea how this is treated elsewhere by real world example i guess you meant a few tickers in each category   you can find whole lists online   i just did a quick search list of mlp and list of reit found a list and have provided the top few off of the first list that i found   the lists were by company name so there 's no explicit or implicit endorsement of these particular investments examples of reit examples of mlp

from my experience payments from banks and other financial entities such as loyalty programs generally are n't as large as payments that go the other direction from consumer to bank thus keeping a bank account open simply for some reward loyalty points may just be changing your behavior for the wrong reasons the more important scenario is whether or not you have any automated ach payments or whether your bank account is linked to other services perhaps the biggest tell that you 're in the clear is when those transactions start occurring from your credit union account   for example if you had a direct deposit to your bmo bank account make sure you see deposits start to appear in the credit union account if you 're making automatic withdraws to an online savings or brokerage account make sure those transfers are stopped and that you instead see them coming out of your new credit union account you should n't need to move the auto loan but you will need to make sure you can pay it from the new account   some financial advisors such as in this bankrate article titled lenders can tap bank account for mortgage even recommend keeping liabilities and assets at different locations if for whatever reason your financial situation turned bleak it would be more difficult for the bank to help itself to what 's in your checking account to avoid getting nickel and to death by payment processing fees i tend to pay insurance bills yearly or semi annually thus consider if there is anything that may be coming due in the next 6 months if so you might want to get your new account hooked up while you still have all the routing numbers and account numbers in your head it 's a pain to dig this stuff up while also rushing to not be late if all that is in order close the account

from the comments it sounds like you have a technical background so i 'm going to suggest you think of this as a technical problem it 's an optimization problem where the variable you 're trying to optimize for is total interest paid over the lifetime of the loans step 1 is making sure you 're using the credit available to you most efficiently if there 's room in the credit limit for card 1 to move more of your debt there then definitely move your balances from the higher interest cards however be careful some cards will have different interest rates for balance transfers or cash advances and definitely do n't move any principal from card 3 until the 0 interest rate expires pursuing a bank loan as part of step 1 is valid as well you could start with the bank you use for your checking account today credit unions can be a good source of lower interest loans as well ensure that you fully understand the terms and interest rates particularly if they change just be careful about applying for them too many can affect your credit rating negatively you also mention in the comments that you 're paying her mortgage i do n't know how the ownership is set up there but either refinancing or taking out a home equity loan can be a way to consolidate debt the interest rate on a home loan will almost assuredly be less than on your higher rate cards especially taking the tax deduction into account step 2 is paying down the debt efficiently the rule here is simple pay the minimum payment on all cards except for the one with the highest interest rate any money you have above the minimum payments should go into paying down the principal on that one in your case that 's card 2   good luck

first many banks do not keep the loan even if they send you a payment notice and process the monthly payment there 's still a good chance the loan itself was packed up and sold to investors mortgages in and of itself is not inherently dangerous but the loan definitely needs a house behind it if you found a bank that keeps its loans it would be a tough sell you 'd be asking them to trust that you 've chosen the right number to match up with the house you intend to buy and then they 'd need to have another round of processing to turn this into a loan with normal collateral i.e. put a lien on the house and tie them together

gt if you have five to eight dictators fighting at once    you will quickly see these 5 to 8 dictators mutually come to the conclusion that it is not in their interests to fight it out but rather support each other and prevent new or you will see mergers as we saw in the accounting and banking fields you both knock out a competitor and increase your market share in the process    this becomes similar to a government sanctioned monopoly but instead of one firm you have 6 or 8 each recognizing that they 've got a great position as gatekeepers and rent seekers    this is similar to how the healthcare and insurance companies really do n't do very much except extract money they over bill the hospitals then over bill the customers and profit the huge margins   or how the government used to do student loans then instead outsourced to the big banks to do it then recently they determined that big banks were taking tens of billions of dollars in profit for running the program that 's tens of billions of dollars of wealth simply extracted from our taxes    this is why the government under obama decided to kick out the banker middle men and simply issue the exact same loans with the exact same rules a ll by themselves why outsource to a middleman when you can run the exact same program with tons less overhead   it 's also the reason single payer healthcare is tons more efficient over the current model and would save our country trillions over the term    not to mention the of currency you envision is truly a mirage the firms the government chooses as suited enough to pay taxes basically means the government still has the final decision on which currency bonds to accept what if the government then decides only one corp is suited to do this job or only two then it 's functionally no different than teh current situation    right now the world buys usd bonds at extremely low interest rates and this helps fund our government and keeps our nations costs very low under your scenario the government is saying we accept bonds from x y or z and so instead the world runs out to buy xyz bonds at extremely low interest rates   instead of giving our country the funding it needs we 're actually giving xyz corps the low interest rates   this is basically the same downfall of letting the big banks run the student loan program   it gives the firms more power the government less power costs us more tax dollars and gives those firms an undeserved higher place on the food chain    i quite simply disagree with it i would rather our government print the bonds themselves and take the benefit of the low cost of borrowing rather than giving xyz corps more favorable funding to continue world wide expansion and takeover    furthermore if xyz corps are approved by the government for paying tax dollars what do we do in the case of a fiscal emergency such as 2007 when aig basically went bankrupt in a period of only a few months of course this would be sure to happen only right after tax day after the entire country buys aig bonds pays the government in aig bonds and the executives of aig pay themselves huge bonuses then they go bankrupt and the government is left holding all the iou 's which are worthless    and of course traders goldman sachs etc would all know aig was about to get fucked and would make trillions while the us gov received all tax receipts in worthless paper   the fact is with the speed big companies can fall down under the weight of their own the danger is all too real that a full year of tax receipts simply disappears

this is a somewhat complicated question because it really depends on your personal situation   for example the following parameters might impact your optimal asset allocation if you need the money before 3 years i would suggest keeping almost all of it in cash cds treasuries and ultra safe short term corporate bonds if however you have a longer time horizon and since you 're in your 30s you would ideally have decades you should diversify by investing in many different asset classes   this includes australian equity international equity foreign and domestic debt commodities and real estate   since you have such a long time horizon market timing is not that important

they still wo n't reflect reality might be marginally better but people inherently use optimistic assumptions when evaluating acquisitions the cost savings numbers are always overstated synergies tend to be bullshit revenue growth always slows margins are optimistic    the fact is the person getting fucked in this the shareholder does n't really have a seat at the table and all the true decision makers want the deal the ceo wants the deal the bankers want the deal the corp dev team wants the deal as well they need to justify their existence and if they always say no they will be painted as overly negative by a deal ceo and in the end the board almost always listens to the ceo

since you 're 20 30 years out of retirement you should be 90 to 100 in stocks and in one or two broad stock market funds likely i 'm not sure about the minimums at td ameritrade but at vanguard even $ 3k will get you into the basic funds one option is the targeted retirement year funds which automatically rebalance as you get closer to retirement   they 're a bit higher expense usually than a basic stock market fund but they 're often not too bad   look for expenses under 0.5 annually and preferably much lower i pay 0.05 on mine for example    otherwise i 'd just put everything into something simple an s&p500 tracker for example spy or voo are two examples that has very low management fees   then when your 401(k gets up and running that may have fewer options and thus you may end up in something more conservative do n't feel like you have to balance each account separately when they 're just starting think of them as one whole balancing act for the first year or two   once they 're each over $ 10k or so then you can balance them individually which you do want to do to allow you to get better returns

i did n't mean to imply that bankruptcy is a magical process i was using that to clarify my use of conservative vs. aggressive to be fair i guess it can vary depending on your perspective if you 're taking the perspective of the debt laden company then yes on the side of a higher value could be defined as aggressive if you 're taking the perspective of someone looking to acquire business i would say on the side of a higher value is conservative    if the debt is trading at say $ 0.20 on the dollar then yes i can agree that the market value of the debt is likely more representative of the book value i guess i was n't thinking of that type of extreme example a more common scenario i 'd encounter would be a the debt trading at maybe $ 0.95 on the dollar and b taking the perspective of someone looking to invest in the equity which is why i 'd say that it 's more conservative to use the higher value which is the book value   so i 'm persuaded that using market value of the debt can make sense in some cases but i would still argue that the book value might make more sense in other cases

in general stock markets are very similar to that however you can also put in limit orders to say that you will only buy or sell at a given price these sit in the market for a specified length of time and will be executed when an order arrives that matches the price or better traders who set limit orders are called liquidity or price makers as they provide liquidity i.e. volume to be traded to be filled later if there is no counterparty i.e. buyer to your seller in the market a market maker a large bank or brokerage who is licensed and regulated to do so will fill your order at some price that price is based on how much volume i.e. trading there is in that stock on average this is called average daily volume adv and is calculated over varying periods of time we use which is the 30 day average you can always sell stocks for whatever price you like privately but a market order does not allow you to set your price you are a price taker therefore that kind of order will always fill at a market price as mentioned above limit orders will not fill until the price is hit but will stay on book as long as they are n't filled expired or cancelled

firstly i think you need to separate your question into two parts if you are chinese live in china and intend to stay in china for most of your life then the default answer to question 1 should be   question 2 is not as important you can hold usd in almost any country in the world any investment you hold has risk which may include market risk credit risk liquidity risk inflation risk etc holding usd will expose you to exchange rate fluctuations as well   if the rises in value against the dollar your returns in usd will be reduced by the same amount remember that for currency fluctuations you have to multiply the percentages see here for a good explanation the first thing you probably want to do is find out exactly what the assets are in the you have invested in   the fact that there is a risk level even if it is only 2 would suggest to me that the fund is investing in some combination of bonds and stocks which means that your returns are not guaranteed and could make a loss interest rates on deposit accounts are mandated by the government in china and the current 12 month deposit rate on rmb is 3   to earn over 3 must be investing your assets in something else i 'm guessing bonds   bear in mind that 1.5 years is a very short amount of time in investments so do n't assume this return will continue   i 'm afraid i 've only been studying chinese for a year so i ca n't really help you much with the link you 've sent through you may want to check if there is any guaranteed minimum return which can be the case in more complex structured products ultimately you will need to pick an investment which you feel gives you the best combination of risk and return for your situation there are a huge amount of options to choose between   the 4 5 you are earning right now is not a huge risk premium on the 3 you could earn in china from a time deposit but in the current environment you may struggle to beat it without taking on more risk   before considering that though understand how much risk you already have with

i do n't have a formula for anything like this but it is important to note that the current value of any asset is really theoretical until you actually sell it for example let 's consider a house   you can get an appraisal done on your house where your home is inspected and the sales of similar houses in your area are compared   however this value is only theoretical   if you found yourself in a situation where you absolutely had to sell your house in one week you would most likely have to settle for much less than the appraised value the same hold true for collectibles   if i have something rare that i need cash for immediately i can take it to a pawn shop and get cash   however if i take my time and locate a genuinely interested collector i can get more for it this is comparable to someone who holds a significant percentage of shares in a publicly held corporation   if the current market value of your shares is $ 10 million but you absolutely need to sell your entire stake today you are n't going to get $ 10 million   but if you take your time selling a little at a time you are more likely to get much closer to this $ 10 million number a motivated seller means that the price will drop

i am asking because startups are super risky and 99 of the times you fail and lose the money first of all that 99 number is exaggerated only 96 of companies fail within ten years but starting your own business is not a pure game of chance it mostly depends on how good your business idea is and if you have the necessary skills and resources to succeed with it yes there is luck involved but a smart businessman can calculate the risks and possible rewards and then decide if a certain business idea is a good or a bad gamble also a business failing does not necessarily mean that the business owner failed a good business owner knows when to fold a business might be profitable at first but market circumstances might change at any time making it unprofitable a smart business owner notices that early liquidates the unprofitable business as quickly as possible and on their next business idea only those who can not let go of an unprofitable business or take too long to notice that it is failing are those who get dragged down with it so should you have a startup fund saving your disposable income is never a mistake if you never end up starting a business it will eventually serve you as a retirement fund so yes you should save a part of your money each month but should you start a company with it that depends on whether or not you have a business idea where you know you will succeed how do you know that when you answered yes to all of these questions then you might want to consider it

a distribution is typically a return of capital in other words you 're getting money back that you 've contributed previously and thus would have been taxed upon in previous years when those funds were first to you distributions are nontaxable so they do not represent income from capital gains but do effect your cost basis when determining the capital gain loss once that capital gain loss is realized as an example publicly traded real estate investment trusts reits generally distribute a return of capital back to shareholders throughout the year as a distribution this is a return of a portion of the shareholder 's original capital investment not a share of the reits profits so it is simply getting a portion of your original investment back and thus is not income being received i like to refer to it as new income to differentiate however the return of capital does change the cost basis of the original investment so if one were to then sell the shares of the reit in this example the basis of the original investment has to be adjusted by the distributions received over the course of ownership in other words the cost basis will be reduced when the shares are sold i 'm wondering if the op could give us some additional information about his her s corp what type of business is it in the course of its business and trade activity does it buy and sell securities stocks etc does it sell assets or business property does it own interests in other corporations or partnerships sales of those interests are one form of capital gain long term capital gains are taxed at rates lower than ordinary income but the irs has very specific rules as to what constitutes a capital gain loss i hate to answer a question with a question but we need a little more information before we can weigh in on whether you have actual capital gains or losses in the course of your s corporation trade

i would use neither method   taking a short example first with just three compounding periods with interest rate 10   the start value is 1 so after three years the value is the same as 1 + depreciating like inflation by 10 to demonstrate gets us back to = 1 appreciating and depreciating by 10 cancels out appreciating by 10 interest and depreciating by 3 inflation this is the same as 1 + 1 + = so for 50 years the result is 1 + 1 + = note you can of course use subtraction but the not using the inflation figure directly   e.g. edit this appears to be the fisher equation 2nd note further to comments here is a chart to illustrate how much the relative performance improves when inflation is accounted for   the first fund 's return is 6 and the second fund 's return varies from 3 to 6   inflation is 3

gt even with a pell grant to attend school it can be very hard to get a job that will accommodate a class schedule and also pay enough for basic living expenses and many people around here were not encouraged to pursue education because of the expense and because until 10 15 years ago there were always factories hired and it was expected to start at 18 and stay until retirement   yeah but i know plenty of poor people that got grants and other free money and lived off campus and were able to survive maybe they did n't live like i did or spend like i did but they could get by with that and maybe a part time job i worked all throughout college    gt if you do too well at work they do n't want to give you the time off to move forward problem i had at a law office where i was working way more hours than hired for then told i could n't cut back to our original agreement when the next semester required more seated classes if you do n't excel it 's not worth their trouble to accommodate you because there are plenty of others begging for a job that can work whenever they 're told   i hope you 're not trying to become a lawyer that field is way over saturated

most of stock trading occurs on what is called a secondary market for example microsoft is traded on nasdaq which is a stock exchange an analogy that can be made is that of selling a used car when you sell a used car to a third person the maker of your car is unaffected by this transaction and the same goes for stock trading still within the same analogy when the car is first sold money goes directly to the maker actually more complicated than that but good enough for our purposes in the case of stock trading this is called an initial public offering ipo seasoned public offering for most purposes what this means is that a drop of value on a secondary market does not directly affect earning potential let me add some nuance to this say this drop from 20 $ to 10 $ is permanent and this company needs to finance itself through equity stock in the future it is likely that it would not be able to obtain as much financing in this matter and would either 1 have to rely more on debt and raise its cost of capital or 2 obtain less financing overall this could potentially affect earnings through less cash available from financing one last note in any case financing does not affect earnings except through cost of capital i.e. interest paid because it is neither revenue nor expense financing obtained from debt increases assets cash and liabilities debt and financing obtained from stock issuance increases assets cash and shareholder equity

if the savings rate is the same as the loan rate mathematically it does n't make any difference whether you pay down the loan more and save less or vice versa however if the loan rate is higher than the savings rate it 's better to pay it down as fast as possible the chart below compares paying down the loan and saving equally the gradual scenario versus paying down the loan quickly at 2 x $ and then saving 2 x $   the savings rate for illustration is 2 paying quickly pays down the loan completely by month 51   on the other hand in the gradual scheme the loan ca n't be paid down with the savings until month 54 which then leaves 3 months less for saving   in conclusion it 's better to pay down the higher rate loan first   practically speaking it may be useful to have some savings available

you probably have enough math to satisfy a program as an incoming student however gmat will matter a lot the and their equivalents are going to have more applicants with perfect and higher math backgrounds than they can take if you ca n't distinguish yourself with connections from well published professors who can write good letters for you then they 're probably out of reach which means almost surely that you wo n't get a job at an ivy or equivalent as they are pretty incestuous    basically if you go on the market without a top tier publication before you go out or without a huge endorsement from a big name your best outcome is to land at a school that is the same level as the one from which you receive your degree and you had better have at least 1 decent pub or or a presentation at a top conference with a good pipeline to hope for that   more likely outcome is you have a good job market paper decent pipeline maybe a few conference presentations but no pub or in which case the most likely outcome for you is a step down from the tier of school you were at so if you were at a flagship state program then you will end up in the second tier state programs the worse your portfolio on the market the farther you fall   so if your goal is a flagship state program then you need to be aiming as high as absolutely possible and the chances of getting into those programs are progressively smaller the higher you shoot the flagship state schools like ut and the ivy equivalents like harvard etc will get hundreds if not thousands of applicants ones with backgrounds in working finance or econ or worse i had two physics phd holders start in my cohort with me so you have no chance to compete with that kind of math and programming experience perfect and great recommendations it is very hard but you ca n't win if you do n't play i suppose i would wager that the average number of applications to programs sent by applicants is around 50 so why not aim a few of those applications high and see if anything sticks    computer language proficiency is a good thing to highlight but wo n't win you any big awards by the time you get out of your first year every student should have proficiency in either stata r sas and have some python perl c etc depending on what area of research you go for so you have a head start but not for long    your best shot to improve your chances are good recommendations from professors you know that are research active and big names in their sub fields and in the finance field as a whole next up would be to have an active interest in a research area and be able to discuss write about why you want to research that area do n't just think about it go look up papers that do that sort of research and see what they do and how they do it so that you will know the limitations of that sort of research when i interview a prospective student and they say i am interested in international finance research or any other sort of general field i know they have n't got a clue what they 're interested in which puts them behind again

you do n't need to click i can tell you the answer in one word   one universal truth about big corporations and their ceos they do n't understand anything about computers or technology it simply is n't their expertise if they hear from the television that the most important thing in the world is blockchains they 're going to bite that hook   the most important thing is not blockchains blockchains are almost completely unimportant all a blockchain is is a log file that never gets trimmed or deleted and everyone gets a copy and they verify the contents against each other 's copies it 's not revolutionary and you do n't need it

the few individuals who create the corporations that take advantage of the sharing economy making it broadly accepted and utilized make billions   those who actually do the work of sharing not so much unless they are able to do so out of excess of funds rather than through borrowing   those who utilize the sharing economy save some money because they are n't making the investments in infrastructure cars housing whatever and so are n't paying interest or expending use value   they can invest that money in sharing economy corporations gaining value   so the losers in the sharing economy are those who borrowing in order to share

close the account   the age does n't outweigh the fact that you have to pay for the card   it would be one thing if the credit line was a couple thousand but showing the credit bureaus that you are staying away from the $ does n't really make them think you are any more trustworthy with your available credit   utilization matters when you are staying away from much larger chunks of your available credit across all cards
