i think your best bet here would be hsbc   they will provide the required currencies credit debit cards and very easy to use online banking transfers   this includes an online global account view which features all of your accounts on a single screen and allows you to drag and drop money between accounts regarding fees i suspect you will need to be a premier account holder in order to avoid any fees imposed on transactions such as money transfers and exchanging money between currencies   in my experience hsbc offers extremely good exchange rates when exchanging large amounts of money greater than $ 10,000 gbp 5,000   exchanging small amounts will carry a larger spread but still much better than most banks offer in my experience exchanging gbp 5000 will have a spread of about percent while exchanging more than will have a spread of as little as percent in order to qualify for a premier account if my memory of hsbc uk serves me correctly you will need to have at least gbp 50,000 net across all of your hsbc managed accounts including and other investment accounts in order to open a banking swiss account you will need to travel to switzerland and apply in person   you can not open a foreign bank account remotely   with a foreign investment account i believe you can open accounts remotely   for example i opened an account with fidelity switzerland using my fidelity uk account directly from the uk however obviously fidelity does not provide banking services so this is not of interest to you the simplest thing to do is to visit your local hsbc branch and discuss it with them in person other uk banks such as barclays will also provide such services but in my experience they are not as competitive on fees

first it 's not always the case that etfs have lower expenses than the equivalent mutual funds   for example in the vanguard family of funds the expense ratio for the etf version is the same as it is for the admiral share class in the mutual fund version   with that in mind the main advantages of a mutual fund over an equivalent etf are from a long term investor 's point of view the main disadvantage of mutual funds relative to etfs is the minimum account sizes   especially if the fund has multiple share classes i.e. where better classes get lower expense ratios you might have to have quite a lot of money invested in the fund in order to get the same expense ratio as the etf    there are some other differences that matter to more active investors e.g. intraday trading options etc but for a passive investor the ones above are the major ones   apart from those mutual funds and etfs are pretty similar   personally i prefer mutual funds because i 'm at a point where the fund minimums are n't really an issue and i do n't want to deal with the more aspects of etfs for investors just starting out the lower minimum investment for an etf is a big win as long as you can get commission free trades which is what i 've assumed above

they are limiting your total investment in notes to no more than 10 of your net worth step 1 determine your net worth step 2 divide this number by 10 the answer is the maximum amount you can put at risk through lendingclub the issue is that if you lose all the investment you will not be bankrupted if it was the other way you could invest all your net worth in lendingclub by splitting it among 10 + notes your net worth is   determined exclusive of the value of your home home furnishings and    automobile which means do n't include the house and the stuff in the house that means your net worth is the money in the bank plus the money invested in stocks etfs and mutual funds plus retirement accounts 401 k ira minus loans student credit cards

i 've tried to argue this to some close friends who bought homes pre post crisis if the crisis ever ended they thought it was ridiculous there is a clear where renting makes more sense than buying when appropriate inputs of data are entered into the model i think khan academy did a good run down on the subject and used a relatively good model as well    further than that i read the first few paragraphs and stopped reading it was a commercial i was shocked the entire thing up till 2 paragraphs in is literally a commercial    the supposed explicitly implied by the title is n't actually an it 's a click bait commercial posing as a real article that actually might have some real science below the commercial as you 've indicated but that part also sounds like junk finance to sell the idea to consumers that they should in fact buy homes instead of rent and get loans from banks preferably this one and do anything to achieve that if need be even move in with their parents    this financial institution appears to have a sophisticated public relations marketing team doing their commercials posing as news    very interesting to see the marketing beast itself into something so sophisticated as to contain such clear junk science and click bait i wonder what kind of penetration they are getting with this model and what percentage of those see it for what it is    i suppose that would be a big data question answerable through analytics

the pure numbers answer says you want the refund to be close to $ 0   you can even argue as some answers have that you want to try to maximize the payment without receiving any sanctions for underpaying during the year if you trace the money it 's easy to see why   let 's say you get a paycheck   tag some of the dollars for uncle sam   these are the dollars that eventually will be given to the irs   now consider the following scenarios from the raw numbers like this its clear that you lose utility by setting yourself up for a large refund check   the money was yours the entire time but you chose to give it to uncle sam instead however the raw numbers are only part of the puzzle   if you 're a cold numbers person they 're the part that matters   when the are playing their tax evasion games this is the only thing they are paying attention to   however real humans have a few psychological reasons they may choose to lose utility in terms of raw dollars in exchange for psychological assistance these attitudes exist and may be ideal for any one person   obviously the financially savvy answer of minimize your refund is the ideal answer from a dollars and cents perspective but its up to you to see whether that attitude is right when you account for all of the non measurable things like stress   in general i would lead anyone to minimize your refund but i would be if i did n't include the very real psychological reasons people choose to deviate from it

do you have an adviser mentor for your thesis i 'd recommend talking to them about your goals and see if they have any insight they might have a better idea of your credentials capabilities etc they will also likely be one of the ones to write a letter of so it would be good to get them on board early   if you 're still at the same institution or area from your undergrad then you could probably talk to any of the finance profs you liked as well they could be helpful as well and would know more about your background   since you are doing a thesis anyways i 'd recommend trying to get it published this would be something you would want to hopefully get your mentor involved with the association of business schools abs journal rankings can give you an idea of where you might want to try to publish i 'd think anything at an abs 2 3 would be fantastic a 4 as a masters student is really unlikely but would open almost any door would really help your application although the timing is unlikely to work out assuming you are working on the thesis and also applying to phd school this year because the publication process takes a long time being able to mention in your application that you were targeting a journal or being able to provide an update that you received a revise and might really help with your application also if you end up waiting a year for phd school you 'd also have more time to get your thesis published    i 'd think the math stat background should be pretty solid even if you do n't have all the calc    a ton of your placement post phd will be determined by your phd school so if possible shoot high and try attend the best program you are accepted into rankings could give you a good idea of program strength you can also look at the faculty members cv seeing lots of abs 4 or 4 articles in their research is a good sign that it would be a strong program   i hope this helps i 'm not 100 what you mean by flagship state school if you are thinking top 20 maybe ohio state or comparable then my advice may not apply as much but if you are thinking in terms of a solid reputable state school then i think this might apply

well an empty fridge is a waste of 100 of the cooling   if you are cooling nothing then all of the energy to cool it is wasted   air is not very conductive of heat   its why double glass is more than single pane the air provides an barrier    so in a fridge you want to quickly bring the temperature of items placed inside down to a storage temperature around 1c   having a fridge full of already cold items will allow for a much quicker transfer of heat out of the item placed within   and since the heat is out through a larger mass the amount of cooling required will be the same but because the mean temperature change over time is less the fridge will have to work harder for less time if the fridge is full    but in the end the amount of energy required to cool a full will be higher than an empty one as there is more heat to   but the cost of keeping it cold is spread out among many items   so if you only have 1 orange per day in your fridge and it costs you 30 a month to run your fridge then your oranges have an additional 1 cost on them   but if you use 20 things a day and it costs you 60 a month   it only costs you .1 extra per item

if by investment you mean something that pays you money that you can spend then no but if you view investment as something that improves your balance sheet net worth by reducing debt and reducing how much money you 're throwing away in interest each month then the answer is definitely yes paying down debt is a good investment to improve your overall financial condition however your home mortgage might not be the first place to start looking for pay downs to save money   credit cards typically have much higher interest rates than mortgages so you would save more money by working on eliminating your credit card debt first i believe suze orman said something like if you found an investment that paid you 25 interest would you take it   of course you would   paying down high interest debt reduces the amount of interest you have to pay next month   your same amount of income will be able to go farther do more because you 'll be paying less in interest pay off your credit card debt first and keep it off then pay down your mortgage a few hundred dollars in extra principal paid in the first few years of a 30 year mortgage can remove years of interest payments from the mortgage term whether you plan to keep your home for decades or you plan to move in 10 years having less debt puts you in a stronger financial position

these are all factually correct claims s corporation is a pass through entity so whatever gain you have on the corporate level is passed to the shareholders if your s corp has capital gains you 'll get your pro rata share of the capital gains interest the same dividends you get it on your k-1 earned income taxed as such to you i.e. whether you earn income as a s corp or as a sole proprietor matters not that 's the answer to your bottom line question the big issue however is this you can not have more than 25 passive income in your s corp you pass that limit three consecutive years one off is ok your s corp automatically converts to c corp and you 're taxed at the corporate level at the corporate rates you then lose the capital gains rates personal brackets etc this means that an s corp can not be an investment company most of its income has to be earned not passive another problem with s corp is that people who work as self proprietors incorporated as s corp try to abuse it and claim that the income they earned by the virtue of their own personal performance should n't be taxed as self employed income irs upon such a position and if considerable amounts are at stake will take you all the way up to the tax court to prove you wrong this has happened before you should talk to a licensed tax adviser ea cpa attorney licensed in your state to educate you about what s corp is and how it is taxed and whether or not it is appropriate for you

i used to do this it worked well for my simple case though you are limited in the number of people you can name for example to inherit a share of your estate and as thomas pointed out you do need to have your signature witnessed i would certainly use again for a simple will though i suspect my next will is going to be complicated enough that i 'll actually have to use an attorney note that a significant life change such as getting married may invalidate any current will this is certainly the case in my jurisdiction but this may not necessarily be true for you note that if you die without a will your estate will be divided up in a deterministic manner my wife died recently and as her immediate next of kin and with no children i was therefore entirely for her estate had we had children the children would have received $ 40,000 each the rest coming to me this will depend greatly on your jurisdiction and i 'm not sure what happens if the estate is insufficient i bring this up simply because both my wife and i were happy with the other handling the estate and a will would not have made dealing with her death significantly easier

make sure to check the language describing the discount the company may be matching your contribution by 5 instead of a discount   you will likely be taxed on the match as compensation and your benefit would net to less than 5    the next risk is that you 've increased your exposure if your company does poorly   in the worst case scenario you could lose your wages to a layoff and your portfolio to a falling share price   investing in other companies will diversify this risk as for benefits you get the 5 less taxes for free which is n't a bad thing in my book just do n't put everything you own into the stock   it should be part of your overall investing strategy

because etfs unlike most other pooled investments can be easily shorted it is possible for institutional investors to take an arbitrage position that is long the underlying securities and short the etf   the result is that in a well functioning market where etf prices are what they should be these institutional investors would earn a risk free profit equal to the fee amount how much is this amount though etfs exist in a very competitive market   not only do they compete with each other but with index and mutual funds and with the possibility of constructing one 's own portfolio of the underlying   etf investors are very cost conscious as a result etf fees just barely cover their costs   typically etf providers do not even do their own trading   they issue new shares only in exchange for a bundle of the underlying securities so they have almost no costs   in order for an institutional investor to make money with the arbitrage you describe they would need to be able to carry it out for less than the fees earned by the etf   unlike the etf provider these investors face borrowing and other shorting costs and limitations as a result it is not profitable for them to attempt this   note that even if they had no costs their maximum upside would be a few basis points per year   lots of low risk investments do better than that i 'd also like to address your question about what would happen if there was an etf with exorbitant fees   two things about your suggested outcome are incorrect    if short sellers bid the price down significantly then the shares would be cheap relative to their stream of future dividends and investors would again buy them   in a well functioning market you ca n't bid the price of something that clearly is backed by valuable underlying assets down to near zero as you suggest in your question notice that there are limitations to short selling   the more shares are short sold the more difficult it is to locate share to borrow for this purpose   at first brokers start charging additional fees   as shares become harder to find they require that you obtain a locate which takes time and costs money   finally they will not allow you to short at all   unlimited short selling is not possible if there was an etf that charged exorbitant fees it would fail but not because of short sellers   there is an even easier arbitrage strategy investors would buy the shares of the etf which would be cheaper than the value of the underlying because of the fees and trade them back to the etf provider in exchange for shares of the underlying   this would drain down the underlying asset pool until it was empty    in fact it is this mechanism the ability to trade etf shares for shares of the underlying and vice versa that keeps etf prices fair within a small tolerance relative to the underlying indices

i 'm sorry to hear you 've made a mistake having read the contract of sale we signed i do not see any remedy to your current situation   however i 'm interested in making sure i do not take advantage of you   as such i 'll return the vehicle you can return my money plus the bank fees i paid for the cashiers check tax title and registration and i will look at buying a vehicle from another dealership    this seems to be the most fair resolution   if i were to pay for your mistake at a price i did not agree to it would not be fair to me   if you were to allow this vehicle to go to me at the price we agreed to it would n't be fair to you   if i were to return the car and begin negotiations again or find a different car in your lot it would be difficult for us to know that you were not going to make a similar mistake again at this point i consider the sale final but if you 'd prefer to have the vehicle back as is returning to us the money we gave you as well as the additional costs incurred by the sale then we will do so in order to set things right chances are good you will see them back down   perhaps they will just cut the additional payment in half and say well it 's our mistake so we will eat half the cost or similar but this is merely another way to get you to pay more money    stand firm   i appreciate the thought but i can not accept that offer when will you have payment ready so we can return the car if you are firm that the only two solutions is to keep the car or return it for a full refund plus associated costs i 'd guess they 'd rather you keep the car trust me they still made a profit but if they decide to have it returned do so and make sure they pay you in full plus other costs   bring all your receipts etc and do n't hand over the keys until you have the check in hand then go gladly to another dealership that does n't abuse its customers so badly if you do end up keeping the car do n't plan on going back to that dealership   use another dealership for warranty work and find a good mechanic for non warranty work note that this solution is n't legally required in most jurisdictions read your contract and all documentation they provided at the time of sale to be sure but it 's unlikely that you are legally required to make another payment for a vehicle after the sale is finalized   even if they have n't cashed the check the sale has already been finalized what this solution does though is put you back in the driver 's seat in negotiating   right now they are treating it as though you owe them something and thus you might feel an obligation toward them   re asserting your relationship with them as a customer rather than a debtor is very important regardless of how you proceed you are n't legally culpable and so making sure they understand you are n't will ultimately help you further dealerships operate on negotiation the primary power the customer has in the dealership is the power to walk away from a deal they 've set the situation up as though you no longer have the power to walk away   they did n't threaten with re possession because they ca n't the sale is final they presented as a one path situation you pay   period you do have many options though and they are very familiar with the walk away option   present that as your chosen option either they stick with the original deal or you walk away and they will have to look at getting another car off the lot which is often more important than making a profit for a dealership or selling a slightly used car if they 've correctly pushed the title transfer through or you if that 's your task in your state then your brief ownership will show up on and similar reports and instantly reduces the car 's worth   having the title transfer immediately back to the dealership does n't look good to future buyers so the dealership does n't want the car back   they are just trying to extract more money and probably illegally depending on the laws in your jurisdiction your position as customer and decide now that you 'll be fine if you have to return it and walk away then when you communicate that to them chances are good they 'll simply cave and let the sale stand as is

i 'm not aware that any us bank has any way to access your credit rating in france especially as you basically do n't have one in the us banks are not the only way to get finance for a home   in many regions there are plenty of owner financed or owner will carry homes   for these the previous owner will provide a private mortgage for the balance if you have a large downpayment   no strict lending rules no fancy credit scoring systems just a large enough downpayment so they know they 'll get their money back if they have to foreclose   for the seller it 's a way to shift a house that is hard to sell plus get a regular income often this mortgage is for only 3 10 years but that gives you the time to establish more credit and then refinance   maybe the interest rate is a little higher also but again it 's just until you can refinance to something better or sell other assets then pay the loan off quick for new homes the builders developers may offer similar finance for both owner will carry and developer finance a large deposit will trump any credit rating concerns   there is usually a simplified foreclosure process so they 're not really taking much of a risk so can afford to be flexible make sure the owner mortgage is via a title company trust company or escrow company so that there 's a third party involved to ensure each party lives up to their obligations

it does n't matter what industry 25 is high growth especially for a company of that size their debt equity was flat from 14 to 15 decreased in 16 and has decreased again and they are n't issuing equity so how are they financing themselves   their inventory turnover has been greater than since 2012 because a lot of their sales are n't actually held as inventory so with aws as the huge growth engine along with amazon prime and a significant portion of sales not tied to inventory i 'm not sure why you think the key driver of this equity will be inventory turns that 's just such a value play and frankly i think not that relevant to amazon 's future growth potential   almost all high growth equities are valued on a p e ratio that ratio is out on other metrics like same store sales retail average monthly users social media etc and some sense of how those metrics convert to future earnings   i personally think this method makes sense due to the compounding nature of growth rates and the high variability you are never going to get seriously comfortable with you future earnings projections you basically say what are earnings going to be for the next 12 months and then express growth potential beyond that the quality of earnings and your uncertainty by adjusting the p e.

lenders pay attention to where your down payment money comes from if they see a large transfer of money into your bank account within about a year before your purchase this will cause an issue for you down payments are not just there to make the principal smaller they are primarily used as an underwriting data point to assess your quality as a borrower if you take the money as loan it will count against your credit worthiness if you take the money as a gift it will raise some other red flags all of this is done for a reason if you ca n't get a down payment you are a higher credit risk poor discipline lack of consistent income even if you can currently pay the monthly cost of a mortgage   ps the cost of home ownership is much higher than the monthly mortgage payment will all this mean you won't get a loan of course not you can almost always get some loan but it will likely be at a higher rate than you otherwise would qualify for if you just waited a little bit and saved money for a down payment   another option cheaper house edit the below comments provide examples where gifts were are not a problem my experience from buying a house just a few years ago and my several friends who bought house in the same period some with family gifts and some without is that it is an issue your best bet is to talk in person with an actual mortgage broker in your area who can go through the options with you and the downsides to various approaches

others have made excellent suggestions one thing i would add and this can not be understated is to assess your risk tolerance   we tend to think of investing as a purely rational and financial decision yet myself and so many others when times get tough make emotional decisions doing a risk tolerance test as honestly as possible will help you recognize what you can and ca n't handle    on top of that consider how well you face adversity or celebrations in other areas of life i 've found many similarities in the ways that we handle a gain in our investments to the way we celebrate a raise same thing with adversity once you know this you can begin the process of elimination on funds added the point above this does not consume a lot of time and could end up saving you a great deal of money and emotional so it 's well worth it

the big difference is that you get your money earlier at the start suppose you start on a random day with payday on the last day of the month monthly or on every 2nd wednesday biweekly and it takes 3 days for payroll to ramp up ie if payday is within 3 days on your start date your next paycheck is not on the next payday but on the one after if we assume every month has 30 days to keep things simple it is an average of 4 + days until you get your first paycheck with monthly pay an average of days for weekly it is a bit trickier assuming you get hired at a random date here with being a time until you get paid an average of 10.5 days so you get your first pay an average of 8 days earlier later on that 3 day thing no longer occurs and now the company holds an average of 6.5 days of your pay due to you with biweekly paychecks and about 14.5 days with weekly paychecks if you have monthly pay so with monthly pay on average your bank account has 8 fewer days of   your pay in it at all times   this happens when   you are first hired and persists over the length of your employment now suppose you save that extra money on average suppose you have an investment at 4 after inflation   over 40 years those 8 days of pay invested at 4 grow to 38 days of pay a free month what more if the company has problems making payroll you 'll get a warning to say look for another job an average of 8 days sooner and/or have the money in your account   having someone owe you money is usually worse than having the money in your bank account

you have to realize that you 're trying to have your cake and eat it too   you want to do things unofficially by not reporting the accident to insurance companies and/or police but you want to do it officially in that you want to have legal recourse if they try to hit you up for more money   the only way to have it both ways is to trust the other person from a financial perspective ultimately you need to decide if the monetary cost of your raised insurance premiums etc outweighs the cost of whatever money the other party in the accident will try to squeeze out of you factoring in the likelihood that they will do so   you also would need to factor in the likelihood that rather than trying to scam you they 'll pursue legal action against you in short from a purely monetary perspective if the legitimate cost of repairs is $ 700 and the cost to you of doing it by the book via insurance is $ 2000 you should be willing to be scammed for up to $ 1300 because you 'll still come out ahead   of course there are psychological considerations like whether someone unscrupulous enough to scam you will stop at $ 1300   but those numbers are the baseline for whatever outcome calculations you want to do on the more qualitative side of things it is possible they 're trying to scam you but also possible they 're just trying to hustle you into doing everything quickly without thinking about it   they may not be trying to gouge you monetarily they just want to pressure you so they get their money   i agree with other here that the ideal way would be for them to send you an actual bill after repairs are complete   however you could ask them to send you a written copy of the repair shop estimate along with a written letter in which they state that they will consider payment of that amount to resolve the issue and wo n't pursue you further   the legal strength of that is dubious but at least you have some documentation that you did n't just try to stiff them   if they wo n't give you some form of written documentation i would read that as a red flag bite the bullet and contact your insurance company

common sentiment that no investor can consistently beat the market on returns   i guess its more like very few investor can beat the market a vast majority can not do not what evidence exists for or against this obviously we can have a comparison of all investors if we start taking a look at some of the actively managed funds given that fund managers are experts compared to common individual investors if we compare this we can potentially extend it more generically to others most funds beat the markets for few years as you keep increasing the timeline i.e. try seeing 10 year 15 year 20 year return this is easy the data is available you would realize that no fund consistently beat the index few years quite good few years quite bad on average most funds were below market returns especially if one compares on longer terms or 10 20 years hence the perception of course we all know warren buffet has beat the market by leaps and bounds after the initial success people like warren buffet develop the power of self fulfilling prophecy there would be many other individuals

it depends on what you 're talking about if this is for your retirement accounts like iras then absolutely not in your retirement accounts you should be broadly diversified not just between stocks but also other markets like bonds target retirement funds and solid conservative or moderate allocation funds are the best quick and dirty recommendation for those accounts since it 's for the long haul you want to be managing risk not chasing returns returns will happen over the 40 or so years they have to grow   now if you 're talking about a taxable stock account and you 've gotten past pf questions like am i saving enough for retirement and have i paid off my debt then the question becomes a little more murky   first yes you should be diversified the bulk of how a stock 's movement will be in keeping with how its sector moves so even a really great stock can get if its sector is going down diversification between several sectors will help balance that   however you will have some advantage in this sector knowing which products are good which products everybody in the industry is excited about is a huge advantage over other investors it 'll help you pick the ones that go up more when the sector goes up and down less when the sector goes down that over time and investments really adds up just remember that a good company and a good stock investment are not the same thing a great company can have a sky high valuation and if you buy it at that price you can sit there and watch your investment sink even as the company is growing and doing great things have patience know which companies are good and which are bad and wait for the price to come to you   one final note it also depends on what spot you are in if you 're a young guy looking looking to invest his first few thousand in the market then go for it on the other hand if you 're older and we 're talking about a couple hundred grand you 've got saved up then it 's a whole different ball of wax it that spot you 're back to managing risk and need to build a solid portfolio at a measured pace

this is way too long for a comment so i am posting this as an answer my bet is that you 're buying a new piano it is the only instrument that makes sense the rest of this answer are going to assume this but this should apply well if you 're going after a or for example for those readers that do not know a piano is a very delicate and expensive music instrument my piano is literally more expensive than my car there are a lot of similarities in sales negotiation between buying a piano and buying a car you may be surprised to know that the cost for the dealer to acquire a piano is only around half the listed price therefore the salesperson has a lot of room to negotiate a sale price to you this explains why he was able to make a good offer for the model you are not intending to buy you are best by comparing the final sale price with other similar models in your region or the exact model around your region which you have already did those indicate the standard price in your negotiation you described the dealer had the exact model you desire only in different appearance i assume you want a black color while they have a white or wood pattern one in their showroom note every piano is different even with the exact same model there will be very slight differences in the tune and touch since some processes are hand finished if you 're buying a treat each of them as an individual hand crafted art play the exact instrument you will be buying before closing the deal if they do not have your desired model in the showroom ask for a visit to their inventory facility again play the exact instrument not a showroom model some dishonest dealers will have their showroom regulated and tuned differently than the standard from shipping if you get an extremely good offer proceed with caution there may be defects in that particular instrument look for rust or layers on the strings look for in the hammers listen to clicking when playing the keys these are signs that the instrument has been around for quite a while and they can not sell it you can also copy down the serial number and look up the manufacturing date online before you close the deal ask for after sale services how many free will they provide will they polish your piano after delivery these are bargain chips you can use for final adjustment of the price

gt;why not give extra tax breaks for the sale of stock purchased during a public offering since that goes to helping the company but not for secondhand less necessary trading   because secondary trading determines how easy it is for companies to raise additional money and it also allows the company to manipulate private vs publicly held stakes in their company   we give big tax breaks to people who lend businesses money   there 's a difference between lending money and investing in a corporation furthermore the income tax code when it comes to lending money via bonds is a complete mess corporate bond coupons are taxed like regular income although the principal return is of course tax free federal and are taxed differently there is also the advantage that you do get a tax break in the event of default so any additional risk you take on has some marginal tax benefits

yes quite easily in fact   you left a lot of numbers out so lets start with some assumptions if you are at the median of middle income families in the us that might mean $ 15 of that is an investment of $ per month if you invest that amount monthly and assume a 6 return then you will have a million dollars at approximately 57 years old 6 is a very conservative number and as ben miller points out the s&p 500 has historically returned closer to 11 if you assumed an aggressive 9 return and continued with that $ for 40 years until you turn 65 that becomes $ 4 million start with a much more conservative $ 9/hr for $ per year 40 hours 52 weeks no overtime if that person saved 14 of his her income or about $ per month from 25 to 65 years old with the same 9 they would still achieve $ 1 million for retirement is it much harder for a poor person certainly but hopefully these numbers illustrate that it is better to save and invest even a small amount if that 's all that can be done high income earners have the most to gain if they save and the most to lose if they do n't let 's just assume an even $ salary and modest 401(k match of 3 even married filing jointly a good portion of that salary is going to be taxed at the 25 rate if single you 'll be hitting the 28 income tax rate   if you can max out the $ 18,000 2017 contribution limit and get an additional $ 3,000 from an employer match for a total monthly contribution of $ 40 years of contributions would become $ million with the 9 rate of return   if you withdrew that money at 4 per year you would have a residual income of $ 300k throughout your retirement

this depends strongly on what you mean by stock trading   it is n't a single game but a huge number of games grouped under a single name you can invest in individual stocks if you 're willing to make the large effort needed to research the companies and their current position and this can yield large returns at high risk or moderate returns at moderate risk you need to diversify across multiple stocks and multiple kinds of stocks and probably bonds and other investment vehicles as well to manage that risk or you can invest in managed mutual funds where someone picks and balances the stocks for you they charge a fee for that service which has to be subtracted from their stated returns you need to decide how much you trust them you will usually need to diversify across multiple funds to get the balance of risk you 're looking for with a few exceptions like target date funds or you can invest in index funds which automate the stock picking process to take a wide view of the market and count on the fact that over time the market as a whole moves upward these may not produce the same returns on paper but their fees are much lower enough so that the actual returns to the investor can be as good as or better than managed funds the same point about diversification remains true with the same exceptions or you can invest in a mixture of these plus bonds and other investment vehicles to suit your own level of confidence in your abilities confidence in the market as a whole risk tolerance and so on having said all that there 's also a huge difference between trading and investing at least as i use the terms stock trading on a short term basis is much closer to pure gambling unless you do the work to deeply research the stocks in question so you know their value better than other people do and you 're playing against pros you know the rule about poker if you look around the table and do n't see the sucker he 's sitting in your seat well that 's true to some degree in short term trading too this is n't quite a zero sum game but it takes more work to play well than i consider worth the effort investing for the long term defining a balanced mixture of investments and maintaining that mixture for years with purchases and sales chosen to keep things balanced is a positive sum game since the market does drift upward over time at a long term average of about if you 're sufficiently diversified which is one reason i like index funds you 're basically riding that rise this puts you in the position of betting with the pros rather than against them which is a lower risk position of course the potential returns are reduced too but i 've found that market rate of return has been entirely adequate though not exciting of course there 's risk here too if the market dips for some reason such as the great recession we just went through but if you 're planning for the long term you can usually ride out such dips and perhaps even see them as opportunities to buy at a discount others can tell you more about the details of each of these and may disagree with my but that 's the approach i 've taken based on advice i trust i could probably increase my returns if i was willing to invest more time and effort in doing so but i do n't especially like playing games for money and i 'm getting quite enough for my purposes and spending near zero effort on it which is exactly what i want

in the uk using a credit card adds a layer of protection for consumers if something goes wrong or you bought something that was actually a scam if you inform the credit card company with the necessary documents they   will typically clear the balance for that purchase essentially the burden of debt is passed to them and they themselves will have to chase up the necessary people section 75 of the consumer credit act   i personally use my credit card when buying anything one would consider as   consumer spending tvs furniture ect i then pay off the credit card immediately this gives me the normal benefits of the credit card if you get cashback or points plus the additional consumer credit protection on all my purchases   this in my opinion is the most effective way of using your credit card

interest is a fee that you pay in order to use someone else 's money once you 've made the deal pretty much anything you do that reduces the total interest that you pay does so by reducing the time for which you get to use their money as an extreme example consider a thirty year interest only loan with a balloon payment at the end if you pay it off after fifteen years you pay half as much interest because you had the use of the money for half as long the same thing happens when you make biweekly payments you reduce the total interest that you pay by giving up the use of some of the borrowed money sooner that 's not necessarily bad but it 's also not automatically good

  adding to h answer about damage limitation online purchases could include phone tablet app purchases which could be an issue if you have children or you are a victim of fraud first link from googling kid racks up almost $ 6,000 on world in app purchases adding to c. answer i think credit cards perhaps can make it more difficult to budget if you are more lazy have limited savings   these might happen more long term if you do n't keep track of your spending i.e. if your credit limit matches your monthly income and if you pay off your card each month i think it is harder to overspend as you do n't have more credit available than you can afford to spend however this is countered by that a slightly higher credit limit may help to avoid fees from exceeding your credit card limit i think due to that some not all purchases are instantly banked i.e. the shop might send all of its monies to its bank at the end of the day or something like this so you can just keep spending not realising you have exceeding your credit limit and get hit by fees

now is there any clever way to combine forex transactions so that you receive the us interest on $ 100 k instead of the $ 2 k you deposited as margin   yes absolutely but think about it why would the interest rates be different imagine you 're making two loans one for 10,000 usd and one for 10,000 chf and you 're going to charge a different interest rate on the two loans why would you do that there is really only one reason you would charge more interest for the currency that you think is less likely to hold its value such that the expected value of the money you are repaid is the same in other words currencies pay a higher interest when their value is expected to go down and currencies pay a lower interest when their value is expected to go up so yes you could do this but the profits you make in interest would have to equal the expected loss you would take in the devaluation of the currency people will only offer you these interest rates if they think the loss will exceed the profit unless you know better than them you will take a loss

as many people here have pointed out a cfd is a contract for difference when you invest in stock at etoro you buy a cfd reflecting a bid on the price movement of the underlying stock however you do not actually own the stock or hold any rights shareholders have the counterparty to the cfd is etoro when you close your position etoro shall pay you the amount representing the difference between your buy and sell price for each stock   i suggest you read the following article about cfds it explains everything clearly and thoroughly as some of the responders have pointed out and as is mentioned in the article a broker can potentially the prices of underlying assets in order to manipulate cfds to their advantage however etoro is a highly reputable broker with over 2 million active accounts and we guarantee accurate stock quotes furthermore etoro is regulated in europe germany uk france etc by institutions that exact strict regulations on the cfd trading sector and we are obligated to comply with these regulations which include accurate price quoting   and of course cfd trading at etoro has tremendous benefits unlike a direct stock investment etoro allows you to invest as much or as little as you like in your favorite stocks even if the amount is less than the relevant stock price i.e. fraction stocks for example   if you invest $ 10 in microsoft and on the day of execution etoro ’s average aggregated price was $ 30 after a spread of 0.1 you will then have a cfd representing stocks of microsoft in your etoro account in addition with etoro you can invest in stock in the context of a social trading network meaning that you can utilize the stock trading expertise of other trader to your advantage by following them learning their strategies and even copying their stock investments automatically to put it briefly you wo n’t be facing the stock market alone   before you make a decision i suggest that you try stock trading with an etoro demo account a free demo account grants you access to all our instruments at real market rates as well as access to our social network where you can view and participate in trader discussions about trading stocks with etoro all without risking your hard earned money bottom line it ’s free there are no strings attached and you can get a much idea of what trading stocks with etoro is like if you have any further questions please do n’t hesitate to contact us through our site

it really depends on the tasks and how things are going   well allocated work probably takes less than 40 hours a week most of the time but might take a lot more than that sometimes   it really depends   being in a really small company leaves little room for and then there is ambition   do you really want to dominate your industry   then there is the kind of work   truly creative work might be so intense that it tops out around 20 hours a week and everything above that is   that was what i meant by not fitting neatly into standard arrangements   it also has a lot to do what else there is in your life competing   it might be necessary to leave earlier than most to make time for afternoon activities or time with children   defining desirable intervals outside work may be the most important part of knowing what work hours make sense   ultimately it is necessary to understand that balancing work and life is complicated and may have no good answers   sometimes work may be life and other times it may compete vigorously with good living   simply saying anything over a standard 40 hour work week is too much might be a good place to draw the line or that might be a way of avoiding really thinking through where you want to be since that arrangement is only going to be idea for a subset of people   maybe for some 45 is the breaking point and for others 35 is right or maybe just it and leaving after a certain number of things are done is right   this emphasis on time drops away completely under results only work environment rowe arrangements but that leads directly to legal issues because we treat time as sacred no mater how much is spent at the desk or water cooler

i 'm not sure there 's a good reason to do a closing the books ceremony for personal finance accounting and you 're not only wanting to do that but have a fiscal year that 's different from the calendar year yikes my understanding is that usually this process is done for businesses to be able to account for what their retained earnings and such are for investors and tax purposes generally individuals would n't think of their finances in those terms it 's certainly not impossible though gnucash for example implements a closing books feature which is designed to create transactions for each income and expenses account into an end of year equity retained earnings account it does n't do any sort of closing out of assets or liabilities however and i 'm not sure how that would make any sense as you 'd transfer it from your asset to the end of year closing account and then transfer it back as an opening balance for the next year if you want to keep each year completely separate the page about closing books in the gnucash wiki mentions that one can create a separate gnucash file per year by exporting the account tree from your existing file then importing that tree and the balances into a new file i expect that it makes it much more challenging to run reports across multiple years of data though while your question does n't seem to be specific to gnucash i just mention it because it 's the accounting tool i 'm most familiar with i 'd expect that any accounting program would have similar functionality i would however like to point out this section from the gnucash manual note that closing the books in gnucash is unnecessary you do not need to zero out your income and expense accounts at the end of each financial period gnucash ’s built in reports automatically handle concepts like retained earnings between two different financial periods in fact closing the books reduces the usefulness of the standard reports because the reports do n’t currently understand closing transactions so from their point of view it simply looks like the net income or expense in each account for a given period was simply zero and that 's largely why i 'm just not sure what your goals are if you want to look at your transactions for a certain time to just focus on the range of years i 'm interested in for any given purpose as you say then just go ahead and run the report you care about with those years as the dates the idea of closing books comes from a time when you 'd want to take your pile of paper ledgers and go put them in storage once you did n't need to refer to them regularly computers now have no challenges storing every account from the beginning of time at all and you can filter out that data to focus on whatever you 're looking for easily if you do n't want to look at the old data just do n't include them in your reports i 'm pretty sure that 's the better way to keep the books manageable

if you just buy a few lotto tickets normally then no it 's not going to be a good investment as has shown however there are certain scenarios where you can get a positive expected value from a lottery in 2012 it was revealed that some mit students found a scheme to game the massachusetts state lottery   the game called cash had a in the rules the jackpot prize was capped at $ 2 million   any money in the jackpot beyond $ 2 million would increase the payout of the consolation prizes   thus the game would sometimes have a positive expected value   the return on investment was 15 to 20 enough for the participants to quit their jobs this specific loophole is no longer available a cap was placed on the number of tickets sold per store then the game was discontinued altogether another possible strategy is to buy enough tickets to nearly assure a win as one investment group did in 1992   given a large enough jackpot this strategy can yield a positive expected value but not a guaranteed profit caveats include or you might be a genius and exploit a flaw in the lottery 's number generator as one statistician did in an ontario scratch off lottery in 2011

if i was an upside down homeowner and i went to my bank to refinance the mortgage at a lower rate and they declined i 'd give them the middle finger by not paying the mortgage and declaring bankruptcy     a homeowner has no incentive to continue paying a mortgage for a home that is no longer the value of the mortgage and if the bank is unwilling to work with the upside down homeowner to get the home owner a lower interest rate that is the least the bank could do then make the home the bank 's problem and let them eat their cake    this home owner is not asking the bank to forgive part of the mortgage or write it off but asking for his mortgage to be refinanced at the lower rate that is pretty straight forward and simple we as taxpayers bailed the banks out in 2008 the least they could do is help upside down homeowners the banks reluctance to help upside down homeowners is why we have a stagnant housing market    the bank by not working with this home owner to refinance his mortgage at a lower interest rate is a bank that indicates they do n't care about having a paying customer

i do n't think that 's the case    i mean of course some of the new money supply is making it into the stock market but i think it 's because of the factors i listed the money supply is n't growing faster now than it has in the past    here is m2 since 1980 on a log scale because a percent change is more relevant than a change in raw dollars just like stock market returns     i am using m2 because it 's a more complete measure of liquidity   here is the percent change over time in m2 just to show that the qe is n't really doing anything out of the ordinary     here you can see the inflation rate      what quantitative easing has done is drive bond prices lower which i already mentioned it can also be argued that qe has expanded wealth inequality but i already mentioned that as well

i think that all else being equal if more people have solar panels on our roof we keep our military in fewer countries instead of planning on ramping up the number see nigeria furthermore the initial question was n't whether installing solar panels is going to stop the action the conversation started by being about whether solar is actually cheaper when you factor in the amount used to subsidize both sources of energy not whether switching to solar would stop subsidies to oil what you did is called moving the goalposts   the word 2016 does n't show up in the article or in the study it cites that was a typo i understand it was about 2013 i was trying to saying that it was about the same year as yours that was my bad i read the whole thing originally and i even read the study i accept responsibility for the typo though   anyways neither set of data is manipulated my study just includes more things like foreign tax credits cleanup subsidies for both coal and oil tar sands exemption from cleanup funds power africa a five year 7 billion dollar program that was only announced in 2013 that overseas stuff that goes on is a huge part of the equation    and okay so they are n't equivalent then your point is moot yes both sides have off the book subsidies but one side 's off the book subsidies are so bigger that it 's laughable to even put them in the same category not to mention the costs of war in the middle east stretch beyond money think lives and recycling programs actually come with benefits think smaller

an old question but the recent answer for me turned out to be check formerly note check was recently purchased by intuit and is now the only thing check does n't do that paytrust did was accept paper bills from payees that could n't do but that 's a rare problem anymore for me anyways   i went through each of my payees in paytrust and added them into check it found almost all of them i added my security info for their logins and it was setup the few that check could n't find it asked me for the details and would contact them to try and get it setup but in the meantime i just added them to my bank 's billpay system with automatic payment rules my mortgage company was the only one it could n't find and i know what my mortgage is every month so it 's easy to setup a consistent rule check does so much more than paytrust will ever do check has a mobile app and it is really the of the whole system you never really log into the website from your desktop except to setup all the payees most of the time you just get alerts on your phone when a bill is due and you just click pay and choose a funding source and bam you 're done it 's been awesome so far i highly recommend dumping paytrust for it fyi   check is clearly winning at this point but some of the competition are   are not sure if you can pay your bills through them though and

keeping your big emergency fund in stocks if you have 12 months income saved is ok    however you should keep your small emergency fund in cash    however i find that even my stock broker accounts have some cash in them as i like to let the dividends build up enough to make the dealing charges worthwhile   you do n’t wish to be forced to sell at a bad time due to your boiler needing replacing or your car breaking down      however if you lost your job in the same week that your boiler broke down and your car needed replacing then being forced to sell stocks at a bad time is not much of an issue also if you are saving say 1/3 of your income each month and you have a credit card with large unused credit limit that is paid of each month then most small emergency that are under 2/3 of your monthly income can be covered on the credit card with little or no interest charges one option is to check you bank balance on the day after you are paid and if it is more than 2x your monthly income then move some of it to long term savings but only if you tend to spend a lot less then you earn most months

the simple answer is that what you are doing is an incredible waste of time the normal process is to charge say in january the bill is cut at month end and due by the 15th of february no interest accrues as long as the credit line is sufficient for your monthly spending that 's it   now if you are watching your score closely utilization might become an issue if the statement amount is much over 20 there 's an impact to your score this is easily addressed with a second monthly payment made just before the bill is cut   keep in mind the phrase carrying a balance commonly means not paying the bill in full and letting interest accumulate i understand you did n't mean that the way you are paying your account is n't common and really serves no value

since you seem to be interested in investing in individual stocks this answer will address that   as for the general question of investing the answer that @johnfx gave is just about as good as it gets investing in individual stocks is extremely risky and takes a lot of work to do right   on top of the fairly obvious need to research a stock before you buy there is the matter of keeping up with the stocks to know when you need to sell as well as myriad other facets of investing   paid professionals spend all day every day doing this and they have a hard time beating an index fund   unless you take the time to educate yourself and are willing to continually put in a good bit of effort i would advise you to stay away from individual stocks and rely on mutual funds

i think your approach of looking exclusively at usd deposits is a prudent one here are my responses to your questions 1 it is highly unlikely that a usd deposit abroad be converted to local currency upon withdrawal the reason for offering a deposit in a particular currency in the first place is that the bank wants to attract funds in this currency 2 interest rate is a function of various risks mostly supply and demand central bank policy perceived risk etc in recent years low interest rate policy as led by u.s. european and japanese central banks has led particularly low yields in certain countries disregarding their level of risk which can vary substantially thus e.g. eastern europe has very low yields at the moment in spite of its perceived higher risk some countries offer depository insurance   3 i would focus on banks which are among the largest in the country and boast good corporate governance i.e. their ownership is clean and transparent and they are true to their business purpose thus ownership is key then come financials country depository insurance low external threat low war risk is also important most banks require a personal visit in order to open the account thus i would n't split much further than 2 3 banks assuming these are good quality

your employer 's matching contribution is calculated based on the dollar amounts you end up putting in the nature of your 401(k contribution whether pre tax or roth after tax doesn't matter with respect to how their match gets calculated and their match always goes into a pre tax account even if you are contributing after tax the onus is on you to choose a contribution amount that maximizes your employer match regardless of the nature of your contribution maximizing your employer match using roth after tax contributions will eat up more of your annual gross salary but as long as you are willing to do that then you wo n't leave free employer match money on the table roth after tax contributions do n't get the tax deduction inherent in a pre tax contribution the tradeoff is that you end up with less take home pay per period if you contribute the same number of dollars on a roth after tax basis to your 401(k as opposed to on a pre tax basis for instance to make a maximum $ 18,000 roth after tax contribution to a 401(k it 's going to cost you a lot more than $ 18,000 of your annual gross salary to net the same $ 18,000 number on the flip side the roth money is worth more in retirement than pre tax money because it wo n't be subject to taxes then however 401(k plan contribution amounts are almost always expressed as a percentage of gross salary i.e. in pre tax terms even when electing to make after tax contributions so when electing after tax one is implicitly accepting that the contribution will cost more than the percentage of gross salary because you 'll need to pay the tax on a gross amount that would yield the same number of dollars but as an after tax amount

there are far more questions to be addressed here than one answer can address let me work backwards and start with the easy part i make $ 120k yr what can i afford you are making $ 10k mo a great income a well written mortgage will allow you to use 28 for housing that 's the mortgage property tax insurance and hoa on $ 2800 let 's take out $ 500 for prop tax and just $ 300 for insurance i 'll even ignore hoa for now the remaining $ will fund a mortgage of $ 400k. that 's not close to a $ 700 k condo   a $ 550 k mortgage would cost $ and $ 3600 with tax and insurance $ 4100 with hoa over 40 of your gross and a sign that you are in over your head   the real question is why you 'd want to do this $ rent means you can save $ in addition to what you already save if you stay put

it depends on what your plans for the future are taking out a loan is not a bad thing if it is at a good rate and under good terms and you are sure you can handle the payments if you buy the car with cash you may be giving up the opportunity to later get a great rate on that $ 8k however you are probably not utilizing that $ 20k to make as much interest as you 'd then be paying if you did take the $ 8k on loan since you say house fund i assume you are saving to make a down payment on a new house if you plan to buy that house within the next 6 months the hard pulls on your credit report from applying for the car loan will probably ding your credit score for the next 6 months which might cost you on your mortgage rate however if you do n't plan to buy for a few more years and if you 've never had a car payment before then the auto loan would actually be adding diversity to your credit history and in the long run would help your score another factor to consider is the loan to value ratio you are shooting for ltv affects the interest rate requirements for private mortgage insurance etc mortgage rates are at an all time low and lower than auto rates so depending on the terms of the house purchase that $ 8k might be better spent on the car than the house in short if you want to buy the house soon rates are market is a buyer 's market and you need that $ 8k to get a better mortgage rate or prevent you from being required to buy pmi you should probably put it toward the house otherwise you should probably put it toward the car last piece of advice if you absolutely must buy a house and a car in the same short time frame do them both on the same day so that your credit score is not dinged before applying for one or the other with mortgages this may be difficult considering the longer closing procedures but try to time it so that your credit is getting checked by the mortgage broker and the auto lender on the same day

because even if you won the lottery without at least some credit history you will have trouble renting cars and hotel rooms i learned about the importance and limitations of credit history when in the 90 's i switched from using credit cards to doing everything with a debit card and checks purely for convenience eventually my unused credit cards were not renewed at that point in my life i had saved a lot and had high liquidity i even bought new autos every 5 years with cash then last decade i found it increasingly hard to rent cars and sometimes even a hotel rooms with a debit card even though i would say they could whatever they thought necessary to cover any expenses i might run i started investigating why and found out that hotels and car rentals saw having a credit card as a proxy for low risk that you would damage the car or hotel room and not pay so then i researched credit cards credit reports and how they worked they have nothing about any savings investments or bank accounts you have i had no idea this was the case and since i had n't had cards or bought anything on credit in over 10 years there were no records in my credit files old closed accounts had fallen off after 10 years so i opened a couple of secured credit cards with the highest security deposit allowed they unsecured after a year or so then i added several rewards cards i use them instead of a debit card and always pay in full and they provide some cash back so i save money compared to just using a debit card after 4 years my credit score has gone to 800 + even though i have never carried any debt and use the cards as if they were debit cards i was very foolish to have stopped using credit cards 20 years ago but just had no idea of the importance of an established credit history and note that establishing a great credit history does not require that you borrow money or take out loans for anything just get credit cards and pay them in full each month

is it equity or debt understanding the exact nature of one 's investment equity vs. debt is critical when one invests money in a company presumably incorporated or limited by buying some or all of it as opposed to lending money to the company then one ends up owning equity shares or stock in the company in such a situation one is a shareholder not a creditor as a shareholder one is not generally owed a money debt just by having acquired an ownership stake in the company shareholders with company equity generally do n't get to treat money received from the company as repayment of a loan unless they also made a loan to the company and the payment is designated by the company as a loan repayment rather shareholders can receive cash from a company through one of the following sources loan repayment is n't one of those options it 's only an option if one made a loan in the first place anyway each of those ways of receiving money based on one 's shares in a company has distinct tax implications not just for the shareholder but for the company as well you should consult with a tax professional about the most effective way for you to repatriate money from your investment considering the company is established overseas you may want to find somebody with the appropriate expertise

market cap does n't mean that much money went into the system money in equals money out over time and is not directly tied to market cap which can actually be lower if price drops far enough these concepts are the same for all traded assets such as stocks bonds and commodities market cap is simply the current price times the number of shares available in the market so a $ 300 billion market cap does not mean $ 300 billion was paid to somebody to buy it all instead what 's happened is that some money went in at first but much much less and then price increased   bitcoin is a little different in that money in for many innovators and early adopters was in the form of time spent and contributing to the network what they call mining 1 now as to the price jump that 's an effect of market forces for many reasons the market has to buy bitcoin over the last year 2 but many already holding bitcoin were n't ready to sell supply and demand worked in a way that increased price supply low demand high price increases   this situation could easily reverse just as suddenly as the market wanted bitcoin it can decide it does n't want bitcoin supply and demand would work in a way that would decrease price supply high demand low price decreases   this kind of massive market price movement in this short timeframe is exactly what traders mean by volatile it 's actually not that unusual it 's just that most stocks and other assets that experience such gains do n't get much media attention further gains like this often reflect inflated prices market euphoria and trading bubbles all of these terms essentially mean price will correct go down eventually because price is currently much higher than actual value   if the market loses all faith in the asset price will drop to zero and the money in equals money out breaks down some traders will be left holding the bag   meaning they owned the stock at the moment trading permanently ceased 3 notes exact reasons can not be with facts instead we enter the realm of opinion on this point in my opinion bitcoin has increased massively in value mostly due to the media attention it has received and this media attention is not new it received equally pervasive attention in 2013 as an effect price went from under $ 100 to over $ 1000 back to under $ 200 in about 20 months it 's great news if you 're a trader you could have made tons of money as for the early it was actually kind of annoying because it then brought in all the skeptics calling it a ponzi scheme or pyramid scheme despite the quite obvious fact that bitcoin can not be either by definition further upward market forces may have come from the fact that bitcoin is built on an innovative technology that may very well change the way we do a lot of things in the future i 'm referring to blockchain this effect can be seen in several failing companies rising from the like simply by adding the work blockchain to their name i personally find this exactly analogous to the dot com bubble where companies in the late 1990 's made millions in stock simply by adding .com to their name despite having no profits or sometimes not even a working product for high volatility stocks this is not unusual many penny stocks fail and typically the road down is faster than the road up bitcoin may indeed fail but again it 's a bit different than a stock bitcoin is not a company there 's no financials for bitcoin no vc investors board members to report to no product to produce etc bitcoin is designed to simply be a thing itself the hope is to disrupt currency and commodity markets and create a new store of value literally bitcoin is designed to have intrinsic value whether it 's actually working at this point is still unknown

this is a hard question to answer   government debt and mortgages are loosely related   banks typically use yields on government bonds to determine mortgage interest rates   the banks must be able to get higher rates from the mortgage otherwise they would buy government bonds your question mentions default so i 'm assuming a country has on its promise to pay either the principal or interest on government bonds the main thing to consider is who does not get their money   in other words who does the government decide not to pay   this is the important part   the government will have some money so they could pay some bond holders   they must decide who to for example let 's look at who holds greek government debt   around 70 of greek government debt is held outside greece   see table below   the greek government could decide to default only on the debt to foreign holders   in that case the banks in france and switzerland would take the loss on their bonds   this could cause severe problems in france and switzerland depending on the percentage of greek bonds that make up the banks assets   greek banks would still face losses however since the price of their greek bond holdings would drop sharply when the government defaults   interestingly the losses for the greek banks may be smaller than the losses faced by the french and swiss banks   this is usually the favored option chosen by government since the french and swiss do n't vote in greece yields on greek government bonds would rise dramatically   if your greek mortgage is an adjustable rate mortgage then you could see some big adjustments upward   if you live in france or switzerland then the bank that owns your mortgage may go under if greece defaults   during liquidation the bank will sell their assets which includes mortgages and you will probably not notice any difference in your mortgage as i stated earlier this is a hard question to answer since the two financial instruments involved bonds and mortgages are similar but may or may not be related

you need to report the interest expense assuming the loans were for your business you need to report interest expense only interest principle is not an expense just as the loan proceeds are not income the interest expense goes to the appropriate line on your schedule c or e depending on whether you used the loan for the online business or the rental people whom you borrowed from must also report the interest as income to them on their schedule b. you can not deduct the interest expense if they do n't report it as interest income if you did n't take the loans for your business then the interest is not deductible you do n't need to report anything people who lent you money still have to report the interest you paid to them as income on schedule b. if you paid no interest free loan or below above market interest to a related party family member then the imputed interest is considered income to them and gift to you they need to report it on their schedule b and depending on amounts on a gift tax return for $ 1 k to $ 10 k loans there probably will be no need in gift tax returns the exemption is for $ 14 k per year per person if the imputed interest rules may apply to you better talk to a licensed tax adviser on how to proceed

one of the things that you have to be aware of is a little gotcha in the credit utilization rate they or at least the credit company i worked for used the high balance in figuring the credit utilization not the ending balance for example say you had a single card with a $ 2000 credit limit and used it to charge everything during the month say that the high balance was $ 1900 and you paid it down to zero at the end of the month the company would calculate your credit utilization at 95 this is not good and not really fair but that was the way it was done increasing the credit limit helps but you can also usually make interim payments say as a paycheck comes in during the month if you have an online account

not everyone pays their balance in full every month they may not make interest off of you or me but they do make interest off of a lot of cardholders in many cases the interest is variable and the larger your running balance the higher your rate if you 're close to your limit and making minimum payments you can literally take decades to pay off $ 2,000 or so   some people do n't pay at all every month and end up paying late fees some people use their cards overseas and pay foreign transaction fees ever take a cash advance me neither but they charge you interest right away for that instead of waiting until your statement the list of fees and charges is as long as my arm and in tiny print that 's how they make money the points bonus cash back and other rewards programs are to get you in the door it 's like when you see a luxury car advertised for a too good to be true price and you get to the lot and find out that the one they are selling for that price is a manual transmission without ac or a radio they only had one and they sold it an hour before you got there it got you on the lot though the rewards programs function in much the same way minus the disappearing part they get you interested in their offering among a sea of virtually identical products but rest assured if the card issuers were losing money because of them they would n't exist for very long

i believe that article provides some good reasons though it may be a bit light on technical details and there are likely other reasons a company would do it so if they can finance for less then they would lose to taxes by bringing the money home and they do not take on too much debt this will likely work just fine and increase share holder value hopefully someone else can provide some other reasonable scenarios the bottom line is that it does not matter how they finance the share buybacks and/or dividend payments as long as they do not shoot themselves in the foot while doing it

i agree that you should consider a shares based dividend income sipp however unless you 've done self executed trading before enough to understand and be comfortable with it and know what you 're getting into i would strongly suggest that as you are now near retirement you have to appreciate that as well as the usual risks associated with markets and their constituent stocks and shares going down as well as up there is an additional risk that you will achieve sub optimal performance because you are new to the game i took up self executed trading in 2008 oh yes what a great time to learn and whilst i might have chosen a better time to get into it and despite being quite successful over all i have to say it 's the hardest thing i 've ever done the biggest reason it 'll be hard is emotionally because this pension pot is all the money you 've got to live off until you die right so even though you may choose safe quality stocks when the world economy goes wrong it goes wrong and your pension pot will still plummet somewhat at least unless you beat the market something you should not expect to do if you have n't done it before taking the rather abysmal as a benchmark all quality stocks right lol from last highs to this months lows and projecting that performance forwards to the end of march assuming you get reasonable dividends and draw out £ 1000 per month your pot could be worth £ k after one year where as with normal stable long term market performance i.e. no horrible devaluation of the market it could be worth £ k going forwards from those 2 hypothetical positions assuming total market stability for the rest of your life and the same reasonable dividend payouts this one year of devaluation at the start of your pensions life is enough to reduce the time your pension pot can afford to pay out £ 1000 per month from 36 years to 24 years even if every year after that devaluation is an extra 1 higher return it could still only improve to 30 years normally of course any stocks and shares investment is a long term investment and long term the income should be good but pensions usually diversify into less and less risky investments as they get close to maturity holding a certain amount of cash and bonds as well so in my view a sipp with stocks and shares should be at most just a part of your strategy and if you ca n't watch your pension pot payout term shrink from 26 years to 24 years hold your nerve then maybe a sipp with stocks and shares should be a smaller part when you 're dependent on your sipp for income a market crash could cause you to make bad decisions and lose even more income all that said now even with all the new taxes and loss of tax deductible costs etc i think your property idea might not be a bad one it 's just diversification at the end of the day and that 's rarely a bad thing i really don't think you should consider it to be a magic bullet though it 's not impossible to get a 10 yield from a property but usually you wo n't i assume you 've never done buy to let before so i would encourage you to set up a spread sheet and model it carefully if you are realistic then you should find that you have to find really really exceptional properties to get that sort of return and you wo n't find them all the time when you do your spread sheet make sure you take into account all the one off buying costs build a ledger effectively so that you can plot all your costs income and on going balance and then see what payouts your model can afford over a reasonable number of years say 10 take the sum of those payouts and compare them against the sum you put in to find the whole thing you must include budget for periodic minor and less frequent larger renovations your tenants won't respect your property like you would i promise you land lord insurance do n't omit it unless you maintain capability to access a decent reserve at least 10 20 k say i mean it it 's happened to me it cost me 10 k once to fix up a place after the damage and negligence of a tenant and it definitely could have been worse but i do n't really recommend you insuring yourself like this and taking on the inherent risk budget for plumber and electrician call out or for appropriate schemes which include boiler maintenance etc basically more insurance also consider estate agent fees which will be either finders fees and/or 10 management fees if you do n't manage them yourself if you manage it yourself fine but consider the possibility that at some point someone might have to do that for you either temporarily or permanently budget for a couple of months of vacancy every couple of years is probably prudent do n't forget you have to pay utilities and council tax when its vacant for do n't forget ground rent you can get a better return on investment by taking out a mortgage because you make money out of the underlying roi and the mortgage apr this is usually the only way you can approach 10 yield but do n't forget to include the cost of mortgage fees valuation fees legal fees etc every 2 years or however long and repeat your model to make sure it is viable when interest rates go up a few percent

basically you either borrow money or get other people to invest in your business by buying stock or something analogous   sometimes you can get people to park money with you for example many people deposit money in a bank checking account they do n't get any interest or other profit from this they just do it because the bank is a convenient place to store their money the bank then loans some percentage of this money out and keeps the interest i do n't doubt that people have come up with more clever ways to use other people 's money borrowing money for an investment or business venture is risky because if you lose money you may be unable to pay it back on the other hand investors expect a share of the profit not just a fixed interest rate

on most exchanges if you place a limit order to sell at you will be executed before the market can trade at a higher price however most stocks in the us trade across several exchanges and your broker wo n't place your limit order on all exchanges otherwise you could be executed several times the reason for happened to you is that your order was not on the market where those transactions were executed reviewing the ticks there were only 8 transactions above your limit all at for a total shares and all on the nyse arca exchange if your order was on a different exchange nyse for example you would not have been executed if your broker uses a smart routing system they would not have had time to route your order to arca in time for execution because the market traded lower straight after volume at each price on that day

the two banks involved may have different policies about honoring the check it might not be written on the check   your bank may decide that the stale check has to be treated differently and will withhold funds for a longer period of time before giving you access to the money they will give time for the first bank to refuse to honor the check they may be concerned about insufficient funds the age of the check and the fact that the original account could have been closed if you are concerned about the age of the check you could go to your bank in person instead of using deposit by atm scanner or smart phone this allows you to talk to a knowledgeable person and if they are going to treat the check differently or reject the check they can let you know right away the audit may not have been concerned about the fact that the check had n't been cashed because when they did the audit the check was still considered fresh some companies will contact you eventually to reissue the check so you they can get the liability off their books   if the bank does refuse the check contact the company to see how you can get a replacement check issued they may want proof the check ca n't be cashed so they do n't have to worry about paying you twice

the following are my opinion based upon research analysis since this involves taxation rules suggest you consult a tax attorney for their views   a. yes you can transfer any any amount of dollars to your nre account without paying any additional taxes   b. since you have passed substantial presence test you will be categorized resident alien you need to disclose the interest earned on your nre account this amount will be with your total income in us you would have to add this interest income in your total income and calculate tax c. transferring money to parents answer is yes you need to elaborate on this further advantage of parking money in nre account is that you can repatriate money in dollars any time you want assuming you need to buy a house or further education this would be useful incase you do n't have any of those goals yes you can transfer money to your parent if they are in need of funds   d. any transfer above $ 14000 will attract gift taxes this $ 14000 is the overall limit for a tax payee incase you transfer $ 14000 for each parent then it comes to $ there are chances that irs may raise a that you are circumventing the limit by splitting the recipients   e. only when you transfer more than $ 14000 you need to report and pay the gift tax

nothing wrong with the other answers but here 's a trick to hopefully make it totally transparent    imagine that you 're not the one implementing this business plan but someone else is   let 's call this other person your asset manager   so on the first day you give your asset manager $ 9   he takes this and generates $ 1 profit from it recovering the $ 9 which he then reinvests to generate $ 1 profit every day   from your perspective you just gave him $ 9   at the end of the year he gives you $ 365 in addition to your original investment of $ 9 in real life he 'd take the fees of course or perhaps he 's been lending out the money he 's been accumulating and taking the interest from that as pay for his services   so your return on investment is 365 9 100 > 4000 as claimed by your source

let 's suppose your friend gave your $ 100 and you invested all of it plus your own money $ 500 into one stock therefore the total investment becomes $ 100 + $ 500 = $ 600 after few months when you want to sell the stock or give back the money to your friend check the percentage of profit loss so let 's assume you get 10 return on total investment of $ 600   now you have two choices either you exit the stock entirely or you just sell his portion if you want to exit sell everything and go home with $ 600 + 10 of 600 = $ 660 out of $ 660 give you friend his initial capital + 10 of initial capital therefore your friend will get $ 100 + 10 of $ 100 = $ 110 if you choose the later to sell his portion then you 'll need to work everything opposite take his initial capital and add 10 of initial capital to it which is $ 100 + 10 of $ 100 = $ 110 sell the stocks that would be worth equivalent to that money and that 's it similarly you can apply the same logic if you broke his $ 100 into parts do the maths

no one of the key ideas behind a corporation is that an investor 's liability is limited to the amount he invests i.e. the amount of stock he buys this is the primary reason why small businesses become corporations even though one person owns 100 of the stock then if the business goes broke he wo n't lose his house fund etc he 'll lose everything he had in the business but at least there 's a limit to it in some countries there are other ways to achieve the same results like creating a limited company but that 's another story

the short answer is yes you can but you have to make sure you do it correctly   if you are employed by a tech company that does contract work at a separate location and you do n't get reimbursed by your employer for travel expenses you can claim the mileage between your home and location b as a business expense but there 's a catch you have to subtract the mileage between your home and location a your employer so if it 's 20 miles from your house to your employer location a and 30 miles from your house to the business you 're contracting at location b you can only claim 10 miles each way so 20 miles total obviously if the distance to location b is closer than your employer location a you 're out of luck you will have to itemize to take this deduction by filling out a schedule a for itemized deductions and form to calculate how much of a deduction for travel expenses you can take google should i itemize if you 're unsure whether to take the standard deduction or itemize sources

you do n't need to tell me your charity plans they do n't matter your comments still show lack of empathy a basic to put yourself in another ones shoes that actually is pretty important if you want to be a md   have you ever thought that these people work so that they do n't become criminals they maybe fucked up in the past or maybe not but the market is not a good judge for their worth they are people not a commodity or a number    the fact is even if you trained these people menial workers are needed in a society and therefore they should be able to make enough money to survive in the society   you know free market is not the magical solution for everything and you may not believe it but i do have the view that for the most part the govt screws up and should be given extremely limited powers   i do n't claim to know the solution for their problem but i do feel for them not only do they have to support their families with too less but they also have to listen to people telling them how worthless thy are

disclaimer it 's hard to be definitive as there may be some law or tax rule i 'm not aware of from a uk perspective this should be perfectly legal if it 's just a one off or occasional thing for personal reasons rather than being done in the course of a business there probably are n't any tax implications in theory if there 's an identifiable profit from the transaction e.g. because you originally obtained the inr at a lower exchange rate then you might be liable to capital gains tax however this is only payable above approximately £ 10 k capital gains see so unless this is a very large transaction or you have other gains in the tax year you do n't need to worry about that i would only recommend doing this if you trust each other if one side transfers the money and the other does n't the international nature will make it quite hard in practice to enforce the agreement legally even though i think that in theory it should be possible if the sums involved are large you may find that the transaction is automatically reported to the authorities by your bank under money laundering regulations or they may want documentation of the source of the funds reason for the transaction this does n't automatically mean you 'll have a problem but the transaction may receive some scrutiny i think that reporting typically kicks in when several thousand pounds are involved

as far as i know the answer to this is generally no   the closest thing would be to identify the stock transfer company representing the company that you want to hold and buy through them i have held this way but i do n't know if it 's available on all stocks   this eliminates the broker but there 's still a middle man in the transfer company note this section from the stock transfer agent wikipedia article a public company usually only one company to transfer its stock stock transfer agents also run annual meetings as inspector of elections proxy voting and special meetings of shareholders they are considered the official keeper of the corporate shareholder records the decision to have a single transfer company is a practical one ensuring that there is one entity responsible for recording this data hence even if you could buy stock directly from the company that you want to own it would likely still get routed through the transfer company for recording

from the card issuer 's point of view the purpose of balance transfers is very simple a credit card company wants you to owe them more money so they will make more profit getting more interest payments from you to do that they will offer an apparently good deal to transfer the debt that you owe to other companies onto their card the deal may look good to you because it offers a low interest rate for a limited time period etc but never forget that its real purpose is to be a good deal for the card company not for you of course credit card companies target these deals at their typical customers they have to tolerate a few smart customers who actually make them no money at all by always paying off their card balance before any interest is due never using their card to draw cash from an atm which has no interest free loan period never using their card for overseas transactions that incur fees and/or poor currency exchange rates etc   your financial objective should be to make yourself one of the customers the card company does n't want but only paying off the minimum balance every month is exactly the wrong way to do that

they already do it is just sneaky how it is done   they have created a system with healthcare where we pay up to three times more per capita than any other western country   they do this by setting up particular legislation and shutting down public options and anything else that might cut out administration and executive profits   they do n't need to directly tax us in order to keep an unreasonable amount of money flowing to corporate executives and wealthy share holders   that is without even getting into and prohibition legislation   one way they could easily keep money flowing to hollywood would be an additional tax refund that applies to legitimate entertainment costs   or perhaps doing as canada does and adding taxes to storage media   they can also continue to cut web freedom options and bandwidth   every bit of legislation i see come down the pipe with only a couple of notable exceptions such as has been about protecting profits for the top of the economic pile at the expense of everyone else   edit   i would also like to mention that our taxes already fund healthcare and in fact we pay so much that we could have a universal system already just with the money we spend via taxes   it is so hyper inflated because of the vast amount of profit built into the system at all levels     we have to cut out admin and profits to the hyper wealthy if we wish to have a reasonable healthcare system   this chart in particular shows the problem     this was just in 2008 costs have increased since then at the accelerated rate   so yes the oligarchy has ways of making us pay without introducing specific new taxation

if the building has no income it also probably has minimal expenses the heat water and electricity costs are nearly zero they are letting the value depreciate and taking it off the taxes i also suspect the condition of the building is poor so any effort to make the building productive would be very costly many cities combat this by setting the tax on empty buildings or empty lots at a much higher rate or they set the value of the property at a high valuation based on what it could generate sometimes this is only targeted at some sections of the city to encourage development they also offer tax breaks when the owner of a house has the house as their principal residence

i 'm curious so i 'm going to calculate it for my area i 'm in an average priced metro and a 2 bedroom apartment out here is going to cost you at least $ 1400 700 each with a and that 's if you go minutes from downtown it does n't really drop off any more than that the further you go out you 'll also still need renters insurance and to cover half the utilities lets tack on another $ 75 here conservatively at that far out you need a car and the insurance gas and maintenance costs that go with it assuming you go with something cheap say $ 5k with a payment around $ 120 a month + $ 60 a month for insurance another $ 60 for gas and accruing $ 30 a month for maintenance you 're going to need a cell phone and if you 're on a plan alone it 's not cheap with the big 4 providers so you 'll go with someone smaller for $ 50 a month even though the service is mediocre you 'll need to eat so being cheap and buying store brands and sale items you get your groceries down to $ 120 a month so that should cover the bottom level of 's pyramid which is far from glamorous that puts your living costs at $ a month being that it is a major metro minimum wage within the city is $ assuming you have a job that 's 40 hours a week that puts you at $ a month before taxes are withheld since you make so little taxes would only be around $ a month that leaves $ 49 for saving spending emergencies i live in a state that has very good support for the aca as well so the $ 300 credit roughly covers the cost of the monthly premium the deductible is obviously still impossible to pay but you do n't get hit with the penalty at year end and the hospital still gets mostly paid and you might just be able to avoid bankruptcy if the hospital is willing to negotiate the payment plan with you   so what are the conclusions here it 's possible to skate by for a short while assuming you can live without any social life stay healthy and have no emergencies   you also need the self discipline of a monk and to live in an area that supports a minimum wage relative to living costs and the aca

bloomberg suggests that two fidelity funds hold preferred shares of snapchat inc preferred shares hold more in common with bonds than with ordinary stock as they pay a fixed dividend have lower liquidity and do n't have voting rights because of this lower liquidity they are not usually offered for sale on the market whether these funds are allowed to hold such illiquid assets is more a question for their strategy document than the law it is completely legal for a company to hold a non marketable interest in another even if the company is privately held as snapchat is the strategy documents governing what the fund is permitted to hold however may restrict ownership either banning non market holdings or restricting the percentage of assets held in illiquid instruments since ipo is very costly funds like these who look to invest in new companies who have not been through ipo yet are a very good way of taking a diversified position in   start ups since they look to invest directly rather than through the market they are an attractive low cost way for start ups to generate funds to grow the fund deals directly with the owners of the company to buy its shares the of the stock value reflects the accounting principle of marking to market financial assets that do not have a trade price so as to reflect their fair value this implies that fidelity believe that the total npv of the company 's net assets is lower than they had previously calculated this probably reflects a lack of revenue streams coming into the business in the case   of snapchat edit by the way since there is no market for start up stocks pre ipo my heart sinks a little every time i read the title of this question i 'm going to be sad all day now

you 're potentially in very deep water here you do n't know who this person is that you 're dealing with   before you 'd even met him he just gave you his banking info seemingly without a second thought    you have no idea what the sources of his money are so what happens if the money is stolen or otherwise illegal   if it is determined that you used any of that money you 'll be on the hook to return it at the very least   who knows what the legal ramifications are either so it sounds like you began spending his money before you had any kind of written agreement in place   does n't that seem odd to you to have someone just so trusting as to not even ask for that was the source of the email about the $ 2500 from paypal or from him or his advisor   paypal always sends you a notice directly when funds are received into your account and even if they were going to put a temporary hold on them for whatever reason sometimes they do that it would still show up in your account i would highly can i be more advise you not to go anywhere near his bank account until or unless you can absolutely verify who he is where his money comes from and what the situation is if you start dipping into his account whether you think you 're somehow entitled to the money or not he could cry foul and have you arrested for theft this is a very odd situation and for someone who says he 's normally cautious and skeptical you sure let your guard down here when you started spending his money without making any serious effort to confirm his bona just because he passes himself off as smart and the doctor type does n't mean squat   the very best scammers can do that ever see the movie catch me if you can based on a true story so you have no basis for knowing he 's anything at all i am thoroughly confused as to why you 'd just willfully start using his money without knowing anything about him   that 's deeply because you 've opened yourself up to a world of potential criminal and civil liability if this situation goes south if this guy was giving you money as an investment in your business and you instead used some of that money for your own personal expenses then you could land in very serious trouble for co mingling of funds   even if he told you it was okay it does n't sound like there 's anything in writing so he could just as easily deny giving you permission to use the money that way and have you charged with embezzlement you need to step back take a deep breath stop using his money and contact a lawyer for advice   every attorney will give you a free consultation and you need to protect yourself here be careful my friend   if this makes you suspicious then you need to listen to that voice in your head and find a way to get out of this situation

facebook is an online social networking service which i 'd categorize as an ad supported social media platform for a type of company facebook makes money from advertisers and applications on the site so there are a couple of different income streams though in recent years facebook has done a number of acquisitions that should be noted as the company is much more than just the fb site in terms of b2c or b2b i see facebook as being a b2c where businesses are paying for access to consumers rather than businesses looking for other businesses some of the posts on facebook can be sponsored posts that are where things can be a bit for what is an advertisement at the same time various games run through facebook may also make facebook some money since some games may use in game purchases that are worth noting b2b requires one to have 3 companies in the overall system one that is the middle one that is providing a service and one that is consuming a service while facebook is selling advertising on this site i do n't see this as that different from tv networks and other distribution channels that ads are bought for consumers to use there is something to be said for what audience is one aiming b2b implies corporate customers which i doubt is what facebook 's customers want rather they are personal consumers that are n't companies on their own to my mind if you want something closer to b2b consider amazon.com 's cloud services where companies may buy resources from amazon as part of the systems they may use to interface with others i can remember in a previous job that we used clay tablet for doing translation services that took content from my employer 's servers to amazon 's cloud that would then be taken by the translation company for more than a few different pieces to the puzzle while part of facebook could be seen as b2b i doubt i 'd see them as a large part of it but i could be wrong as b2b b2c distinctions are n't my specialty are they yours consider paypal in contrast where a business may use paypal for payment processing paypal has agreements that enable them to process payments either through individual bank accounts or merchant accounts as well as for the company that wants to use paypal for their e commerce site thus there can be businesses on each side which is where i see this being a b2b company that is also b2c as some people may just be consumers consider google as another contrast where companies may pay to use google for e mail and the office like products like google docs and google drive that i 'm not sure is b2b as this is just a business buying services from google that does n't involve another company while there is b2c b2b and b2 g not every business has to tie into a specific category here for something else to consider

again massive i have n't looked at the numbers at all so could be way off and it will be a local issue    if overall housing demand gt supply little movement in price   if current supply = current demand then the increase in supply should lower prices a little i 'd expect a lot of conversions to enable greater access to the housing market from first time buyers which is generally where the growth comes from    if current supply gt current demand rare detroit some company towns where the company has left etc prices should already be depressed more supply pushes them lower still if people can keep up with mortgage payments then all okay if not i doubt this option is large enough to carry much risk     i 'm fairly sure any bank has people far smarter and far more qualified   than me looking at macro trends with actual data so whatever shocks are coming from the boomers dying off will be well managed

the principle to follow is called pay yourself first have your savings deducted from your paycheck before it hits your checking account you spending will change to accommodate the reduction if you have a 401(k available from your employer start saving some money via that if not figure out a way to have something moved out of your checking account to a separate savings account when your paycheck hits then as you get raises up the amount of automatic savings by half of the raise you will find this hurts less than you think and it will let you build an emergency fund which is the first thing you need when the emergency fund is 6 months of normal spending then you can start to invest

if you are really worried your best bet is to move all your cash from sterling into a foreign currency that you think will be resilient should brexit occur i would avoid the euro you could look at the us dollar perhaps make sure you are aware of the charges for moving the money over and back again as you will at some stage probably want to get back into sterling once it settles down if it does indeed fall based on my experience on the stock markets i am not a currency trader i would expect the pound to fall fairly sharply on a vote for brexit and the euro to do the same   both would probably rebound quite quickly too as even if there is a brexit vote it does n't mean the uk government will honour the outcome or take the steps quickly i am not a financial advisor and have no qualifications as such

yes it is but first let me address this sentence my current withholding on my w4 is already at 0 so i ca n't make it    lower you definitely can make it lower on w4 in addition to the allowances that what you meant by already at 0 there 's also a line called additional withholding there you put the dollar amount that you want your payroll to withhold from your paycheck each pay period so the easiest way to send a one time payment to the irs if you 're a w2 employee would be to adjust that line with the amount you want to send and change it back to 0 next pay period you can also send a check directly to the irs follow the instructions to form 1040-es that is exactly what that form is designed to be used for

in a business environment this phenomenon could be easily explained by operational leverage operational leverage is the principle that increasing revenues by a small amount can have a disproportionately large impact on net income consider this example you run a business that rents out a factory and produces goods to sell to consumers the rent costs you $ 10k month and all of your other costs depend on how many goods you produce assume each good gives you $ 10 in profit after factoring your variable costs if you sell 1,000 units you break even because your variable profit will pay for your rent if you sell 1,100 units you make $ 1,000 net profit if you sell 1,200 units you double your overall profit making $ 2,000 for the month operational leverage is the principle that adding incremental revenue will have a greater impact than the revenue already received because your fixed costs are already paid for similarly in personal finance consider these scenarios you have $ 1,000 in monthly expenses and make $ 1,000 your monthly savings and therefore your wealth will be zero   you have $ 1,000 in monthly expenses and make $ 1,100 your monthly savings will be $ 100 per month you have $ 1,000 in monthly expenses and make $ 1,200 increasing your income by ~10 has allowed your monthly savings double at $ 200 per month you have $ 1,000 in monthly expenses and make $ 2,000 your monthly savings are 5 times higher when your income only increased by now in the real world when someone makes more money they will increase their expenses this is because spending money can increase one 's quality of life so the does not happen quite so quickly as pointed out by there comes a point where increased spending provides someone with less increase in quality of life at that point savings really would quickly ramp up as income increases incrementally but assuming you live the same making $ 2,000 month as $ 1,000 month you can save every month a full month 's worth of living expenses this does n't even factor in the impact of earning investment income on those savings as to why the wealth exceeds income at that specific point i could n't say but what i 've outlined above should show how it is quite reasonable that the data is as reported

does gold 's value decrease over time due to the fact that it is being continuously mined remember that demand increases and decreases we 've had seven years or so of strong demand increase and the corresponding price increase suggests there is a lack of gold coming into the market rather than too much also bear in mind that mining the stuff on any scale is hazardous and requires massive investment in infrastructure and time large mines frequently take seven to ten years to come on stream hardly an elastic enterprise

i 'd suggest buying a used car for cash car loans are a bad idea i bought my last car a few years ago for $ 8k off of craigslist and it is still running great make sure you get a car checked out by a mechanic before buying usually they 'll drop it off at a mechanic you want to have take a look or perhaps just go with you my general rule is to not take out loans for anything which decreases in value so a home mortgage would be fine a car loan is not a great plan buy cash and save for the next purchase if you buy a decent used corolla or other small import car you can get it for $ 8k it will likely last a few years at least that could end up costing you less than $ 200 per month total or less much better deal in the long run

thing is it 's already explained in the letter in the end of the first paragraph tesla ’s annualized delivery rate should exceed 100,000 units by the end of next year emphasis mine   when i first saw the number i got excited but then i read the actual sentence realized what they meant and it 's still impressive but it 's not 3x increase in production yoy which would be absurd to expect esp when tesla 's trajectory has been just increases per year so far and into the mid term foreseeable future   then they explained it again on the cc elon said something like we 'll exit next year at a 100k rate but it 's hard to tell how steep the curve will be but we 'll probably have over 60k deliveries i think yeah probably   i emailed the author of this article and he still believes that tesla has unequivocally stated that they will produce and deliver 100k cars in 2015 but that 's simply not correct   i have some people who know press contacts within tesla working on it out though their efficacy at press communications has not been ideal at times in the past   if tesla did unequivocally state that they would deliver 100k cars next year after delivering just over 35k this year and 22k last year that would be enormous news and should have sent the stock to $ 300 today up 30 50%+ instead of the 4 it did go up   but it did n't send it that high because that 's just not what 's happening   i 'm extraordinarily bullish on tesla but 100k in 2015 is just not what 's going to happen   100k+ in 2016 though sounds about right   and is in line with every other estimate everyone has done for the past several years including tesla themselves   so yeah this number is n't really news but it 's nice to see them reiterate it

all the fees are added to the amount you actually spend but they only occur when you do these kind of transactions they do not happen for any other reason if you transfer a balance from another credit card this fee is added to your balance since this is your first credit card you do n't have to transfer any balance this site says that this is a special type of check linked to your credit card account not to your checking account if you write this type of check to a merchant the additional fees will apply if you use your credit card at an atm this fee will be applied on top of the money you withdraw usually it is a percentage of the amount you withdraw according to this site a cash equivalent is something like casino chips which can be easily converted back into money without any loss   if you use your credit card in a different currency for example euro but your credit cards currency is dollar usually a percentage of the amount ~3 5 if you withdraw money from a foreign currency atm they add usually a fixed amount plus a percentage or any combination of this

i think there are several issues here first there 's the contribution as littleadv said there is no excess contribution excess contribution is only if you exceed the contribution limit the contribution limit for traditional iras does not depend on how high your income goes or whether you have a 401(k it 's the deduction limit that may depend on those things not deducting it is perfectly legitimate and is completely different than an excess contribution which has a penalty second the withdrawal you are allowed to withdraw contributions made during a year plus any earnings from those contributions before the tax filing deadline for the taxes of that year which is april 15 of the following year or even up to october 15 of the following year and it will be treated as if the contribution never happened no penalties the earnings will be taxed as regular income as if you put it in a bank account that sounds like what you did so the withdrawal was not an early withdrawal and the 1099-r should reflect that what distribution code did they put third even if and it does not sound like the case but if it does n't qualify as a return of contributions before the tax due date as described above maybe you withdrew it after october 15 of the following year as littleadv mentioned your contribution was a non deductible contribution and when withdrawing it only the earnings portion which after such a short time should only be a very small part of the distribution would be subject to tax and penalty

in general scholarship income that you receive that is not used for tuition or books must be included in your gross income and reported as such on your tax return   scholarship income you receive that is used for those kinds of expenses may be from your gross income   see this irs information and this related question i believe that as represented on the 1098-t this generally means that if box 5 scholarships and grants is greater than box 1 or 2 only one of which will be used on your 1098-t you received taxable scholarship income   if box 5 is less than or equal to box 1/2 you did not receive taxable scholarship income   this page draws the same conclusion however you should realize that the 1098-t is not what makes you have to pay or not pay taxes   you incur the taxes by receiving scholarship money and you may reduce your tax liability by paying tuition   the 1098-t is simply a record of payments that have already been made for instance if you received $ 10,000 in scholarship money that is actually received checks for that amount or had that amount deposited into your bank account then your income went up by $ 10,000   if you yourself paid tuition it is likely that you can exclude the amount of the tuition from your taxable income reducing the tax you owe see the irs page linked above   however if you received $ 10,000 in actual money and in addition your tuition was paid by the scholarship with money you never actually had in your own bank account then the entire $ 10,000 would be taxable   you do not give enough information in your question to be sure which of these situations is closer to your own   however you should be able to decide by looking at your bank account look at how much money you received and how much you spent on tuition   if you received more scholarship money than the tuition you paid out of pocket you owe taxes on the remainder   i emphasize that this is just a general rule of thumb and should not be taken as tax advice you should review the irs information and/or consult a tax professional to determine what part of your scholarship income is taxable in addition as this now rather old article from the new york society of cpas notes many colleges and universities prepare incorrectly and report tuition and related expenses   this means you should be careful to reconcile the 1098-t with your own financial records of what money you actually received and paid   when i was in grad school there was a good deal of hand wringing and hair pulling each year among the students as we tried to determine what relationship if any the 1098-t bore to the financial facts

so people deposit money with you you agree to pay them fixed back and then you invest money for your own profit sounds like a bank to me   or a dividend paying mutual fund or a number of other similar ideas   sure you 're welcome to start something like that up it 's unlikely you 'd get money from people unless you had already proved yourself competent as an investor though   after all if it 's possible to get a safe comfortable 5 why would anyone give you money at 2 or 3 instead of just getting that 5 for themselves   or more likely finding a competitor who gives 4.9 as in most things the market will find inefficiencies like this and squash them like bugs    that said there are some opportunities that take advantage of other kinds of situations   the most common i 'd say is owning a home   you take out a mortgage for 80 of the value of the home instead of buying it outright and you instead invest the 80 in the market   you likely will beat your mortgage rate given the current rates   that 's effectively doing the same thing with an expense you 'd have anyway you always have to live somewhere since it 's a secured loan you get better rates than the market will give as it 's quite safe and you can use tax laws in your favor mortgage interest deduction in particular and the capital gains break on primary residences

others have already commented on the impact of anything which merchants from raising possible breaches so i wo n't dwell on that maybe we need stronger legislation maybe we do n't but it does n't change today 's answer often it works the other way around to what you might expect rather than the merchant noticing and notifying visa mc others visa mc others spot patterns of suspicious activity example 1 i do n't have any data on the relative numbers of who is being notified notifying between merchants and payment processors but at the point when your card is identified as compromised there 's no reason to suppose that an individual merchant in the traditional sense has been compromised let alone identified in fact because there 's a fast moving investigation it could even be a false alarm that led to your card getting cancelled conversely it could be a hugely complex multinational investigation which would be it 's simply not safe to assume that simply brand x has been compromised therefore everything brand x knows about you is also compromised furthermore there 's no reason to assume the merchant has even admitted to or discovered the root cause mc visa banks at the point at which they 're cancelling cards simply ca n't say at least not in a way that might backfire involving lots of lawyers because the standard of proof needed to go on record blaming someone is simply not yet met so yes it 's common that you are n't told anything for all of the above reasons and of course if you really want to find out more you may have some success with your local data protection legislation and formally make a subject access request or local equivalent to see what that brings back be sure to do it in writing to the official address of both mastercard and your bank

how long will that transition take and why did you get into construction   i ask because i 'm curious about how geography the number of jobs in your area in that particular field your perception of job options why you chose that occupation at the time and how long you expect your transition from one job to another to take those things factor into other arguments going on about this article and i 'm curious how that information relates to myself and others   you mentioned cc debt as building the trade deficit and that is n't entirely true at least from what i 've read about the deficit the deficit is a symptom outcome of some of which you know but the decisions businesses make to outsource does n't just add to that but builds a skill deficit manufacturing is a good example of businesses outsourced and that skill seeing less and less entry level work due to it which inhibits choice of income   as for wages a lot of countries have minimum wage laws but to suggest one or another is disastrous for an entire country ignores a variety of economic factors that lead to a crap economy

first of all many employees past a few years in particular are always looking for new jobs it 's how they make sure that they 're always getting the best value for their services this is doubly true for star employees   i do n't know if this is some cultural thing but i can tell you my own experience as an employer of roughly 40 people in sweden over the last half decade the business is web development my take from this is that    1 people who are about to leave do worse work   2 people who are about to leave act differently   i just do n't agree with in any way in fact quite the contrary people who have left my employment have done better in the last 3 4 months than they have before just so that they can 1 get a good reference letter and 2 leave my employment on good standing so that noone feels rational intelligent people do not burn bridges they build networks   people who are looking for other jobs act just like they always do all the ideas for behavioural change presented in this are completely circumstantial    in my experience the best way to identify employees who are very close to leaving or seriously considering it is listening to what they have to say they 'll make sure new messages get through such as this job is n't challenging enough or i 'm not having fun if they don't make those messages and still leave it means they did n't think you would be able to change those circumstances but of course that is more or less equity wiki in practice edit just to be clear the point i 'm trying to make here is that star employees have no problems their with current affairs   edited out some details that could be used to identify the business

i ca n't think of any conceivable circumstance in which the banker 's advice would be true edit actually yes i can but things have n't worked that way since so his information is a little stale credit bureaus got their start by only reporting information about bad debtors the bureaus only store on your file what gets reported to them by the institution who extended you the credit this reporting tends to happen at 30 60 or 90-day intervals depending on the contract the bureau has with that institution all credit accounts are real from the day you open them i suspect the banker might be under the misguided impression the account does n't show up on your report become real until you miss a payment which forces the institution to report it but this is the institution wo n't report it until the 30-day mark at the earliest whether or not you miss a payment or pay it in full the cynic in me suspects this banker might give customers such advice to sabotage their credit so he can sell them higher interest loans laws were created for a reason

assuming you are in the usa i would recommend making this a gift   you can gift someone up to per year without paying a gift tax additionally you can gift someone up to but it is a one time deal tied to inheritance tax    you can have a general expectation with the that they will return the money with some interest on some schedule   you can even write that payment schedule down   but for legal tax and personal relationship reasons you should both consider all these payments gifts if you think failure to repay will put a strain on your relationship then you should n't make the loan   if not then the payments in both directions really are gifts as a gift legal documentation can be really minimal really only the has to document anything and that is just on their tax return even then i think it is only necessary if you exceed the annual gift limit i would however recommend documenting any interest rates or payment schedules for personal reasons being a gift these numbers are just guidelines but at least you wo n't find yourself arguing about whether or not the guidelines are being met depending on how large the amounts involved are you might want to spread the load over several people to stay under that annual limit but the limit is per tax year so you could do half now and half in january

below is just a little information on short selling from my small unique book the small stock trader   short selling is an advanced stock trading tool with unique risks and rewards it is primarily a short term trading strategy of a technical nature mostly done by small stock traders market makers and hedge funds most small stock traders mainly use short selling as a short term speculation tool when they feel the stock price is a bit overvalued most long term short positions are taken by fundamental oriented long short equity hedge funds that have identified some major weaknesses in the company there a few things you should consider before shorting stocks despite all the and blame surrounding short selling especially during bear markets i personally think regular short selling not naked short selling has a more positive impact on the stock market as lastly small stock traders should not expect to make significant profits by short selling as even most of the great stock traders jesse livermore baruch nicolas william and steven cohen have hardly made significant money from their shorts it is safe to say that odds are stacked against short sellers over the last century or so western large caps have returned an annual average of between 8 and 10 percent while the returns of small caps have been slightly higher   i hope the above little information from my small unique book was a little helpful author of the small stock trader

it 's legal in fact they are required to do this assuming you are in fact a hce highly compensated employee to avoid getting in trouble with the irs i 'm guessing they do n't provide documentation for the same reason they do n't explain to you explicitly what the income thresholds are for social security taxes etc that 's a job for your personal accountant here 's the definition of a hce   an individual who owned more than 5 of the interest in the business at any time during    the year or the preceding year regardless of how much compensation    that person earned or received or for the preceding year received    compensation from the business of more than $ 115,000 if the preceding    year is 2014 $ 120,000 if the preceding year is 2015 2016 or 2017    and if the employer so chooses was in the top 20 of employees when    ranked by compensation there are rules the restrict distributions from plans like 401ks for example treasury reg says that a plan can not make a distribution to a hce if that payment reduces the asset value of the plan to below 110 of the value of the plan 's current liabilities so after taking account all distributions to be made to hces and the asset value of the plan everyone likely gets proportionally reduced so that they do n't run afoul of this rule there are for this but these are options that the plan administrators may take not you i suppose if you were still employed there and at a high enough level a company accountant would have discussed these options with you note there 's a chance there 's some other limitation on hces that i 'm missing which applies to your specific situation your best bet to understand is simply ask your money is still there you just ca n't get it all this year

from my experience using paypal for selling products on ebay and for the last two experiences of a friend   can paypal get money from my bank account without my authorization this is assuming they have transferred the funds to me they ca n't pull money from your bank account without your authorization they will however take the money from your paypal account if it 's still there or leave you with a negative balance if you 've already withdrawn they will do this as soon as there is a claim against you and will only release the funds if the investigation ends in your favor any money received would first be used to satisfy the negative balance what actions can paypal takes against me if charge back amount is very high and i do n't agree pay them they will send it to a collections agency is there any case it is going to effect my bank account i.e. is there any chance paypal can block my bank account in india they will block you from using paypal if you try to sign up again with a different bank account or credit card and they recognize you as the account holder they will block that account as well

you can increase your monthly cash flow in two ways it 's really that simple i 'd even argue that to a certain extent decreasing expenses can be more cash positive than increasing income by the same amount if you 're spending post tax money because increasing income generally increases your taxes so if you have a chunk of cash and you want to increase your cash flow you could decrease debt like chris suggested and it would have the same effect on your monthly cash flow or you could invest in something that pays a dividend or pays interest there are many options other than real estate including dividend paying stocks or funds cds bonds etc to get started you could open an account with any of the major brokerage firms and get suggestions from their financial professionals usually for free they 'll help you look at the risk reward aspects of various investments

sorry mate its not about being loyal it 's about what you negotiate    you stay with a company long enough and you 'll only rack up your annual 2 pay increase and see minor raises until you 're promoted to incompetence if you really want to see healthy compensation than you need to realize it 's about negotiating to your true value to the market not just join a company and cross your fingers for the best    frankly if someone is willing to pay more $ $ and other benefits then you 'd do yourself and those you support a disservice not going for it there are times when you should be less aggressive about it for the long haul but do n't forget a company 's job is to turn a profit which means getting workers to work at the lowest possible salary and when a corporation thinks someone is loyal and wo n't move then a smart company will go ahead and test that assumption   re entry level expectations about their true value absolutely agree expect entry compensation but do n't think being loyal is what changes that only increasing your actual value does not just because you 've been around forever

based on your question details i doubt you 'll like this answer but first things first you need to focus on rebuilding your credit and your savings $ 1 k is n't a huge loan amount so i 'm going to assume you 've made some poor decisions in the past to get to this point i 'm a small business owner and i make it a goal to have 3 6 months of expected expenses in an account should my circumstances ever drastically change or something happen that would keep me from working    without knowing your living situation and daily expenses here 's some general advice on building a small business without a loan   1 find steady employment anywhere you can   2 pay off outstanding debts and rebuild a savings account to rebuild your credit score    3 if you need fast cash sell some stuff you do n't need gaming systems home electronics etc also minimize your unnecessary expenses dining out etc   4 once your debts are paid off create a business startup savings plan put away as much as you can afford every week until you reach your goal    5 once your goal is reached you can begin your flipping business open a bank account and separate your profits into buckets for operations self pay and taxes if you declare this income which i hope you do for myself i put away 35 for income taxes which i do not touch until my taxes are paid i put 40 away for daily operations this keeps my business running allowing me to pay for the equipment i need the products i deliver and advertising to keep my business running i pay myself 25 this is a simple method but it works well for me

advice from a long time flipper you negotiate price based on four factors and none of these are set in stone how much you love the house   is this house a 100 out of 100 for you or a 85 or a 75   how much have you compromised what is the likelihood that you will find a house that will make you just as happy or at least close   you might have a house that is a 95 out of 100 but there are five other houses that you rated between 93 95    what is your timeframe   know that playing takes longer and can knock you out of the game sometimes and takes a little while to find a new game what is the relative housing market   zillow and other such sites are crap   yes the give you a generalized feel for a community but their estimates are off sometimes by 30 40   other factors like street noise updates to and so on are huge factors   you will have to really navigate the area and look for very comparable houses that have recently sold   then use average housing movements to extrapolate your future houses cost as a buyer you have two jobs   buy the house you want and manage your agent   your agent wants you to buy a house as soon as possible and to increase their reputation   those are their only two factors of working    by you offering closer to the asking price they are able to get their sales as quick as possible   also other agents will love working with them   in fact your agent is selling you on the home and the price   agents hardly worry about you paying too much as most buyers the deal they get on their home   admitting that you paid too much for your house is more of an admission of ignorance of yourself compared to agent if you decide to low ball the owner your agent spends more time with you and possibly reduces their reputation with the selling agent   so it is common for agents to tell you that you should not offer a low price as you will insult the owner my advice   unless the home is truly one of a kind for the market offering anything within 20 of the asking price is definitely within range   i have offered 40 less   if a house is asking too much and has been on the market for 8 months there is no way i am going in with an offer of even 15 lower   that leaves you no room    what you do first think about how much you think this house could sell for in the next 3 months   in your example let 's say 80 k based on conservative comps   then take the most you would actually pay for it   let 's say   70 k is about as high of an opening offer i would go    do not tell your agent your true breaking points   if you tell your agent that you would go to 75 k on the house   then that is what their negotiations will start at   remember they want the sale to happen as soon as possible   very likely the other agent especially if they know each other will ask if how flexible you are going to be   then next thing you know your agent calls you back and says would you be willing to go 77 k or the owner is firm at do not give up your position   you should never forecast to your agent what your next bid or offer would be for the house   never get into scenarios or future counters    so you offer   if your agent asks you how firm that is   very firm   if your agent does n't want to take the offer to them thank you for being my agent but i am going to be working with someone that represents what i want    if the owner says you are done too me   well that 's how it goes   if the owner stays firm at asking or lowers then you can come up if you feel comfortable doing so   but understand what your goal is   is it to get a house or to get a good deal on a house   mine was always to get a good deal on a house   so i might offer 72 k next   if they did n't budge i am out   if they moved down i went from there    easy summary the fact is if they are n't willing to negotiate with you enough it always ends the same   you give them your take it or leave it offer   you tell your agent that if he she comes back with one penny over it comes from their commission god i have said this 100 times in my life and it is the best negotiation tactic you have with your agent   the owner says yes or no and it is over

if i understand what you 're asking i think you 're looking at the relationship wrong   yes when one currency has a higher interest rate relative to another it 's value should theoretically appreciate   for example if the usd interest rate is 10 and the eur is 5 the usd should appreciate in value against the eur   however the parity relationship tells you the price at which an investor would be indifferent to the difference in interest rates   so using the formula for interest rate parity   = f s    and plugging in the interest rates from above and a spot rate of $   =   the 1 year forward rate would have to be $ in order for the investor to be indifferent between holding usd or eur   all this assuming interest rate parity holds   i 'm not big on econ but this is how i understood it when studying for the cfa exam the past few months   so please someone correct me if i 'm wrong

it is not a question of where you have your driver 's license   it is a question of the states tax related residency rules   though a driver 's license can be a part of that question since you likely have a residence in nyc and so can prove residency through a lease bills etc you probably have to file as a nys nyc resident    i do have to question your maintaining a california driver 's license if you are not a resident   if you are attempting to maintain dual residency look into both states residency rules to see if you are liable for taxes in both states    california seems particularly picky about these types of situations probably due to concerns that you may be trying to circumvent california taxes   that said it usually revolves around income in the state   of course if you maintain residency in california as well the argument can be made that you owe some taxes due to the fact that you take advantage of state services   e.g. you drive on california roads i suggest you consult a tax professional knowledgeable in these issues to sort out the details

this is really two questions about yield and contents content as others have noted an annuity is a contractual obligation not a portfolio contained within an investment product per se the primary difference between whether an annuity is fixed or variable is what the issuer is guaranteeing and how much risk reward you are sharing in generally speaking the holdings of an issuer are influenced by the average duration of the payments however you can ascertain the assets that back that promise by looking at for example the holdings of a large insurance or securities firm that is why issuers are generally rated as to their financial strength and ability to meet their obligations a number of the market failures you mentioned were in part caused by the failure of these ratings to represent the true financial strength of the firm yield as to the second question of how they can offer a competitive rate there are at least several reasons i am assuming an immediate annuity 1 return of principal the 7 you are being quoted is the percent of your principal that will be returned to you each year not the rate of return being earned by the issuer if you invest $ 100 in the market personally and get a 5 return you have $ 105   however the annuity 's issuer is also returning part of your principal to you each year in your payment as they do n't return your principal when you eventually die because of this they can offer you more each year than they really make in the market what makes a ponzi scheme different is that they are also paying out your principal usually to others but lie to you by telling you it 's still in your account 2 the time value of money a promise to pay you $ 500 tomorrow costs less than $ 500 today a fixed annuity promises to pay you a certain amount of money each year this can be represented as a rate of return calculated based on how much you have to pay to get that annual payment but it is important to remember that the first payment will be worth substantially more in real purchasing power than the last payment you get the longer you live the less your fixed payment is worth in real terms due to inflation in short the rate of return has to be discounted for inflation it is not a real rate of return in other words if you give me $ 500 today and i promise to pay you $ 100 for the next 5 years i am making money not only because i can invest the money between now and then but also because $ 100 will be worth less five years from now than it is today with annuities if you want your payment to rise in step with inflation you have to pay more for that a lot more these are the two main reasons here are a few smaller ones 3 a very long time horizon if the stock market or another asset class is performing well poorly the issuer can often afford to wait much longer to buy or sell than an individual and can take better advantage of historical highs and lows over the long term 4 big boy investing a large financially sound issuer can afford to take risks that an individual can not such as in very large or illiquid assets such as a private company a la warren buffet 5 efficiencies of scale institutional investors have a number of legal advantages over individuals which i wo n't discuss in detail here however they exist large issuers are also often in related business insurance mutual funds such that they can deal in large volumes and form an internal clearinghouse i.e. if i want to buy facebook and you want to sell it they can just move the stock around without doing any trading with the result that their costs of trading are lower than those of an individual hope that helps

in general if you can afford to replace something you are able to self insure   you really want to understand a little of the statistics before you can make a generic call but my rule of thumb is that insurance via extended warranty is rarely a good deal   here is a simple expected value math formula you can apply when the > is true then you should buy it replacement cost x likelihood of using warranty > cost of insurance you can then back compute what is the likelihood that i 'd need to lose this item to break even   given your numbers $ 2000 x y > $ 350 or y > or y > 17.5 so if you think there is a 17.5 or greater chance that you 'll need to have you system replaced i.e. not just a simple fix and as scott pointed out you 'll be able to actually use the replacement warranty then the applecare is a good purchase   note this only applies to items you can replace out of pocket without significant burden because if you did n't have the $ 10k to replace your car it would n't matter if the insurance was n't such a good deal especially if you need the car to get to work etc so the obvious question is why would a for profit company ever offer insurance on something they are statistically likely to lose money on   the obvious answer is they would n't but that does n't mean you should never buy this type of insurance because you may have statistically significant circumstances for instance i purchased a $ 40 remote helicopter as a gift for my children   i also paid the $ 5 for a no questions asked warranty on it because knowing my kids i knew there was a nearly 100 chance they would break it at least once   in this case this warranty was well worth the $ 5 because they did break it   presumably they make money on these warranties because most of the purchasers of the plan are more attentive or too lazy to make the claim than in this case edit note i incorporated scott 's comment about likelihood of being able to utilize the warranty into a combined likelihood of using warranty term   this term could be broken up into likelihood of needing replacement x likelihood of actually getting company to replace it i did n't do this above because it makes it a little harder to understand and may not be a major factor in all cases but you can definitely add it after the fact i.e. if there 's only a 90 chance applecare will pay out at all then divide the 17.5 by 0.9 to get likelihood of needing the replacement for it to be cost effective more complete formulas can be derived also including terms for full replacement costs vs repair costs and including terms for deductible type costs or shipping but i 'm trying to keep things relatively simple for those who are n't statistics nerds like i am

you do n't mention what kind of insurance you 're talking about but i 'll just address one angle on the question for some kinds of insurance such as health insurance in the us auto insurance and homeowner 's insurance you may be insuring against an event that you would not be able to pay for without the insurance   for instance if you are at fault in a car accident and someone they could sue you for $ 100,000   a lot of people do n't have $ 100,000   so it 's not even a matter of i 'll take the risk of having to pay it when the time comes if the time comes you could lose virtually everything you own and still have to pay more from future earnings   you 're not just paying $ x to offset a potential loss of $ y you 're paying $ x to offset a potential of your entire life   it is plausible that you could assign a reasonable monetary value to that potential cost that would mean you actually come out ahead in the insurance equation it is with smaller expenses such as insuring a new cellphone against breakage that insurance becomes harder to justify   when the potential collateral damage of a bad event are less you must justify the insurance expenses on the financial consequences only which as you say is often difficult

suppose that the etf is currently at a price of $ 100   suppose that the next day it moves up 10 to a price of $ 110 and the following day it moves down 5 to a price of $   over these two days the etf has had a net gain of 4.5 from its original price the inverse etf reverses the daily gains losses of the base etf   suppose for simplicity that the inverse etf also starts out at a price of $ 100   so on the first day it goes down 10 to $ 90 and on the second day it goes up 5 to $   thus over the two days the inverse etf has had a net loss of 5.5 the specific dollar amounts do not matter here   the result is that the etf winds up at = of its original price and the inverse etf is at = of its original price   a similar example is given here as suggested by your quote this is due to compounding   a gain of x% followed by a loss of y% compounded on the gain is not in general the same as a loss of x% followed by a gain of y% compounded on the loss   or more simply put if something loses 10 of its value and then gains 10 of its new value it will not return to its original value because the 10 it gained was 10 of its decreased value so it 's not enough to bring it all the way back up   likewise if it gains 10 and then loses 10 it will go slightly below its original value since it lost 10 of its newly increased value

you can withdraw from your rrsp to pay your taxes while not necessarily advisable it is permitted yet the tax consequences are no different just because you happen to be using the money to pay a prior year 's income tax balance due when you make the withdrawal from your rrsp an amount will be withheld towards your income tax for the withdrawal year assuming you have other income then you are likely to owe cra even more than the amount withheld because the withdrawal is effectively taxed at your marginal rate in that case consider the withholding tax merely a downpayment you 'll figure the final amount due when you file your next income tax return e.g. if you were to withdraw money from your rrsp today in 2015 to pay your 2014 income tax balance due then on your 2015 income tax return you 'll need to declare the withdrawn amount as income for 2015 you 'll get credit for the withholding taxes already paid when you made the withdrawal your tax return will indicate how much more you 'll need to pay to settle your 2015 taxes if you then pay your 2015 income tax balance due with an rrsp withdrawal in 2016 then repeat better to save up funds elsewhere e.g. in a bank account or a tfsa to cover an anticipated income tax balance owing

time barred debts and state statutes of limitation on collecting debts are good places to start on the issues of what can be collected and for how long what seems to be at issue is bankruptcy vs. time barred debts vs. what creditors original debt owners not collection agencies or those who buy debt can do you should also check out the fair credit reporting act which governs some of the question   the fair credit reporting act and the section on time barred debts applies to collection agencies etc so called debt owners as pointed out by @littleadv since they buy debt from the creditors not actual creditors those the debt is was originally owed to creditors those to whom the debt was originally owed have different rules than debt collectors and can do things debt collectors ca n't state law generally governs what creditors as original owners of the debt can do legally and for how long bankruptcy bankruptcy is a legal action that frees someone from paying all or part of debt owed they are crying uncle and stating they do n't have enough money to pay their creditors on a credit report accounts will generally be updated to show included in bankruptcy or similar debt that is determined to still be owed often will be reduced in amount payments time barred debts time barred debts are debts that are still owed but can not be collected through direct legal action suing each state has its own statute of limitations on how long different types of debt can be collected by suing after initial default before being considered time barred this period is typically 3 6 years but a few states such as kentucky allow much longer time periods up to 15 years being a time barred debt does not prevent a collector from contacting someone about a debt collectors can still try to collect a debt forever and probably will but they ca n't normally sue and collect payment once the statute of limitations period has passed there are gotchas with time barred debts regarding collection however which can make them still legally actionable making any payment no matter how small making a verbal commitment to pay or even acknowledging the time barred debt is often enough to make the debt legally collectable even if it would normally be past the statute of limitations for collection this is again state dependent but it is a pitfall for many people the process of making a debt collectable again is often called re aging re aging essentially means the clock starts on the statute of limitations extending the time that a creditor may use the courts to collect that debt if someone is taken to court over a time barred debt that is legally has not been legally re aged nothing happens to them however being time barred does not prevent legal action in the sense that you still have to prove the debt is time barred and in court if your sued over it   being time barred does not mean the debt a debt is always owed unless the debt has been forgiven or discharged in bankruptcy court this means that combined with the ability of debt collectors to contact someone about out of statute debt and the pitfalls of re aging it is entirely possible for a debt collector to get a 20 year old debt actionable again also note that while someone is trying to dodge a debt to make it time barred e.g. by not paying anything creditors and debt collectors can still take legal action to sue over the debt and if they get a judgment against someone this can extend the debt indefinitely judgements will eventually lapse but often only after 10 years or more and many states allow dormant judgements to be within that time period credit reports   regarding credit reports whether someone owes a debt and whether it appears on a credit report are two separate things as previously stated no debt or goes away unless some sort of legal action makes it so   as far as reporting is concerned however most bad credit stops being reported after seven years by federal law that is accounts on a credit report will be deleted seven years from the original delinquency dates of the accounts regardless of being included in bankruptcy or as time barred debt this assumes no legal process allows the account to continue being reported as is often the case with re aging as an fyi a bankruptcy discharge date has nothing to do with when account information will be removed from your credit report   note that some debts such as tax liens can be reported indefinitely should bankruptcy be considered the decision to do bankruptcy is mostly a matter of how severe the debt is if it is an extremely large amount and assets are very small bankruptcy is a good route in so far as it will legally take care of a lot of loose ends and likely relieve most or all of the burden of actually owing the money credit wise 10 years is the maximum a bankruptcy specifically will appear on a credit report accounts may drop off a credit report before bankruptcy because they are past the seven years they can be legally reported debts owed to the state such as child support student loans income tax etc generally can not be written off and are n't subject normal debt statute of limitations on collection   finally bad credit is bad credit there is likely to be little difference in terms of ability to get loans between bankruptcy and attempting to dodge legal action to make debts time barred if the debt is significant bankruptcy may be the only sensible option

this has been me for the past few weeks   side by side the iphone has a superior screen and build quality screen is much brighter stock and i do n't want to root android to tweak the settings and crash battery life while build quality does n't feel cheap i checked out an htc that had a brighter screen than the gs3 but its specs were poorer and os was dated there is no ideal phone for consumers like me and it feels intentional what i really dislike about the iphone are the cut google apps screen with no horizontal display growth and very easily al back less display would have been great   ideal    4.5 screen iphone quality no display speed build while android powered

that is utter horseshit there is n't a first world nation anywhere in which there is a black majority from madagascar to and for whites from new zealand to america the exact opposite    i 'm willing to have my mind changed if someone can explain why that is the case i 'm more than open to hearing it but from where i sit it seems extremely self evident

how is selling more cars equivalent to the peak of culture i fail to agree that american culture reached a peak 40 years ago frankly i think i 'd be pretty bored if i were thrown back to 1969 even though it seemed pretty exciting at the time   maybe i should have said the peak of american society and productive business   you do n't find it odd that the year when the most cars were sold in the us was over 40 years ago despite a doubling of the population   that means people do n't buy cars as often as they are not as financially able to anymore   people with lots of money buy new cars poor people do n't    google and iphones are all well and good but how many of today 's business success stories provide valuable services to society fewer and fewer

does n't it make more rational sense to have business people running hospitals though i mean generic business skills are much easier to come by than and if you get business people running the hospitals then you can have doctors working in them

etiquette or not it is hurting the seller the transaction fees have usually minimums so if the actual transaction is below the minimum they 'll pay larger fee on the transaction relatively as an example assume minimum fee for a debit card swipe is 20 cents or 2 of the transaction for a transaction of $ 10 and above the fee will be 2 of the transaction but for $ the fee becomes 12 of the transaction 6 times more expensive for the seller basically the sale was most likely at a loss for them they usually have very low margins especially for a dollar store so take that into account as well

a rollover the cash from the previous account into the new one a low cost ira like vanguard this and only this   because your mortgage is less than 4 while your retirement plan will earn 7 over the long term i have no retirement plans because because you 're 28 and essentially will be happy working until i die unless circumstances change but as far as i see it this is not such a bad deal because it is like paying taxes on income principal says i will lose up to 30 you 're ignoring the 10 early withdrawal penalty i am wise with my money for the most part then do n't piss away $ 3,000 just for a temporary feel good i earn a high salary in a tech job   as a result of being under 20 i am paying mortgage insurance of about $ 300/mo so after building up an emergency fund throw as much as possible of your high salary against your mortgage to get rid of the pmi
