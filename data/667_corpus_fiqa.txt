you have to file and issue each one of them a 1099 if you are paying them $ 600 or more for the year because you need to issue a 1099 to them so they can file their own taxes i do n't think there 's a way that you could just combine all of them additionally you may want to make sure that you are properly classifying these people as contractors in case they should be employees

bernie sources   gt heading out to open land to make your society in your image would definitely prove your point as long as it works   and do that how buy my own island sea and hope the us military does n't just drop a seal team on my head   gt;we just have plenty of evidence that no government is less so   no we really have evidence that structure is better than nothing i 'm not advocating for no structure businesses charities organizations etc obviously work better when they are well structured   to answer your enron example no corporation would have enough power to actually do something like that if they did n't have at least partial backing by the government    you know the drill big business buy politicians contributions politicians write big business laws anti competitive to push small guys out then when big business needs additional help politicians come in to save the day bailouts   the market would be extremely more competitive if for example the dodd frank act which to my understanding the repeal just recently passed the house went away it has been community banks just like glass did it essentially only allowed the big banks to compete surprise they did some stupid things great recession but if you do n't think they did n't already know that they those bailouts were coming if needed you are fooling yourself   these messages are almost getting to the point of tldr   i want to simplify our debate a bit   the crux of my whole belief is this the only way for a government to spend their citizens money in a better way than the citizens could would be if the government knew the utility of every single citizen it is absolutely impossible to do that the only people that truly know their own utility from something is them self    from here on i would like to debate the headlines like what i wrote above and not necessarily bullet points we can every now and then but i find that we then start working on tangents of tangents of tangents and can get a little messy   however i do not want to leave the current stones with your response   i would say that if it was privatized you are not going to have scope creep at least not to the same extent say we have the la militia that is wanting to help protect their ports they want to help develop a new boat that is fast and can help maneuver around big ships quickly like a better version of the new mark patrol boat   that money is their money directly or the peoples money who they 've asked to voluntarily give their money up to help protect their area   if they screw up and start asking for above necessary stuff or pick a developer who wastes their money etc they are going to lose business they will stop getting donations lose profit etc   however the government does n't have that why because their revenue donations are n't voluntary there really is n't accountability especially in bureaucracy    to the exchange stock problem i would say that exchanges are private businesses too they should have full reign on whether they allow trades if they believe that there is an unnecessary selloff because of a fake tweet saying that president has been shot they can stop that if fact it would be in there best interest to do so because it could limit unnecessary investor losses   it is unfortunate that the whole world is covered with governments i wish there was another western to populate and try new ways with   however i would say that there is a clear shift away from government is society   a few examples the driverless car elderly people and people who are disabled will be able to rely on the government less for transportation additionally assuming everyone will eventually have a driverless car there will be much less demand for traffic cops etc   cryptocurrency as there are now more and more businesses that stop accepting cash mainly starting with change there will naturally be less robbers because there is no money to steal you could make the argument that there will be an increase in cyber theft which i agree but not on a 1:1 ratio of the decrease in physical this decrease will help also lessen the demand for police officers   package delivery if it was n't for the post office their ability to deliver letters and using they would have gone broke a long time ago imagine amazon dhl ups fedex etc all competing to deliver you letter i 'm assuming that it would be less than the cost of a current stamp and with a lot more assurance that it will actually get to its destination   those are just a few examples

as cryptocurrencies are rather new compared to most assets there has n't been a lot of specific guidance for a lot of situation but in 2014 the irs announced that it published guidance in notice 2014 21 i 'm not aware of further guidance that has been published beyond that though it would n't surprise me if treatments changed over time in that notice the answer to the first question describes the general treatment for federal tax purposes virtual currency is treated as property general tax principles applicable to property transactions apply to transactions using virtual currency your specific questions about what constitutes a business and when you 're considered to be selling the are likely to be considered on a case by case basis by the irs as the amounts involved here are so small relatively speaking my recommendation would be to read through what the irs has published carefully make reasonable assumptions about what scenarios that are described are closest to what you 're doing and document doing so clearly as part of your tax preparations and when in doubt on the side of whichever option incurs more tax is unlikely to be objected to by them of course i 'm not a lawyer or tax advisor i 'm a stranger on the internet so for real advice you should contact somebody qualified i doubt you 'd be too much for not doing so given the amounts involved you could also attempt contacting a local irs office or calling them with your specific questions and they may be able to provide more specific guidance tailored to you though doing so may not save you from an auditor deciding something differently if they were to examine your return later there are also phone numbers to contact specific people listed at the end of notice 2014 21 you could try calling them as well

i really does depend on the bank here is a fairly typical page on interest calculations the key phrase is interest is calculated on each day 's final balance and paid monthly   so at the end of each day the amount of interest is calculated for that day based on how much is in the account at the end of the month the amount of interest for each day is and added to the account balance that calculation is extremely similar to duffbeer703 's compound monthly using the average balance for the month provided the account does n't have tiered interest rates and the balance does n't go negative the software that banks use is easily sophisticated enough to handle that kind of calculation your bank should be able to give you a statement of exactly how the interest is calculated

i 've spent a lot of time augmenting excel models with r. basically any process you pull from excel into sql r python will run faster sometimes much faster so the more calculations you can push into r code the better especially is very poorly optimized in excel and i 've seen the equivalent in r run literally 100x faster over the same data additionally you can chunk through data or load -&gt process -&gt save as csv in r to minimize the memory load on your machine vs keeping a giant excel model open all day   a key insight is that the model does not need to be pulled wholesale from excel to r. you can in fact take specific tables or target specific intense portions of the model to be pulled into r and processed before returning them to a csv to be picked up by your core excel model often you 'll run this process once per day in the morning in this case you effectively create a two step model where you use r to refresh the model to reflect new data and still maintain the excel as the core working gui for when you have scenario analysis type tasks that need to be maintained

wall street salaries are rather exorbitant but its influence is far from insignificant   do you know where pensions come from the money that veterans and retirees rely on to survive hedge funds   how do the firms and companies that employ all those workers listed in greater numbers institutional money management aka hedge funds as a small subset    a company in distress and is in threat of laying off thousands of employees what can help it a private equity firm that will actively work to save and restore the company for it 's own profit but the employees will still have jobs    no large company with tens of thousands of employees can exist right now without the capital raising and transaction advisory services of an investment bank stock trading as a means to grow personal wealth would not exist    while true these institutions make a disproportionate amount money you must consider why nearly all front office jobs on wall street have hours investment banking analysts have up to 100 hours a week that 's salary per hour hedge fund managers wake up at night sweating to check asia markets to see if they 'll still have a job these are not the suburban 9 5 jobs where you can actually have weekends the high salary comes from an extremely rare skillset that 's taught only from experience not in schools high stress and commitment and the highest quality of labor mostly ivy on wall street they 've worked their asses off for these jobs    salary has to do with supply and demand i have the respect for janitorial workers because they do what we do n't want to do but their pay is n't great because anyone can be a janitor if most people in the country could build a portfolio with a sharpe ratio higher than 2 that billions of pension dollars would rely on then we wo n't have such high hedge fund salaries for example

it does n't matter what industry 25 is high growth especially for a company of that size their debt equity was flat from 14 to 15 decreased in 16 and has decreased again and they are n't issuing equity so how are they financing themselves   their inventory turnover has been greater than since 2012 because a lot of their sales are n't actually held as inventory so with aws as the huge growth engine along with amazon prime and a significant portion of sales not tied to inventory i 'm not sure why you think the key driver of this equity will be inventory turns that 's just such a value play and frankly i think not that relevant to amazon 's future growth potential   almost all high growth equities are valued on a p e ratio that ratio is out on other metrics like same store sales retail average monthly users social media etc and some sense of how those metrics convert to future earnings   i personally think this method makes sense due to the compounding nature of growth rates and the high variability you are never going to get seriously comfortable with you future earnings projections you basically say what are earnings going to be for the next 12 months and then express growth potential beyond that the quality of earnings and your uncertainty by adjusting the p e.

can i give the bank the $ 300,000 to clear the mortgage or must i pay off the total interest that was agreed upon for the 30 year term this depends on the loan agreement   i had one loan where i was on the hook regardless   early payment was just that early payment   it would have allowed me to skip months without making payments because i had already made them    most loans charge interest on the remaining balance if you pay early it reduces your balance decreasing the interest   if you pay it off early there 's no more balance and no more interest    i 'm curious why the bank would let you do this since they will lose out on a lot of profit but they have their money back and can loan it out again   if they maintained the loan they are n't guaranteed of getting their money    interest is rent that you pay for the loan of the money   once you return the money why pay more rent   while some apartment leases require paying through the entire term most allow for early termination with proper notice   you give back the apartment the landlord rents it out again   why should they get paid two rents    another issue is that if someone with a mortgage switches jobs to a new location that person will likely prefer to sell the current house and buy one in the new location   this is actually the typical way for a mortgage to end   if the bank did not allow that they would essentially force the family to rent out the mortgaged house and rent a new house   so the bank would go from an owner occupied house that the inhabitants want to keep maintained to a rental where the inhabitants only care to the extent of their legal liability    consider the possibility that the homeowners lose one of their jobs   they ca n't afford the house   so they sell it and close out the mortgage   should the bank refuse to allow the sale and attempt to recover the interest from the impoverished homeowners   that situation would almost guarantee an expensive foreclosure    once there is any early termination clause for any reason it makes sense for the bank to structure the loan to include the possibility   that way they do n't have to investigate whatever excuse is involved   loan regulators may require this as well particularly on mortgages

interesting the real surprise here is preference it seems not only do people but in person they actually seem to mostly prefer it that way    most spending being offline is n't too surprising especially if you count corporate purchasing the average consumer spend most of their money on things like gas and food two products not normally available online also big purchases like cats and houses are n't online either but companies also often do n't ship online think about a building contractor he goes to the contractor store in the morning before going to the job site or about the heavy manufacturer a lot of steel manufacturers require the customer to speak to a sales rep or even to meet in person depending on the size of the deal

a falling $ aud would be beneficial to exporters and thus overall good for the economy if the economy improves and exporters start growing profits that means they will start to employ more people and employment will increase and with higher employment employees will become more confident to make purchases including purchasing property i feel the falling $ aud will be beneficial for the economy and the housing market however what you should consider is that with an improving economy and a rising property market it will only be a matter of time before interest rates start rising with a lower $ aud the will be more confident in starting to increase interest rates and increasing interest rates will have a effect on the housing market you are looking to buy a property to live in so how long do you intend to live in and hold the property i would assume at least for the medium to long term if this is your intention then why are you getting cold feet what you should be concerned about is that you do not on your borrowings make sure you allow a buffer of 2 to 3 above current interest rates so that if rates do go up you can still afford the repayments and if you get a fixed rate then you should allow the buffer in case variable rates are higher when your fixed period is over regarding the telling you that property prices are going to crash well they were saying that in 2008 then again in 2010 then again in 2012 i do n't know about you but i have seen no crash sure when interest rates have gone up property prices have off and maybe gone down by 10 to 15 in some areas but as soon as interest rates start falling again property prices start increasing again it 's all part of the property cycle   i actually find it is a better time to buy when interest rates are higher and you can negotiate a better bargain and lower price then when interest rates start falling you benefit from lower repayments and increasing property prices the only way there will be a property crash in australia is if there was a dramatic economic downturn and unemployment rates rose to 10 or higher but with good economic conditions an increasing population and low supplies of newly build housing in australia i see no dramatic crashes in the foreseeable future yes we may get periods of weakness when interest rates increase with falls up to 15 in some areas but no crash of 40 plus as i said above these periods of weakness actually provide opportunities to buy properties at a bit of a discount edit in your comments you say you intend to buy with a monthly mortgage repayment of $ 2500 in place of your current monthly rent of $ 1800 that means your loan amount would be somewhere around $ to $ you also mention you would be taking on a 5 year fixed rate and look to sell in about 2 years time if you can break even i assume that is break even on the price you bought at in 2 years you would have paid $ 16,800 more on your mortgage than you would have in rent so here are the facts a better strategy

there is a reason your credit score if you ever take out a mortgage you might pay dearly for your behavior the bank where you have the credit card reports the amount on the bill to the credit rating agencies if you pay before the bill date they will always report zero you should wait at least till the day after the billing cycle ends and then pay off you do n't need to have the paper bill in your hands you can see online when the cycle closed depending on your other financial behavior this will have between zero and significant effect on the percentages you get offered for car loans mortgages etc

trading and investing are very very different activities    investing is very generally done for the longer haul by people looking for a reasonable return determined largely by the long term prospects of the business in which they invest accepting some moderate risk usually around the prospects of that business    trading is very generally done shorter term seconds to days weeks and can involve significantly higher risk usually focused around market conditions and players at the time of the trade to reiterate these are gross generalizations but if you are just starting out   a you probably want to be investing rather than trading and b you may be best served by understanding as well as you can the difference between the two   once you understand that difference that will lead you to learning resources on each

most likely that 's the amount of interest that accrued on the loan while you were in school   if you had paid that amount before you would have just paid off accrued interest and your loan balance would have stayed the same since you did not pay the interest it will be added to your loan balance and you will just pay it off as part of the loan plus compounded interest    if you pay off your loan at 5 over 30 years hopefully you wo n't but that 's what they 're amortized for that $ 350 will compound and become $   essentially you 're borrowing $ 350 at 5 interest for 30 years hopefully that motivates you to pay it off sooner that that

the author is using an approximation to what you have exactly which is called a true time weighted rate of return you have expressed the total time weighted return for the period in question   in order to express this as an annual rate you may annualize it by adding one raising to the power and subtracting one again for a period of y years the alternative to a time weighted return is a money weighted return which is actually another name for the internal rate of return

you 're not talking about capitalism you 're talking about hate for the bourgeois which you refer to as parasites thus making you the you do n't own a business you work for one if you wanted to create a company you could because you have the freedom to so do the opportunity to as this guy did through discipline and determination but you you prefer to debate religion and give people advice and make assertions on the internet   capitalism is an economic system that is based on private ownership of the means of production and the creation of goods or services for profit taken right from wikipedia   this guy built a company from the garage of a small house driving a 12 year old car while his friends drove new cars and enjoyed healthy salaries today his company has 7,000 employees and lots of revenue who did he exploit it sounds like he produced a service for profit    so what is the fact that his revenue and profit are larger than most his net profit is much lower than gross profit because of already high liabilities not only including various taxes but as much or more in mandatory insurances i 'd wager the net profit is less than half of the gross profit if his liability increases there is less incentive to continue operations    the fact is he created his business and he can do with it what he pleases

if it helps you to think about it long is equivalent to betting for the upside and short is equivalent to betting for the downside if you are long on options then you expect the value of such options to increase   if you are long an option then you own the option   if you are short an option then generally you sold the option   someone who is short a call sometimes called the writer or occasionally the issuer has sold a call option to someone who is now long a call buying a call option that will increase in value is itself a form of investment just as it 's investment to buy stock or other instruments hoping they will appreciate in value   an option 's value will rise or fall with the underlying so being long an option is a way to be long in the underlying   someone can be long in a stock by buying the stock or long in a call by buying call options in the stock   the long call generally requires less initial investment than buying the underlying and lets the option holder avoid the asset downside during the option term   the risk is that the asset may not appreciate to the point that the call option will pay off in the conceptual sense a share of stock is a particular right to the profits and assets of a corporation both in form of dividends and in liquidation   an option is a particular right to the the share of stock   it 's just a further way to formalize and the various property rights that exist in a corporation   if you can buy a piece of paper with particular rights to corporate profits and assets then you can buy another piece of paper with particular rights to the former piece of paper

learn something new every day i found this interesting and thought i 'd throw my 2c in good description i hope from short selling what is short selling first let 's describe what short selling means when you purchase shares of stock in purchasing stocks you buy a piece of ownership in the company you buy sell stock to gain sell ownership of a company when an investor goes long on an investment it means that he or she has bought a stock believing its price will rise in the future conversely when an investor goes short he or she is anticipating a decrease in share price short selling is the selling of a stock that the seller does n't own more specifically a short sale is the sale of a security that is n't owned by the seller but that is promised to be delivered   still with us here 's the skinny when you short sell a stock your broker will lend it to you the stock will come from the brokerage 's own inventory from another one of the firm 's customers or from another brokerage firm the shares are sold and the proceeds are credited to your account sooner or later you must close the short by buying back the same number of shares called covering and returning them to your broker if the price drops you can buy back the stock at the lower price and make a profit on the difference if the price of the stock rises you have to buy it back at the higher price and you lose money so what happened the plan the reality lesson i never understood what shorting a stock meant until today seems a bit risky for my blood but i would assume this is an extreme example of what can go wrong this guy literally chose the wrong time to short a stock that was in all visible aspects on the decline   how often does a large company or individual buy stock on the decline and send that stock soaring how often does a stock go up 100 in 24 hours 600   another example is recently when bought 10 of weight watchers and caused the stock to soar 105 in 24 hours you would have the day you shorted that stock on that particular day if you believed enough to gamble on it going down in price

yes and no any great idea excluding new technologies discoveries usually involves a trade off good ideas taken to their extremes usually are   i 've generally worked in the open communication environment musk describes for most of my career for 25 years and i 've seen where it works and where it does n't and what musk 's email misses is where it does n't work it is a good starting   for one thing there need to be filters a vp director senior manager ceo or other higher up can not deal with 1000 emails per day for ideas criticisms etc he does mention avoiding chit chat but employees with good ideas for technology or business do not see their suggestions as chit chat most actual good ideas from juniors are too low level for senior management such as different platforms coding methods etc most ideas that senior management are needed like company direction organization etc require a sophisticated knowledge and experience of business contracts etc most of the junior ideas i 've seen including my own were bad ideas that came from lack of experience in business   or take some new hr policy imagine the thousands of direct responses of people straight to hr on the policy that would grind things to a halt the whole purpose of direct managers and supervisors is to filter information down up and sideways so that other people can do their jobs   you do n't want to have high value people knowledge experience spending their day dealing with emails and other people 's ideas you want them providing that value to the business so you need filters people who can recognize the good from the bad and pass on the bad that could be direct managers at the employee 's side or it could be administrative help at the department 's side either way it 's necessary to be efficient   then there 's the problem of including all stakeholders if you are junior and work out a solution to a problem with a junior in another problem but in implementing it you break a whole system which i 've seen happen you 've just caused a lot of harm to the organization neither of you may fully understand the implications of your solution on other things people with responsibility for those things need to be included in the discussion and take responsibility for any implementation   i hate bureaucracy and sometimes it can be a major inefficiency and for getting simple and obvious things done but bureaucracy can also improve efficiency and value and a lack of it can be i 've seen marketing and sales people continually take engineers off of important development work in order to build demos for potential new clients all of which failed to materialize why because the marketing and sales people were chasing leads for contracts without any review of the technical solution the ideal one what the solution to the customer needs really involves what was needed to improve efficiency was a bureaucratic process that reviewed the market opportunities with the technical offerings of the company and either reject opportunities early on or plan and schedule how best to chase the leads   in my experience what works best in most cases is open communication but clear guidelines a on what is appropriate or not to go direct b that the communications are about ideas only and coming up with solutions and c that actions or implementations require bringing the chain of command into the loop for comment or objection before doing anything   complaining to management is n't usually of much value and does n't change much but identifying the problem that is part of the complaint identifying a workable solution with stakeholders and asking for permission via the chain of command is usually a good way to get things done without creating the problems of a free for all

some loans have a variable interest rate which can protect the lender from inflation and the borrower from deflation how much protection it offers depends on how closely the interest rate follows the inflation deflation rate most variable rate loans have limits on how much and how frequently they can adjust in your deflation scenario the lender comes out ahead with a fixed rate loan already since those future dollars are worth more than current dollars   the borrower does n't owe more dollars but the value of the dollars they owe is higher

one is a choice the other is not while they are both liabilities on the balance sheet in the real world they are quite different    we do not feel as much ownership over our money that goes to interest payments as we do over our tax payments   taxes pay for our government and the services it provides   interest on the other hand is what we pay in order to have a bank loan us money   similar to paying for a good or service obtained from some other business we do not feel we have a say in what the bank does with that money   if we of a business practices we stop doing business with them assuming there are other choices   we can not practically avoid dealing with our government    we certainly feel that we should have a say in what is done with our tax money   i doubt there is anyone in the world that completely approves of their government 's spending   it is very easy to feel with regard to our tax payments   for example some people feel resentment because their taxes fund the welfare rolls all that said i believe there is little overlap between the two groups   it seems to me that you are referring to those with large amounts of high interest e.g. credit card debt   i doubt that a large percentage of them are the tax laws looking for deductions and loopholes   if they had that mindset they would also be working hard to get out of the hole they are in    in summary we choose to pay a financial adviser to take out a loan or to obtain a credit card   we do not choose to pay taxes   since taxes are supposed to pay for our government and things which should benefit everyone we want a say in what is done with it   this is also the case because it is forced on us   fine son i 'll lend you some money but i do n't want you buying cigarettes with it   since our say is limited and we likely will not approve of everything our government does we want to exert what control we do have reduce our payments as best we can

when they make the most money off of charging interest on late payments this is incorrect do you have any data to back this in the past decade there was a tendency by financial institutions to make money from late payments and there were certain rewards incentives for people who paid late however the bubble cracked soon enough and there were huge losses in the card industry today most of the revenue for card companies is from margins on customers who pay on time and growth avenues are promoting to pay every transaction by card why do they actively seek people who pay their bills on time as evidence by requiring good credit scores to get approved for a card instead of they opposite as indicated above remember if one customer defaults it wipes out margins made by tons of customers in spite of giving credit to people with good credit score the average credit card debit an us individual holds is still quite high

i think that people only use the phrase only spend what you can afford to lose when they are talking about the most risky or speculative investments or even gambling    when talking about gambling the following quote is a bottom line the speculative investment that brought me to this question via google is how much should i invest in bitcoin   i was tempted to put in 10 of my investments not including the 6 month safety fund and not including equity in my home   now thinking about this question it seems that it depends on your income as a percentage of your investment income which should grow in proportion to the whole over time   for example early stage of career not much investment income 20 mid career 5 mid late career moving to more safe investments 5 late career retirement 1 another way to calculate would be as a percentage of the amount you put into retirement savings per year   maybe 10 of this figure when you 're young and 1 nearer to retirement

the problem with a little bit of deflation is that it can turn into a lot of deflation very quickly   that i d the risk of the so called liquidity trap   a place where the fed truly does lose its power and depressions become possible   the us housing market is in a secular depression   people are n't buying despite record low rates because they assume the house will be cheaper next year   now imagine that across the entire economy   the longer you wait the cheaper things get   it sounds but the problem is that it is n't just you waiting it is everyone waiting all at the same time   so the economy such as it is grinds to a halt and jobs vanish and things get even cheaper   it is a cycle that is extremely costly to get out of   the last time we fell into a depression it took massive new government spending programs plus a world war to fully pull us out of it   some people might make the argument that you need a good long depression every now and then   they may say that in fact the great depression was the catalyst for policies that set america up for 70 years of solid economic growth   i 'm not so sure   i do look at our current situation with bailed out zombie banks and i have to wonder if just letting them all fail may have been better even though the short term pain would have been severe   we 'll probably know in about 5 years if they did the right thing

the idea behind this move is to avoid or mitigate long term deflationary pressure and to boost the competitiveness of swiss exporters this is primarily a swiss based initiative that does not appear likely to have a major impact on the broader eurozone however some pressure will be felt by other currencies as investors look to purchase ie this is not a great scenario for other countries wanting to keep their currencies weak in terms of personal wealth if you hold swiss f then you are impacted however 1.2 is still very strong most analysts cite 1.3 as more realistic so there seems little need for a reaction of any kind at the personal level at this time although diversity as ever is good it should also be noted that changing the peg is a possibility and that the 1.3 does seem to be the more realistic level if you hold large amounts of swiss f then this might cause you to look at your forex holdings for the man in the street probably not an issue

it is barely possible that this is citi 's fault but it sounds more like it is on the costco end    the way that this is supposed to work is that they your card for the necessary amount   that reserves the payment removing the money from your credit line   on delivery they are supposed to capture the preauthorization   that causes the money to transfer to them   until that point they 've reserved your payment but not actually received it   if you cancel then they do n't have to pay processing fees    the capture should allow for a larger sale so as to provide for tips and unanticipated taxes and fees    in this case instead of capturing the preauthorization they seem to have simply generated a new transaction   citi could be doing something wrong and processing the capture incorrectly   or costco could be doing a purchase when they should be doing a capture   from outside we ca n't really say    the thirty days would seem to be how long costco can schedule in advance   so the preauthorization can last that long for them    costco should also have the ability to cancel a preauthorization   however they may not know how to trigger that   with smaller merchants they usually have an interface where they can view and capture or cancel them   costco may have those messages sent automatically from their system    note that a common use for this pattern is with things like gasoline or delivery purchases   if this has been citi costco both times i 'd try ordering a pizza or some other delivery food and see if they do it correctly   if it was citi both times and a different merchant the other time then it 's probably a citi problem rather than a merchant problem

it is measured in us dollars   the us can not just print the money because that would cause inflation   remember that money is really just a convenient placeholder for the barter system   creating more money regardless of whether there is more value in the economy work resources etc is a very bad idea and doing so has collapsed the economies of many countries debt increasing means that the us owes other countries more money   so yes they are receiving more money from other countries but the us has to pay it all back with interest eventually the us government spends more money than it receives in taxes   to decrease the debt spending needs to decrease and/or taxes need to increase many countries lend to the us   one of the biggest is china   these countries do so because of interest the us pays back more money than it gets lent so the lending countries make a profit if china suddenly called in all its debt to the us this would severely damage the world economy   china 's biggest trading partner is the us so it has no interest in harming the us this way it would harm itself   additionally the us would probably refuse to pay it not to mention that it ca n't and then china would lose all the money it invested in the us   it would benefit no one

answering this question is weird because it is not really precise in what you mean do you want all stocks in the us do you want a selection of stocks according to parameters   do you just want a cool looking graph however your possible misuse of the word derivative my interest your reference to   gold and silver seems to indicate that you do not know what a derivative actually is or what it would do in a portfolio   the straightforward way to see an efficient frontier is to do the following for a set of stocks in this case six randomly selected ones                rai amzn msft twx from = 2012 06 01 to = 2017 06 01      returns lt;- null   tickerlist lt;- rai amzn msft twx   for ticker in tickerlist    returns lt;-     lt;- tickerlist   returns lt;-     frontier lt;-   width = 800 height = 600   which = all       constraints =     portfolio weights         rai    amzn    msft     twx             covariance risk budgets         rai    amzn    msft     twx             target returns and risks    mean            var          the minimum variance portfolio of these six assets has a mean return is and variance is amzn does not get any weight in the portfolio   it kind of means that the other assets span it and it does not provide any additional diversification benefit    let us add two etfs that track gold and silver to the mix and see how little difference it makes     from = 2012 06 01 to = 2017 06 01     returns lt;- null   tickerlist lt;- rai amzn msft twx gld   for ticker in tickerlist    returns lt;-     lt;- tickerlist   returns lt;-    frontier lt;-     width = 800 height = 600         optimal weights   out lt;- constraints =   lt;-   lt;-   lt;-   lt;- optimal portfolio     equal weights   lt;- 8)   lt;-   lt;-   lt;- equal weights portfolio    width = 800 height = 600   =   chart ylim = c(0 2   chart ylim = c(0 2   chart main = drawdown ylim = 0   chart main = drawdown ylim = 0         adding gold changes the minimum variance mean return to and the variance stays about the same you can see how the weights change at different return and variance profiles in the picture   the takeaway is that adding gold decreases the return but does not do a lot for the risk of the portfolio   you also notice that silver does not get included in the minimum variance efficient portfolio and neither does amzn     we can also compare the optimal weights to an equally weighted portfolio and see that the latter would have performed better but had much   larger drawdowns which is because it has a higher volatility which might be undesirable     everything below here is false but illustrative   so what about the derivative part let us assume you bought an out of the money call option with a strike of 50 on msft at the beginning of the   time series and held it to the end   we need to decide on the the annualized cost of carry rate the annualized rate of interest the time to maturity is measured in years the annualized   volatility of the underlying security is by the historical volatility       lt;- months   t lt;- 60 months 5 years   vol lt;- annualized volatility     lt;- 60 1   for t in    s lt;-    lt;- = c s = s x = 50 time = t t 12 r = 0.001 b = 0.001 sigma = vol    lt;-       lt;-   lt;-     lt;-   lt;-     returns lt;-     lt;- 9     lt;-   lt;-   lt;- equal weights derivative portfolio     width = 800 height = 600   =   chart ylim = c(0 4.5   chart ylim = c(0 4.5   chart main = drawdown ylim = 0   chart main = drawdown ylim = 0        even though we have a massively profitable instrument in the derivative the portfolio analysis does not include it   because of the high volatility however if we just use equal weighting and essentially take a massive position in   the out of the money call which would not be possible in real life we get huge drawdowns and volatility but   the returns are almost two fold but nobody will sell you a five year call   others can correct any mistakes or misunderstandings in the above it hopefully gives a starting point   read more at      the album

i dug up an old article on motley fool and one approach they mention is to get the stock certificates and then sell them to a friend if the company was liquidated you should receive a 1099-div form at     year 's end showing a liquidating distribution treat this as if you    sold the stock for the amount of the distribution the date of sale    is the date that the distribution took place using your original cost    basis in the shares you can now compute your loss if the company has n't actually been liquidated you 'll need to make    sure it 's totally worthless before you claim a loss if you have    worthless stock that 's not worth the hassle of selling through your    broker you can sell it to a friend or cousin aunt or uncle for    pennies however you ca n't sell the stock to a spouse siblings    parents grandparents or lineal descendants here 's one way to do    it send the certificate to your stock transfer agent explain that the shares have been sold and ask to cancel the old shares and issue    a new certificate to the new owner some brokerages will offer you a quicker alternative by buying all of your shares of the stock for a penny they do it to help out    their customers in addition over time some of the shares may    actually become worth more than the penny the brokers paid for them by selling the shares you have a closed transaction with the stock and can declare a tax loss meanwhile your friend relative or    broker for a pittance has just bought a or liner

in general the higher the return such as interest the higher the risk if there were a high return no risk investment enough people would buy it to drive the price up and make it a low return no risk investment interest rates are low now but so is inflation they generally go up and down together so as a low risk almost no risk investment the savings account is not at all useless there are relatively safe investments that will get a better return but they will have a little more risk one common way to spread the risk is to diversify for example put some of your money in a savings account some in a bond mutual fund and some in a stock index fund a stock index fund such as spy has the benefit of very low overhead in addition to spreading the risk among 500 large companies mutual funds with a purchase or sale fee or with a higher management fee do not perform any better on average and should generally be avoided if you put a little money in different places regularly you 'll be fairly safe and are likely get a better return if you trade back and forth frequently trying to the market you 're likely to be worse off than the savings account

the right way to develop confidence is to get educated confidence can come from many sources but the right source of confidence is an understanding of how markets work markets react and overreact to news i think the biggest factor to trading successfully is to not allow emotion to drive you you should determine how much you are comfortable gaining and losing and set those in limit and stop orders rather than just using market orders all of the time as i 've grown in my understanding of the market i find it much more rare that i feel confident enough to make a specific bet most of my money is allocated in index funds and i only buy and sell small amounts to reset the percentages according to a preset allocation plan i still keep some cash available for speculative trades in the account where those trades will add the most value

on what basis did you do your initial allocation of funds to each stock    if you are re balancing that implies returning things to their initial allocation   you can do this without any research or recommendations if you started out with say 10 stocks and 10 of the funds allocated to each stock then re balancing would simply be either buying selling to return to that initial allocation   if you are contributing to the portfolio you could adjust where the new money goes to re balance without selling   or if you are drawing money from the portfolio then you could adjust what you are selling if on the other hand you are trying to decide if you want to alter the stocks the portfolio is holding then you have an entirely different question from re balancing

you need to get the current tax software the 2013 filing software is out already even though it needs to update itself before filing as the final forms are n't ready yet then you will look carefully at schedule e to understand what gets written off i see you are looking at the $ 2200 rent vs your own rent of $ 2100 but of course the tax form does n't care about your rent you offset the expenses of that house against the income   the expenses are the usual suspects mortgage interest property tax repairs etc but there 's one big thing new landlords are prone to forgetting depreciation it 's not optional say the house cost you $ 400k. this is your basis you need to separate the value of land which is not depreciated for a condo with no land it can be as little as 10 when we bought our house for insurance purposes the land was nearly 40 of the full value say you do the research and decide 30 for land then 70 = $ depreciation is taken each year over a 27.5 year period or just over $ 10,000 per year note the forms will help you get your year 1 number as you did n't have a full year   this depreciation helps with your cash flow during the year as you should do the math and if you keep the house adjust your w4 withholdings for 2014 that lump sum you 'll get in april wo n't pay the bills each month but is recaptured on sale   at some point in the future you may save enough to buy a house where you wish to live but need to sell the rental consider a 1031 exchange it 's a way to sell a rental and buy a new one without triggering a taxable event what i do n't know is how long the new house must be a rental before the irs would then allow you to move in the same way you turned your home into a rental a rental can be turned back to a primary residence i just doubt you can do it right after the purchase as fellow member @littleadv would advise get professional advice and he 's right i 've just offered what you might consider the first year tax return with that schedule e is the toughest as it 's brand new the next year is simple in comparison   the question of selling immediately is tough only you can decide whether the risk of keeping it is too great you 're saying you do n't have the money to cover two month 's vacancy that scares me i 'd focus on up the emergency account and securing a credit line you mentioned the tax savings my opinion is that for any investment the tax tail should never wag the investing dog buy or sell a stock based on the stock not the potential tax bill for the sale in your situation the rent and expenses will cancel each other and the depreciation is a short term loan from a tax perspective if you sold today what do you net if you analyzed the numbers now what is your true income from the property each year is that return worth it a good property will provide cash flow principal reduction each year and normal increase in value this takes a bit of careful looking at the numbers you might feel you 're just breaking even but if the principal is $ 12 k less after a year that 's something you should n't ignore on the other hand an exact break even with little equity at stake offered you a leveraged property where any gains are a magnified percentage of what you have at risk   last welcome to money se consider adding some more details to your profile

here 's an excerpt from visa 's card acceptance guidelines for visa merchants pdf   the merchant name is the single most important factor in cardholder    recognition of transactions therefore it is critical that the    merchant name while reflecting the merchant ’s doing business as    dba name also be clearly identifiable to the cardholder this can    minimize copy requests resulting from merchant    merchant applications typically list the merchant name as the merchant    dba this may differ from the legal name which can represent the    corporate owner or parent company and may differ from the owner ’s    name which for sole proprietorships may reflect the business owner i think that the key statement above is therefore it is critical that the merchant name be clearly identifiable to the cardholder since this merchant was not clearly identifiable to the cardholder they are in breach of a critical point in these guidelines this is from visa but i would assume that all other major credit cards would have similar guidelines for their merchants however keep in mind that these are guidelines and not necessarily rules

i 'm going to make an educated guess on 1 money markets invest in bonds with a very short time to maturity an mma at a bank will be invested in government bonds yields on these bonds are really low right now thus the yield on that mma is going to be pretty low when you make a deposit in a savings account the bank uses some of that money to lend back out to its customers in the form of car loans mortgages etc these rates are higher so the bank is willing to pay you a bit more than the yield mma so they can use your money for these loans for 2 your time window is short so there are n't really a lot of options for you keeping your money where it is will actually cost you money in fees you can do as i suggested in my comment above close the current savings account that 's hitting you with fees and open a free high yield savings account you might get 1.1 if you average $ 60k in the account over the next 6 months you 'll earn $ 200 250 after taxes you did n't ask about cds but lately shorter term cds are paying less than savings accounts going out to a year will get you just above the rate on a high yield savings account two years just a little more these are outside your goal window so they are n't an option for you

you signed a contract to pay the loan   you owe the money    stories of people being arrested over defaulted student loans are usually based in contempt of court warrants when the person failed to appear in court when the collection agency filed suit against them explore student loan forgiveness program research collections and bankruptcy and how to deal with collection agencies   there are pitfalls in communicating with them which restart the clock on bad debt aging off the credit report and which can be used to say that you agreed to pay a debt   for instance if you make any sort of payment on any debt a case can be made that you have assumed the debt   once you are aware of the pitfalls contact the collection agency in writing and dispute the debt   force them to prove that it is your debt   force them to prove that they have the right to collect it   force them to prove the amount   dispute the fairness of the amount    doubling your principal in 6 years is a bit    so work with the collectors establish that the debt is valid and negotiate a settlement   or let it stay in default your credit report in the us is shot   it will be a long time before the default ages off your report   this is important if you try to open a bank account rent an apartment or get a job in the us   these activities do not always require a credit report but they often do   you will not be able to borrow money or establish a credit card in the us here 's a decent informational site regarding what they can do to collect the loan   pay special attention to administrative wage garnishment   they can likely hit you with that one   you might be for a court summons but only requires that the collectors be able to confirm that you work for a company that is subject to us laws update   i am informed that federally funded student loans are not available to international students   is only possible for debts to the federal government   private companies must go through the courts to force settlement of debt   op is safe from

a credit card is essentially a contract where they will loan you money in an on demand basis   it is not a contract for you to loan them money the money that you have overpaid is generally treated as if it is a payment for a charge that you have made that has not been processed yet   the bank can not treat that money as a deposit and thus leverage it make money them selves you can open an account and get a debit card   this would allow you to accrue interest for your deposit while using your money   but if you find one willing to pay you 25 interest please share with the rest of us

short answer is to put the max 15 contribution into your espp long answer is that since you want to be saving as much as you can anyway this is a great way to force you to do it and pick up at least a 15 return every six months or however often your plan makes a purchase i say at least because sometimes an espp will give you the lower of the beginning or end period stock price and then a 15 discount off of that but check the details of your plan if you feel like your company 's stock is a good long term investment then hold onto the shares when purchased otherwise sell as soon as you get them and bank that 15 return

as mentioned in the comments there are costs associated with owning living in an apartment first you have to pay maintenance charges on a monthly basis and perhaps also property tax find out the overall outgoings when you live in that apartment add the emi payments to the bank it should not be way higher than your current rent as an advantage you are getting an asset when you buy an apartment rent is a complete loss least financial terms so real estate is in general a good idea over paying rent as for the loan part personal loans are by far the most expensive of loans as they are in general unsecured loans but do check with your bank one way is to try and get a student loan which should be cheaper if you can borrow from family that is the best option you could return the money with perhaps bank fixed deposit rates it is better to pay family interest than bank if none of the options are workable then personal loan is something you need to look at with a clear goal to pay it off as soon as possible and try to take it in stages as an when you require it and if possible avoid taking all the at once

either way letting these institutions fail would have undoubtedly produced a worse result best case scenario complete credit freeze i.e no credit cards   worst case scenario even the most financially sound banks fail as part of a financial domino effect and we 're back to trading deer skin for   the best way to prevent these kinds of situations is to never get in them in the first place   placing graduated capital constraints on larger and larger financial institutions i.e.   the larger your balance sheet the greater the percentage of capital you must retain to offset risk is the best way to protect against financial collapse   this way competitive market forces would remain intact while reducing risk   basel 3 addresses some of these issues but i speculate more will need to be done to prevent another collapse from happening in   the future

i think the idea here is that because of the way mortgages are amortized you can drop additional principal payments in the early years of the mortgage and significantly lower the overall interest expense over the life of the loan a heloc accrues interest like a credit card so if you make a large principal payment using a heloc you will be able to retire those chunks of debt quicker than if you made normal mortgage payments i have n't worked out the numbers but i suspect that you could achieve similar results by simply paying ahead making even one extra payment per year will take 7 9 years off of a 30 year loan i think that the advantage of the heloc approach is that if you borrow enough you may be able to recalculate lower the payment of the mortgage

your question is actually quite broad so will try to split it into it 's key parts yes standard bank isas pay very poor rates of interest at the moment they are however basically risk free and should track inflation   any investment in the 6 7 return range at the moment will be linked to stock stock always carries large risks ~50 swings in capital are pretty standard in the short run in the long run it generally beats every other asset class by miles if you ca n’t handle those types of short terms swings you should n’t get involved if you do want to invest in stock there is a hefty ignorance tax waiting at every corner in terms of how brokers construct their fees in a nutshell there is a different best value broker in the uk for virtually every band of capital and they make their money through people signing up when they are in range x and not moving their money when they reach band y or just having a large marketing budget and screwing you from the start at ~1 a year is def in this category there is n't much of an obvious way around this if you are adamant you do n't want to learn about it the way the market is constructed is just a total predatory for the complete novice there are middle ground style investments between the two extremes you are looking at bonds bond funds and mixes of bonds and small amounts of stock such as the vanguard income or conservative growth funds outlined here can return more than savings accounts with less risk than stocks but again its a very diverse field that 's hard to give specific advice about without knowing more about what your risk tolerance timelines and aims are if you do go down this or the pure stock fund route it will need to be purchased via a broker in an isa wrapper the broker charges a platform fee the fund charges a fund fee in both cases you want these as low as possible the telegraph has a good heat map for the best value isa platform providers by capital range here fund fees are always in the key investor document under ongoing charges

another reason flexibility and liquidity   there is a fundamental difference between installment and revolving debt such that it could be rational to pay revolving debt before an amortizing loan    lets say you have 100 k in cash a 100 k mortgage at 4 and 4 25 k credit cards at maximum balance and a 0 promotional rate at least for now    if you pay off the mortgage you may not get liquidity if you need it   this path is not necessarily reversible    if you pay off the credit cards you have 100 k of credit available to you   you can reverse to the case of having 100 k in cash and 200 k in debt

an order is your command to the broker to say sell 100 shares of aapl an executed order or partially executed order is when all or some of that command is successfully completed a transaction is an actual exchange of shares for money and there may be one or more transactions per executed order   for example the broker might perform all of the following 5 transactions in order to do what you asked on the other hand if the broker can not execute your order then 0 transactions have taken place the fee schedule you quote is saying that no matter how many transactions the broker has to perform in order to fill your order and no matter what the share prices are they 're only going to charge you $ 0.005 per share $ 0.50 in this example of 100 shares subject to certain limits however as it says at the top of the page you linked our fixed pricing for stocks etfs exchange traded products or and warrants charges a fixed amount per share or a set percent of trade value and includes all ib commissions exchange and most regulatory fees with the exception of the transaction fees which are passed through on all stock sales certain transaction fees are passed through to the client   the transaction fee you included above is the sec fee on sales   many but not all transaction fees do depend on the prices of the shares involved as a result they can not be called fixed fees for example if you sell 100 shares of aapl at $ 150 each but if you sell 100 shares of amzn at $ each so the broker will charge you the same $ 0.50 on either of those orders but the sec will charge you more for the expensive amzn shares than for the cheaper aapl shares the reason this specific sec fee mentions aggregate sales rather than trade value is because this particular sec fee applies only to the seller and not to the buyer   so they could have written aggregate trade value but they probably wanted to highlight to the reader that the fee is only charged on sells

what you have is usually called a pre paid credit card   you pay some money indian rupees to the credit card company and then you can use the card to pay for purchases etc in foreign non indian currencies upto the remaining balance on the card if a proposed charge exceeds the remaining balance the transaction will be declined when you try to use the card   there might be multiple ways that the card is set up e.g. it might be restricted to charge purchases denominated in us dollars alone or you might be able to use it anywhere in the world except india   the balance on the card might be denominated in inr or in us$ say in the latter case the exchange rate at which your inr payment was converted into the $ us balance is fixed and agreed to at the time of the original payment you paid inr 70 k say and the balance was set to us$ 1000 even though the exchange rate on the open market would have given you a few more us dollars in the former case with the balance denominated in inr a charge of us$ 100 say would be converted to inr at a fixed agreed upon rate or at the current exchange rate that the visa or mastercard network is using plus typically a 3 fee currency exchange fee and your balance in inr will decrease accordingly with all that as if you made a purchase from walmart usa and later returned it for a credit it should increase your credit card balance   appropriately you may be with currency conversion fees along the way depending on how your card is set up but with a us$ card a credit of us$ 100 should increase your card balance by us$ 100 so that $ us 100 can be spent on something else instead   in short the card is    your bank account you can not spend more than the remaining balance on the card just like you can not withdraw more money from your bank account than you have in the account and you can recharge your card by making more inr payments into it so as to increase the available balance but it is like a current account in that you are unlikely to earn interest on the balance the way you do with a savings account so what if you are back in india and have no further use of this card can you get your balance back as cash or deposit into your regular bank account call the customer help line or read the card agreement you signed

it can certainly help build a credit score but remember that businesses gain credit differently from individuals   depending on the country there is n't usually a national register of business credit ratings the way there is for individuals   the credit record you 'd be gaining is with your own bank only banks will usually base your business credit record on revenue and transactional loads rather than merely on having and holding a credit card   that said it is n't always that easy to get a business credit card and so it is a useful thing to have for credibility with clients depending on the type of work you do a credit card can also sometimes work out cheaper and faster for financing small overdrafts than a regular business overdraft facility   that said i 've found that larger loans over a five year term can work out much cheaper for an established business than they would for an individual even where the business itself has no history of using credit

if significant amounts are involved that would be a good time to consult a tax professional ea cpa licensed in your state   generally sale of a business is an ordinary income and you can only deduct tangible expenses as joe said that would be laptops bills expenses per receipt of course they must all be directly attributable to the business you will need to be able to show that the laptops has only been used in business recapture depreciation etc same with all the rest of the expenses if you 're incorporated i.e. you hold this software under an s corp then you 're selling stocks not business and the tax treatment may be different but i 'm guessing this is not the case for you

it will depend largely on your broker what type of stop and trailing stop orders they provide saying that i have not come across any brokers yet that offer limit orders with trailing stop orders   unlike a standard stop order where you can either make it a market stop order or a limit stop order usually most brokers have trailing stop orders as market orders only where you can either set the trailing stop to be a dollar value or percentage from the most recent high remember also that trailing stop orders will be based on the intra day highs and not the highest closing price that means that if the share price spikes up during the day your trailing stop will move up and if the price then spikes down you may be stopped out prematurely after which the price might rally again for this reason i try to base my trailing stops on the highest closing price by using standard stop loss orders and moving it up manually after the close of trade if the share price has closed at a new high this takes a few minutes each evening depending on how many stocks you have to check and adjust the stops for but gives you more control using this method will also enable you to set limit orders attached to your stop loss triggers and you wo n't have to keep your trailing too close to the last high price thus potentially causing you to get stopped out prematurely slightly off track but may be handy if you set profit targets my broker has recently introduced trailing take profit orders the way it works is say you have a profit target of 50 so you buy at $ 2 and want to take profits if the price reaches $ 3 you could set your trailing take profit trigger at say $ or above and set a trail by amount of say $ 0.10 so if the price after hitting $ falls to $ 3.00 you will be stopped out and collect your profits if the price moves up to $ and then falls to $ 3.20 you will be stopped out at $ 3.20 and make some extra profits if the price continues going up the trailing take profit will continue to move up always $ 0.10 below the highest price reached i think this would be a very useful order if you were range trading where you could set the trailing take profit trigger near recent resistance so you can get out if prices start reversing at or around the resistance but continue profiting if the price breaks through the resistance

reporting costs on a fully loaded basis means that the business should report costs directly and indirectly associated with its product and the relevant indirect costs e.g. overhead indirect charges etc if you 're looking at a company in general the fully loaded cost basis of the firm is essentially all costs related to the it offers in economics accounting 101 terms reporting costs on a fully loaded basis means reporting both the fixed and variable costs associated with production fixed costs are costs that remain constant regardless of how much the firm produces e.g. general overhead like rent managers salaries etc while variable costs are per unit costs that may change as the firm increases or decreases production e.g. the cost of materials hourly wages etc

serious answer this would be a horrible idea for you so do n't do it   theoretical answer   this gets more complicated   if you are refusing to pay your student loans this is bad for the economy because you just destroyed the value associated with that payment   you essentially robbed the person holding the debt since you promised to pay it off     however you also stimulate the economy by buying goods   i 'm just an armchair economist but i would say that the detriment of not paying your debt is higher than the benefit of paying for the goods   now lets say you never say your not paying of your loans and instead just pay the minimum payment and buy the goods   now you are helping the economy because your debt is still generating money and you are injecting real money through your payment   so you essentially made more money for the economy   so long as the system believes you can pay of the debt the system is able to hold more money   this is actually why most credit companies want you to pay the minimum balance that and the interest earns them far more money than you borrowed

yes absolutely   the hsa when used for medical expenses allows you to essentially pay for your medical expenses tax free even if you do n't have extra room in your budget you can fund the hsa as you incur medical expenses then withdraw money to pay the expenses and you 'll see an immediate tax benefit at tax time   however let 's say that you have plenty of room in your budget and you do n't have a lot of medical expenses you already contribute the maximum to your 401(k or ira and you want to do more the hsa acts like a retirement account in this case allowing you to contribute before tax money and let it grow untaxed   the hsa does have a huge benefit that no other retirement account has if you choose not to reimburse yourself for medical expenses but you keep track of the unreimbursed expenses you incur then you can reimburse yourself for these expenses at any point in the future completely tax free essentially your contributions are treated like a traditional ira but your withdrawals are treated like a roth ira and can be done at any age if you do n't acquire enough medical expenses you can still withdraw whatever is left at age 65 and those withdrawals will be taxed like a traditional ira   the hsa provides for tax free contributions and growth if used for medical expenses and tax deferred growth if withdrawn after age 65 without medical expenses

this is slightly opinion based is it appropriate to invest small amounts for short periods of time   at your age and the time period i would say no this is because although the index fund do return 6 7 on average there are several times it and goes negative as well stock markets in short periods like 6 months can be unpredictable at times a downturn will remain stagnant for periods of 2 3 years before suddenly zoom ahead if you are not to particular about the time when you need the changes done i.e. the changes can in worst case wait for few years then yes investing in index fund would make sense   else you are well off keeping this in savings try cd 's if they can offer better rates for such durations

it depends on your tax rate multiply your marginal rate including state if applicable by your 3.1 to figure out how much you are saving through the deduction then subtract that from the 3.1 to get the effective rate on the mortgage for example if you are in the 28 bracket with no state tax impact from the mortgage your effective rate on the mortgage is this also assumes you 'd still itemize deductions without the mortgage otherwise the effective deduction is less others have pointed out more behavioral reasons for wanting to pay off the car first but from a purely financial impact this is the way to analyze it this is also your risk free rate to compare additional investing to after taking into account taxes on investments

gt;you assume that student performance is a good proxy for teacher performance one of the bigger influences on student performance is parent engagement   if the goal is success in actual conveyance of knowledge then external factors are merely the environment in which the performance or lack thereof must be executed   if a teacher is incapable of reaching a particular group of students due to whatever environmental reasons then that teacher is obviously not performing in that environment   it would be best then for everyone including that teacher to get a different teacher in their place and for that teacher then to attempt to teach in a different environment where they may be capable of shining rather than to keep them in an environment where they are failing   a big part of the problem here is that merit is seen by teachers as if it were a judgment of them as people which ironically enough is a rather juvenile mindset when in fact it is merely a judgement of their specific performance in a particular situation   and as far as pay is concerned pay varies in virtually every profession and industry and people move and choose accordingly the seeking of some utopian is woefully naive

for this the internal rate of return is preferred in short all cash flows need to be discounted to the present and set equal to 0 so that an implied rate of return can be calculated you could try to work this out by hand but it 's practically hopeless because of solving for roots of the implied rate of return which are most likely complex it 's better to use a spreadsheet with this capability such as 's calc the average return on equity is 9 so anything higher than that is a rational choice example using this simple tool the formula variables can easily be input for instance the first year has a presumed cash inflow of $ because the insurance has a 30 discount from $ that is assumed to be otherwise paid a cash inflow of $ 40,000 to finance the a cash outflow of $ 40,000 to fund the a $ 400 outflow for inspection and an outflow in the amount of the first year 's interest on the loan this should be repeated for each year   they can be input as they are for each year and the calculator will do the rest

stock returns can not be evaluated on its own you need to take into account inflation and the return of other investment vehicles over the long run you want to earn more than your peers ie inflation or lose less than them stock lets you buy into the profits of a company managed by others so the fundamental question is do those company managers make better decision than average person of course there are times when they make awful decisions eg just before dotcom bubble and sometimes the best decision is to close the business but overall those people are much better educated have higher iq more etc and so over long time and across all the companies this is correct and hence the stock market premium

points are significant levels technical analysts can use to determine directional movement support and resistance pivot points use the prior period 's high low and close to formulate future support and resistance in this regard pivot points are predictive or leading indicators there are at least five different versions of pivot points i will focus on standard pivot points here as they are the simplest if you are looking to trade off daily charts you would work out your pivot points from the prior month 's data for example pivot points for first trading day of february would be based on the high low and close for january they remain the same for the entire month of february new pivot points would then be calculated on the first trading day of march using the high low and close for february to work out the standard pivot points you use the high low and close from the previous period i.e. for daily charts it would be from the previous month in the following formulas you will now have 5 horizontal lines p r2 s1 and s2 which will set the general tone for price action over the next month a move above the pivot point p suggests strength with a target to the first resistance a break above first resistance shows even more strength with a target to the second resistance level r2 the converse is true on the downside a move below the pivot point p suggests weakness with a target to the first support level s1 a break below the first support level shows even more weakness with a target to the second support level s2 the second resistance and support levels r2 s2 can also be used to identify potentially overbought and oversold situations a move above the second resistance level r2 would show strength but it would also indicate an overbought situation that could give way to a similarly a move below the second support level s2 would show weakness but would also suggest a short term oversold condition that could give way to a bounce this could be used together with a momentum indicator such as rsi or stochastic to confirm overbought or oversold conditions   pivot points offer a methodology to determine price direction and then set support and resistance levels however it is important to confirm pivot point signals with other technical analysis indicators such as candle stick reversal patterns stochastic and general support and resistance levels in the price action these pivot points can be handy but i actually have n’t used them for trade setups and entries myself i prefer to use candle sticks together with stochastic to determine potential turning points and then take out trades based on these you can then use the pivot points resistance and support levels to help you estimate profit targets or areas to start becoming cautious and start tightening your stops say for example you have gone long from a signal you got a few days ago you are now in profit and the price is now approaching r2 whilst the stochastic is approaching overbought you might want to start tightening your stop loss as you might expect some weakness in the price in the near future if prices continue up you keep increasing your profits if prices do reverse then you keep the majority of your existing profits this would become part of your trade management if you are after finding potential market turning points and take out trades based on these then i would suggest using candlestick charting reversal patterns for your trade setups the patterns i like to use most in my trading can be described as either the hammer or one white soldier for bullish reversals and shooting star or one black for bearish reversals below are diagrams of where to place your entries and exits on both bullish and bearish reversal patterns bullish reversal pattern    so after some period of weakness in the price you would look for a bullish day where the price closes above the previous day ’s high you place your buy order here just before market close and place your initial stop just below the low of the day you would apply this either for an uptrending stock where the price has from or near the trendline or moving average or a ranging stock where price is bouncing off the support line the trade is reinforced if the stochastic is in or near the oversold and crossing back upwards volume on the up day is higher than volume on the down days and the market as a whole is moving up as well the benefit with this entry is that you are in early so you capture any bullish move up at the open of the next day such as gaps the drawbacks are that you need to be in front of your screen before market close to get your price close to the market close and you may get if prices reverse at the open of the next day thus being stopped out with a small loss as the price moves up you would move your stop loss to just below the low of each day alternative bullish reversal entry   an alternative entry would be to wait for after market close and then start your analysis easier to do after market close than whilst the market is open and less emotions involved place a stop buy order to buy at the open of next trading day just above the high of the bullish green candle your stop is placed exactly the same just below the low of the green bullish candle the benefits of this alternative entry include you avoid the trade if the price reverses at the open of next day thus avoiding a potential small loss in other words you wait for further confirmation on the next trading day and you avoid trading during market open hours where your emotions can get the better of you i prefer to do my trading after market close so prefer this alternative the drawback with this alternative is that you may miss out on bullish news prior to and at the next open so miss out on some potential profits if prices do gap up at the open this may also increase your loss on the trade if the prices gaps up then reverses and hits your stop on the same day however if you choose this method then you will just need to incorporate this into your trading plan as potential slippage bearish reversal pattern    so after some short period of strength in the price you would look for a bearish day where the price closes below the previous day ’s low you place your sell short order here just before market close and place your initial stop just above the high of the day you would apply this either for an stock where the price has from or near the trendline or moving average or a ranging stock where price is bouncing off the resistance line the trade is reinforced if the stochastic is in or near the overbought and crossing back downwards volume on the up day is higher than volume on the up days and the market as a whole is moving down as well the benefit with this entry is that you are in early so you capture any bearish move down at the open of the next day such as gaps the drawbacks are that you need to be in front of your screen before market close to get your price close to the market close and you may get if prices reverse at the open of the next day thus being stopped out with a small loss as the price moves down you would move your stop loss to just above the high of each day alternative bearish reversal entry    an alternative entry would be to wait for after market close and then start your analysis easier to do after market close than whilst the market is open and less emotions involved place a stop sell short order to sell at the open of next trading day just below the low of the bearish red candle your stop is placed exactly the same just above the high of the red bearish candle the benefits of this alternative entry include you avoid the trade if the price reverses at the open of next day thus avoiding a potential small loss in other words you wait for further confirmation on the next trading day and you avoid trading during market open hours where your emotions can get the better of you i prefer to do my trading after market close so prefer this alternative the drawback with this alternative is that you may miss out on bearish news prior to and at the next open so miss out on some potential profits if prices do gap down at the open this may also increase your loss on the trade if the prices gaps down then reverses and hits your stop on the same day however if you choose this method then you will just need to incorporate this into your trading plan as potential slippage you could also trade other candle stick patterns is similar ways and with the long entries you can also use them to get into the market with longer term trend following strategies you would usually just use a larger stop for longer term trading to determine the size of your order you would use the price difference between your entry and your stop you should not be risking more than 1 of your trading capital on any one trade so if your trading capital is $ 20,000 your risk per trade should be $ 200 if you were looking to place your buy at 5.00 and had your initial stop at $ you would divide $ 200 by $ 0.40 to get 500 stocks to buy using this form of money management you keep your losses down to a maximum of $ 200 some trades may be a bit higher due to some slippage which you should allow for in your trading plan which becomes your r multiple your aim is to have your average win at or higher 3 x your average loss which will give you a positive expectancy even with a win ratio under 50 once you have written down your trading rules you can search stock charts for potential setups when you find one you can backtest the chart for similar setup over the past few years for each setup in the past down the prices you would have entered at where you would have set your stop work out your r and go day by day moving your stop as you go and see where you would have been stopped out work out your profit or loss in terms of r for each setup and then add them up if you get a positive r multiple then this may be a good stock to trade on this setup if you get a negative r multiple then maybe give this stock a miss and look for the next setup you can setup watch lists of stocks that perform well for both long setups and short setups and then trade these stocks when you get a new signal it can take some time starting off but once you have got your watch lists for a particular setup you just need to keep monitoring those stocks you can create other watch lists for other type of setups you have backtested as well

not sure i understand your question    if you 're talking about paying off the payable you decrease the liability and decrease an asset aka when you actually pay the wages decrease cash and decrease wages payable    if you 're talking about closing expense accounts you simply credit the expense to zero and debit retained earnings for the same amount which will reduce re since re is equity and has a normal credit balance    if you 're talking about accruing revenue you simply do the opposite of an expense if revenue is accrued then you credit a revenue account increase it and increase cash or receivable    if you 're closing a revenue account you debit the account to zero and credit retained earnings or income summary which eventually gets closed into re anyways    the sum of these revenues and expenses will leave you either with a debit or credit balance in re a credit balance means you have a profit and a debit balance means you have a loss other expenses like sales tax and other expenses excluding cogs might also be taken directly from re or identified at the time of sale and held in its own separate account    but i 'm not sure if this will answer your question since i 'm not sure what you 're asking

you 're not missing any concepts it sounds like you are contributing a piece of collateral to the business and you want to know a fair way to value how much this contribution of collateral is worth technically the economic answer would be the difference in interest between a secured loan and an unsecured loan   so for example suppose that the business could get a loan at 17 without the collateral maybe just on a credit card but with the duplex as collateral it is able to get the loan at 10.5 in principle the value of this collateral is 17 10.5 or 6.5 because it has allowed the business to pay 6.5 less interest on its loan

call me overly paranoid but letting unknown people know your charges and your personal information is asking for trouble they know who you are and how to find you and how much money you typically make if they are decent people okay but otherwise they have good ground for a crime against you you con you target thieves on you steal your identity anything else which you wo n't like if it happens and it has noting to do with being from philippines people are everywhere crimes happen all the time just the less you expose yourself the less likely a crime will be committed against you my suggestion would be to share as little financial and personal data as possible especially to share as little actual money figures as possible also see this question

the question is about the us but to add the european perspective the rule over here i only know german law but assume it 's the same for all of the euro area is that you need more than half of the bill or you have to be able to prove that more than half of the bill was destroyed good luck in order to get it replaced coins can also be replaced but all only as long as you did n't break it on purpose so giving half of the bill to the cab driver would be on purpose and if the central bank knows about it make the bill or coin invalid german information

but they were spending on things that people did nt need ie tanks guns bombs not things a consumer would want or could use this is the difference between productive work and the hole diggers i was illustrating before govt spending for the sake of spending does not create wealth it on capital from more productive avenues sure the govt needs to spend on war items if there 's a legitimate threat of us being attacked but govt spending should always be kept to a minimum so that the private sector can achieve the highest level of productivity with the scarce resources we have

i 'm going to post this as an answer because it 's from the gofundme website but ultimately even they say to speak with a tax professional about it   am i responsible for taxes us only while this is by no means a guarantee donations on gofundme are    simply considered to be personal gifts which are not for the most    part taxed as income in the us however there may be particular    case specific instances where the income is taxable dependent on    amounts received and use of the monies etc      we 're unable to    provide specific tax advice since everyone 's situation is different    and tax rules can change on a yearly basis we advise that you    maintain adequate records of donations received and consult with your    personal tax adviser      additionally wepay will not report the funds    you collect as earned income it is up to you and a tax professional    to determine whether your proceeds represent taxable income the    person who 's listed on the wepay account and ultimately receives the    funds may be responsible for taxes      again every situation is    different so please consult with a tax professional in your area en us i responsible for taxes us and here 's a blurb from which adds to the confusion but enforces the speak with a professional idea crowdfunding services have to report to the irs campaigns that total    at least $ 20,000 and 200 transactions money collected from    crowdfunding is considered either income or a gift this is where things get a little tricky if money donated is not a    gift or investment it is considered taxable income even a gift could    be subject to the gift tax but that tax applies only to the gift    giver non taxable gifts these are donations made without the expectation of getting something    in return think of all those fans who gave money to    gofundme to help the cost of tom ’s nfl fine    for those fans are n’t expecting anything in return    except maybe some satisfaction so their donations are considered    gifts under irs rules an individual can give another individual a    gift of up to $ 14,000 without tax implications so unless a fan    is particularly generous his or her gofundme gift wo n’t be taxed taxable income now consider that same fan donating $ 300 to a business    venture if the fan receives stock or equity in the company in return    for the donation this is considered an investment and is not taxable    however if the business owner does not offer stock or equity in the    company the money donated could be considered business income and the    recipient would need to report it on a tax return

st. john 's church richmond virginia march 23   mr president no man thinks more highly than i do of the patriotism as well as abilities of the very worthy gentlemen who have just addressed the house but different men often see the same subject in different lights and therefore i hope it will not be thought to those gentlemen if entertaining as i do opinions of a character very opposite to theirs i shall speak forth my sentiments freely and without reserve this is no time for ceremony the question before the house is one of awful moment to this country for my own part i consider it as nothing less than a question of freedom or slavery and in proportion to the magnitude of the subject ought to be the freedom of the debate it is only in this way that we can hope to arrive at truth and fulfil the great responsibility which we hold to god and our country should i keep back my opinions at such a time through fear of giving offence i should consider myself as guilty of treason towards my country and of an act of toward the of heaven which i above all kings   mr. president it is natural to man to indulge in the illusions of hope we are apt to shut our eyes against a painful truth and listen to the song of that till she us into is this the part of wise men engaged in a great and struggle for liberty are we disposed to be of the number of those who having eyes see not and having ears hear not the things which so nearly concern their temporal salvation for my part whatever anguish of spirit it may cost i am willing to know the whole truth to know the worst and to provide for it   i have but one lamp by which my feet are guided and that is the lamp of experience i know of no way of judging of the future but by the past and judging by the past i wish to know what there has been in the conduct of the british ministry for the last ten years to justify those hopes with which gentlemen have been pleased to solace themselves and the house is it that insidious smile with which our petition has been lately received trust it not sir it will prove a to your feet suffer not yourselves to be with a kiss ask yourselves how this reception of our petition with these war like preparations which cover our waters and our land are fleets and armies necessary to a work of love and reconciliation have we shown ourselves so unwilling to be reconciled that force must be called in to win back our love let us not deceive ourselves sir these are the implements of war and the last arguments to which kings resort i ask gentlemen sir what means this martial array if its purpose be not to force us to submission can gentlemen assign any other possible motive for it has great britain any enemy in this quarter of the world to call for all this accumulation of and armies no sir she has none they are meant for us they can be meant for no other they are sent over to bind and upon us those chains which the british ministry have been so long forging and what have we to oppose to them shall we try argument sir we have been trying that for the last ten years have we anything new to offer upon the subject nothing we have held the subject up in every light of which it is capable but it has been all in vain shall we resort to and humble what terms shall we find which have not been already exhausted let us not i you sir deceive ourselves sir we have done everything that could be done to avert the storm which is now coming on we have we have we have we have ourselves before the and have its to arrest the tyrannical hands of the ministry and parliament our have been our have produced additional violence and insult our have been disregarded and we have been with contempt from the foot of the in vain after these things may we indulge the fond hope of peace and reconciliation there is no longer any room for hope if we wish to be if we mean to preserve those privileges for which we have been so long we mean not to abandon the noble struggle in which we have been so long engaged and which we have pledged ourselves never to abandon until the glorious object of our contest shall be obtained we must fight i repeat it sir we must fight an appeal to arms and to the god of hosts is all that is left us   they tell us sir that we are weak unable to cope with so an but when shall we be stronger will it be the next week or the next year will it be when we are totally and when a british guard shall be in every house shall we gather strength by and inaction shall we acquire the means of resistance by lying on our backs and hugging the phantom of hope until our enemies shall have bound us hand and foot sir we are not weak if we make a proper use of those means which the god of nature placed in our power three millions of people armed in the holy cause of liberty and in such a country as that which we possess are by any force which our enemy can send against us besides sir we shall not fight our battles alone there is a just god who over the of nations and who will raise up friends to fight our battles for us the battle sir is not to the strong alone it is to the vigilant the active the brave besides sir we have no election if we were base enough to desire it it is now too late to retire from the contest there is no retreat but in submission and slavery our chains are forged their may be heard on the plains of boston the war is let it come i repeat it sir let it come   it is in vain sir to the matter gentlemen may cry peace there is no peace the war is actually begun the next that sweeps from the north will bring to our ears the clash of arms our are already in the field why stand we here idle what is it that gentlemen wish what would they have is life so dear or peace so sweet as to be purchased at the price of chains and slavery forbid it god i know not what course others may take but as for me give me liberty or give me death   this speech is the best response i can give

careful   i would personally need a lot more than $ 5 more per hour to go from w-2 employment to 1099 employment   it boils down to two reasons 1 employers pay a huge amount of taxes on behalf of their employees and 2 you would have to pay all of your own withholding up front your current proposal from them does n't account for that there are also risks that you face as a 1099   on the first item your employer currently pays 6.2 of your social security tax you pay the other 6.2 if you go to 1099 status you will be self employed as an independent contractor and have to pay the full 12.4 out of your increased 1099 wages   on the second item your employer also does your withholding out of your paychecks based on what you tell them on a form w-4 if you 're disciplined enough to pay this out yourself in estimated taxes every time you get a paycheck great many people are n't and just see a much bigger paycheck with no taxes out of it and end up with a large tax bill at the end of the year   overall there are some other considerations like healthcare and other benefits these will not be available to you as a 1099 employee you can also be terminated unless you have a specific contract length with the company   as i see it not including any benefits you would receive you 're looking at less money in your pocket at $ as a contractor than at your $ your pay net social security deductions is $ 48 x 40 hrs x 52 weeks = = as a 1099 $ you would net $ 50 x 40 hrs x 52 weeks = =   then there are the rest of taxes etc to figure out your real take home pay   i 'm not a tax advisor but i would be very careful to get the whole picture figured out before jumping i would ask for a lot more with the added risk you would take as an independent too

first of all the annual returns are an average there are probably some years where their return was several thousand percent   this can make a decade of 2 a year become an average of 20 second of all accredited investors are allowed to do many things that the majority of the population can not do although this is mostly tied to net worth less than 3 of the us population is registered as accredited investors accredited investors are allowed to participate in private offerings of securities that do not have to be registered with the sec although theoretically riskier these can have greater returns indeed a lot of companies that go public these days only do so after the majority of the growth potential is done for example a company like facebook in the 90s would have gone public when it was a million dollar company instead facebook went public when it was already a 100 billion dollar company the people that were privileged enough to be allowed to invest in facebook while it was private experienced 10000 returns public stock market investors from facebook 's ipo have experienced a nearly 100 return in comparison third there are even more rules that are simply different between the underclass and the especially when it comes to leverage the rules on margin in the stock market and options markets are simply different between classes of investors the more capital you have the less you actually have to use to open a trade imagine a situation where a retail investor can invest in a stock by only putting down 25 of the value of the stock 's shares someone with the net worth of an accredited investor could put down 5 of the value of the shares so if the stock goes up the person that already has money would earn a greater percentage than the that s actually investing to earn money at all fourth warren buffett 's fund and george soros funds are n't just in stocks george soros claim to fame was taking big bets in the foreign exchange market the leverage in that market is much greater than one can experience in the stock market fifth options anyone can open an options contract but getting someone else to be on the other side of it is harder someone with clout can negotiate a 10 year options contract for pretty cheap and gain greatly if their stock or other asset appreciates in value much greater there are cultural limitations that prompt some people to make a distinction between investing and gambling but others are not bound by those limitations and can take any kind of bet they like

because etfs unlike most other pooled investments can be easily shorted it is possible for institutional investors to take an arbitrage position that is long the underlying securities and short the etf   the result is that in a well functioning market where etf prices are what they should be these institutional investors would earn a risk free profit equal to the fee amount how much is this amount though etfs exist in a very competitive market   not only do they compete with each other but with index and mutual funds and with the possibility of constructing one 's own portfolio of the underlying   etf investors are very cost conscious as a result etf fees just barely cover their costs   typically etf providers do not even do their own trading   they issue new shares only in exchange for a bundle of the underlying securities so they have almost no costs   in order for an institutional investor to make money with the arbitrage you describe they would need to be able to carry it out for less than the fees earned by the etf   unlike the etf provider these investors face borrowing and other shorting costs and limitations as a result it is not profitable for them to attempt this   note that even if they had no costs their maximum upside would be a few basis points per year   lots of low risk investments do better than that i 'd also like to address your question about what would happen if there was an etf with exorbitant fees   two things about your suggested outcome are incorrect    if short sellers bid the price down significantly then the shares would be cheap relative to their stream of future dividends and investors would again buy them   in a well functioning market you ca n't bid the price of something that clearly is backed by valuable underlying assets down to near zero as you suggest in your question notice that there are limitations to short selling   the more shares are short sold the more difficult it is to locate share to borrow for this purpose   at first brokers start charging additional fees   as shares become harder to find they require that you obtain a locate which takes time and costs money   finally they will not allow you to short at all   unlimited short selling is not possible if there was an etf that charged exorbitant fees it would fail but not because of short sellers   there is an even easier arbitrage strategy investors would buy the shares of the etf which would be cheaper than the value of the underlying because of the fees and trade them back to the etf provider in exchange for shares of the underlying   this would drain down the underlying asset pool until it was empty    in fact it is this mechanism the ability to trade etf shares for shares of the underlying and vice versa that keeps etf prices fair within a small tolerance relative to the underlying indices

you want a fee only advisor   he charges like an architect or plumber by the hour or some other flat fee that is his only compensation he is not paid on commission at all   he is not affiliated with any financial services company of any kind    his office is starbucks   he does not have a well lit office like the commission broker down the street   he does not want you to hand him your money it stays in the brokerage account of your choice within reason some brokerage accounts are terrible and he 'll tell you to get out of those   he never asks for the password to your brokerage account   edit the uk recently outlawed commission brokers   these guys were competitive sales types who thrive on commissions and probably went into other sales jobs   so right now everyone is clamoring for the few proper financial advisors available   high demand is making them expensive   it may not be cost effective to hire an advisor you may need to learn it yourself   it 's not that hard   ever hear of a plumber who works totally for free and makes his money selling you wildly overpriced pipe   that 's what regular financial advisors are    they sell products that are deliberately made unnecessarily complex the purpose is first to conceal sales commissions and high internal fees and second to confuse you so the financial world feels so daunting that you feel like you need their help just to navigate it    they 're trying to fry your brain so just give up and trust them    products like whole life and variable annuities are only the poster children for how awful all of their financial products are   these products exist to fleece the consumer without quite breaking the law   of course everyone goes to see them because they have well lit offices in every town and they 're free and easy to deal with do n't feel like you need to know everything about finance to invest   you do n't need to understand every complex financial product that the brokerage houses dreamed up they are designed to conceal and confuse as i discuss above and you do n't want them   the core of it is fairly simple and that 's all you really need to know    look at any smaller university and how they manage their endowments if whole life annuities and those complex financial products actually worked university endowments would be full of them    but they 're not   endowments are generally made of investments you can understand   partly because university boards are made of investment bankers who invented those products and know what a ripoff they are    some people refuse to learn anything   they are done with college and refuse to learn anything more    i hope that 's not you    because you should learn the workings of everything you 're investing in     if you do n't understand it do n't buy   and a fee only financial advisor wo n't ask you to   1000 well well advised university endowments seek the most successful products on the market and end up choosing products you can understand   that 's good news for you

the answer depends on what else you 'd do with that 2   but first let 's look at some actual numbers for simplicity 's sake let 's say you have a £ 100k mortgage outstanding your payment is £ 1000 per month and you want to pay £ 1000 extra per month   2 interest compounded monthly for simplicity so = per month   your interest is probably compounded daily but this simplifies the math and is n't too far off of it if you do n't pay it off early then first month you 'll owe £ minus £ 1000 so £   second month £ after interest then £ after payment   so on and so forth   after 24th month 2 years you 'll owe £ after that 24th payment   so you 've paid off £ 20,000 of balance at the cost of £ 24,000 total interest paid £ if you do pay off another £ 1000 so you put a total of £ 2000 in per month which is penalized .02 each payment for a total of £ 48,000 paid over the 24 months   after that 24 months you have a balance of £ so a bit over £ 44k paid off at the cost of £ 48k total interest and fees paid £ so at the end of the 24 month period you 've paid an extra £ 24 in interest fees than you would have otherwise   you of course have a lower loan balance at the end but you have n't saved any money overall and if you 're just refinancing at this point into a new loan you 're no better off and very slightly worse off even assuming the money will just sit in your bank account and do nothing   i think with daily compounding interest it will be around the same or slightly better but it 's not a significant amount now there is a third option perhaps pay £ so after penalty £ on the first month   this is that whole extra £ 1000 per month all up front where it makes the most difference for interest this does help some you pay £ in interest around £ 450 less   sounds good to me right   except you might be able to make more than £ 450 with that £ 24,000   £ 450 is of £ 24,000 meaning you just need to make a 2 return on your money to beat out this option and in fact that 's not surprising given the 2 interest rate   investing in the market even conservatively is likely though not guaranteed to be beneficial over a 2 year period it 's fairly risky though if you can think over 5 10 years it 's very likely to be substantially better   even a 4 5 return well below long term market averages will be quite a bit better and the market 's down quite a bit right now so it might be even better than that though it 's still a risk you can make a term deposit looks like fixed rate bond is the term even and at least break even right now it looks like 1.9 is common for a 2 year term deposit in the uk in total my recommendation would be against paying off the mortgage early particularly in this 2 interest rate period   2 is around inflation levels meaning you 're not really paying any real interest from one point of view   once the rates are higher then it may be worth considering    the exception here basically the standard exception to these questions is if you are otherwise going to spend the money on luxuries   in that case you 're better off prepaying the mortgage at least from a personal finance perspective if you can do so up front but not if you 're going to do it monthly   what is better for you personally in this regard is a question only you can answer of course

the process of borrowing shares and selling them is called shorting a stock or going short   when you use money to buy shares it is called going long in general your strategy of going long and short in the same stock in the same amounts does not gain you anything   let 's look at your two scenarios to see why when you start loot is trading at $ 20 per share   you purchased 100 shares for $ 2000 and you borrowed and sold 100 shares for $ 2000   you are both long and short in the stock for $ 2000   at this point you have invested $ 2000 and you got your $ 2000 back from the short proceeds   you own and owe 100 shares under scenario a the price goes up to $ 30 per share   your long shares have gone up in value by $ 1000   however you have lost $ 1000 on your short shares   your short is called and you return your 100 shares and have to pay interest   under this scenario after it is all done you have lost whatever the interest charges are under scenario b the prices goes down to $ 10 per share   your long shares have lost $ 1000 in value   however your short has gained $ 1000 in value because you can buy the 100 shares for only $ 1000 and return them and you are left with the $ 1000 out of the $ 2000 you got when you first sold the shorted shares   however because your long shares have lost $ 1000 you still have n't gained anything   here again you have lost whatever the interest charges are as explained in the traders exclusive article that posted in the comments there are investors that go long and short on the same stock at the same time   however this might be done if the investor believes that the stock will go down in a short term time frame but up in the long term time frame   the investor might buy and hold for the long term but go short for a brief time while holding the long position however that is not what you are suggesting   your proposal makes no prediction on what the stock might do in different periods of time   you are only attempting to hedge your bets   and it does n't work   a long position and a short position are opposites to each other and no matter which way the stock moves you 'll lose the same amount with one position that you have gained in the other position   and you 'll be out the interest charges from the borrowed shares every time with your comment you have stated that your scenario is that you believe that the stock will go up long term but you also believe that the stock is at a short term peak and will drop in the near future   this however does n't really change things much   let 's look again at your possible scenarios you believe that the stock is a long term buy but for some reason you are guessing that the stock will drop in the short term   under scenario a you were incorrect about your short term guess   and although you might have been correct about the long term prospects you have missed this gain   you are out the interest charges and if you still think the stock is headed up over the long term you 'll need to buy back in at a higher price under scenario b it turns out that you were correct about the short term drop   you pocket some cash but there is no guarantee that the stock will rise anytime soon   your investment has lost value and the gain that you made with your short is still tied up in stocks that are currently down your strategy does prevent the possibility of the unlimited loss inherent in the short   however it also prevents the possibility of the unlimited gain inherent in the long position     and this is a shame since you fundamentally believe that the stock is undervalued and is headed up   you are your long term gains for a chance at a small short term gain

it appears that you already know this but fico credit scores as controlled by fair isaac corporation are the real official credit scores and fico takes a cut on their production no matter which of the 3 major credit bureaus calculates the official score all using slightly different methods be careful when obtaining a score for making a big decision that it is a fico score because relatively few lenders will lend based on a non fico score that said some non fico scores are easy to obtain and can be roughly translated to an approximation of your score barclays bank credit cards offer a free transunion score the score is a 900 point scale while the fico score is an 850 point scale this is a simple ratio and you can calculate your approximate fico score by the formula

to answer i 'm going to make a few assumptions first the ideal scenario for a pre tax 401(k is the deposit goes in at a 25 tax rate i.e. the employee is in that bracket but withdrawn at 15 this may be true for many but not all it 's to illustrate a point   the spy s&p 500 index etf has a cost of per year if your 401(k fees are anywhere near 1 per year total over 10 years you 've paid nearly 10 in fees vs less than 1 for the etf above i suggest the ideal is that the 401(k saves you 10 on your taxes but if you pay 10 over the decade the benefit is completely negated   i can add to the above that funds outside the retirement accounts give off dividends which are tax favored and if you were to sell etfs held over a year they receive favorable cap gains rates   the deposit to get the matching funds should always be good advice it would take many years of high fees to destroy that but even that seemingly reasonable 1 fee can make any other deposits a bad approach   keep in mind when retired you will have a zero bracket in 2011 the combined standard deduction and exemption adding to $ as well as a 10 bracket the next $ 8500 so having some pretax money to take advantage of those brackets will help last the average person changes jobs now and then the ability to transfer the funds from the bad 401(k to an ira where you can control the investments is an option i 'd not ignore in the analysis   i arbitrarily picked 1 to illustrate my thoughts the same math will show a long time employee will get hurt by even if enough time passes what are the fees in your 401(k    edit study of 401(k fees put out by the dept of labor unfortunately it 's over 10 years old but it speaks to my point back then even a 2000 participant plan with $ 60 m in assets had 110 basis points this is 1.1 in fees on average whatever the distribution is those above this average should n't even participate in their plans except for matching and those on the other side should look at their expenses as points out below yes for those just shy of retirement the fee has less impact and of course they have a better idea if they will retire in a lower bracket those who have some catching up to do may benefit despite the fees

because the hft bought them in response to the guy buying the hft was only able to get them faster because his server and internet connection were faster that in combination with the fact that they intentionally just spray the exchange with a huge combination of buys if they do n't have anyone on the hook they just cancel    so the hft sends the exchange a bunch of buy orders they know 99.9 wo n't match up with a guy who 's looking to buy and cancel them however when they get a guy on the hook they let that one go through and do n't cancel it    a traditional market maker does n't do that they let all the orders go through and charge a higher price when someone wants it however this is accepted as fair because they 're providing volume they 're making sure that buyers and sellers will have an active market so it 's expect that they should be able to profit for having that convenience   when a hft can cancel their orders at will they 're not providing volume   it 's not uncommon for a market maker to buy as many shares as possible and then force you to pay more for it however they give people the ability to buy or sell shares    hft do n't do this they are fast enough to cancel buy orders unless they have a buyer on the hook as a result they can be a market maker without any losses that would be one thing but they do n't provide the market with liquidity they just dump the shares as soon as they 're done taking their haircut tax

hi ly   it 's really great you are doing this and i hope some of the suggestions help you    when i was in wonderful angkor wat a few things struck me as very helpful    1 make your tuk tuk recognizable and write you name somewhere this way when i go out of a temple you will be easy to spot   2 you seem to speak english well this is an important aspect your customers will really appreciate   3 from what i 've seen the methods for getting customers for your tuk tuk in siem reap is as follows get them when they get off the bus and drive them to the hotel then try to tell them to invite you back the next day for taking them to angkor wat i am sure this works but since everybody are doing it i imagine it 's the hardest way for customer acquisition you can distinguish yourself from the other drivers by    a. making sure you show the customers you have excellent english and you can share you knowledge with them    b. sell western style kind of less pushy smile at a potential customer when they see you they will smile back talk to them in your normal voice volume this will make them come closer since they want to hear what a nice smiling guy like is saying   then explain their options for visiting the temples     4 make deals with hotels and people trust the receptionists at their hotel more than street tuk tuks it is highly likely they will ask the reception for the best way to get to angkor wat and you should be the one they recommend try getting on as many lists as possible and high up that list as possible    5 having cold water wet wipes and other commodities are nice ideas but i am not sure this will what get people in your tuk tuk it will only make them more satisfied once they are inside it might be to hard and expensive to keep them ice cold but you can suggest travelers to stop at a kiosk where they can but some supplies before the trip or make a deal with a kiosk and before you exit siem reap stop there and give them a fresh water bottle from the fridge   most importantly do n't spend money on stuff like and curtains before you are sure they are money makers i am pretty sure 99 of customers will not notice they extended they take fresh air for granted     i hope you found this helpful and please feel free to message me   hope to see you soon

from my experience using paypal for selling products on ebay and for the last two experiences of a friend   can paypal get money from my bank account without my authorization this is assuming they have transferred the funds to me they ca n't pull money from your bank account without your authorization they will however take the money from your paypal account if it 's still there or leave you with a negative balance if you 've already withdrawn they will do this as soon as there is a claim against you and will only release the funds if the investigation ends in your favor any money received would first be used to satisfy the negative balance what actions can paypal takes against me if charge back amount is very high and i do n't agree pay them they will send it to a collections agency is there any case it is going to effect my bank account i.e. is there any chance paypal can block my bank account in india they will block you from using paypal if you try to sign up again with a different bank account or credit card and they recognize you as the account holder they will block that account as well

yes bond funds are marked to market so they will decline as the composition of their holdings will households actually have relative levels of credit to equity holdings   the reason why is because there is little return on credit making it irrational to hold any amount greater than to fund future liquidity needs risk adjusted and time discounted the vast majority of credit is held by insurance companies   pension funds have large stakes as well   banks hold even fewer bonds since they try to sell them as soon as they 've made them insurance companies are forced to hold a large percentage of their floats in credit then preferred equity   while this their returns it 's not a large problem for them because they typically hold bonds until maturity   only the ones who the risk of insurance will have to sell at unfavorable prices being able to predict interest rates thus bond prices accurately would make one the best bond manager in the world   while it does look like inflation will rise again soon just as it has during every other us expansion can it be assured when commodity prices are high in real terms and look like they may be in a collapse   the banking industry would have to produce credit at a much higher rate to counter the deflation of all physical goods households typically shun assets at low prices to pursue others at high prices so their holdings of bonds etfs should be expected to decline during a bond collapse   if insurance companies find it less costly to hold etfs then they will contribute to an increase in bond etf supply

to answer your question yes it 's often worth it to have investments that produce income do a google search for income vs growth investing and you 'll get a sense for two different approaches to investing in equities in a nutshell growth stocks think netflix etc do n't pay dividends but are poised to appreciate in price more than income stocks think banks utilities etc that tend to have less volatile prices but pay a consistent dividend in the long run decades growth stocks tend to outperform income stocks that 's why younger investors tend to pick growth stocks while those closer to retirement tend to stick with more stable income producing portfolio but there 's nothing wrong with a mixed approach either i agree with pete 's answer too

what you are doing is neither one   you are simply watching to make sure you do n't overdraw which itself suggests you might be living hand to mouth and not saving   keeping track of your money and budgeting are useful tools which help people get on top of their money   which tends to have the effect of allowing you to save    how much did you spend on groceries last month eating out gas if you were keeping track of your money you could say immediately what you spent and whether that is above or below average and why   how much do you plan to spend in the next 3 months on gas groceries eating out   if you knew the answer to that question then you would have a budget    and if those months go by and your budget proves to have been accurate or you as to what went wrong so you can learn and fix it then your budget is a functioning document that is helping you master your money   certainly the more powerful of the two is the keeping track or accounting of what has happened to you so far    it 's important that you keep track of every penny without letting stuff slip through the cracks    here you can use proper accounting techniques and maybe accounting software just like businesses do where they reconcile their accounting against their bank statements and wallet cash i shortcut that a little   i buy gift cards for mcdonalds panera starbucks etc and buy my meals with those   that way i only have one transaction to log $ 40 mcdonalds gift card instead of a dozen little meals   it works perfectly fine since i know all that money went to fast food   a little more dangerous is that i treat wallet cash the same way logging say two monthly entries of $ 100 to cash rather than 50 little transactions of left $ 1 tip at restaurant   this only works because cash is a tiny part of my overall expenditures not worth accounting   if it added up to a significant part i 'd want accounting on that

note i am the currency units   while i strongly suspect it 's us$ i do n't know from the chart   the system works the same no matter what the currency a call or a put is the right to sell put or buy call shares at a certain price on a certain day this is why you see a whole range of prices   not all possible stock values are represented the number of possibilities has to be kept reasonable   in this case the choices are even units for an expensive stock they may be spaced even farther apart than this the top of the chart says it 's for june   it 's actually the third friday in the month june 15th in this case   thus these are bets on how the stock will move in the next 10 days while the numbers are per share you can only trade options in lots of 100 the left side of the chart shows calls   suppose you sell a call at 19 the top of the chart   the last such trade would have gotten you a premium of per share the flip side of this is when the third friday rolls around it will most likely be exercised and they 'll be paying you only 19 a share for a stock now trading at something over 26   note the volume bid and ask columns though you're not going to get for such a call as there is no buyer   the most anybody is offering at present is a share now lets look farther down in the chart say a strike price of 30   the last trade was only .10 think it 's very unlikely that fb will rise above 30 to make this option worthwhile and thus you get very little for being willing to sell at that price   if fb stays at 26 the option will expire worthless and go away   if it 's up to 31 when the 15th rolls around they 'll exercise the option take your shares and pay you 30 for them   note that you already gave permission for the trade by selling the call you ca n't back out later if it becomes a bad deal going over to the other side of the chart with the puts here the transaction goes the other way come the 15th they have the option of selling you the shares for the strike price   lets look at the same values we did before   19   there 's no trading you ca n't do it 30   here you will collect 3.20 for selling the put   come the 15th they have the right to sell you the stock for 30 a share   if it 's still 26 they 're certainly going to do so but if it 's up to 31 it 's worthless and you pocket the 3.20 note that you will normally not be allowed to sell a call if you do n't own the shares in question   this is a safety measure as the risk in selling a call without the stock is infinite   if the stock somehow up to 10,000 when the 15th rolls around you would have to come up with the shares and the only way you could get them is buy them on the open market you would have to come up with a million dollars   if there simply are n't enough shares available to cover the calls the result is catastrophic whoever owns the shares simply gets to dictate terms to you   and in the days of old this sometimes happened

what other ways would you suggest plus if i truly believe that the product i 'm selling is going to improve your life it would be incredibly fucking rude not to give you the opportunity to obtain it and that is how i feel i 'm not wasting people 's time i am honestly trying to better their lives with my product i do n't really understand how that makes me an intrusive asshole honestly its people like you who are the assholes i 'm making cold calls because that 's my job i believe in my product and believe my potential customers will find it desirable too when people like you assume we are just intrusive assholes trying to rip people off it makes my job harder less efficient and no where near as fulfilling i would suggest you take a look at yourself and change your attitude towards people who approach you with their products instead of assuming everyone who attempts to sell you something is just a rude intrusive waste of time

it does n't matter if you give the check to the dealer or your friend but under no circumstances should you co sign your friend 's car loan since the money you are giving is a loan i highly highly recommend you do the following requiring a signed promissory note shows you are serious about getting paid back and gives you some legal protections if you are not paid back if you go to a random small claims court on any given day you will witness at least a few cases where one person says it was a gift and the other says it was a loan with a promissory note it 's a loan period prepare not to get paid back even with the note it happens all the time think about what you will do if your friend misses a payment to you or never repays the loan will you forgive or get legal and try to collect again do not co sign the loan if you do and your friend does not make car payments you will be 100 responsible and the lender will take legal action against you to collect

you got out in time great but how did you know when to get back in the internet is littered with threads by people who got out in advance or during then did n't get back in in time because the did n't feel real some people are still sitting out just hoping against hope the market crashes but it probably wo n't to those 2009 levels   i recommend looking at trinity wiki results as a place to start getting a sense of portfolio longevity when totally out of the market the reality is that all cash which is basically a zero duration bond is a dangerous position as is all stocks a balanced portfolio gives you diversification the only free lunch in investing   better to not try and time your way in and out of the market but rather glide within a range benjamin graham recommends no more less than if you want to skip the research headaches stick with a total bond or intermediate term bond fund or google around for lazy portfolios   the real key is not to let emotions drive your decisions it always feels different this time until it is n't much better to set a target portfolio of stocks bonds rule of thumb imagine you might lose half the stock portion in a downturn then ride it out that way you do n't have to worry about being at one extreme or the other

that amount of shares is too low to create in the market usually you do n't specify the price to sell the stock unless you are personally on the floor trading the securities and even then with a volume of $ 50,000 it would just mean you threw away $ 45,000 for most people it would mean setting a $ 5 sell order and the broker would understand that as sell this security so long the price is above $ 5 when you get to the trading volume required to influence the price usually you are also bound by some regulations banning some moves one of them is the pump and dump and even if you are suggesting the opposite it might be in preparation of this scam also the software used for high frequency trading what all the cool in wall street are using these days employ advanced and proprietary to analyze the market and make thousands of trades in a short interval of time on 's speed decisions happen in milliseconds and this could result in big market moves without reason   so a human trader attempting to manipulate the market versus these setups would be like a kid in a attempting to the flash dc comics a cool kid not really kids more like suited up sharks money eating sharks

as others have explained defined contribution is when you or your employer contributes a specified amount and you reap all the investment returns   defined benefit is when your employer promises to pay you a specified amount benefit and is responsible for making the necessary investments to provide for it    is one better than the other we can argue this either way    defined benefit would seem to be more predictable and assured   the problem being of course that it is entirely reliant upon the employer to have saved enough money to pay that amount   if the employer fails in that responsibility then the only fallback is government guarantees   and of course the government has limitations on what it can guarantee   for example from wikipedia    the maximum pension benefit guaranteed by pbgc is set by law and adjusted yearly for plans that end in 2016 workers who retire at age 65 can receive up to $ per month or $ per year under pbgc 's insurance program for single employer plans benefit payments starting at ages other than 65 are adjusted which means the maximum guaranteed benefit is lower for those who retire early or when there is a benefit for a survivor and higher for those who retire after age 65 additionally the pbgc will not fully guarantee benefit improvements that were adopted within the five year period prior to a plan 's termination or benefits that are not payable over a retiree 's lifetime other limitations also apply to supplemental benefits in excess of normal retirement benefits benefit increases within the last five years before a plan 's termination and benefits earned after a plan sponsor 's bankruptcy by contrast people tend to control their own defined contribution accounts   so they control how much gets invested and where   defined contribution accounts are always 100 funded    defined benefit pension plans are often underfunded   they expect the employer to step forward and subsidize them when they run short   this allows the defined benefits to both be cheaper during the employment period and more generous in retirement   but it also means that employers have to subsidize the plans later when they no longer get a benefit from the relationship with the employee    if you want someone else to make promises to you and are n't worried that they wo n't keep them you probably prefer defined benefit    if you want to have personal control over the money you probably prefer defined contribution    my personal opinion is that defined benefit plans are a curse   they encourage risky behavior and false promises   defined contribution plans are more honest about what they provide and better match the production of employment with its compensation   others see defined benefit plans as the gold standard of pensions

as others have pointed out it sounds like the problem is n't the accessibility of your money the problem is willpower so address that instead how   willpower is both a finite resource and a resource that can be increased like muscle strength   since willpower is finite break down the problem into as many pieces as possible then address only one of those pieces at a time be more sensible with my money is nebulous vague and large there 's no place to start   so break it apart first thing is the one example in your question you go out on payday with friends coworkers intending to only buy a couple of beers alcohol lowers willpower and end up blowing through far more so what about making a rule to not go out on payday   nice idea but that might still be too hard to do if you have a habit of going out with them on payday then this has become your community and you will feel the of not going out with them as well as the social pressure from them to do as you 've always done   so set up a different habit for that night one that both involves the obligation of going there instead and other people who will expect you to be there some examples would be a sport that happens to practice or compete on payday nights or some charity that happens to need you at that time   once you 've broken that habit and in the resulting of your wallet look for other similar leaks i 'm going to guess that all your money gets spent on going out to pubs as opposed say to buying bric a you do n't need if so then you need to face that you 've adopted a pub going culture and that your community has shrunk to just those kind of people it may seem like you have a lot of people in your life but if all it takes to lose connection to all of them is to stop going to pubs then you really do n't your human connections essential for an enjoyable life are too fragile too focused so if that 's the problem branch out diversify the communities you 're part of i 've already mentioned sport church is another good one i mean a living church the kind where the people are always doing stuff together and it 's fun to go to not the other kind where everyone sits in a pew for an hour a week and rushes the exits as soon as possible other possibilities are reaching out to neighbors or becoming politically involved   hmmm i started writing about willpower but i 'm ending up at community at your core do you feel like if you did n't spend this way that you would n't have any friends

the downside of the store card is that the deal for using the card is typically 6 12 months of no payments or no interest in reality the deal is deferred payments interest the problem is if you miss any payment or fail to pay the computer off in full you 'll have to pay for the accrued interest at a rate typically 25 or higher that means if you buy your computer for $ 1,000 and pay $ 999 at the end of 12 months you may have to pay $ 250 in accrued interest these cards can be great deals just be really careful

currencies that are pegged or fixed require that foreign currencies are held by the central issuer at a proportional amount this is analogous to having a portfolio of currencies that the central bank issues shares from in the form of its own currency we will continue with this analogy if the central bank says these shares are worth $ 1 but the underlying components of the portfolio are worth $ 0.80 and decreasing then it is expensive for the central bank to maintain its peg and eventually they will have to disregard the peg as people start questioning the central bank 's solvency people will know the $ 1 they hold is not really worth what the central bank says it is because of the price changes people experience in buying goods and services especially when it comes to imports shadow economies will also trade using a currency more reflective of labor which happens no matter what the government 's are for doing so swiss national bank central bank did this in early 2015 as it experienced volatility in the euro which it had previously been trying to keep it 's currency pegged to it became too expensive for it to keep this peg on its own the central bank can devalue its currency by adjusting the proportions of the reserve such as selling a lot of foreign currency x buying more of currency y. they can and do take losses doing this swiss national bank is maintaining a large loss they can also flood their economy with more of their currency diluting the value of each individual 1 dollar equivalent this is done by issuing bonds or monetizing goods and services from the private sector in exchange for bonds people colloquially call this printing money but it is a misnomer in this day and age where printers are not relevant tools the good and service goes onto the central bank 's balance book and the company entity that provided the service now has a bond on its book which can be immediately sold to someone else for cash another reading is that the bond is as good as cash the bond did n't previously exist until the central bank said it did and central banks can infinitely exchange goods and services for bonds bond monetization also called quantitative easing is practiced by the federal reserve in the united states bank of japan european central bank and now the central bank of the republic of china

these are n't just any old run of the mill unions these are public unions these are unions of government employees government employees already get special benefits by of their government jobs such as wonderful pension and medical plans that the rest of us can only dream about when they unionize they demand even more and get it         seems to me that if government workers want to unionize then they should forfeit their government benefits and be paid as non government contractors or something similar

okay but that 's about gold as an investment in today 's world and during   an extremely unstable financial situation   many other types of investments could be used similarly those who advocate gold as a hedge do n't advocate buying it during a crisis they advocate keeping some as part of an investment strategy but again that 's gold as gold not gold as currency   leveraging your investments based on current financial situations is what investing is about    gold as a medium for currency is a totally different thing    what you just described would be called arbitrage in moving markets or other situations i guess looking for no lose situations where you can trade things around and increase your net value doing it     it helps stabilize markets as people take advantage of this situation it counters the effect and self corrects think about it

if your criteria has changed but some of your existing holdings do n't meet your new criteria you should eventually liquidate them because they are not part of your new strategy however you do n't want to just liquidate them right now if they are currently performing quite well share price currently uptrending   one way you could handle this is to place a trailing stop loss on the stocks that do n't meet your current criteria and let the market take you out when the stocks have stopped up trending

here 's an article on it that might help one of the tricky things is that you probably have the value of the vested shares and withheld taxes already on your w-2 this confuses everyone including the irs they sent me one of those audits by mail one year where the issue was they wanted to double count stock compensation that was on both 1099-b and w-2 a quick letter explaining this and they were happy the general idea is that when you first irrevocably own the stock it vests then that 's income because you 're receiving something of value so this goes on a w-2 and is taxed as income not capital gains conceptually you 've just spent however many dollars in income to buy stock so that 's your basis on the stock for tax paid if your employer withheld taxes it should be included in your w-2 in that case you would not separately list it elsewhere

you can keep the cash in your account as long as you want but you have to pay a tax on what 's called capital gains to quote from wikipedia a capital gain is a profit that results from investments into a capital asset such as stocks bonds or real estate which exceeds the purchase price it is the difference between a higher selling price and a lower purchase price resulting in a financial gain for the conversely a capital loss arises if the proceeds from the sale of a capital asset are less than the purchase price thus buying selling stock counts as investment income which would be a capital gain loss when you are filing taxes you have to report net capital gain loss so you do n't pay taxes on an individual stock sale or purchase you pay tax on the sum of all your transactions   note you do not pay any tax if you have a net capital loss taxes are only on capital gains   the amount you are taxed depends on your tax bracket and your holding period a short term capital gain is gain on an investment held for less than one year these gains are taxed at your ordinary income tax rate a long term capital gain is gain on an investment held for more than one year these gains are taxed at a special rate if your income tax rate is 10 or 15 then long term gains are taxed at 0 i.e. no tax otherwise the tax rate is 15 so you 're not taxed on specific stock sales you 're taxed on your total gain there is no tax for a capital loss and investors sometimes take profits from good investments and take losses from bad investments to lower their total capital gain so they wo n't be taxed as much the tax rate is expected to change in 2013 but the current ratios could be extended until then however the rate is as is   of course this all applies if you live in the united states other countries have different measures hope it helps   wikipedia has a great chart to refer to

so what 's your actual plan strategy suggestion to combat this again    are you planning on buying physical gold other precious metals again tangible not paper and buying amp investing in real estate        this is n't a sarcastic question i want to go down this hypothetical path in the thought experiment a bit further        for example for a us investor could part of the strategy be to move to a state with no state income tax to preserve as much income as possible in order to invest that income in one of the target categories      is careful selection of primary residence real estate in a location most likely to appreciate part of the strategy       is moving your investment accounts offshore to a tax haven part of the strategy

i never said wall street enjoys paying taxes   but that is only because they are short sighted and arrogant   if they were to take a step back they would see that a functioning society is more in their interest that a few extra mil and social upheaval   if this is a reasonable argument not saying it 's true but that it 's not immediately or definitively wrong then we can say that it 's not unreasonable for warren buffet to hold that idea which would invalidate your premise   requiring a level of proof beyond that is absurd and you 're just obstructing the conversation what are we going to do hack into his brain to find out his true thoughts   just to be clear i do not think government bureaucracy will solve this problem and i agree with your analysis of how that would play out   i do n't think a solution to these types of problems exists within the state market paradigm   but at least now we 're agreeing that there is a market failure at work rather than your previous statement of it is ridiculous for bob to think he is entitled to 5 cows if john sells jim ten thousand heads   my question then is why do you espouse such simplistic nonsense when you understand that the situation is much more complex   is it because it is easier and more psychologically comfortable to ignore these than to admit that your model does not have an effective way of dealing with them   gt why do you think this exactly   because things like this require collective action or you run into the free rider problem

recycled toner cartridges spill excess toner all over the of printers causing higher maintenance costs and shorter life spans for other consumable components such as the the reason this occurs is that the drum assembly has a conductive coating on it that wears out after the cartridge 's service life once that coating is weakened or removed it can no longer keep excess toner from spilling out i 'd say a good 95 of recycled are just drill and fill so the old drum remains unchanged   even changing the drum does n't work all the time hp uses a special coating on their drums which is n't replicated when an aftermarket drum is used

there are some important thing you need to understand about bonds and how they work   a bond does n't need an active market like a stock for example to have value     nonetheless there exist active markets for all of these bonds     the purpose of buying these bonds was not to step in due to the absence of a market   rather the purpose was to deliberately bid up the price of these bonds ahead of the market causing their price to rise and yields interest rates to drop   the fed can hold any and all of these bonds to maturity while receiving contractual payments all the while and never sell a single bond back to the market

the federal program is struggling financially the nfip is $ 25 billion in debt after paying out damages for hurricanes and it will probably have to borrow more money to pay for harvey which is on track to be one of the most destructive in u.s. history the nfip is only authorized to borrow up to about $ 30 billion meaning the agency could hit its limit after all the harvey claims come in

there are basically two approaches based on how detailed you want to be in your own personal accounting obviously the more like a business or like real accounting you want to be the more complex you can make it but in general i find that the purpose of personal accounting is 1 to track what i own and 2 to ensure i have documented anything i need to for tax purposes and as long as you 're meeting those goals any reasonable approach is workable

and i do n't blame them for doing so they get bonuses based on the bottom line and stock price why not pump it as much as they can then when it starts to fall apart just go to another overpaid ceo position with another company start again meanwhile someone else is more than willing to take the current overpaid ceo job and try to rescue rebuild nowadays most ceo 's did n't start the company they are at so they do n't feel as attached as they should knowing this the only thing we can do make ourselves invaluable to the company so they have to give you more or go someplace that will

many of the limitations of blockchains and bitcoin in particular can be overcome with changing the implementation but most of the proposed fixes undermine the ideological underpinnings of decentralized verification and a fully traceable ledger   the major hurdle that it does n't currently have a fix to make it a national currency is that the monetary policy with bitcoin is fixed and not by a government   very few modern governments would be willing to entirely give up monetary policy and as the number of transactions increases to the levels in which cash is exchanged for a blockchain the kinds of entities that have the processing power necessary to verify a block timely gets consolidated into very few hands that own sizable data centers and then they arguably get to determine monetary policy among themselves without any election voting or duly appointed fiduciary responsibility
