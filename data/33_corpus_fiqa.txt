not at all the millionaire next door offers a book full of anecdotes on couples that earned money and saved their way to being millionaires i believe about 1/3 or so had businesses but the rest were employed and simply saved wisely   $ saved for 40 years at 8 will return $ 1m. adjust the numbers to hit a million sooner or reach a higher goal   the author might be accused of survey bias this is the phenomenon of studying the final results without looking at the pool of people years prior little adv is correct that while 1/3 of millionaires may have gotten that way by starting a business that says nothing about how many businesses need to start to find the one millionaire that resulted   i view the book more as a lesson of spend beneath your means and focus on his anecdotes of the dual income couples who saved their way to this status if you are in no rush get this book from your library and spend the few hours to read it in response to my friend dilip 's comment moneychimp offers a good look at compound growth for the s&p over time the 40 years ending 2012 which obviously include the lost decade returned a cagr of not to be confused with the average when i pull the numbers for each year 's return and apply an annual $ deposit the 40 years ends with $ a 1 fee or 1 lower return resulted in $   if 8 is n't conservative of course you can run the numbers you wish the 40 years contained both a lost decade and two great ones will the 3 decades post lost average to get the decade period to i do n't know

no ca n't make quick bucks it depends very much on what the strike price was dividends which are below 10 of the market value of the underlying    stock would be deemed to be ordinary dividends and no adjustment in    the strike price would be made for ordinary dividends for    extra ordinary dividends above 10 of the market value of the    underlying security the strike price would be adjusted refer more at nse india edit the nifty consists of 50 stocks the largest one has weight of around 8 so 10 on this will only translate to .8 on index

some aspects of your general financial lifestyle make a big difference in your score always pay late declare bankruptcy have bills go to collection these will hurt your overall score   some aspects of your life start with a low score and rise over time the number of years you have had credit some only have short term and transient impacts what is your utilization rate today when was your last hard pull any you do over the transient aspects during a period of time when your score does n't matter is a waste of energy if you are looking for a new mortgage or a another type of loan then act in a way that will improve your score but if you see no immediate need then do n't sweat the details if your credit limit is too low for your lifestyle then ask for it to be increased just do n't ask for the increase a few days before you put in the auto loan application

you question is a bit scary to me you show $ 2100 rent and let 's even assume that 's 100 i.e. never a vacancy rule of thumb is 10 vacancy depending on area a tenant may stay a year but when they leave you might need to have a bit of maintenance and miss 2 months rent you count the mortgage and taxes and are left with $ 500/mo where is the list of ongoing expenses i suggest you put that $ 500/mo into a separate account and let us know a year from now if anything is left to anthony 's point i agree 100 no one can tell you everything you need to know but whatever my answer or his other members with experience similar or different will add to this and in the end you 'll have a great overview the truth is that it 's easy for me to sit here and see what you may be missing by the way if you look at the rules of thumb they will make your head spin there are those who say the target is for the rent to be 2 of the value of the house but there are markets where this will never happen there 's another rule that says the expenses besides tax should be planned at 50 of the rent i.e. you should put aside $ 1000/mo for expenses over the long term the new house will be lower of course but in years past year 10 or so this number will start to look reasonable

no it 's perhaps a bit obvious but with the shorter term loan you would be contractually obligated to pay the higher monthly payment by paying double on the longer loan you retain the flexibility to pay less and you would pay less interest if you truly doubled your payment on the longer loan this is because you 'd be paying off more of the principal more quickly but you 'd also be making a slightly higher payment than on the shorter term loan you can play with the amortization calculator at bankrate to understand this

i am currently in the process of purchasing a house i am only putting 5 down i see that some are saying that the traditional 20 down is the way to go i am a first time homebuyer and unfortunately we no longer live in the world where 20 down is mandatory which is part of the reason why housing prices are so high i feel it is more important that you are comfortable with what your monthly payments are as well as being informed on how interest rates can change how much you owe each month right now interest rates are pretty low and it would almost be silly to put 20 down on your home it might make more sense to put money in different vehicle right now if you have extra as the global economy will likely pick up and until it does interest rates will likely stay low just my 2 cents worth   edit i thought it would not be responsible of me not to mention that you should always have extra 's saved for closing costs they can be pricey and if you are not informed of what they are they can creep up on you

if markets were perfectly efficient the price should reflect everything that is currently known about the future of a commodity   if it is known that silver is currently under valued then investors would be buying it driving the price up   conversely if silver is currently over valued then investors would be selling and the price would be going down   added to that is emotion   if the price is currently trending up then people expect it to keep going up and the price continues to rise   until enough people think it ca n't go any higher and start selling which drives the price down   since this is driven by emotion it can not be predicted when this will happen

best as i can tell the simple answer is the smartest approach to investing for dividends is to pick a company that is has and will continue to make a solid profits there are lots of them out there specifically companies with no debt a history of long term and steady growth and a stable market share will almost always recoup any drop in stock valuation due to a dividend payout and usually in short order this is why dividends were created as a mechanism for distributing profits back to investor without diminishing thier stake in the company the trick then is to find such companies with the best ratio between stock price and dividend payout and again there are a lot of good options out there   all the is justified however as many unscrupulous companies will try to pull investors in with high dividends as a means to simply generate capital these companies have few of the quality attributes mentioned above instead high debt fluctuating or negative profits minimal market share or diminishing growth present a very risky long term play and will be avoided by this conservative investor

were you thinking of an annuity they guarantee regular payments usually after retirement in any case every investment has counterparty risk bonds guarantee payout but the issuer could always default this is why treasury bonds have the lowest yields the treasury is the world 's most trusted borrower it 's also why junk bonds have higher yields than investment grade and partially why longer duration bonds have higher yields as mentioned there 's bank accounts which gain interest and are insured by fdic up to $ 250,000 if the bank folds they 'll be acquired by another and your account balance will simply transfer similar to bank accounts are money market funds these are funds that purchase very short term paper basically < 90 day bonds they maintain a share price of $ 1 and pay interest in the form of additional shares these have the risk of breaking the buck where they need to sell assets at a loss to meet investor withdrawal demands and nav drops below $ 1.00 fortunately that 's a super rare but still definitely possible finally there 's one guy i 've seen on tv pitching a no risk high yield investment i ca n't remember the firm but i am waiting to see them shut down for running a ponzi scheme

option prices consist of two parts the intrinsic value the difference between the strike and the current price of the stock and a time premium representing the probability that the stock will end up above the strike for a call or below for a put    all else being equal options decline in value as time passes since there is less uncertainty about the expected value of the stock at expiration and thus the time premium is smaller   theta is the measure of the change in value in one day   so for every day that passes the calls you sold are going down by $ which is positive to you since you sold them at a higher value and the calls you sold are going down by $ so your position a short spread is gaining $ each day assuming no change in stock price or volatility in reality the stock price and volatility also change every day and those are much stronger drivers of the value of your options   in your case however the options are deep out of the money meaning it 's very likely that they 'll expire worthless so all you have left is time premium which is decaying as time goes on

yeah    they actually have said that their new strategy is not to make money from breakage people who pay but do n't use it i believe they also guaranteed the $ 10 deal for a year but i 'm not at all certain so do n't quote me on that    instead they want to make money from the data and eventually convince movie theaters to cut them in on sales and/or give them discounts on tickets both of which depend on people actually using moviepass    i think those are really silly plans the movie data is highly unlikely to cover the costs of the tickets that moviepass has to buy    movie theaters like studios are stubborn bastards who have a history of sticking to their guns and refusing to budge even an inch when it comes to certain terms they also have recently demonstrated a preference for building out their own direct to consumer offerings rather than with third party offerings    i do n't see them getting a ton more traffic from mp customers and more concession sales and then deciding to give up any of their highly prized concession sales considering that most heavy theater likely have a primary theater that they go to it would probably make more sense for theaters to simply market their own offering to them in theater and wait for mp to run out of money    finally amc is the biggest chain and actively wants this $ 10/month subscription to fail amc has announced that it absolutely will not give mp any deals on ticket prices something that mp is counting on to make this sustainable maybe mp is counting on amc to eventually change its mind but i do n't think that 's a smart bet    otoh what the hell do i know i 've been wrong plenty of times before

when inflation is high or is rising generally interest rates will be raised to reduce people spending their money and slow down the rate of inflation as interest rates rise people will be less willing to borrow money and more willing to keep their money earning a good interest rate in the bank people will reduce their spending and invest less into alternative assets but instead put more into their bank savings when inflation is too low and the economy is starting to slow down generally interest rates will be raised to encourage more spending to restart the economy again as interest rates drop more will take their saving out of their bank accounts as is starts to earn very little in interest rate and more will be willing to borrow as it becomes cheaper to borrow people will start spending more and investing their money outside of bank savings

i hate to point to wikipedia as an answer but it does describe exactly what you are looking for the s&p 500 is a free float    capitalization weighted index    published since 1957 of the prices of    500 large cap common stocks actively    traded in the united states the    stocks included in the s&p 500 are    those of large publicly held companies    that trade on either of the two    largest american stock market    exchanges the new york stock exchange    and the nasdaq the components of the s&p 500 are    selected by committee the committee    selects the companies in the s&p 500    so they are representative of the    industries in the united states    economy in addition companies that    do not trade publicly such as those    that are privately or mutually held    and stocks that do not have sufficient    liquidity are not in the index the s&p is a capitalization weighted index   if a stock price goes up then it comprises more of the total index   if a stock goes down it comprises less and if it goes down too much the committee will likely replace it so to answer your question if one stock were to suddenly skyrocket nothing would happen beyond the fact that the index was now worth more and that particular stock would now make up a larger percentage of the s&p 500 index

gt as i currently understand we owe much of our national debt to ourselves    debtors owe creditors creditors are by and large the banks forget about we ourselves   one thing we are taught in school is that banks earn money on the spread between what a creditor pays minus what a saver earns in interest on his deposit in reality such private savings pretty much do not exist when someone borrows from the bank they mostly are n't borrowing another person 's savings the bank is creating new currency through the issuance of debt   gt the reason for this is that people are being charged interest that does not exist in the system    i 'm not sure what you mean by does not exist in the system the way it works is you borrow a dollar and now you owe a dollar plus the interest on the dollar since each new loan creates more debt than currency the monetary system can never shrink or it if you mean that the currency is by any objective measure of value that is correct    gt therefore if we tried to pay the debt like some conservative politicians are fighting for it would be a massive transfer of wealth from the 99 to the 1 since most of the debt is owed to the 1 banks   there is no possibility of repaying it both the red team and the blue team are in on this if you 're worried about the 99 you should be advocating commodity money because that is the only way to stop theft by inflation if you 're worried about yourself get informed as to how these plans have played out in history and how you might protect yourself

i know this is heresy but if you have funds for significantly more    than 6 months of expenses let 's say 12 months how risky would it be    to put it all into stock index funds quite risky as if you do need to dip into it how fast could you get the cash also do you realize the tax implications when you do sell the shares should you have an emergency in the worst case scenario let 's say you have a financial emergency    at the same time the stock market crashes and loses half its value    you could still liquidate the rest and have sufficient funds for 6    months am i underestimating the risks of this strategy that 's not worst case scenario though worst case scenario would be another 9/11 where the markets are closed for nearly a week and you need the money but ca n't get the funds converted to cash in the bank that you can use this is in addition to the potential wait for a settlement in the case of using etfs if you choose to go that way in the case of money market funds cds and other near cash equivalents these can be accessed relatively easily which is part of the point a approach where some cash is kept in house some in accounts that can easily accessed and some in other investments may make sense though the breakdown would differ depending on how much risk people are willing to take if it truly is an emergency fund then the odds of needing it should be    very slim so why live with near zero return on that money something to consider is what is called an emergency here for some people a sudden $ 1,000 bill to fix their car that just broke down is an emergency for others there could be emergency trips to visit family that may have gotten into accidents or gotten a diagnosis that they may pass away soon consider what do you want to call an emergency here as chances are you may not be considering all that people would think is an emergency there is the question of what other sources of money do you have to cover should issues arise

difference between a limit and market order is largely a trade off between price certainty and timing certainty if you think the security is already well priced the downside of a limit order is the price may never hit your limit and keep trading away from you you 'll either spend a lot of time amending your order or sitting around wishing you 'd amended your order   the downside of a market order is you do n't know the execution price ahead of time this is typically more of a issue with illiquid instruments where even smaller orders may have price impact for small trades in more liquid securities your realized price will often resemble the last traded price hope that helps both have a purpose and the best tool for the job will depend on your circumstances

there are two independent sets of terms we need to define in order to answer your question   i am trying to understand the difference between value blend and growth these are different categories of mutual funds value discounted or undervalued stocks this is often measured by a difference between the stock 's price and the net asset value growth stocks that fund managers believe are poised for significant growth increase in stock price and blend a blend of two categories of stocks in this context it probably refers to a combination of growth and value stocks but it just depends on the context   i want to receive dividend and growth these are ways to receive earnings from a stock or fund dividend a direct cash payment from owning a stock or a fund stocks and funds who pay out 100 of their profits do n't have any money leftover to grow themselves and either stagnate or shrink growth an increase itself in capital gains if a stock or fund pays out zero dividends then all profits are invested back into the company for fund increasing its value if you intend to automatically reinvest dividends then receiving dividends is essentially the same as receiving profit through capital gains if you intend to sell stocks or funds periodically to get some extra spending cash then receiving profits through capital gains is essentially the same as dividends

i did n't mean to imply that bankruptcy is a magical process i was using that to clarify my use of conservative vs. aggressive to be fair i guess it can vary depending on your perspective if you 're taking the perspective of the debt laden company then yes on the side of a higher value could be defined as aggressive if you 're taking the perspective of someone looking to acquire business i would say on the side of a higher value is conservative    if the debt is trading at say $ 0.20 on the dollar then yes i can agree that the market value of the debt is likely more representative of the book value i guess i was n't thinking of that type of extreme example a more common scenario i 'd encounter would be a the debt trading at maybe $ 0.95 on the dollar and b taking the perspective of someone looking to invest in the equity which is why i 'd say that it 's more conservative to use the higher value which is the book value   so i 'm persuaded that using market value of the debt can make sense in some cases but i would still argue that the book value might make more sense in other cases

the mutual fund is legally its own company that you 're investing in with its own expenses mutual fund expense ratios are a calculated value not a promise that you 'll pay a certain percentage on a particular day that is to say at the end of their fiscal year a fund will total up how much it spent on administration and divide it by the total assets under management to calculate what the expense ratio is for that year and publish it in the annual report but you ca n't just pay the fee for any given year in a regular account you certainly could look at what expenses were paid for each fund by multiplying the expense ratio by your investment and use it in some way to figure out how much additional you want to contribute to make it whole again but it makes about as much sense as trying to pay the commission for buying a single stock out of one checking account while paying for the share price out of another it may help you in some sort of mental accounting of expenses but since it 's all your money and the expenses are all part of what you 're paying to be able to invest it 's not really doing much good since money is fungible in a retirement account with contribution limits it still does n't really make sense since any contribution from outside funds to try to pay for expense ratios would be counted as contributions like any other again i guess it could somehow help you account for how much money you wanted to contribute in a year but i 'm not really sure it would help you much some funds or brokerages do have non expense ratio based fees and in some cases you can pay for those from outside the account and there are a couple cases where for a retirement account this lets you keep your contributions invested while paying for fees from outside funds this may be the kind of thing that your coworker was referring to though it 's hard to tell exactly from your description usually it 's best just to have investments with as low fees as possible regardless since they 're one of the biggest drags on returns and i 'd be very wary of any brokerage based fees when there are very cheap and free mutual fund brokerages out there

you are in the perfect window for making an ira contribution the irs allows you to make ira contributions for last year until tax day so you know that for 2014 you did n't have access to a 401 k at work you want to avoid making a deductible ira contribution for this year 2015 until you are sure that you wo nt have a 401 k at work this year take your time and decide if the ira or the roth works best for your situation having a ira now will be good becasue you have many years for it to grow keep in mind that it is not unusual to have multiple retirement accounts current 401 k rolled over into a ira   roth ira each has different rules limits and benefits there is no reason to pick one way of investing for retirement becasue you never know if the next employer will have the type of plan you like i am assuming that your spouse if you are married does n't have access to a 401 k otherwise you would have to consider the applicable limits

my € i probably live in the same country as you stop worrying the euro zone has a € guaranty deposit so if any bank should fail that 's the amount you 'll receive back this applies to all bank accounts and deposits not to any investments you should not have more than € in any bank so lucky you if you have more than that money divide between a number of banks as for the euro there might be an inflation but at this moment the usa and china are in a currency battle that benefits the euro meaning you should not invest in dollars or yuan at this time look for undervalued currency to invest in as they should rise against the euro

you 're getting great wisdom and options establishing your actionable path will require the details that only you know such as how much is actually in each paycheck and how much tax is withheld how much do you spend each month and yearly expenses too how much spending can you actually cut or replace how comfortable are you with considering or not considering unexpected emergency spending you mentioned you were cash poor but only you know what your current account balances are which will affect your actions and priorities btw interestingly your increase 401k contributions by 2 each year will need to end before hitting the $ 18 k contribution limit i took some time and added the details you posted into a cash flow program to see your scenario over the next few years there is n't a 401k loan activity in this program yet so i build the scenario from other simple activities you seem financially minded enough to continue modeling on your own i 'm posting the more difficult one for you borrow from 401k but you 'll have to input your actual balances paycheck and spending my spending assumptions must be low and i entered $ 70 k as take home so the model looks like you 've got lots of cash if you choose to play with it then consider modeling some other scenarios from the advice in the other posts here 's the borrow $ 6500 from 401k scenario model at be to me it 's all about trying the scenarios and see which one seems to work with all of the details the trick is knowing what scenarios to try and how to model them full disclosure i needed to do similar planning so i wrote be and i now share it with other people it 's in beta so i 'm testing it with scenarios like yours notice most of the extra activity occurs on

's answer is quite good and for your own specific situation you might begin by being about what you are getting for investing a few thousand dollars   with the exception of paul graham 's y there are very few opportunities to invest at that type of level and y provides a lot of other assistance besides their modest initial investment    i can tell from your post that you think like an investor   it is highly unlikely that the entrepreneurial programmers that you will be backing will be wired that way    from the modest amount that you are investing you are unlikely to be the lead investor in this opportunity   if you are interested in proceeding simply stick along for the ride examining the terms and documents that more significant investors will be demanding   remain positive and supportive but simply wait to sign on the dotted line until others have done the heavy lifting for more insights into startups themselves see paul graham 's essays at   he 's the real deal and his recent essays will provide you with current insights about software startups good luck

the way i 've implemented essentially value averaging is to keep a constant ratio between different investment types in my portfolio lets say in a simple example 25 cash 25 reit real estate 25 us stock 25 foreign stock lets say i deposit a set $ 1000 per month into this account if the stock portion goes up it will look like i need more cash reit so all of that $ 1000 goes into cash the reit portion to get them towards their 25 i may spend months investing only in cash the reit while the stock goes up of course if the stock goes down that $ 1000 per month goes into the stock accounts now you can also balance your account if you 'd like regularly selling stock or the reit and making the account balanced so if the stock goes down you 'd use the cash reit to purchase more stock if the stock went up you 'd sell the stock and buy reit leave more in cash

the appropriate amount of cash bonds to hold will be largely a matter of opinion but here are the general reasons why having at least some is a good idea cash is very liquid and bonds are often mostly liquid this means you can access them very quickly without taking on losses to get the most liquidity out of your bonds you can do what is called laddering this means that you take out different bond amounts with different maturity dates and periodically renew them on a schedule so that you always have some bonds maturing which you can access without paying an interest penalty you can look this term up online for more details cash and bonds are low risk if you have absolutely no low risk assets then in the event of say a market crash you may have no savings to fall back on by owning some bonds and some equities you are able to earn a modest return without being too risky however note that some bonds are just as risky as equities any bond which pays an abnormally high interest rate does so because the entity backing the repayment government company whomever is thought to not be guaranteed to be able to do so the 25 figure given by your author is his opinion on the appropriate mix of cash bonds to equities but there are many views on the matter consider that any rule of thumb in personal finance should be for general consideration only

in simplest terms when a company creates new shares and sells them it 's true that existing shareholders now own a smaller percentage of the company   however as the company is now more valuable since it made money by selling the new shares the real dollar value of the previous shares is unchanged that said the decision to issue new shares can be interpreted by investors as a signal of the company 's strategy and thereby alter the market price   this may well affect the real dollar value of the previous shares   but the simple act of creating new shares does not alter the value in and of itself

you realize that no matter what we need janitors right   we need cooks at mcdonalds we need those low end jobs to function as a society   so no matter how educated we get there will always be someone at the bottom   you ca n't just tell them to get more education because everyone is doing that   even if that individual does then someone else is now at the bottom   now i do n't know the answer to the overall question of minimum wage but your solution is ridiculous

watch out for po financing a lot of those contracts have nasty terms like i agree that scam capital will be my sole source of credit for the next 2 years that can get in the way of using bank debt or credit cards they may even tell you otherwise to get you to sign but they are the payday lenders of the business world    it can be great when it works but there are a lot of shark men while you can grow your company on po financing understand that those companies exist to suck all the profit out of small non innovative companies who needed a hand and their terms reflect that    if your business is that good maybe you can get someone to buy in instead the second benefit to this is that if things go tits up then you do n't have any personal guarantee you will likely have to guarantee po financing in most parts of the country

yes you can be honest and succeed   dishonest business people also succeed many times   the key whether being honest or dishonest is that you have be smart on how to do that and who to do it with    you should be honest with smart and knowledgeable customers you will win their trust and loyalty but being honest with your vendors is not always a good idea   you can be dishonest with clueless customers as long as you make sure you do n't get into trouble legal with them they may not be repeat customers but not every business is about repeat customers

another answer to this question occurred to me as i started learning more about historical uses for gold etc   perhaps it 's a idea but i 'm going to float it anyway to see what you folks think investing in gold is an indirect investment in the economy and gdp of the nation of india   to that extent is it only a hedge against inflation so long as the indian economy grows at a more rapid rate than your local inflation rate   fact india currently consumes more than 1/3 of gold production predominantly in the form of jewelry and their demand has been growing rapidly up 69 just between 2009 and 2010 alone i ca n't find too many consumption numbers for india but when you look at past articles on this subject you see phrases like one forth and 20 being used only a few years go to describe india 's consumption levels fact india has virtually no domestic sources of gold   india ’s handful of gold mines produce about 2.5 tonnes of the metal each year a fraction of the country ’s annual consumption of about 800 tonnes fact indian culture places high value on gold as a visible demonstration of wealth   particularly in situations such in indian weddings where the bride brings in gold to show her family 's status and wealth and it forms part of the given to bride it is believed that a bride wearing 24k gold on their wedding to bring luck and happiness throughout the married life fact the recent trends in outsourcing indian citizens working abroad sending money home etc have all lead to a influx of foreign cash to the indian economy and explosive gdp growth see the following chart and compare the period of with a chart showing the price of gold in other answer here   notice how the curves parallel each other to a large degree   potentially unfounded conclusion drawn from above numbers   the rapid growth of the indian economy coupled with a rich cultural tradition that values gold as a symbol of wealth along with a sudden rise in wealthy people due to the economy and influx of foreign cash has resulted in skyrocketing demand for gold from india and this large consumption demand is the most likely explanation for the sudden rise in the price of gold over the last several years   investors then jump on the rising price bandwagon as especially does anyone that can make a profit from selling gold to those seeking to get on said bandwagon as such as long as indian cultural tradition remains unchanged and their economy remains strong the resulting increasing demand for gold will sustain current and perhaps increased prices   should there be any sudden collapse in the indian gdp gold will likely tumble in parallel disclaimer not an expert just observations based off the data i 've seen there may be other parts to the picture of gold demand that i 've not considered

there are many different things that can happen all or some taking russia and argentina as precedence you may not be able to withdraw funds from your bank for some period of time not because your accounts will be drained but because the cash supply will be restricted similar thing has also happened recently in cyprus however the fact that the governments of russia and argentina limited the use of cash for a period of time does n't mean that the us government will have to do the same it my choose some other means of restraint what 's for sure is that nothing good will happen nothing will probably happen to your balance in the bank although cyprus has shown that that is not a given either but i 'm not so sure about fdic maintaining it 's insurance if the bank fails meaning if the bank defaults as a result of the chain effect you may lose your money if the government is defaulting it might not have enough cash to take over the bank deposits after the default the currency value will probably drop sharply devaluation which will lead to inflation meaning your same balance will be worth much less than it is now so there 's something to worry about for everyone

it appears that the company in question is raising money to invest in expanding its operations specifically lithium production but that is off topic for here the stock price was rising on the back of perceived increases in demand for the company 's products but in order to fulfil demand they need to either invest in higher production or increase prices they chose to increase production by investing to invest they needed to raise capital and so are going through the motions to do that the key question as to what will happen with their stock price after this is broken down into two parts short term and long term in the short term the price is driven by the expectation of future profits see below and the behavioural expectations from an increase in interest in the stock caused by the fact that it is in the news people who had never heard of the stock or thought of investing in the company have suddenly discovered it and been told that it is doing well and so want a piece of it this will exacerbate the effect of the news broadly positive or negative and will drive the price in the short run the effect of extra leverage assuming that they raise capital by writing bonds also immediately increases the total value of the company so will increase the price somewhat the short term price changes usually back after a few months as the shine goes off and people take profits for investing in the long run you need to consider how the increase in capital will be used and how demand and supply will change since the company is using the money to invest in factors of production i.e. making more product it is the return on capital or investment employed roce that will inform the fundamentals underlying the stock price the higher the roce the more valuable the capital raised is in the future and the more profits and the company as a whole will grow a to ask yourself is whether they can employ the extra capital at the same roce as they currently produce it is possible that by investing in new more productive equipment they can raise their roce but also possible that because the lithium mines or whatever can only get so big and can only get so much access to the extra capital will not be as productive as existing capital so roce will fall for the new capital

do n't let tax considerations be the main driver that 's generally a bad idea you should keep tax in mind when making the decision but do n't let it be the main reason for an action selling the higher priced shares possibly at a loss even i think    it 's ok to do that and it does n't necessarily have to be fifo it is ok to do that but consider also the term long term gain has much lower taxes than short term gain and short term loss will be offsetting long term gain means you can lose some of the potential tax benefit any potential related to buying a home that can offset capital gains no and anyway if you 're buying a personal residence a home for yourself there 's nothing to write off except for the mortgage interest and property taxes of course selling other investments for a capital loss to offset this sale again why sell at a loss anything related to retirement accounts e.g. i think i recall being able to take a loan from your retirement account in order to buy a home you can take a loan and you can also withdraw up to 10 k without a penalty if conditions are met bottom line be prepared to pay the tax on the gains and check how much it is going to be roughly you can apply previous year refund to the next year to mitigate the shock you can put some money aside and you can raise your salary withholding to make sure you 're not hit with a high bill and penalties next april after you do that as long as you keep in mind the tax bill and put aside an amount to pay it you 'll be fine i see no reason to sell at loss or pay extra interest to someone just to reduce the nominal amount of the tax if you 're selling at loss you 're losing money if you 're selling at gain and paying tax you 're earning money even if the earnings are reduced by the tax

it can be helpful but also knowing what has been tried before is vital what works and what does not work many ideas are not so new for example typically in it management loves the idea of but what it often means is that they want to start before they understand the scope of the problem let alone the requirements   it tends to be the big projects that end up being screwed up smaller stuff is easier but it takes a lot of skills to manage the production of large and complex systems or pieces of engineering   sure change is important but so is the knowledge of what works and what does not work every so often something comes along and sets it on its head so some of that old knowledge can be discounted but not often

two typical responses to articles surveys making such claims   1 people use other forms of asset for emergency savings because interest rates are low clearly false   2 people use other forms of saving than a saving account therefore such surveys as the x% ca n't handle a $ 500 emergency are wrong on their face this is false the vast majority use a savings account   i 've chosen a topic that absolutely annoys the shit out of me every time it comes up how people save their money every time this topic comes up about x% of americans ca n't come up with $ y dollars in an emergency or have less than $ z in savings someone inevitably in with the linked response i have never seen anyone attempt to source their hand waving response beyond their own anecdote which is usually a thinly veiled brag about how financially savvy they are with their wealth perhaps people who have no assets or crippling debt do n't go out of their way to brag about it   i could link multiple reddit posts making a similar response which i address with my own stock response about once every 1 2 months instead i 've decided to expand with data from several other sources this is the good bad research problem if you 're asserting something but qualify your statement with sure we 'd find if we looked into then you 're doing it wrong a good researcher or journalist does n't put bullshit like that in their work because it 's their job to actually look for sources of data data which should exist with multiple government and independent groups so let 's get started all data as recent as i could find oldest source is for 2010   most americans do n't invest in the stock pubs   about of americans owned publicly traded stock directly or indirectly with a much smaller percent owning stock directly   pages 18 and 16 respectively it 's important to note the of indirect ownership which suggests this is mostly retirement accounts it 's entirely possible people are irresponsible with their emergency savings but i think it safe to say we should not expect people to dip into their retirement accounts for relatively minor emergency expenses the reason is obvious even if it covers the expense they now have to make up the shortfall for their retirement savings this is further supported by the same source   gt;"the value of assets held within iras and dc plans are among the most significant of many balance sheets and are a significant determinant of their future retirement security   page 20 pdf page 20 of 41   there is also a break down of holdings by asset type on page 16 pdf page 16 of 41   this data is skewed by the top 10 who keep more of their wealth in different asset power for a breakdown between the 1st 10th and percentiles see table 3   so far it seems pretty hard to maintain a large percent of americans have their wealth stored outside of savings accounts mattresses aside   here 's my original reply as to the breakdown of americans assets by type and percent a note this assumes people have assets source for images people wealth data   most people use savings accounts with runner up falling to checking accounts this will into our next topic which is the problem of unbanked underbanked households   a large number of individuals have no assets breaking down by asset types assumes people have assets in the first   to quote the fdic   from the 2015 survey indicate that percent of households in the united states were unbanked in 2015 this proportion represents approximately million households an additional 19.9 percent of u.s. households million were underbanked meaning that the household had a checking or savings account but also obtained financial products and services outside of the banking system   that 's right there are millions of households so finance savvy they do n't even have bank accounts obviously it 's because of low interest rates also most people have a checking account as well as savings account the percent with checking and savings was while those with checking only were page 25 pdf page 31 of 88 it 's possible in some surveys people keep all their money in checking but given other data sources and the original claim this fails to hold up if the concern was interest rates it makes no sense to keep money in checking which seldom pays interest   this survey also directly addresses the issue of emergency savings   gt overall percent of households saved for unexpected   expenses or emergencies in the past 12 months page 37 pdf page 43 of 88   furthermore   7.2 shows that among all households that saved for   unexpected expenses or emergencies savings accounts   were the most used savings method followed by checking   accounts more than four in five percent kept savings   in one of these accounts about one in ten 10.5 percent   households that saved maintained savings in the home or   with family or friends    emphasis added   why do n't people have wealth in different asset classes well they do n't save wp content rates by wealth   this is further supported by the oecd data   americans currency and deposits are 13 vs 5.8 for securities and other shares as of total financial household financial   additionally   interest earning checking accounts of american households second a   among all households that saved for unexpected expenses or emergencies savings accounts were the most used   savings method followed by checking accounts page 7 pdf page 13 of   saved for an emergency with a savings account vs who used checking   in fairness the fdic link does state banked americans were more likely to hold checking accounts than savings accounts 98 vs respectively but that does n't mean they 're earning interest in their checking account it 's also worth noting median transaction account value was for 2013 this is the federal reserve data $ 4100

sounds like a bad idea the ira is built on the power of compounding removing contributions will hurt your retirement savings and you will never be able to make that up instead consider tax free investments state bonds federal bonds municipal bonds etc for example i invest in california muni bonds fund which gives me ~3 4 annual dividend income completely tax free in addition there 's capital appreciation of your fund holdings there are risks of course for example rate changes will affect yields and capital appreciation so consult with someone knowledgeable in this area or ask another question here for the basics this will give you the same result as you 're expecting from your roth ira trick without damaging your retirement savings potential

former employee so i have a little insight they are very scared of unionization and also losing their exemption in the railway act this fedex as an airline railway company where ups is a ground shipping company what that means is that fedex has protections against unions fedex ground drivers are not employees they are contractors some of these guys are not happy and the states were changing laws to benefit the workers in some way i 'm not entirely sure how it works but fedex is smart so they are these people as independent service providers they are forcing single route drivers to sell to multi route isp owners when you have an owner that owns multiple routes they ar likely to be pro union and it also puts another barrier between the driver and fedex

all else being equal i would n't object to zero capital gains tax except not all else is equal the differential between earned income and capital gains is enormous this is more than enough to drive huge sums of money out of incomes and into capital gains private equity funds provides the simplest and most legal means of accomplishing this there are more legally questionable methods though not challenged at this time involving carried interest   let 's say an employer has $ 1 they can choose to pay an employee or divert it into capital gains if the effective tax rate that employee pays is 40 that leaves 60 cents going to that employee and does n't even count the other cost of that employee through unemployment insurance etc if they divert it then at the top rate it becomes 85 so even without other cost considerations that becomes a 25 surcharge on treating it as wages more than enough incentive freezing out wages as much as possible in favor of capital gains which is occurring on a large scale    so let 's get back to the issues faced by granny selling her house you say it 's unfair for granny to pay 35 as opposed to 15 on the capital gains yet is it any more unfair than granny paying 35 on her earned income all those years she paid for the house would n't she be much better off if all those years she paid less on her earned income at the expense of paying more on her capital gains all with essentially the same overall federal tax receipts so in essence you are arguing that she should be screwed less on her one time capital gains in favor of screwing her many many times that amount over the years leading up to that sale ouch   so let 's look at the difference between capital gains and income at the investor level you have a wage earner that gets out of bed every morning and works at the of someone else daily we 'll suppose they are it the 35 tax bracket under $ 400k is it more fair to charge them 35 than it it the person who invested their money and gets their paycheck while watching i love i know it 's almost never that easy but really if working 40 or 80 or even 100 hours per week does n't deserve the same break how do you justify it for the person who simply purchased their future income labor is after all hired to help produce capital goods how is their contribution to those capital goods not part and parcel to the capital gains   even with these issues i still would n't have such a problem if markets including wage and capital ratios acted independently of these effective tax rates but that notion is absurd even if doing so require some illegal maneuvers which in many cases do not    so yeah i find your argument to be specious and quiet arbitrary at every level

you would have to find someone in the other state who wanted to swap   this is conceivable but difficult if you want the houses to be the same value   how do you find the one person who lives in the right place now and wants to move to the right area    the normal way this situation is handled is to simply put your house on the market   at the same time you find a new house in the new location   you arrange for a new mortgage for the new house and make purchase contingent on selling the old house   your buyer pays off your mortgage and gives you a bit left over that you use as a downpayment on the new house    note that you take a loss on closing costs when you do this   this is why if you are in the position where you move frequently you may be better off renting    sometimes an employer will help with this paying for a long term hotel or short term rental   this can give you more room to sell and buy the houses    if you have to move right now immediately not in a few months when your housing situation is fixed consider double renting   you rent out your mortgaged house to someone and pay rent on a new place   you may put some of your stuff in storage until you get into your permanent place    the downside is that it can be harder to sell a house with a tenant until you are close to the end of the lease   and of course you are probably not in the best position to get or pay good rent   your situation restricts your options   you might get stuck in this situation for a year so as to get the time that you need to line up a buyer    of course you may get lucky and find someone who wants your old house as an investment property   such a person wo n't be bothered by a tenant   but they usually want a good price   after all they want to make money off it    there are those operations that advertise that they buy ugly houses   they want a good deal   you 'll probably take a bath   but they can buy quickly so you can move on quickly   no waiting until they find a buyer    and i 'm not saying that you ca n't do a swap like you want   i 'm just saying that you may find it difficult to find a swapping partner   perhaps an investment person would be up for it   they take your house in trade for their house letting you stay in their house until they can fix up your old house and either rent it or sell it   the problem is that it may be hard to find such an investor who can handle a house where you are and has a house where you need to be    i do n't have a good suggestion for finding a swapping partner other than calling a lot of realtors and asking for suggestions   maybe a bit of online checking for properties where the owner 's business is managing the sale

organize your expenses in order of the rate of return and pay them in that order   by far the highest rate of return on your list is nowhere else are you going to see an immediate 100 return or 50 depending on the company 's matching policy on every dollar you allocate to this pot second would probably be money that you do not allocate here will usually incur a penalty   outside of large expenses like a home education or a reasonable car you never want to pay to use your own money and borrowed money is still yours remember that someday you have to pay all of it back   avoiding a negative rate of return interest can be just as beneficial as finding a high positive rate of return on an investment continue down the list determining what must be paid first and what the highest rates are in the immediate future and the long run   meanwhile live within your means and set aside a portion of your monthly income towards things like a rainy day fund up to a level which is not touched when reached   additional savings through work or your personal investments should not be neglected money saved early and compounded is worth many times what a dollar saved down the road will gain especially if you are young in your career

i have had similar thoughts regarding alternative for the reasons you mention but for the most part they do n't exist   gold is often mentioned but outside of 1972 1974 when the us went off the gold standard it has n't been very effective in the diversification role   cash can help a little but it also fails to effectively protect you in a bear market as measured by portfolio drawdowns as well as std dev relative to gov't bonds there are alternative assets reverse etfs etc which can fulfill a specific short term defensive role in your portfolio but which can be very dangerous and are especially poor as a long term solution while some people claim to use them for effective results i have n't seen anything verifiable i do n't recommend them gov't bonds really do have a negative correlation to equities during periods in which equities underperform timing is often slightly delayed and that makes them more valuable than any other asset class as a   if you are concerned about rate increases avoid lt gov't bond funds   intermediate will work but will take a few hits short term bonds will be the safest   personally i 'm in 30 and willing to take the modest hit in exchange for the overall portfolio protection they provide against an equity downturn   if the hit concerns you tips may provide some long term help assuming inflation rises along with rates to some degree i personally think tips give up too much return when equity performance is strong but it 's a modest concern tips may suit you better than any other option   in general i 'm less concerned with a single asset class than with the long term performance of my total portfolio

from the irs perspective there 's no difference between your taxes and your sole proprietorship 's taxes they 're all just your taxes while i could see it being very useful and wise to track your business 's activities separately and use separate bank accounts and the like this is just a convenience to help you in your personal accounting and not something that needs to relate directly to how tax forms are completed or taxes are paid when calculating your taxes if you want to figure out how much you owe vs. how much your business owes you 'll have to do so yourself one approach might be just to take the amount that your schedule c puts as income on your return and multiply by your marginal tax rate another approach might be to have your tax software run the calculations as though you had no business income and see what just your personal taxes would have been without the business if you think of the business income as being first and should use up the lower brackets rather than your personal income maybe do it the other way around and have your software run the calculations as though you had only the business income and no other personal investment income and see what the amount of taxes would be then once you 've figured out a good allocation the actual mechanics of paying some personal tax amount from your personal bank account and some business tax amount from your business bank account are up to you i 'd probably just transfer the money from my business account to my personal account and pay all the taxes from the personal account writing two separate checks one from each account that total to the correct amount i 'm sure would work just fine as well you can probably make separate payments from each account electronically through direct pay or as well as long as all taxes are paid by the deadline i do n't think the irs is too picky about the details of how many payments are made

given your time frame i 'm not sure if investing in a 529 is your best option if you 're investing in a 529 you may have to deal with market volatility and the amount you invest over the course of three years could be worth less than what you had initially invested when it comes to your child 's college education the main idea of starting a plan like a 529 is the time frame for your investments to grow you also have the option of pre paying your child 's college but that has restrictions most of the state sponsored pre pay plans limit you to state schools if that was n't obvious also the current political situation is tricky and may influence the cost of education in ~3 4 years but i 'm not sure this is the proper place for that discussion also as far as the viability of these it depends state by state i live in illinois and do n't think i would count on a payout given our current financial situation you could however look into paying tuition now for a state school and it will be risk free in terms of inflation but again it 's hard to anticipate the political scope of this they also have private pre pay plans but that would limit your child 's university options just as the state pre pay check out this investopedia article on 529 plans it 's basic but will give you a high level overview bankrate has an overview as well

think again     all prosperity ultimately comes from the generation -the of wealth     we create wealth out of the ether when we take a thing physical which is worth little and turn it into a thing that is worth more with the power of an idea and the application of labor   on a macro scale that translates into the manufacturing sector   the manufacturing sector in the us has changed it 's not gone   it 's spectacularly healthy in a of new ways while all the old ones have died off or are dying a slow death   the new manufacturing sector demands skill not just attendance   unskilled work is drying up because under current laws unskilled people cost more to employ than they can possibly produce but someone with a skill in trade can get a job in half a heartbeat especially if they are willing to move to where the job is   no nation of any size can prosper without the internal generation of real wealth   the idea that we can be a nation of bankers and managers is laughable and is precisely what got us into our current situation   the future is and will always be in making new things   labor is not a word and it does not equate to a second class existence as pay rates are currently demonstrating   it was geniuses working in the trades who were the innovators and entrepreneurs that built american industrial power thus economic power in the first place     it will be again

if your credit card 's interest rates are not more than your 35 25 for your tax bracket and 10 penalty there is no way i would consider this if you boil it down to the numbers you are asking whether you should borrow money at a 35 interest to pay off your credit cards i would say absolutely not $ 20 k of auto loans which equal $ 1100 a month in payments also we purchased a car for me a year ago which is 375 a month probably should n't have done it but the car i was driving was on it 's last leg where is the $ difference going you 've got to make sacrifices and right now you are leaning towards sacrificing your future for your present it would take years of large contributions to make up for the money lost in early withdraw penalties and taxes not to mention the loss in growth these accounts would have been earning if left alone this plan is similar to saying you want to spend $ 60k to pay off $ 40k do n't do it if it was me i 'd get a couple $ 3,000 cars that should free up at least $ 600 a month and reduces your debt by $ 14k i 'd also pull my child out of private school unless there is really no public option which based upon your refusal to consider selling your house i image there 's a decent public school near your neighborhood that 's an extra $ 500 a month next i 'd sell anything that i could through craigslist or garage sales i 'd get on a written budget and the envelope system to make sure you are really as tight as you are presenting in your question hating debt is a great motivator but you should n't let it lead you to make even bigger financial mistakes i think you started doing well and got promotions and did what almost everyone else does you increased your standard of living no matter what you choose to do you will never build your retirement or have financial stability without living on a budget and spending less than you make   maybe attacking this debt the old fashioned way will give you the tools you need to gain financial stability long term updated to address calculations assuming 18 cc interest and 10 ira growth and always spending at least $ 1500 on cc debt until it 's gone then $ 1,500 back into retirement after that if you continued paying $ 1,500 a month the credit cards would take about 71 months to pay off in that time you 'd spend a total of $ on the debt   your plan would spend $ 60k upfront to reduce the debt by $ 40k the new balance of $ 25k would be paid off in 20 months and would cost $ 30k total total cost on your plan would be $ 90k your plan pays $ less in total and it would be 51 months quicker however you would have no retirement at age 40   if you then saved $ 1500 a month in retirement you would catch up to the $ 70k loss in your ira at age 49 i 'm including growth in both accounts to calculate this if you had instead just left the ira alone you 'd be done with the ccs at age 44 if after age 44 you put in $ 1500 month into retirement your plan would never catch up to this plan it seems to me that cashing out your ira is a 5 year

  your question is subjective and as such the answer varies from person to person    the rent you should be paying is the tricky part   minimum is whatever is the least you can find   maximum is the most you can afford   to be financially responsible you would live as close to that minimum as you can bear   however this can cause stress if you are trying to on lower than you can actually bear you have certain expenses that are required to survive   housing clothing food   these are your needs   everything else is convenience or luxury best way to develop a budget is to list the categories of everything you have spent over several months   figure out a monthly amount for each one   divide them up into groups of things you need things that make life and things you can do without    then start with your income and figure out how much you bring home each pay period   when you get paid allocate the money to your needs until they 're all covered   if there 's anything left fund the second group then on to the third   continue tracking your spending and adjust where you allocate the money   after 2 3 months you 'll start having a decent idea on how much you actually spend on each category   you 'll probably find areas where you 're spending a lot more than you realize    the method i 've just described is the one advised by you need a budget software but you do n't need the software to use the method   though it does help also if there 's any debt that goes in with the needs because we all need to pay our bills

do n't use a credit repair agency they are scams one of the myriad of ways in which they work is by setting you up with a bogus loan which they will report you as paying on time they 'll pretend to be a used car dealer or some other credit based merchant for a time this will actually work this is called false reporting the problem is the data clearinghouses are not stupid and eventually realize some hole in the wall car dealer with no cars on the lot yes they do physical inspections as part of the process just sometimes they 're a little slow about it is reporting trade lines worth millions of dollars per year it 's a major problem in the industry but eventually that business loses its fraudulent reporting ability those trade lines get revoked and your account gets flagged for a fraud investigation the repair agency has your money and you still do n't have good credit bad news if this all goes down while you 're trying to close on a house you 're better off trying to settle your debts usually for 50 or declaring bankruptcy altogether the latter is n't so bad if you 're in a stable home because you wo n't be able to get an apartment for a while credit cards or a good deal on auto financing   ed i just saw what one agency was charging and can tell you declaring bankruptcy costs only a few hundred dollars more than the repair agency and is 100 guaranteed to get you predictable results as long as you name all your debts up front and are n't getting by student loans and considering you ca n't stomach well guess what now you 'll have a lawyer to deal with them for you anything you accomplish through an agency will eventually be reversed because it 's fraudulent but through bankruptcy your credit will start improving within two years the tradeoff being that you wo n't be able to get a mortgage at all or apartment easily during that so find a place to down for a few years before you declare

a yes it does accomplish the goal of adding more money but the money is in lieu of any return you can earn while the loan is outstanding if you somehow knew exactly which periods where going to run negative and you took a 401k loan during that time you 'd be in pretty good shape but if you had that information you 'd probably be ruling the world in short order and would n't care much about a measly 401k b it 's a nice idea but unfortunately you are not allowed to set your own interest rate if you could your idea would work perfectly the interest rate is bank specific and is typically 1 2 points over prime but if your plan was to leave your money sitting in cash or low interest bearing accounts anyway the loan does actually achieve the goal of getting more money in there though it 's your money you are n't earning it

i do n't understand the logic in the other answer and i think it does n't make sense so here is my take you pay taxes on income not on sales price so if you put x $ of your own money in the account and it becomes x + y $ in the future at the moment of liquidation you will own taxes on the y $ never on the x $ as it was your own already taxed money to begin with the difference between long term and short term gains just influences the tax rate on y. if you donate the gain alone the y $ to charity you can deduct y from your tax base so adding y to your tax base and then deducting y again obviously leaves your tax base at the old value so you pay no extra taxes which seems logical as you did n't make any money in the process aside from extreme cases where the deductible gain is too large a percentage from your income or negative i do n't see why this would ever be different so you can take your original 100 $ back out and donate all gains and be fine note that potential losses are seen different as the ira regulations are not

yep you 're single you 're possibly still a dependent on your parent 's taxes in lieu of rent and you 're finally bringing home bacon instead of bacon bits welcome to the working world let 's say your gross salary is the u.s. median of $ 50,000 with bi weekly checks 26 a year common practice you 're getting $ per paycheck in the 2013 percentage method tax tables here 's how your federal withholding is calculated as a single person paid biweekly federal taxes are computed the amount up to a is taxed at x% then the amount between a and b is taxed at y% so if you make $ c between a and b the tax is + c the amount is included in the base amount for ease of calculation back to our example let 's say you 're getting $ gross wages per check that puts you in the 25 marginal bracket you pay the sum of all lesser brackets which is the base amount of the 25 bracket plus the 25 marginal rate on every dollar that falls within the bracket that 's + .25 = + .25 = + = $ per paycheck the effective tax rate on the total amount as if you were being charged a flat tax is and this is just for the federal income tax add to this ma state income taxes 5.25 flat tax fica aka medicare 1.45 flat and aka social security 6.2 up to a wage base that $ 50k does n't even approach and your effective tax rate on each dollar you earn is + 5.25 + 1.45 + 6.2 = this does n't include any state unemployment taxes that may be withheld separately but as the rate i come up with is pretty darn close to what you 've figured meaning i slightly overestimated your gross income and thus your effective tax rate my bet is that 's either employer paid in ma or it 's just part of ma state income tax it gets better at least at the federal level the amount of your state income taxes is tax deductible at the federal level if you itemize your deductions that may not be a factor for you as you 'd have to come up with more than $ of other tax deductible expenses to make itemizing the better option than taking the standard deduction big ticket items are mortgage expenses other than principal payments hospital stays such as for or major accident and state and local taxes such as sales property and income if you can claim yourself as a dependent meaning your parents ca n't then $ 150 of each check $ 3,900 of your annual salary is no longer taxed for federal withholding lowering the amount of money taxed at the 25 marginal rate you effectively save $ biweekly $ annually in taxes get married and file jointly and your spouse her personal exemption and an extra standard deduction amount if you do n't itemize go on your taxes the tax rates for married couples filing jointly are also lower they 're currently calculated or were in 2012 to be the same as if two equal earners were to file separately so if your spouse does n't work your taxes on the single income are calculated at the rates you 'd get if you earned half as much it does n't work out to half the taxes but it is a significant marriage advantage have kids and each one is another little $ 3,900 tax write off it 's nowhere near the cost of having or raising the child but it helps and having kids is n't about the money owning a home making charitable deductions having medical expenses etc are a toss up the magic number in 2013 is $ for a married couple $ for a single person if your mortgage interest insurance premiums property taxes medical expenditures charitable donations any contributions from your take home pay to a tax deferred savings account typically these accounts are paid into by your employer as a pre tax deduction and never show up as taxable income but you could just as easily move money from your take home pay into tax deferred savings and any other tax deductible payments add up to more than 12 large then itemize if not take your standard deduction as a single taxpayer just starting out in life you probably do n't have any of these types of expenditures certainly not enough to give up the sd i did the math on my own taxes in 2012 and was surprised at how little the government actually gets of my paycheck when all 's said and done remember back in the summer of 2012 when everyone was mad at romney for making millions and only paying an effective income tax rate of 14 which was compared to the middle class 's marginal rate of 25 28 well my family of 3 living on a little more than the median income from one earner me taking the married standard deduction three personal exemptions and a little extra for student loan interest paid an effective federal income tax rate of something like 3.5 of course the fica and ss taxes do n't allow any deductions not even for retirement savings so add in the 4.2 ss in 2012 and 1.45 fica and the full federal gimme was more like 9 10

1 link 2 it does n't matter if they can or do what matters is if they are investing not trading in it more than banks are investing in businesses if that is the case it is then businesses as a whole will see the inflation first and commodities will be playing the entire time but mostly when the investments hit recession   i will invest in the market again after they lose their invested value in historical terms the best time was to invest in them was 1980 1938 and 1900 and the best time to get out was 1929 1960 's and 2000 but to bet against them right now with the dollar is meaningless because the fed is deflating the currency as they go down so it 's like running on a treadmill by holding silver i am essentially short the market only difference is instead of holding a devaluing currency cash i 'm holding a real money which is increasing in value   there 's nothing simpler than investing in commodities for the long term people lose when they are making monthly daily trades in them anyone who bought and held on to gold in 2000 did it for $ 300 and they 've made infinitely more than the majority of people investing in blue chips because they 've lost value and much more than those who invested in bonds and that trend is n't going to stop unless the government lets the dollar deflate in which case the dollar will come to gold instead of the other way around until they are in equilibrium again historically the dow has an average of being 2 ounces of gold peaking at 50 and at .5 if it hits .5 again like it has everytime this occurs in the past then either gold will be $ 20000 or the dow will be 4000 you pick

i think you 're missing the point in terms of profit margin the trucks actually pay a larger percentage of their gross in overhead that is their net is a larger proportion of their gross than it is on average for restaurants they pay more for inspections they pay for services and many other things and licenses and permits than restaurants typically pay   what you are proposing is a law that would also bar another brick and mortar restaurant in your own words one that sells the same product for cheaper due to the lack of overhead say for example a chain fast food restaurant   are you saying that new businesses should n't be allowed to open next door to established businesses of the same type or does your argument only apply to food trucks   i am not a flag waving libertarian or anything but i do n't think that choosing which types of business model to protect should be on the list of things that city governments should be doing especially in the case of states like california and texas where the state vehicle code clearly states that the only regulation a municipality may enact on otherwise legal mobile vendor are rules that serve the public health and/or safety not competition   just because some people may not agree with you does n't mean that they are either simple minded or misread your point i understand your argument very well i just do n't happen to agree with it that does n't mean i think you are simple minded either i just think you 're a name calling jerk

it 's good to ask this question because this is one of the fundamental in market at any time t for each product on a typical exchange there are two well defined prices at time t there is literally no person in the market who wants to sell below the ask so all the people who are waiting to buy at the bid or below could very well be waiting there forever   there 's simply no guarantee that any seller will ever want to part with their product for a lesser price than they think it 's worth so if you want to buy the product at time t you have a tough choice to make you get in line at the bid price where there 's no guarantee that your request will ever be filled and you might never get your hands on the product you decide that owning the product right now is more valuable to you than ask bid quantity so you tell the exchange that you 're willing to buy at the ask price and the exchange matches you with whichever seller is first in line now if you 're in the market for the long term the above choice is completely immaterial to you   who cares if you pay $ 10.00 1000 shares or $ 10.01 1000 shares when you plan to sell 30 years from now at $ 200 or $ but if you 're a day trader or anyone else with a very short time horizon then this choice is extremely important if the price is about to go up several cents and you got in line at the bid and never got filled then you missed out on some profit if you cross the spread to buy at the ask and then the price does n't go up or worse goes down you 're screwed   in order to get out of the position you 'll have to cross the spread again and sell at at most the bid meaning you 've now paid the spread twice plus transaction fees and regulatory fees for nothing all of the above also applies in reverse for selling at the ask versus selling at the bid but most people like to learn in terms of buying rather than selling

you are on the right track for tax purposes its all ordinary income at the end of 2016 if the free lance employer will withhold fed state and local tax then that takes care of your estimated tax if they ca n't or wo n't you will need to make those estimates and make payments quarterly for the fed and state tax at your projected tax liability   or you can bump up withholding by your day job employer and cover your expected tax liability at year end without making estimated tax payments

as a resident of new york state you will in addition to the federal income tax handled by the irs be responsible for state and local income taxes for new york the state tax forms are also used to determine your new york city tax if hr was either not aware of the local tax requirement for new york or you filled out the new york state version of the w-4 incorrectly you may have had too little tax withheld for new york state the refund from the irs is not dependent on the refund owe status for state and local taxes it is possible that your state taxes are fine but that you owe taxes to the city that tax you owe to the city will reduce the refund from the state and may require you to pay money to new york of course if you do itemize what you pay to the state and city may result in deductions on your federal form if you owe back taxes to the state or local government this could result in the irs seizing a federal refund but that does n't happen right away

as indicated in comments this is common practice in the us as well as eu   for example in this fox business article a user had basically the same experience their card was replaced but without the specific merchant being disclosed   when the reporter contacted visa they were told we also believe that the public interest is best served by quickly notifying financial institutions with the information necessary to protect themselves and their cardholders from fraud losses even a slight delay in notification to financial institutions could be costly the spokesperson said in an e mail statement visa works with the breached entity to collect the necessary information and provides payment card issuers with the affected account numbers so they can take steps to protect consumers through independent fraud monitoring and if needed cards the most critical information needed is the affected accounts which visa works to provide as quickly as possible what they 're not saying of course is that it 's in visa 's best interests that merchants let visa know right away when a leak occurs without having to think about whether it 's going to screw that merchant over in the press   if the merchant has to consider pr they may not let the networks know in as timely of a fashion they may at least wait until they 've verified the issue in more detail or even wait until they 've found who to pin it on so they do n't get blamed but beyond that the point is that it 's easier for the network visa mastercard etc to have a system that 's just a list of card numbers to submit to the bank for re issuing nobody there really cares which merchant was at fault they just want to re issue the cards quickly   letting you know who 's at fault is separate   there 's little reason for the issuing bank to ever know you should find out from the merchant themselves or from the network and in my experience usually the former eventually you may well find out the article suggest that situation is common but there is some good news consumers do in many cases find out the source of the breach but of course does n't go into detail about numbers

the margin money you put up to fund a short position $ 6000 in the example given is simply a good faith deposit that is required by the broker in order to show that you are acting in good faith and fully intend to meet any potential losses that may occur   this margin is normally called initial margin   it is not an accounting item meaning it is not debited from you cash account   rather the broker simply these funds so that you may not use them to fund other trading   when you settle your position these funds are released from segregation    in addition there is a second type of margin called variation margin which must be maintained while holding a short position   the variation margin is simply the running profit or loss being incurred on the short position   in you example if you sold 200 shares at $ 20 and the price went to $ 21 then your variation margin would be a debit of $ 200 while if the price went to $ 19 the variation margin would be a credit of $ 200    the variation margin will be netted with the initial margin to give the total margin requirement $ 6000 in this example   margin requirements are computed at the close of business on each trading day   if you are showing a loss of $ 200 on the variation margin then you will be required to put up an additional $ 200 of margin money in order to maintain the $ 6000 margin requirement $ 6000 $ 200 = $ 5800 so you must add $ 200 to maintain $ 6000   if you are showing a profit of $ 200 then $ 200 will be released from segregation $ 6000 + $ 200 = $ so $ 200 will be release from segregation leaving $ 6000 as required when you settle your short position by buying back the shares the margin monies will be release from segregation and the ledger postings to you cash account will be made according to whether you have made a profit or a loss   so if you made a loss of $ 200 on the trade then your account will be debited for $ 200 plus any applicable commissions   if you made a profit of $ 200 on the trade then your account will be credited with $ 200 and debited with any applicable commissions

no something does n't seem right here   there would be virtually no time value to the option 10 minutes before market close on the expiration day what option is it and what is the expiration edit it appears you were looking only at the ask price it was $ however the bid price was only $ 1.35 and the last transaction was $ 1.40 so the true value is right about $ 1.35 to $ 1.40 at this second   this is a pitfall that tends to occur when you trade options with almost no volume for instance the open interest in that option is only 1 contract assuming that is yours so the bid and the ask can often be very far apart as they are only being generated by computer traders or the result of outdated irrelevant human orders

as many people here have pointed out a cfd is a contract for difference when you invest in stock at etoro you buy a cfd reflecting a bid on the price movement of the underlying stock however you do not actually own the stock or hold any rights shareholders have the counterparty to the cfd is etoro when you close your position etoro shall pay you the amount representing the difference between your buy and sell price for each stock   i suggest you read the following article about cfds it explains everything clearly and thoroughly as some of the responders have pointed out and as is mentioned in the article a broker can potentially the prices of underlying assets in order to manipulate cfds to their advantage however etoro is a highly reputable broker with over 2 million active accounts and we guarantee accurate stock quotes furthermore etoro is regulated in europe germany uk france etc by institutions that exact strict regulations on the cfd trading sector and we are obligated to comply with these regulations which include accurate price quoting   and of course cfd trading at etoro has tremendous benefits unlike a direct stock investment etoro allows you to invest as much or as little as you like in your favorite stocks even if the amount is less than the relevant stock price i.e. fraction stocks for example   if you invest $ 10 in microsoft and on the day of execution etoro ’s average aggregated price was $ 30 after a spread of 0.1 you will then have a cfd representing stocks of microsoft in your etoro account in addition with etoro you can invest in stock in the context of a social trading network meaning that you can utilize the stock trading expertise of other trader to your advantage by following them learning their strategies and even copying their stock investments automatically to put it briefly you wo n’t be facing the stock market alone   before you make a decision i suggest that you try stock trading with an etoro demo account a free demo account grants you access to all our instruments at real market rates as well as access to our social network where you can view and participate in trader discussions about trading stocks with etoro all without risking your hard earned money bottom line it ’s free there are no strings attached and you can get a much idea of what trading stocks with etoro is like if you have any further questions please do n’t hesitate to contact us through our site

the opposite of an economic bubble is a bubble burst :p jokes aside though an economic bubble occurs when the economy is in bull market mode and asset prices are growing very fast it 's usually measured by ratio 's like price to earnings and the levels of various market indices so the opposite would be when valuations are falling very fast or are very low and price to earnings ratios are low   this condition is usually a recession a recession is a market slowdown generally after a bubble bursts and severe recessions can become depressions if they last long enough great depression 1930s   a bubble is not necessarily negative stock prices usually rise a lot so paper wealth is greatly magnified if you can get out in time you 're golden similarly a recession is n't bad for everyone some investors keep large amounts of cash waiting for recessions so they can buy low sell high for most people however recessions are negative because unemployment increases and some people get fired and the economy slows down asset prices have fallen so their investments are worth less than they used to be on paper and people mainly have to it out until the market starts growing again

the reason that stock buybacks are not considered insider trading is because the offers are open to all on equal terms to everyone outside the company even if the company knows inside information it 's not supposed to tell it and company executives are not allowed to tender shares unless they had previously set up a blind selling program on if that 's actually the case no one investor is better informed than another and hence there is no insider trading the issue of inside trading is that insiders are better informed

mortgage rates are at record lows the 30 yr fixed is now below 4 if you are in the 25 bracket and itemize state income tax property tax donations easy to pass the minimum it costs you 3 post tax this is the rate of long term inflation effectively making this money free    you are likely to be able to average a far greater return than this mortgage is costing you these rates may last another year or two but long term they are an anomaly   etfs such as dvy the dow high dividend stocks are yielding over 3.75 3.2 after the 15 cap gain tax i.e. you get a small positive return and the potential for capital gains if this etf rises just it 's all profit above your cost of money   that said there are those who sleep better with a paid in full house regardless of the rate to that extreme i 've read those who make paying their mortgage a priority ahead of funding their matched 401(k while i can guess what the market will return but ca n't know what will actual happen it 's foolish to skip one 's match they reason that the market can crash i reply the 401(k has to have a short term fund money market or t bill type returns but a 100 match is a no brainer   using an estimated 4 for the 30 and 3.5 for the 15 the payment on the 15 yr mortgage will be 50 higher $ 15yr for $ 200 k vs $ for the 30 how does this play in your budget do you have an adequate emergency fund are you funding your retirement plan at a decent level in the end there is no right answer just what 's right for you understanding the rest of your financial picture will get you more detailed advice not knowing your situation limits the answers   edit when i wrote this answer the dvy was trading at $ $ 100,000 invested would have given off $ after a 15 dividend tax rate at $ now the $ 100,000 investment would be worth $ and yielding $ for a net $ after tax the choice to go dvy would have been profitable from the start with room now for a 35 crash before losing any money

while technically true a card issuer can cancel your card for almost any reason they want it 's highly unlikely they 'll cancel it because you pay your bills there are many many people out there that pay their bills in full every month without ever paying a cent in credit card interest i would n't ever purposefully incur any interest on a credit card related anecdote i used to have a credit card that i only used for gas purchases because they gave 5 off for fuel the issuer eventually discontinued the program i assume because people like me took advantage of it so while they did n't cancel my card the bonus eventually went away i miss that card my conclusion if you can take advantage of promotional rates by all means go for it you do n't owe them any favors enjoy it as long as it lasts

first point the cra wants you to start a business with a reasonable expectation of profit they typically expect to see a profit within 5 years so you may be inviting unwanted questions from future auditors by using a breakeven strategy second point if the goal is to pay as little tax as possible you may want to consider having the corporation pay you as little as possible corporate income taxes are much lower than personal income taxes according to these two cra links how it works is that your company pays you little as an outright salary and offers you perks like a leased company car expense account for lunch and entertainment a mobile phone computer etc the company owns all of this stuff and lets you use it as part of the job the company pays for all this stuff with corporate pre tax dollars as opposed to you paying for it with personal after tax dollars there are specifics on meals entertainment which modify this slightly you can claim 50 but you get the idea the actual rate difference will depend on your province of residence and your corporate income level   there is also a requirement for reasonable expenses such that the expenses have to be in line with what you are doing if you need to travel to a conference each year that would be a reasonable expense adding your family and making it a vacation for everyone would not you can claim such expenses as a sole proprietor or a corporation the sole proprietorship option puts any after expense profits into your pocket as taxable income where the corporate structure allows the corporation to hold funds and limit the amount paid out to you   i 've seen this strategy successfully done first hand but have not done it myself i am not a lawyer or accountant consult these professionals about this tax strategy before taking any action

i wanted to know that what if the remaining 40 of 60 in a ltv loan to value ratio for buying a home is not paid but the borrower only wants to get 60 of the total amount of home loan that is being provided by lending company generally a lending company say bank will not part with their funds unless you first pay your portion of the funds this is essentially to safeguard their interest let 's say they pay the 60 either to you or to the seller the title is still with seller as full payment is not made now if you default the bank has no recourse against the seller who still owns the title and you are not paying some banks may allow a schedule where the 60/40 may be applied to every payment made this would be case to case basis the deal could be done with only paying 20 in the beginning to the buyer and then i have to pay emi 's of $   the lending company is offering you 1.1 million assuming that you are paying 700 k and the title will be yours this would safeguard the banks interest now if you default the bank can take possession of the house and recover the funds a distress sale may be mean the house goes for less than 1.8 m say for 1.4 million the bank would take back the 1.1 million plus interest and other closing costs so if you can close the deal by paying only 20 bank would ask you to close this first and then lend you any money this way if you are not able to pay the balance as per the deal agreement you would be in loss and not the bank

the tax deferred status of a 401k plan helps you in theory because your tax rate will be lower once you retire and start drawing the money   this theory could prove incorrect also the money you add to a 401k lowers your taxable income today so you end up paying less taxes to the government right now   depending on where you are in the tax bracket scale that could have the affect of lowering your tax bracket which will save you money in other areas each person 's situation is different by my general theory is to contribute towards retirement in the following order hope this helps

i 'm kind of shocked that no formal behavioral modeling has been proposed as an explanation yet one such model would be steep hyperbolic quasi hyperbolic discounting   consumers would rather pay for popcorn later than for an expensive movie ticket now   for instance consumers might when purchasing the ticket see a low value of popcorn and view the ticket price as the whole price because they do not predict purchasing popcorn   then when entering the theater the present value of popcorn is very high and they purchase it   there might therefore be a market for a commitment device such as a theater to make the appropriate decision ex ante   another commitment device that seems to be practiced is when individuals sneak their own popcorn into the theater   they may not actually want the popcorn but by bringing their own they ensure they do not purchase the theater 's

charge less money   that 's the only thing   what that really means is negotiating lower ticket prices with venues not removing fees   people do n't realize that ticketmaster 's business model is shielding venues from public ire not adding arbitrary amounts to tickets for the minor service of buying online a service everyone knows costs very little to perform   the arbitrary fees mostly go back to the venue per their agreement however they 're divided out as admin fees and processing fees and convenience fees charged by ticketmaster so that ticketmaster eats the blowback instead of the venue charging exorbitant prices

so many answers here are missing the mark   i have a $ 100k mortgage because that is n't paid off i ca n't buy a car   that 's really misguided logic you have a reasonably large amount of college debt and did n't mention any other it 's a really big deal what kind of debt this is   is it unsecured debt through a private lender is it a federal loan from the department of education let 's assume the worst possible reasonable situation   you lose your job and spend the next year plus looking for work   this is the boat numerous people out of college are in far far far far more than the unemployment rates indicate   federal loans have somewhat reasonable indentured servitude but i digress repayment strategies you can base the payment on your current income through income based and income continent repayment plans   if you 're through a private lender they still expect payment   in both cases because the us hit students with ridiculous lending practices your interest rates are likely 5 10 or even higher given your take home income is quite large and i do n't know exactly the cost of living where you live you have to make some reasonable decisions   you can afford a car note for basically any car you want   what 's the worst that happens if you ca n't afford the car   they take it back if you can afford to feed yourself house yourself pay your other monthly bills you make so much more than the median income in the us that i really do n't see any issues what you should do is write out all your monthly costs and figure out how much unallocated money you have but i 'd imagine you have enough money coming in to finance any reasonable new or used car   keep in mind new will have much higher insurance and costs but if you pick a good car your headaches besides that will be minimal

i ca n't say specifically about charities to help greece if someone on here has specific knowledge please chime in the only shortcut i know to tell if a charity is legitimate is to consult one of the ratings type groups that monitor charities for example for explicitly christian charities there 's a group called the council for financial accountability to be a member in good standing a charity has to meet a bunch of criteria like having an independent board of directors i.e. you ca n't start a charity make yourself the president and your brother in law the vice president and you 're not answerable to anyone else their fund raising and administrative costs ca n't be more than a certain percentage of total income etc there are similar groups with similar standards for more general charities i 'm not naming any of those groups because there 's a potential catch how reputable is the group that rates other people 's reputations and i do n't want to recommend someone without knowing years ago i came across a news story about an organization that rated colleges and that had given one particular college their top rating but the news story said investigators found that that one college was the only college they ever gave a rating to and that their address was the same as the college 's address it turned out of course that the college was a scam the other method is to take some time to investigate the charity   for starters get a copy of their annual report or their newsletter if they 're total frauds often they do n't have an annual report or a newsletter of course a fraud could make up beautiful flyers describing all the wonderful work they do with pictures of people they helped and detailed case histories and it 's all complete fiction but that 's more work than most con men go to i 've gotten lots of for contributions from people who call on the phone or come to my door or send an email if the message does not have a logo a mailing address and phone number reasonably coherent english and a fair amount of text describing what they do i do n't give them anything they could be a new start up that has n't had time to prepare these things they could believe that pretty flyers are a waste of money and they want to put all their resources into helping the needy but more likely it 's a scam that somebody through together in his basement of course the best thing is if you personally know people who are officers in the organization well assuming you personally know them and you know that they are honest people if you know the president and you know he 's a sleazy con man you might want to stay away from that group see if you can find information about the charity in the news or on line if they 're being investigated for fraud by the justice department you might want to avoid them etc maybe you 've thought this through but you also might want to think about exactly who in greece you want to help and what your philosophy of charity is do you want to help people who lost their jobs because of the economic problems there and who are now unemployed do you want to donate to the government to help them balance the budget do you want to help support an or a homeless shelter or give money directly to needy people etc and one piece of unsolicited advice unless you have millions to give and i 'm assuming you do n't as you said your first gift would be $ 50 i 'd pick one or two charities and give regularly to them i think you can do more good by giving $ x per month to a single charity than to give to a different charity every month you make more difference

currency like gold and other commodities is n't really much of an investment at all it does n't actually generate any return its value might fluctuate at a different rate than that of the us dollar or euro but that 's about it it might have a place as a very small slice of a basket of global currencies but most us european households do n't actually need that sort of basket it 's really more of a risk management strategy than an investment strategy and it does n't really reflect the risks faced by an ordinary family in the us or europe or similar investments should n't generally be particularly exciting generally exciting opportunities mean that you 're speculating on the market not really investing in it if you have a few thousand dollars you do n't need and do n't mind losing you can make some good money speculating some of the time but you can also just lose it all too maybe there 's a little room for excitement if you find amazing deals on ordinary investments at the very bottom of a stock market crash when decent solid companies are on sale much cheaper than they ordinarily are

i actually love this question and have hashed this out with a friend of mine where my premise was that at some volume of money it must be advantageous to simply track the index yourself there some obvious touch points most people do n't have anywhere near the volume of money required for even a $ 5 commission outweigh the large index fund expense ratios there are logistical issues that are massively reduced by holding a fund when it comes to winding down your as you get near retirement age index funds are not touted as categorically the best investment they are being touted as the best place for the average person to invest there is still a management component to an index like the s&p500   the index does n't simply buy a share of apple and watch it over time   the s&p 500 is n't simply a single share of each of the 500 us companies it 's market cap weighted with frequent rebalancing and constituent changes   voo makes a lot of trades every day to track the s&p index passive index investing is almost an oxymoron the most obvious part of this is that if index funds were the best way to invest money berkshire hathaway would be 100 invested in voo   the argument for passive index investing is simplified for public consumption   the reality is that over time large actively managed funds have under performed the large index funds net of fees   in part the of the advice is that the average person is or should be more concerned with their own endeavors than they are managing their savings   investment professionals generally want to avoid how come i my money only returned 4 when the market index returned 7   if you track the index you wo n't do worse than the index this helps people sleep better at night in my opinion the dirty little secret of index funds is that they are able to charge so much less because they spend $ 0 making investment decisions and $ 0 on researching the quality of the securities they hold   they simply track an index xyz company is 0.07 of the index then the fund carries 0.07 of xyz even if the manager thinks something shady is going on there the argument for a majority of your funds residing in mutual funds etfs is simple when you 're of retirement age do you really want to make decisions like should i sell a share of amazon or a share of exxon   would n't you rather just sell 2 units of index fund and completely maintain your investment diversification and not pay commission   for this simplicity you give up three basis points   it seems pretty reasonable to me

cryptocurrency is undoubtedly at the peak of gartner hype cycle but it very well could the way we use currency for our daily needs in the future   stay with me on this at present cryptocurrency appears no more than a speculation that is sugar coated by individuals who have vested interest in it however if we overlook this excitement the actual use of cryptocurrency is mind boggling    suppose you had a mid life crisis and went on a journey to the middle of the earth to find where humans supposedly originated from and you met and connected with a local coffee farmer named in a very remote part of ethiopia he invited you for an evening coffee and you obliged and six months later you for this same coffee whilst you were having another wave of existential thoughts in your that overlooked the urban jungle   suddenly you remembered that had a cheap but functional smartphone with a bitcoin wallet and afterwards you communicated with him on whatsapp and decided to enter in a transaction with him is delighted with this technology but mainly because he does not have to travel 100 km to and fro the nearest city where his bank is located and he is also happy that he can send a sack of coffee beans to his friend who lives in a land and all he needs to do is hand over the coffee sack to delivery truck en route the shipping port ultimately saving lot of his precious time and resources   now use this one example and multiply it by hundreds of millions of people around the world who have a very remote access to a but have an access to a basic smartphone imagine the possibility of connecting people like to the world and having a seamless cross border trade finance transaction using currency that is not controlled by any government   like many others i am keen to see the developments of cryptocurrency in the coming years but for now i remain that said i am more interest in the countless opportunities that will be unlocked by the very technology that is fundamental to all the cryptocurrencies the blockchain   is one branch of blockchain technology which has proved useful there are million other possibilities which i 'm sure will benefit many industries in the coming decade and i for one am very excited

this scheme does n't work because the combination of corporation tax even the lower tax plus the personal income tax does n't give you a tax advantage not on any realistic income i 've ever worked it out on anyway   prior to the 2014 tax year on lower incomes you could scrape a bit of an advantage but the 2013 budget changed the calculation for the tax credit on non eligible dividends so there should n't be an advantage anymore moreover if you were to do it this way by paying corporation tax instead of cpp you are n't eligible for cpp if you sit with a calculator for long enough you may figure out a way of saving $ 200 or something small but it 's a lot of paperwork for little if any benefit and you would n't get cpp i understand the money multiplier effect described above but the tax system is designed in a way that it makes more sense to take it as salary and put it in a tax deferred saving account i.e. an rrsp so there 's no limit on the multiplier effect like i said sit with a calculator if you 're earning a really large amount and are still under the small business limit it may make more sense to use a but that is the case regardless of using it as a tax shelter because if you 're earning a lot you 're probably running a business of some size the main benefit i think is that if you use a you can carry forward your losses but you have to be aware of the definition of an allowable business investment loss

knowing the answer to this question is generally not as useful as it may seem   the stock 's current price is the consensus of thousands of people who are looking at the many relevant factors dividend rate growth prospects volatility risk industry etc that determine its value   a stock 's price is the market 's valuation of the cash flows it entitles you to in the future   researching a stock 's value means trying to figure out if there is something relevant to these cash flows that the market does n't know about or has   pretty much anything we can list for you here that will affect a stock 's price is something the market knows about so it 's not likely to help you know if something is mispriced   therefore it 's not useful to you if you are not a true expert on how important the relevant factors are and how the market is reacting to them currently and often even if you are then you are essentially guessing   how likely are you to catch something that the thousands of other investors have missed and how likely are you to miss something that other investors have understood   i do n't view gambling as inherently evil but you should be clear and honest with yourself about what you are doing if you are trying to outperform the market as people become knowledgeable about and experienced with finance they try less and less to be the one to find an undervalued stock in their personal portfolio   instead they seek to hold a fully diversified portfolio with low transactions costs and build wealth in the long term without wasting time and money on the guessing game   my suggestion for you is to transition as quickly as you can to behave like someone who knows a lot about finance

there are two things i would like to add by no means am i an expert on this so please call me out if you spot a mistake   gt economic contraction scared people so instead of continuing making promises they started paying off the promises they had   every true expect this did n't cause the ball to stop rolling so much as it stopped the ball from rolling a little sooner than it otherwise would have   as pointed out in the comments above money is debt and with debt in the system we 've chosen to adopt comes interest that means that new money must be created in order for old money to be repaid which leads to a need for perpetual growth and perpetual growth is unsustainable pure and simple it does n't exist   so yeah people got a and that put the brakes on the economy but it was going to happen eventually   gt people paying off debt is fine so long as there is money for services and people paying for service is fine so long as they do n't rack up more debt than they can   as explained above this is a fallacy because our monetary system literally requires that people are n't responsible when it comes to debt eventually we 'll get to a stage the vast majority of people have taken on as much debt as they can logically support at which point they would need to take on even more debt in order to service the debt that already exists it 's either that or the money supply contracts and you have a recession   it always me when i hear people saying things like they should known better or this is what you get for not handling your finances correctly when describing people that get into debt issues the system literally depends on people acting like idiots and taking on more debt than they can support   it 's also a reason why you ca n't really blame wall street for what happened even though they did some messed up things they were just playing by the rules of the game

think about how loans work for you personally   when you charge a $ 50 dinner for two to your visa card you did not earn $ 50 in income   you did not pay income tax on that $ 50   the money you use to pay back that $ 50 at the end of the month is not tax deductible     interest on a loan is a business expense     repayment of principal is not a business expense just as receiving the loan in the first place is not business income    effectively this means the llc repays the loan with after tax dollars   just like you do with your visa card   when i do corporate accounting payment of loan interest shows up on the expense side of the profit loss statement and it makes the balance sheet net assets go down    however payment of loan principal is effectively null   it does n't appear on the profit loss at all and it 's a wash on the balance sheet as both assets and liabilities fall by the same amount

an annuity is a contract its contents are a contractual obligation from the issuing company if you want to evaluate how your annuity is likely to fare you 're essentially asking whether or not its issuer will honor its contract they 're legally required to honor the contract unless they go bankrupt even if they do go bankrupt you will be a creditor and may get a portion of the assets recovered by the bankruptcy process generally the issuer will take the proceeds and invest them in the stock market or possibly in similar instruments e.g. berkshire hathaway bought a railroad and invests some money in it directly they invest in these places because that 's where the returns are one of the reason that annuities may have a good rate on paper is that they may end up taking some of your principal because many are structured as some form of survivor 's insurance policy consider if you 're 65 years old and have some retirement savings you 'd like to be able to spend them without fear of them running out because you live longer than you expected e.g. you survive to your 90s so you could invest in the stock market and hope for a 7 return indefinitely and then plan to spend the returns but if those returns do n't materialize for a few years because there 's a big stock market crash you 're in big trouble or you could buy an annuity contract which will pay you 7 a year or more until you die then you 're guaranteed the returns unless the issuer goes bankrupt sure you lose all your principal but you 're dead so hey maybe you do n't care the insurance company essentially sells risk tolerance other annuities are n't structured like this and may be marketed towards non retirees they 're usually not such a good deal if they appear to be such a good deal it may be an illusion variable annuities in particular are hard to reason about without a good deal of knowledge about how the stock market behaves on a year to year basis many of them have a maximum return as well as a minimum and the stock market may pile up a lot of its returns into one year so after a crash and recovery cycle you might end up behind the market instead of ahead annuities are a form of safety safety can be very expensive if you 're investing your own money consider whether you need that safety you probably need n't worry quite so much about the issuer being crazy fraudulent or ponzi esque you should worry mostly about whether it looks better on paper than it is

personally i solve this by saving enough liquid capital aka checking and savings to cover pretty much everything for six months but this is a bad habit a better approach is to use budget tracking software to make virtual savings accounts and place payments every paycheck into them in step with your budget the biggest challenge you 'll likely face is the initial implementation if you 're saving up for a semi annual car insurance premium and you 've got two months left that 's gon na make things difficult in the best case scenario you already have a savings account which you among your various expenses this does mean you need to plan when it is you will actually buy that shiny new macbook pro and stick to it for a number of months much more difficult than buying on credit especially since these retailers hate dealing in cash

if your gut told you to buy during the depths of 09 your gut might be well calibrated the problem is stock market declines during recessions are frequently not that large relative to the average long run return of 9   a better strategy might be hold a percentage in equities based upon a probability distribution of historical returns   this becomes problematic because of changes in the definition of earnings and the recent inflation stability which has encouraged high valuations   cash flow has not been as corrupted as earnings now and might be a better indicator   this obviously is n't perfect either but returns can be improved since there is no way yet available the optimal primary strategy is still buy hold which has made the most successful investor frequently one of the richest people on the planet for decades but this could still be used as an auxiliary for cash management reserves during recessions once retired

disclaimer i am not an attorney and i have not 100 researched the law take any advise from an online forum with a grain of salt please consult an attorney tax specialist or the irs directly for any concrete answers afaik there is n't anything that would prevent you from starting a business simply owing back taxes should n't make a difference on how you make money whether that is working for yourself or someone else all the irs is concerned about at this point is that you still owe them when going through the process of forming an llc a couple of years back i do n't recall any personal tax information being brought up except when we were discussing possible loan options regarding loan options one important issue you may come into is if the irs has filed a lien against you a federal tax lien is the government ’s legal claim against your property when you neglect or fail to pay a tax debt the lien protects the government ’s interest in all your property including real estate personal property and financial assets a lien will exist on your credit report for 7 years after it is released the irs releases your lien within 30 days after you have paid your tax debt with a lien it will be very difficult to get a loan or other financing for your small business if this ends up being the case you can try to get a discharge or subordination on specific property that would allow lenders a claim on your property ahead of the irs otherwise you may find yourself relying solely on what money you currently have a big point is the irs 's threshold on filing a lien is $ 10,000 the fresh start initiative increased the irs notice of federal tax lien filing threshold from $ 5,000 to $ 10,000 however notices of federal tax liens may still be filed on amounts less than $ 10,000 when circumstances warrant since you currently owe over the past 3 years it is possible that adding another year in back taxes will cause the irs to file a lien if they have not yet already done so so it may be something to keep an eye on if you do plan on taking out a loan for your business

the hsa money is yours to keep you ca n't add new money into the account and get a tax deduction for the new money but you can spend the old money on medical expenses first log into the website for the hsa and see if you have money left this can be important because if there is still money left they might be charging you a monthly fee you should have gotten a letter from the old company or the administrator when you left the high deductible insurance plan this would have told you your options regarding the spending or transferring of old funds hsa related numbers would have appeared on your w2 and you should have a 1099-sa from the administrator it is likely that there is a copy of the 1099 on the administrators website the numbers you enter on the tax forms depends on how much you contributed from your paycheck how much your company contributed and how much you sent if any from other sources besides payroll deduction you will also have to know how much money was withdrawn from the hsa and how much was used for medical purposes the last month rule is for those people who start in the middle of the year if you start through the year you are allowed to make the maximum contribution if you still have it at the end of the year and you expect to keep it   the last month rule the last month rule states that if you are covered by an hsa eligible    health plan on the first day of the last month of a given year you    are considered an eligible individual for the entire year in turn    you can then contribute to the hsa for that full year if you are covered by an hdhp on dec 1st of a given year you may contribute the maximum for that year for example you could begin coverage and open up my hsa in november    of a given year come december 1st you are covered and per the last    month rule considered an eligible employee for that full year that    allows you to contribute up to that year ’s contribution limit even    waiting a few months to make a prior year contribution if you like    back up the truck and load up the hsa however there is a catch   the testing period the testing period states if you use the last month rule you must    remain an eligible individual covered by hdhp for the following 12    months if you fail to remain an eligible individual change insurance    plans lose insurance plan receive other health coverage any extra    contributions you made as a result of the last month rule will be    taxed and penalized if you contribute per the last month rule and end your hdhp insurance within 1 year you will have to pay tax on any excess    contributions you were allowed to make and pay a 10 penalty in this case excess contributions are determined by the    contribution limit 12 months compared to your time eligible

just look at for manufacturing and then compare population sizes   if you 've got 4x the people and you 're only producing slightly more than another country in finished goods what does that say about your manufacturing sector   is it a world beater or an also ran     also of course most of the margin for those products is realized post manufacture   selling shit to consumers is hard     also consider things like this gt;this is partly because a large share of chinese production costs consists of imports from other countries and 2010 demonstrate this by examining the production costs of an iphone in 2009 it cost about $ 179 in china to produce an iphone which sold in the united states for about $ 500 thus $ 179 of the u.s. retail cost consisted of chinese imported content however only $ was actually due to assembly costs in china the other $ reflected costs of parts produced in other countries including $ for parts made in the united states     the us adds more value to the manufacturing process of an iphone forgetting design entirely than the country that ends up with the credit for its manufacture

there are a few potential downsides but they are minor if you forget to make the payment the interest hit the following month could be significant with many cards the new charges will be charged interest from the start if the previous payment was late missed just make sure you do n't forget to pay the entire bill if the $ 5 k in monthly bills is a large portion of the credit limit for that credit card you could run into a problem with the grace period during the three weeks between when the monthly bill closes and the payment is due new charges will keep rolling in plan on needing a credit limit for the card of 2x the monthly bills of course you do n't have to wait for the due date just go online and pay the bill early if the monthly bills are a significant portion of the total credit limit for all credit cards it can decrease your credit score because of the high utilization rate   the good news is that over time the credit card company will increase your credit limit thus reducing the downsides of the last two items also keep in mind you generally ca n't pay a credit card bill or loan with a credit card but many of the other bills each month can be handled this way

first congratulations on the paycheck   on the holds is it possible that by allowing your account balance to go negative into overdraft that you triggered such treatment of your account   perhaps the bank is being more cautious with your account since that happened   just how long did you have their $ 150 on hold   or perhaps it 's not you specifically but the bank is being more cautious due to credit conditions that have been prevalent these last years   consider allowing you to cash a check immediately when it technically has n't cleared yet is a form of credit   maybe it is n't you they do n't trust well enough yet but the company that issued the check   checks bounce and not by fault of the depositor i once had a new account years ago and discovered a 5 day hold on deposits   the irony was it was a check drawn on the same bank   i called my banker and asked about it and suggested i 'd take my business back to my old bank   i was in the process of applying for a mortgage with the new bank   holds were removed but you may have some trouble with the i 'll walk technique given the climate and your recent overdraft situation and no leverage or if you do have some leverage consider using it but before you assume anything i would as johnfx suggested ask your bank about it   pay your branch a visit in person and talk to the manager   phone calls to customer service may be less successful   if it 's not a big issue and more a minor technical policy one the bank may remove the holds   if they wo n't the manager ought to tell you why and what you can do to solve it eventually

i am surprised no one has mentioned the two biggest things in my opinion   or i should say the two biggest things to me   first 1099 have to file quarterly self employment taxes   i do not know for certain but i have heard that often times you will end up paying more this way then even a w-2 employees   second an llc allows you to deduct business expenses off the top prior to determining what you pay in taxes as pass through income   with 1099 you pay the same taxes regardless of your business expenses unless they are specifically allowed as a 1099 contractor which most are not i believe   so what you should really do is figure out the expense you incur as a result of doing your business and check with an accountant to see if those expenses would be deductible in an llc and if it offsets a decent amount of your income to see if it would be worth it   but i have read a lot of books and listened to a lot of interviews about wealthy people and most deal in companies not contracts   most would open a new business and add clients rather than dealing in 1099 contracts   just my two cents good luck and much prosperity

right so the fundamental question is if the roll over will cause short term interest rates to decouple from the fed 's say so   this is otherwise known as a bond auction failure   the fed wants the treasury debt off their books but they do n't want to raise interest rates to make that happen   so they 're going to experiment with outside of the fed to see if they can boil the   if the starts to i guarantee you that they 're going to take the pot off the   at their the proposed roll over suspension rate it 'll take approximately 12 to 16 years to to get that two trillion off their books and that assumes that nothing bad happens during that time   gt do you know of any good that would back your side   the closest you 're going to find would be anything written about the post 1995 but it looks like their program of direct stock market participation technically they 're using etfs probably for financial cryptography purposes began in earnest in news articles/2017 07 head turns surprise critic of etf purchases   this piece indicates that the japanese are n't the only ones doing this   england the swiss and even the eu is doing the same thing across multiple exchanges   as the article points out there 's a two effect of suppressing fx stock price correlations strengthening or weakening of currencies raising or lowering stocks listed on associated and reducing volatility through market intervention aka plunge protection teams    they also reference an survey of   central bank reserve managers

one way to value companies is to use a dividend discount model in substance it consists in estimating future dividends and calculating their present value so it is a methodology which considers that an equity is similar to a bond and estimates its current value based on future cash flows a company may not be paying dividends now but because its future earnings prospects are good may pay some in the future in that case the model will give a non zero value to that stock if on the other hand you think a company wo n't ever make any profits and therefore never pay any dividends then it 's probably worth 0 take microsoft as an example it currently pays ~3 dividend per annum the stock has been listed since 1986 and yet it did not pay any dividends until 2003 but the stock has been rising regularly since the beginning because people had priced in the fact that there was a high chance that the company would become very profitable which proved true in the long term + 60,000 including dividends since the ipo

a bona fide company never needs your credit card details certainly not your on back of card to issue a refund   on an older charge they might have to work with their merchant provider   but they should be able to do it within the credit card handling system and in fact are required to   asking for details via email does n't pass the sniff test either   to get a credit card merchant account a company needs to go through a security assessment process called pci security gets into you pretty good   of course they could be using one of the dumbed down services like square but those services make refunds ridiculously easy    how did you come to be corresponding on this email address   did they initially contact you   did you find it on a third party website   some of those are fraudulent and many others like yelp it 's very easy to insert false contact information for a business consumer forums even moreso   you might take another swing at finding a proper contact for the company   stop asking for a cheque   that also the credit card system   and obviously a scammer wo n't send a check at least not one you 'd want   if all else fails call your bank and tell them you want to do a chargeback on that transaction   this is where the bank to reverse the charge   it 's rather straightforward especially if the merchant has agreed in principle to a refund but requires some paperwork or e paperwork    do n't chargeback lightly   do n't use it casually or out of laziness or unwillingness to speak with the merchant e.g. to cancel an order   the bank charges the merchant a $ 20 or larger investigation fee separate from the refund   each chargeback is also a strike too many strikes and the merchant is barred from taking credit cards it 's serious business    as a merchant i would never send a cheque to an angry customer   because if i did they 'd cash the cheque and still do a chargeback so then i 'd be out the money twice plus the investigation fee to boot

it may have been the standard practice for a long time and indeed it still is the common practice for my credit union to apply all excess payment directly to the principal at the risk of sounding a little cynical i will suggest that there is a profit motive in the move to not applying excess payments to principal unless directly instructed to do so interest accrued is n't reduced until the principal is reduced so it benefits the creditor to both have the money in advance and to not apply it to the principal you should probably move forward with the expectation that all of your creditors are even if only in a passive aggressive manner

the total limit book is a composite of all the orders on all of the exchanges while it 's uncommon for a limit order posted beyond the nbbo to fill outside of the nbbo it does occur for example the best ask may be on exchange x but for some reason the smart order routing algorithm may select exchange y if it judges the net trade to be less costly etc and hfts will immediately arbitrage the order between two exchanges or the best order on exchange x disappears causing the order to fill above the nbbo the system is n't perfect because there are multiple exchanges but that eventuality is extremely rare with equities since nearly every exchange will have orders posted at the nbbo because exchange equity fee and rebate schedules are extremely competitive nearly identical   it is however more common with options since less exchanges as a percentage of the total will have orders posted at the nbbo because of very wide exchange rebate and fee schedules how a single exchange handles a new order that crosses an existing limit order is already addressed here how do exchanges match limit orders
