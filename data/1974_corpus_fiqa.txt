another factor to consider beyond the fact that growth and volatility go together is that the times when many people will need to liquidate their investments will correlate with the times that many other people need to liquidate their investments and such correlation will push down the immediate value of those investments while certificates of deposit have penalties for early withdrawal one can establish up front what the worst case penalty would be for cashing it in at the most inopportune time   by contrast stocks offer no such assurance   stocks sometimes have weird downward spikes that may be short lived but if life circumstances force one to liquidate stocks during such a downward spike the penalty can be much larger than on a cd

by living in sweden and having a swedish personal identification number you are required to declare your entire worldwide income for tax purposes with the swedish tax authorities it would seem to not make any difference if some of that income is kept outside of sweden a company that has no permanent base of operations within sweden should not deduct any preliminary taxes for an employee that lives in sweden rather the employee should apply for special a tax sa tax status and pay the taxes that had the company had a permanent base of operations in sweden the company would have paid the information available on the tax authority 's web site in english seems limited but the relevant page in swedish in your situation is very likely fast i there is a summary at paying taxes for individuals particularly do note the summary section when staying for at least six months you are considered as resident in sweden for tax purposes and are liable for taxation in sweden on all of your worldwide income you must also file a swedish income tax return your tax return must be filed no later than may 2nd of the year after the fiscal year as well as that if you stay in sweden for a continuous period of at least six months you are considered to be resident in sweden as a resident you are liable for taxation in sweden on all of your worldwide income in some cases a tax treaty with with your ordinary country of residence   may limit the swedish taxation for a more detailed answer including which exact forms you need to fill out and what data is needed i strongly recommend that you either contact they are usually quite nice to deal with and they tend to realize that everyone benefits from getting the tax paperwork and payments right from the beginning or find an attorney specializing in swedish tax law they even point out themselves that my emphasis the practical applications of these rules are relatively complicated and for more information you can contact the tax information at

i think what those articles are saying is if you want to leave some money to charity and some to relatives do n't a roth to charity while taxable accounts to relatives   in other words it 's not bad to leave a roth ira to charity it 's just not as good as giving it to humans if there are humans you want to give money to in your situation the total amount you want to leave to relatives is less than the value of your roth   so it sounds like the advice as it applies to you is do n't leave your relatives $ 30 k from your taxable funds while leaving the whole roth to charity   instead leave $ 30 k of your roth to your relatives while leaving all the taxable funds to charity along with the leftover $ 20 k of the roth   in other words the roth is a last resort for charitable giving only give away roth money to charity if you already gave humans all the money you want to give them   i 'm unsure of the details of how you would actually designate portions of the roth for different beneficiaries but some googling suggests it is possible

disclaimer this should go without saying but this answer is definitely an opinion i 'm pretty sure my current accountant would agree with this answer and i 'm also pretty sure that one of my past accountants would disagree when i started my own small business over 10 years ago i asked this very same question for pretty much every purchase i made that would be used by both the business and me personally i was and naive then and i just assumed everything was deductible until my accountant could prove otherwise at some point you need to come up with some rules of thumb to help make sense of it or else you 'll drive yourself and your accountant here is one of the rules i like to use in this scenario if you never would have made the purchase for personal use and if you    must purchase it for business use and if using    it for personal use does not increase the expense to the business it    can be fully deducted by the business even if you sometimes use it personally too here are some example implementations of this rule note about partial expenses i did n't mention partial deductions above because i do n't feel it applies when the criteria of my rule of thumb is met note that the irs states personal versus business expenses generally you can not deduct personal living or family expenses however if you have an expense for something that is used partly for business and partly for personal purposes divide the total cost between the business and personal parts you can deduct the business part at first read that makes it sound like some of my examples above would need to be split into partial however i think the key distinction is that you would never have made the purchase for personal use and that the cost to the business does not increase because of allowing personal use partial deductions come into play when you have a shared car or office or something where the business cost is increased due to shared use in general i try to avoid anything that would be a partial expense though i do allow my business to reimburse me for mileage when i lend it my personal car for business use

there are 2 primary ways to bet against a stock if you think it will decline the first is to short sell shares of that stock the second is to buy put options i would also add that selling naked call options would also be a bet against but i do n't believe that is as common as the other 2 mentioned methods the problem with short selling an ipo is that you first have to borrow the shares you are going to sell since the shares are privately held prior to the ipo that can be problematic even after the ipo you may have to wait a bit before shares become available to borrow   the problem with options either buying puts or seeking naked calls is similar options are traded on a different exchange than the stock and they have their own requirements that a stock must meet to have options traded both of these problems eventually correct themselves however not in time for you to catch the initial fall you seem to be looking for

i will use 10 of this 20 k to pay the loan back on an annual basis agreement an annual payment of 0.8 $ 2,000 $ 250,000 is nowhere near large enough   the interest alone is going to be well over $ 10,000 and probably closer to $ 20,000 on an unsecured loan so you need to plan for at least a $ 20,000 $ 30,000 annual payment depending on the terms length and interest rate on the loan    but in general is this sustainable safe   essentially what you are doing is using leverage to increase the amount you can invest   while this is fantastic when the market rises it can go horribly wrong when the market goes down   generally it is unwise to fund a risky meaning there are large swings in return investment with a risk free meaning you 'll always make a payment loan if you want to see what could happen forecast a 20 market drop and see what you are left with obviously you 'll need to make the loan payment out of your balance since you wo n't have any gains to pull from   an average of 10 12 over a long period of time is reasonable but the variance can cause the return to be anywhere from to + 40 in one year   can you afford those losses    here 's an actual example if you were to invest $ 250,000 in the s&p 500 in january 2000 with an 8 interest only loan your next three years returns would be after three years assuming an interest only payment of $ 20,000 your balance would be just over $ 100,000 you 'd still owe $ 250,000 and you 'd still be making $ 20,000 in interest payments   if your loan interest rate was 25 which is not unreasonable for an unsecured loan you 'd be bankrupt after 3 years you 'd still owe $ 250 k but could not make the interest payment no this is not a good idea   the only time you should borrow money to invest in when you have control over the returns   so if you wanted to start your own business had a stable business plan and had much more certainty over the returns the borrowing money might be plausible    but borrowing money to do passive investment is a huge mistake

make sure you are paid on volume not people   almost all companies have a requirement to recruit a certain number of others   that 's not bad it ensures the company continues to grow without having to pay advertising and training costs   that 's what the commissions are for   the largest cost of distributing a product outside of mlm is advertising and marketing   if i remember correctly this adds up to about 66 of the cost of the product   if that 's true an mlm has quite a bit of money available to pay commissions and still have their products remain relatively competitive but when all is said and done you should be paid on volume just like a sales manager position in a company   a sales manager has to hire and train a sales staff but once they are out producing the manager is paid a percentage based on the volume of their sales staff   if an mlm is setup the same way then this is good   if they are setup to pay on recruiting people then run away as quickly as you can the biggest problem with recruiting is not whether or not you can do it   it 's whether or not the people you recruit can do it i have been involved with an mlm of sorts for 10 years   it pays a nice continual flow of income   i worked it hard for about 6 years and have ever since   the problem was attrition   it was greater than i ever imagined   it became very   i never have and never will be a high pressure person   i would show them the business and if they were interested great if not great   the problem was that people became interested but did n't have the skills to be successful   i should never have let them join the business   so they leave the business and say that mlm is bad   no it just was n't right for them or they were n't right for it regardless of what business you join make sure that you believe that everyone you introduce to the business has the ability to do the same thing you are doing   if they do great otherwise do n't even show it to them

etf creation and redemption process notes the process while etf trading occurs on an exchange like stocks the process by    which their shares are created is significantly different unless a    company decides to issue more shares the supply of shares of an    individual stock trading in the marketplace is finite when demand    increases for shares of an etf however authorized participants aps    have the ability to create additional shares on demand through an in kind transfer mechanism aps create etf units in the    primary market by delivering a basket of securities to the fund equal    to the current holdings of the etf in return they receive a large    block of etf shares typically 50,000 which are then available for    trading in the secondary market this etf creation and redemption    process helps keep etf supply and demand in continual balance and    provides a hidden layer of liquidity not evident by looking at    trading volumes alone this process also works in reverse if an investor wants to sell a    large block of shares of an etf even if there seems to be limited    liquidity in the secondary market aps can readily redeem a block of    etf shares by gathering enough shares of the etf to form a creation    unit and then exchanging the creation unit for the underlying    securities thus the in kind swap to the underlying securities is only done by aps so the outflow would be these individuals taking a large block of the etf and swapping it for the underlying securities   the aps would be taking advantage of the difference between what the etf 's trading value and the value of the underlying securities

the question states our insurance company is offering a 30 discount on an $    commercial policy if we install the insurance is paid in    two installments this appears to mean six monthly payments so i 'll make some comparison calculations using six monthly loan repayments to keep things simple without the loan or the insurance costs $ 4100 every six months using this loan payment formula the calculation below shows with the 30 discounted insurance maintenance and loan repayment you would be paying $ every six months   the discount required to break even is   i.e. rearranging the equation   alternatively with the discount of 30 you would break even if the six monthly repayment amount was $   solving the payment equation for s gives an equation for the loan   so with the 30 discount you would break even if the loan required was $ checking by back calculating the periodic payment amount a   likewise we can keep the loan at $ 40000 and solve for t to find the break even loan term   note in this formula log denotes the natural logarithm   now we can set some values   so with break even payments the $ 40000 loan is paid off in just under years   i.e. checking   this just beats the $ 4100 cost of proceeding without the notes if your loan repayment was monthly it would reduce the cost of the loan slightly   the periodic interest rate is calculated from the apr according to the method used in the eu and in some cases in us   the calculations above were run using mathematica

how is that possible the mutual fund does n't pay taxes and passes along the tax bill to shareholders via distributions would be the short answer your basis likely changed as now you have bought more shares but i gained absolutely nothing from my dividend so how is it    taxable the fund has either realized capital gains dividends interest or some other form of income that it has to pass along to shareholders as the fund does n't pay taxes itself did i get screwed the first year because i bought into the fund too    late in the year perhaps if you do n't notice that your cost basis has changed here so that you 'll have lower taxes when you sell your shares   is anyone familiar with what causes this kind of situation of    receiving a taxable dividend that does n't actually increase the    account balance yes i am rather familiar with this the point to understand is that the fund does n't pay taxes itself but passes this along the shareholders that hold funds in tax advantaged accounts like 401ks and iras still get the distribution but are shielded from paying taxes on those gains at that point at time is it because i bought too late in the year   no it is because you did n't know the fund would have a distribution of that size that year some funds can have negative returns yet still have a capital gains distribution if the fund experiences enough redemptions that the fund had to sell appreciated shares in a security this is part of the risk in having stock funds in taxable accounts or is it because the fund had a negative return that year   no it is because you do n't understand how mutual funds and taxes work along with what distribution schedule the fund had do i wait until after the distribution date this year to buy i 'd likely consider it for taxable accounts yes however if you are buying in a tax advantaged account then there is n't that same issue

putting a dollar amount on the valuation of a start up business is an art form that often has very little at all to do with any real numbers and more to do with your salesman abilities when talking with the vc that said there are a few starting points first is past sales the cost of those sales and a hopefully realistic growth curve   however you do n't have that so this gets harder do you have any actual assets   machinery computers desks patents etc   things that you actually own   if so then add those in   if this is a software start up code is an asset but without sales it 's incredibly hard to put a value on it   the best i 've come up with is how much would it cost for someone else to build it after they 've seen yours   yes you may have spent 5,000 hours building something but could someone else duplicate it or at least the major parts in 200 hours after seeing a demo   use the lower number if i was you i 'd look hard at my business plan   hopefully you were as honest as you can be when writing it and that it is as researched as possible   what is it going to take to get that first sale   what do you actually need to get there hint your logo on the side of a building is not a necessary expense   nor is really nice office space   once you have that first sale what is the second going to take   can you extrapolate out to 3 years   how many key members are there   how much is their contribution worth   at what point will you be profitable    next is to look at risks   you have n't done this before that 's huge i 'm assuming simply because you asked this question   another is competitors hopefully they already exist because opening a new market is incredibly hard and expensive on the flip side hopefully there are n't that many because entering a crowded market is equally hard and expensive   note each are possible but take radically different approaches and sums of money and $ 200k is n't going to cut it no matter what it is you are selling that said competition should be able to at least point you in the direction of a price point and estimate for how long sales take   if any are publicly traded then you have additional info to help you set a valuation   are there any potential regulatory or legal issues what happens if a key member leaves dies or is otherwise no longer available   insurance only helps so much if the one guy that knows everything literally gets run over   god help you if this person likes to go i bring risks up because you will have to them during this negotiation   for example asking for $ 200k with zero hard assets while trying to sell software to government agencies assuming a 3 week sales cycle will have you laughed at for naivety   whereas asking for $ 10 m in the same situation with a team that has governmental sales experience would likely work another big question is exit strategy do you intend to ipo or sell to a competitor or a business in a related category   if selling do you have evidence that the target company actually buys others and if so how did those deals work out   what did they look for in order to buy   exit strategy is huge to a vc and they will want to make several multiples of their money back in a relatively short amount of time   can you realistically support that for how much you are asking for   if not then going through an angel group would be better   they have similar questions but very different expectations the main thing is that no one knows what your business is worth because it is 100 unproven after 2 years and is therefore a huge financial risk   if the money you are asking for is to complete product development then that risk factor just went up radically as you are n't even talking about sales   if the money is purely for the sales channel then it 's likely not enough however if you know what it 's going to take to get that first sale and have at least an educated idea on how much it 's going to cost to repeat that then you should have an idea for how much money you want   from there you need to decide how much of the business it is worth to you to give up in order to get that money and voila you have a pre money valuation the real trick will be to convince the vc that you are right which takes research and a rock solid presentation and negotiating from there   no matter what offer a small percentage of the business for the money you want and realize you 'll likely give up much more than that a few things you should know usually by year 3 it 's apparent if a start up is going to work out or not   you 're in year 2 with no sales that does n't look good unless you are building a physical product have a competent team with hard experience doing this have patents at least filed a proven test product and hopefully have a few pre orders and just need cash to deliver   although in that situation i 'd probably tell you to ask your friends and family before talking to a vc   even would be better    $ 200k just is n't a lot of money and should be very easy to raise from friends or angels   if you ca n't then that speaks volumes to an institutional vc   a plus is having two or three people financially invested in the company more than that is sometimes a problem while having only 1 is a red flag if it 's a web thing and you 've been doing this for 2 years with zero sales and still need another $ 200k to complete it then i 'd say you need to take a hard look at what you 've built and take it to market right now   if you ca n't do that then i 'd say it might be time to abandon this idea and move on as you 'll likely have to give up 80%+ to get that $ 200k and most vcs i 've run into would n't bother at that level   which begs the question how did the conversation with the vc start   did you approach them or did they approach you   if the latter how did they even find out about you   do they actually know anything about you or is this a fishing expedition   if the latter then this is probably a complete waste of your time the above is only a rough guide because at the end of the day something is only worth what someone else is willing to pay   $ 200k in cash is a tiny sum for most vcs so without more information i have no clue why one would be interested in you i put a number of hard questions and statements in here   i do n't actually want you to answer me those are for you to think about   also none of this should n't be taken as a rather it should shock you into a realistic viewpoint and hopefully help you understand how others are going to see your baby    if the vc has done a bit of research and is actually interested in investing then they will bring up all the same things and likely more in order to convince you to give up a very large part of it   the question you have to ask yourself is is it worth it   sometimes it is often it 's not

the two things are materially different point number 1   with a credit card the bank and card network earn a fee every time you spend on your card   you swipe a $ 100 dinner the credit card company makes about $ 3   you pay it back they may not make any interest but they 've made their $ 3   additionally if you have a $ 1,000,000 credit limit you 've only actually borrowed $ 100 which brings me to point number 2    point number 2   a credit limit of $ x is not in any way the same as a loan for $ x.   when you seek a personal loan the lender hands you money in equal amount to your loan less any origination fees that may apply   your loan for $ 8,000 results in $ 8,000 being wired to your account   your credit limit is only a loan when you actually charge something   until then its a simple adjustable risk limit set by the bank 's underwriters point number 3   your credit report contains no income information   it 's up to the lender to determine what sort of risk they 're willing to take   some personal lenders are just fine with stated income and employer contact information   some lenders want to see some pay stubs   some lenders will lend $ x on stated income but wo n't lend $ x+1 without income verification   some will lend the money at a lower interest rate if you do prove your income and employment   it 's all lender specific   credit card issuers are clearly lax on the income verification piece of the equation because of points number 1 and 2 point number 4   if you 're getting a loan for your required mortgage down payment you are a much bigger repayment risk than you realize

since all the other answers thus far seem to the risk likelihood of the money being seized i figure i may as well make my comment an answer unless you happen to have your legal team travelling with you and your suitcase of cash you should expect that you 'll be questioned extensively so that any sign of in your answers or anything you say that does n't make sense to the officer will be used as an excuse to seize your money and you 'll learn an expensive lesson in civil asset forfeiture the government will file a complaint against your money leading to a ridiculously named case such as united states v. $ in u.s. currency worth noting that while the outcome in this case was not in the government 's favor in the vast majority of cases the government keeps the cash between 9/11 and 2014 u.s police forces have seized over 2.5 billion dollars in cash without search warrants or and returned the money in less than 10 of cases   that last link is kind of a long read but contains cases where people with completely legitimate money and documentation for their money had it seized anyway and were only able to recover it after months or years in court

there are several ways to protect against or even profit from a market correction hedge funds do this by hedging that is buying a stock that they think is strong and selling short a paired stock that is weak if you hold say a strong retail company in your portfolio you might sell short an equal weight of a weak retail company   these are like buying insurance on your portfolio if you own 300 shares of xyz currently trading at $ 68 you buy puts at a level at a strike price that lets you sleep at night for example you might buy 3 xyz 6-month puts with a strike price of $ 60 a disadvantage is that the puts are wasting assets that is their time premium which you paid for at the outset becomes zero at expiration this is why it is like insurance you would n't complain that your insurance premium was lost when you purchase insurance on your house and the house does n't burn down would you of course not the purpose of the insurance is to protect your investment note that as these puts are married they only protect your portfolio instead of profiting from a correction you would merely protect your portfolio during a correction no small feat if your portfolio is similar to the market you can buy s&p index puts if your market reflects a lot of technology you can buy technology sector puts   say you have a portfolio of $ 80 k that reflects the market you could buy out of the market puts again reflecting your tolerance for loss any losses in your portfolio after the puts go in the money would be more or less offset by gains in the puts   an advantage is that the bid ask spread is smaller for the s&p. you would pay less for the protection also the s&p puts are cash settled meaning you get money put in your account on the business day after expiration day a disadvantage is that the puts do not linearly go up as the market drops delta hedging is a big deal in and of itself another disadvantage is that they are wasting assets see the married puts section previous while the s&p puts can be used to maintain your market portfolio in the midst of a correction you could purchase more puts than needed if you had correctly timed the market then your portfolio with puts would increase your mileage may vary some have predicted an imminent market crash way too often collars involve selling out of the money calls and using the premiums to buy out of the money puts there are many varieties of collars but the most straightforward is to sell 1 call and buy 1 put for every 100 shares this can also be done for index puts and calls this has the effect of simultaneously you get your insurance for almost free but again it is protecting your portfolio   as the name implies you make money when the market goes bearish   bear put spreads involve buying puts at a close strike price and selling an equal number of puts at a lower strike price than the first you have a defined maximum loss the premium you paid for the higher put minus the premium you received for the lower put you have a defined maximum gain the difference between strikes minus the defined maximum loss   buy s&p 500 index puts if you buy deep out of the money puts it wo n't cost much but you have little probability of it paying off but if they go in the money there could be a sizable payoff this is similar to putting one chip on red 18 on the roulette wheel but rather than paying off it is a variable payoff if you 're $ 1 in the money you just get $ 100 if you 're $ 12 in the money you have a $ 1200 payoff   if you buy at the money puts it will cost a lot and your probability will be about 1 in 2 that you will pay off in our roulette analogy this is like putting 30 chips on the even bet of the roulette wheel the variable payoff is as in the previous paragraph but you 're more likely to get a payoff and you will lose it all of the roulette ball lands on an odd number 0 or 00 that is the underlying of your put goes up or stays the same if your research shows you what good stocks to buy it may also tell you which stocks are ripe for a fall you could short sell these stocks or buy puts on them   similar to short selling stocks or buying puts you could sell short overpriced sectors or buy puts on them there are etfs that will allow you benefit from falling prices without needing to have a margin agreement or options agreement in place   sorry to have a lengthy answer many other answers emphasize that one should n't try to time the market but that is not the op 's question provided here are both

in general no if you just have one employer and work there with the same salary for the whole year   typically an employer does tax withholding by your monthly income to the entire year and withholding the right amount so that at the end what is withheld is what you owe   it 's not a surprise to them when your income crosses a tax bracket threshold because they knew how much they were paying you and knew when you would cross into another bracket so they factored that in if you have multiple jobs or only worked for part of the year or if your income varied from month to month e.g. you got a raise there could be a discrepancy between what is withheld and what you owe because each employer only knows about what it 's paying you not what money you may have earned from other sources   even here though the discrepancy would n't be due to the tax brackets per se   you can adjust your withholdings on form w-4 if needed to tell the employer to withhold more or less than they otherwise would

not always you always consider economic factors in conjunction with each other rather than in isolation which leads to weird assumptions people spending is n't what you should look at always when inflation is high means government is spending government is spending on public projects creating employment increasing salaries out loans so you are putting money into the economy and into people 's hands everybody will be spending so it will also drive pull inflation but there are differences among economists regarding cost push inflation which is a dangerous phenomena at the same time the interest rates which are a monetary tool for central banks to the money flow in the economy are low under low interest rate conditions businesses take loans to invest in projects because interest rates are low people find it logical to spend now than spend later as interest rates are low there is an expectation that they can not earn more in savings than investing in products which will generate benefits in the near term these all goes on in cycles and after a period of inflation you will see government taking action to rein in inflation it will increase interest rates to suck money out of the economy this is when people will curb spending because they know they will earn a higher return while saving rather than investing

in my opinion it generally makes sense to focus all of your debt reduction energy and funds on one loan at a time there are two reasons for this it will allow you to more quickly move from 4 loans to 3 loans and then 2 and then 1 providing you with a sense of progress and motivation as you reduce the number of loans that you have your monthly minimum payment obligations will be reduced   then if you have a month with an emergency expense you will have more income available to you for your emergency without getting behind on your loans there is debate about whether to pay loans in order of the loan balance or in order of interest rate you can read about this here and here but in your case your highest interest loans also have the lowest balance so either method would have you picking the same loans first    you have already chosen wisely to start with the $ 1500 6.8 loans   send all of your $ 1000 to one of these loans and continue to work aggressively to knock out all four as quickly as possible

if one takes a slightly more expansive view of the word saving to include most forms of durable asset accumulation i think the reason some do and most do n't is a matter of a few factors i will include the three that seem obvious to me education most schools in the us where i live do not offer personal finance courses and even when they do there is no opportunity for a student to practice good financial habits in that classroom setting i think a simple assignment that required students to track every penny that they spend over the period of a few months would help them open their eyes to how much money is spent on trivial things that they do n't need perhaps this would be more effective in a university setting where the students are usually away from home and therefore more responsible for the spending that occurs on their own behalf beyond simple education about personal finances most people have no clue how the various financial markets work if they understood they would not allow inflation to eat away at their savings but that 's a separate topic from why people do not save culture since much of the education above is n't happening children get their primary financial education from their parents this means that those who are wealthy teach their children how to be wealthy and those who are poor pass on their habits to children who often also end up poor erroneous ideas about consumption vs. investment and its economic effects also causes some bad policy encouraging people to live beyond their means and use credit unwisely but if you live in a country where the average person expects to eat out regularly and trade in their automobiles as soon as they experienced their highest rate of depreciation it can be hard to recognize bad financial behavior for what it is collective savings rates reflect a lot of individuals who are each other 's bad behavior discipline even when someone is educated about finances they may not establish good habits of budgeting regularly tracking spending and setting financial goals for me it helps to be married to someone who has similar financial goals because we budget monthly and any major purchases over $ 100 or so must be agreed upon at the beginning of the month with obvious exceptions for emergencies this eliminates any impulsive spending which is probably 90 of the battle for me some people do not need to account to someone else in order to spend wisely but everyone should find a system that works for them and helps them to maintain some financial discipline

that really depends on the lender and in the current climate this is extremely unlikely in the past it was possible to get a loan which is higher than the value of the house deposit considered usually on the basis that the buyer is going to improve the property extend renovate etc and this increase the value of the property responsible lenders required some evidence of the plans to do this but less responsible ones simply seem to have given the money here in the uk this was often based on the assumption that property value tends to rise relatively quickly anyway so a seemingly reasonable addition to the loan on top of the current value of the property will quickly be covered that meant that indeed some people have been able to get a loan which is higher than the cost of the purchase even without concrete plans to actively increase the value of the property today the situation is quite different lenders are a lot more careful and i ca n't see this happening all that aside had it been possible is it a good idea i find it difficult to come up with a blanket rule it really depends on many factors   on the one hand   mortgage interest rates tend to be significantly lower than shorter term interest rates and from that point of view it makes sense right however they are usually very long term often with limited ability to overpay which means the interest will be paid over a longer period of time

i used to work for one of the three ratings agencies awhile ago first there are lots of different ratings the bulk of ratings are for corporate debt and public finance so senior debentures fixed income and general obligations e.g. tax free muni bonds respectively ratings agencies are not paid by the investment banks they are paid by the corporations   or state that is issuing debt the investment banks are the syndicate that pulls the transaction together and brings it to market   for mortgage backed securities collateralized debt cdo clo 's all of which are fancy structured securitizations well that is a different matter those   transactions are the ones where there is an close tie between the investment bankers and ratings agencies and those were the ratings that blew out and caused problems   ratings agencies continued to do a decent job with what was their traditional business corporate and municipal bond ratings as far as i know    what said was 100 correct s&amp;p 's fees were paid by investors the people who were purchasing the bonds until about 50 years ago around the same time that hill purchased s&amp;p in 1966 they from that model and started charging the bond issuers for ratings i do n't know if that decision was driven by hill or not though   one more thing not all credit ratings agencies are paid by the issuers one of the 10 's a designation given by the is jones their revenue comes from the investors bond purchasers not the companies issuing bonds unlike the moody 's business model so there is an alternative which i consider hopeful and reason not to totally despair   edit what mentions is also totally accurate the part about roubini who is a professor at or columbia or such and a sensible though slightly high sort is consistent with my impression as for whether it would require government action to implement the changes advocated by roubini yes i guess it would but i do n't know if the government would do that it would be better if the credit ratings agencies would find their own way to a different less conflicted payment incentive model   keep in mind too that many of the provisions of dodd frank have removed the existing regulatory requirements for credit ratings on bonds and other securities this is the scary part though there is n't anything to replace the credit ratings agencies not at the moment as far as i can tell eventually the government is supposed to come up with an alternative but that has n't happened yet which is better not requiring ratings at all or the past situation of sometimes inflated ratings which a false sense of confidence i do n't know

patience has never been my strong suit unfortunately this is what you need to build up credit the activities that increase your credit score are paying your bills on time and not using too much of the available credit that you do have the rest age of accounts recent pulls etc are short term indicators that indicate changes in behavior that will make lenders pause and understand what the reasons behind the events are also keep in mind that your credit score should n't run your life   it should be a passive indicator of your financial habits not something that you actively manipulate    is there anything i can do to raise my score without having to take out a loan with interest pay your bills on time and do n't take out more credit than you need   you 're already in the excellent category so there 's no reason to panic or try to manipulate it   even if you temporarily dip below if you need to make a big purchase house your loan to value and debt income ratio will be much bigger factors in what interest rate you can get   as far as the bofa card goes if you do n't need it cancel it   it might cause a temporary dip in your credit but it will go away quickly and you 're better off not having credit cards that you do n't need

gt;the question is more like do we want it   i agree that 's the issue and without doing more research i think it would be a good thing currently it makes almost no sense to hire a woman over a man other things equal due to pregnancy risk reducing some of maternity leave and making some paternity leave mandatory would reduce the disparity between obviously women can breast feed and are more crucial to baby than men in most cases so they should still have more leave time but men can play a part sometime after pregnancy   men taking leave currently does n't make as much sense since they generally make more than women however making leave mandatory can also help reduce wage disparity if it exists which is debated nonetheless i do n't see a way in which it can possible increase disparity    increasing equality is n't done just for the sake of equality it is actually beneficial for the economy women are probably in the work force and eliminating biological differences makes the other factors much more important for them intelligence competence etc in addition women may focus more on their careers if they know a pregnancy does n't completely stall them relative to men and that they are less expected to be primary children this creates a more competitive and productive workforce as a whole   however making men take time off obviously reduces productivity a certain amount as they ca n't work so you would have to weigh the pros and cons here carefully which would be quite difficult in addition it would be quite lame to force a healthy willing individual to stop working simply because his spouse has a child even if his spouse wants to be the primary caregiver that too can be harmful for mens careers and may possibly reduce the imagine a ceo or manager having to take forced paternity leave when his wife has a baby that can be a career killer in upper management

the ruble was is and will be very unstable because of unstable political situation in russia and the economy strongly dependent of the export of raw resources what you can do i assume you want to minimize risk the best way to achieve that is to make your savings in some stable currency euro and swiss franc are currently very stable currencies so storing your surpluses in them is a very good option if you want to keep your money safe to prevent political risk you should keep your money in countries with stable political regime which are unlikely to nationalize the savings of the citizens in predictable future as for your existing savings in rubles it 's a hard deal i assume as the web developer you have a plenty of money which have lost a lot of value if you convert them to euro or francs you will the current value after the loss you 'll safe them ruble falling down but in case the ruble will return to previous value you 'll loose   keeping savings in currencies is however speculation like investing in gold etc so if you can mentally accept the loss and want to sleep good convert them you have also option to invest in properties for example buy an extra appartment it 's a good way to deal with financial surplus in europe in us however you should be aware in it 's connected with the political risk the real estates can be confiscated in any moment by the state and you ca n't run away with it the savings can also be confiscated but there 's a fair chance you 'll manage to rescue them if you act quickly

the answer is yes and the reason is if today 's interest rates are lower than the interest rate coupon at which the bond was issued the bond 's lifetime value is 100 cents on the dollar that 's the principal repayment that the investor will get on the maturity date but suppose the bond 's coupon rate is 4 while today 's interest rate is 3 then people who bought the bond at 100 would get 4 on their money while everyone else was getting 3 to compensate a three year bond would have to rise to almost 103 so that the so called yield to maturity would be 3 then there would be a capital loss from almost 103 to 100 that would exactly offset the extra interest that is 1 more for three years if today 's interest rates are negative as they were from time to time in the 1930s and in the present decade the negative interest rates will prevent the buyer from getting the lifetime value as defined by the op of principal plus interest over the original life of the bond this happens in a flight to quality situation where people are willing to take a small capital loss on treasuries in order to prevent a large possible loss from bank failures like those that took place in 2008

this type of structured product is called a capital protection product   it 's like an insurance product where you give up some upside for protection against losses in certain cases    from the bank 's perspective they take your investment treat it as an interest free loan and buy derivatives like options that give them an expected return greater then   they make their money with this product you are giving up some potential upside in order to protect against losses other than catastrophic losses if the lower index drops by 50 or more    what 's the catch there 's not really a catch it 's a lot like insurance you might come out ahead e.g. if the market goes down less than 50 but you might also give up some upside   the bank will sell enough of these in various flavors to reduce their risk overall losses in your product will be covered by gains in another note that this product wo n't necessarily sell for $ 1,000 you might have to pay $ 1,100 or $ or whatever the bank can get people to buy them for for each note whenever it 's released   that 's where the gain or loss comes into play   if you pay $ 1,100 but only get $ 1,000 back because the index did n't go up or went down you 'd have a net loss of $ 100 it 's subtle but it is in the prospectus the estimated value of the notes is only an estimate determined by reference to several factors   the original issue price of the notes will     exceed the estimated value of the notes because costs associated with selling structuring and hedging the notes are included in the original issue price of the notes   these costs include the selling commissions the projected profits if any that our affiliates expect to realize for assuming risks inherent in hedging our obligations under the notes and the estimated cost of hedging our obligations under the notes

the diversification offered by the advisor can easily be at vanguard with something like the ivy portfolio simplify it or complicate it to your liking with vanguard index reits index stock funds international bond etc set up automatic contributions and do n't watch your money like a hawk set it and forget it or maybe rebalance your holdings once a year the main thing advisors are good for at your level of assets is investors to stay in the market during a crash most investors will sell after a crash and completely miss out on the rebound it 's human nature to be a terrible market timer but if you can really promise yourself never to sell in a panic then you do n't need an advisor at your asset level fees like 1.25 sound like a okay deal but should be viewed in context with an average annual return of say 7 a 1.25 fee represents nearly 18 of your gain for the year and 1.25 may be the least of your fees what about fees when you get out of the funds neat trick huh calling a fee 1.25 instead of is active management worth 18 of your yearly gain your advisor 's fee and the active funds fees compound year after year because they take the fees out of your account every year or month

all the other answers posted thus far discuss matters from the perspective of us tax laws and are unanimous in declaring that what the op wants to do is indeed a very bad idea i fully agree it is a bad idea from the perspective of us tax laws and is likely a bad idea from the perspective of indian tax laws too but what the op wants to do is   or used to be common practice in india in more recent times india has created a permanent account number pan number for each taxpayer for income tax purposes and each bank account or investment must have the owner 's or first named owner 's in case of a joint account pan number associated with it   this most likely has decreased the popularity of such arrangements or has led to new being used the op has not indicated the residence and citizenship of his family or his own status for that matter but if they are all indian citizens resident in india and are then there might be one mechanism for doing what the op wants to do apply for a pan number in the name of the hindu undivided family and use this number to carry out the investments in the name of the hindu undivided family   there presumably are similar statuses for undivided families for other religions but i am not familiar with them there are lots of matters here which are more legal questions than personal finance questions e.g. if the op is a us tax resident then the family presumably will not be able to claim hindu undivided family status since the op has been divided from the family for tax purposes or so i think even if status is available the op might not be able to act as the while his father is alive and so on   consultation with tax lawyers not just chartered accountants in india is certainly advisable

why are there taxi regulations in the first place i mean if uber was able to provide such a comparable service without taxi regulations then why do we need them obviously the people have spoken with their wallets and i do n't think uber has killed or seriously hurt me if i 'm wrong    as far as i 'm concerned the only reason these regulations exist is to make cabs more expensive and give the local government more money from cabs as a service but uber actually creates a lower burden on the government because they have ride sharing which means that less people are on the roads which is definitely a good thing    please tell me i 'm wrong i 'm genuinely asking

the simplest thing is to transfer to your current account you 'll have the ability to borrow assuming employer allows 50 of the balance if you need to and one less account to worry about   transferring to an ira is the other common choice this offers the ability to convert to a roth ira and to invest any way you choose the 401(k options may be limited   without more details it 's tough to decide for example if you are in the 15 bracket the roth conversion can be a great idea and the 401(k might be not so great just deposit to the match and then use the ira for example

i 'd lean toward using the $ 3,000 from the emergency fund although depending on your monthly bills a $ 2,000 emergency fund or even a $ 5,000 one may be a bit small but here are a couple of other options for you zero interest balance transfers if you have cards and have a zero balance on them your credit card companies are keen to see you put a balance on them find out if they 're offering any 12 months no interest on balance transfers offers or if any of their rivals is since of course the car loan is an outstanding balance you can transfer you 're not asking them for cash put the $ 3,000 on that zero balance transfer option get rid of the car and pay the $ 300/mo to pay down the balance on the card 10 months later two months before the end of the free period you 're at zero again   without dipping into your emergency fund you 'll also now have a history with that card company of paying back which may lead them to attempt to entice you to go into more debt which you 'll resist of course by increasing the limit if you do n't want a higher limit just tell them to reduce it again a $ 3,000 unsecured loan with no pre payment penalty provided the math works out the interest may be expensive unless you find something with a teaser rate for the first x months but if you find an option do the math on it to see if it 's actually more expensive than carrying the car payments insurance etc on a depreciating asset it may not be as expensive as the 20 rate or whatever makes it sound but again do the math and if you apply your $ 300/mo to it within say 11 months you 're clear again   with a nice little paid back loan on your credit report both of these ensure that you still have your emergency fund at your disposal and both capitalize on the fact that right now you 're probably a good credit risk if you dip into your emergency fund and an emergency happens like loss of a job and you find yourself short of funds you may have trouble securing further credit at that point to cover the gap in your emergency fund

h1b visas are not terrible and i am not against all h1b visas however it is a bald faced lie to suggest the number 1 if not only reason companies use them is to cut labor costs these companies are not advertising they could have hired local talent but chose to provide the job to someone from a poorer region   i think whatever city everybody in the world wants to work or go to school like tokyo or london or paris or boston that is going to have the world 's best talent also if those people go back to their they do n't bring with them the ideas from the city they worked or but rather the best ideas from all over the world   that is n't at all what is happening in technology there are plenty of computer science and electrical engineer majors in the usa out of work and some making six figures with a bs degree and 3 years experience but so many are out of work many of those jobs were outsourced but the talent used was so poor the cost to upkeep or update was so expensive that many companies brought back the jobs to the usa those companies still want to hire the same low cost workers but want them working in the usa for reasons i will spare here the usa talent pool is so full and jobs so scarce it drives down wages not actually because what really happens in the company is toxic to work for and demands 16 hour days 7 days a week for the same great salary that may have once been 40 hours a week with fun and entertainment and space and a gym on site etc   stopping h1b visas would force companies to bring back their on site gyms large break rooms increase work life balance etc   stopping h1b visas mean a lot of billion dollar tech companies would have to pay their shareholders and executives less this year than last year which is outrageous in the race to the bottom

as mentioned by dilip you need to provide more details in general for transacting on stocks long term if you hold the stock for more than one year then its long term and not taxable there is a stt securities transaction tax that is already deducted paid during buying and selling of a stock short term if you hold the stock for less than one year it 's short term gain this can be adjusted against the short term loss for the financial year the tax rate is 10 day trading is same as short term from tax point of view unless you are doing it as a full time business if you have purchased multiple quantities of same stock in different quantities and time then when you selling you have to arrive at profit or loss on fifo basis ie first in first out

it is typically possible to sell during a crash because there are enough people that understand the mechanics behind a crash generally you need to understand that you do n't lose money from the crash but from selling every single crash in history more than recovered and by staying invested you would n't have lost anything this assumes you have enough time to sit it out it could take several years to recover on the other side of those deals are people that understand that and make money by buying during a crash they simply sit the crash out and some time later they made a killing from what you panic sold when it recovers its value

i have n't read the paper but have read similar papers before will likely read this paper here in a while    i can see the use for patents to a degree not the way they are now but in some form or another i think they should still exist i am not under the delusion of they help innovate i see them more or less as bringing stability to the marketplace business the changes i would like to see made is on certain patents or probably all patents that they expire at a certain time or if the patent is not put to use in a given time frame that it falls back into the public domain expired patents being fully searchable online for free    i would also disallow any patenting of genes or anything that nature has produced and or made if some one makes a new element or makes an absolutely new gene that has been seen or found any where else then sure patent it but something that already exists no    i agree that patents do stifle creativity and ultimately do harm us as a developing nation especially in it 's current iteration the solution i briefly went over would give a happy medium it would do much less harm than now and offer better innovation down the road the stability question with relation to business marketplace is how certain products are made and produced some people put a lot of time and effort into developing something and they need a little protection in doing it 7 years or so should be enough to recoup that back and then some after that time they can still produce said product but would have to compete against everyone else who uses a similar design    all in all i think every one can agree that the patent copyright system needs serious overhaul and not because it is too weak but it is because it was designed and implemented in a 20th century mindset not a 21st it worked somewhat well in the early 1900 's but since then it has not things move at a faster rate now than they did then as such in this day in age it is a lot stronger than it needs to be and needs to be back in a lot of areas it needs to be by people who know the area well and have no financial stake in the system one way or the other possibly people in academia with knowledge on the system and can offer valid arguments for it 's change and help to bring in common sense reforms to the system with how fucked up it is now it would probably be best to just scrap the system and design a new system from the ground up all currently held patents now have a 7 year life span if the patent is not in current use you have a year to show that you are working toward using the patent rather than just shelving it so no one else can use it

can it be so that these low interest rates cause investors to take greater risk to get a decent return   with interest rates being as low as they are there is little to no risk in banking especially after dodd frank risk is just a fancy word for will i make money in the long future no one knows what the actual risk is unless you can see into the future but there are ways to mitigate it so arguably the best way to make money is the stock market not in banking   there is a great misallocation of resources which at some point will show itself and cause tremendous losses even maybe cause a new financial crisis a financial crisis is backed on a believed to be strong investment that goes belly up   tremendous losses is a rather grand term with no merit banks are not purposely keeping interest rates low to cause a financial crisis   as the central banks have kept interest rates extremely low for a decade even negative this affects how much we save and borrow the biggest point here is to know one thing bonds bonds affect all things from municipalities construction to pensions if interest rates increased currently the current rate of bonds would drop vastly and actually cause a financial crisis in the u.s. due to millions of older persons relying on bonds as sources of income

running for profit business does n't pressure those involved to make the best product it pressures them to make the best profit   making the best profit pressures those involved to produce the cheapest product that the market wo n't reject marked at the highest price the market wo n't reject   private companies have the freedom to avoid or limit the effect of that pressure if they choose and sacrifice some profit for quality and improved customer satisfaction though many still choose profit   public companies who are eventually to shareholders who sole goal is profitability are much less likely to avoid the pressures to increase profits at all costs   particularly in the age of day traders and ceo merry go round long term planning is very difficult when short term profitability is on the line   a company that made one widget a year for $ 1 and sold that widget for $ 10 billion would be a very successful company from the profit standpoint and would likely have an excellent share price if the business model looked secure for the next year or two   competition helps alleviate this and pushes for better products and lower prices by upping the bar of what the market will reject over time increase the available alternatives and the features quality price scale shifts   the importance of having a level playing field anti monopoly laws and ensure that new players can come onto the scene is fundamental to capitalism working otherwise those who hold monopoly positions will prevent competition from emerging and charge as much as is possible for the cheapest product people will still buy   this is of particular issue when not buying the product is a threat to one 's life or safety medical care emergency services food etc

if you have a long enough time horizon investing in the stock market while in a bad economy can turn out to be a very smart decision if you need access to your capital in the short term 1 2 years then it is probably a bad decision if you have the ability to ride out the next few years then you may be buying securities at an extremely low valuation take aapl and msft for example these are both technology stocks which is by far the hottest sector in the economy now and you can buy both of these companies for less than earnings historically you would have had to pay 20x or higher for high tech growth companies but today you can buy these stocks at discounted valuations now aapl may have a large market capitalization and a high stock price but the simple fact is they are growing their earnings very quickly they have best in class management and they have $ 100 billion in cash and $ 50 billion in annual cash flow generation and you can buy the stock for a historically low multiple

what is a good resource to learn about options trading strategies options are a quite advanced investment form and you 'd do well to learn a lot about them before attempting to dive into this fairly illiquid market yale 's online course in financial markets covers the options market and is a good starting point to make sure you 've got all the basics you may be familiar with most of it but it 's a decent on lingo and black scholes how can i use options to establish some cash flow from long standing investments while minimizing capital gains expenses this question seems designed to get people to talk about covered calls essentially you sell call contracts you let people buy things you already have at a price in the future at their whim they pay you for this option though usually not much if the options are n't in the money you can think of this as trading any return above the call option for a bit of extra cash   i do n't invest with taxable accounts but there are significant tax consequences for options because they expire there will be turnover in your portfolio and up front income when you take the sell side so if you trade in options with close expiration dates you 'll probably end up with a lot of short term capital gains which are treated as normal income one strategy is to trade in broad based stock index options which have favorable tax treatments some people have abused this though to disguise normal income as capital gains so it could go away obviously the easy approach is to just use a tax advantaged account for options trading an etf might also be able to handle the turnover on your behalf for example vix is a series of options on s&p500 options a second strategy i 've heard of is buying calls and puts at a given strike price for example if you bought dec 13 calls and puts on spx 115 today it would cost you about $ 35 dollars if the price moves more than 35 dollars away from 115 by dec 13 in either direction you 've made a profit if you reflect on that for a bit you 'll see why vix is considered a volatility index i guess i should mention that shorting a stock and buying a put option at the market price are very similar with the exception that your loss is limited to the price of the option   is there ever an instance where options investing is not speculative the term speculative is not well defined for many people the answer is no it 's very easy to just buy put options and wait for prices to fall or call options and wait for prices to rise moreover the second strategy above essentially gives you similar performance to a stock without paying full price these all fall under the headline of increasing a risk portfolio rather than decreasing it which i figure is a decent definition of speculation on the other hand there are ways to use options minimize risk rather than increase it you can buy underwater options as portfolio insurance if your portfolio drops below a certain amount you still have the right to sell it at a higher one and the case schiller index is run in part on the hopes that one day there might be a thriving market for real estate options or futures when you buy a home or lend money to someone to buy one you could buy regional case schiller options to protect you if the regional market tanks but in all of these cases it 's required for someone else to take the opposite trade risk is n't reduced it 's traded around so technically there is a speculative element to these as well i think the proper question here is whether speculation is present but whether speculation can be put to good ends without speculators the already very thin market for options would faster

tl dr i bonds do not fit well into most personal finance plans first the questions succinct reference i like your thought process weighing your liquidity and risk versus your return   this is very important   however i think you might be a bit by i bonds   i bonds are not generally good for personal investment as they are not marketable when necessary have redemption penalties and hold lower overall yields in general   finally they are significantly harder to trade as you can buy and hold a tips etf and get exposure to all maturities and get the current competitive rate all in one purchase inflation protection is in general an interesting problem   while inflation protected bonds sound like they are great for inflation protection after all it is in the name they may not be the best instruments for long medium term protection   it is really important to remember that inflation protected bonds have significantly lower returns and one form of inflation protection is to just have more money in the future   tips really protect against large inflation changes as normal bonds have the future expected inflation already baked in their higher rates also when you own a stock you own part of a company and inflation will increase the value of the company relative to the inflated currency   foreign stocks can give even more protection if you think inflation in your local currency is going to be higher then the foreign currency   stocks in the past have had significantly higher return overall than inflation protected bonds but have higher risk as well as a medium term low risk portfolio it is worth looking into some combination of tips normal bonds and a small to medium allocation of local foreign stocks all done through low fee mutual funds or index etfs

mathematically it seems like the expected rate of return whatever that might be is the same for both an aggressive strategy is higher risk and higher reward a conservative strategy is lower risk and lower reward that is not true   roughly the mathematical of higher risk and higher reward is higher standard deviation and higher mean   in other words the aggressive strategy does have a higher expected rate of return higher mean   its disadvantage is that it has a higher likelihood of incurring intermediate losses and/or higher magnitude of intermediate losses on the way this is illustrated with the following chart   from vanguard you can see that the average return is greater the riskier the portfolio i.e. the more allocated to stocks relative to bonds but this higher average return comes at the price of a greater range of possible returns   with an aggressive portfolio you take a greater risk of losses at any given moment for a greater chance of gains over a long period given this it should be obvious why the advice is to be aggressive early on   early in life you do n't care about whether your current position is up or down because you 're not taking the money out   if your portfolio is down you just leave the money in there until it goes back up again   later in life you need to spend the money you now care about whether your current position is up or down because you ca n't afford to wait out a down market and may have to realize a loss by selling it 's important to note that the expected return is always greater for a higher risk portfolio as is the expected risk the expected rate of return does n't magically change as you age   what changes is your ability to absorb losses to hold out for later gains

it sounded an interesting question so i looked it up the reason i asked about the tax years is because it matters if the bonus was paid and then returned in the same year it should not appear on your w2 at all and your taxes would be calculated accordingly you might end up with overpayment of fica taxes but you can get that credited on your tax return if however the repayment is not in the same year as the payment it becomes more complicated the code section that deals with it is 26 usc what it says in short is this you can deduct the repaid amount from your current taxable income but only if its more than $ 3000 the tax benefit of such deduction can not exceed the actual tax paid on this in the year when you got the bonus i.e. you need to calculate that year with the amount and without the amount the credit can not exceed the difference but it can also not exceed the amount you would be paying on that amount in the current year i.e. if current taxes are less than that year you lost the difference if the signing bonus is less than $ 3000 and it spans across tax years you can not deduct it bummer

there 's no formula for how much is the ideal amount to spend on entertainment and fun as joetaxpayer says it 's all about balance maybe relative costs are different in france than in the us where i live but here housing and the things that go with it electricity heat insurance maybe a few other miscellaneous items are usually a huge portion of a young person 's expenses if you do n't mind living with your parents and they do n't mind having you you can save a lot of money there are lots of things you can do for fun that do n't cost a lot of money if your idea of fun is collecting fancy cars and making round the world trips yes that can get expensive fast when i was in my 20s my entertainment mostly consisted of going to movies amusement parks and occasional concerts and playing computer games those are n't super expensive as long as you do n't do them every day and keeping my car running which saved money over buying a new car these days i 'm in a situation analogous to yours i 'm getting older and so i 'm trying to build up a retirement account so i can retire comfortably so i have to balance how much i put away for retirement with spending on fun things now i have certain targets and so i budget that i will put this amount away for retirement every month and my spending money is what i have left i think that 's better than spend whatever i want on fun and then put what 's left toward retirement the latter plan is probably a fast route to debt

1- wells fargo does not own our current mortgage   they have bundled it and sold it as an investment 2- they make their money from servicing the loan   even if they only get $ 50 per month to service it 3 of our monthly payment that adds up to $ per month if they have a million homes under management   that is $ 600 million per year for each million homes being serviced 3- managing the escrow gets them additional profit because they can invest it and earn 2 3   if 1,000,000 homes have an average balance of $ 2,000 in their escrow accounts they can earn up to $ 60 per year or $ annually they make $ 1,000 every time they refinance the home   this is the approximate profit after paying real closing costs   refinance those million homes and you make a cool billion in profit 5- they also want to be sure that they keep us as a customer   by lowering our payment they decrease the likelyhood that we will refinance with someone else and we are less likely to default   not that they lose if we default because they do n't own the loan they make additional profit by paying off the old loan they do n't own it remember then packaging and selling the new mortgage   since they are selling it as a security they sell for future value meaning they sell our $ 200,000 loan for a valuation of $   this means that they sell for $ 200,000 plus some fraction of the additional $ 160,000   let 's say they only want a 10 premium of the $ valuation   that means they sell our $ 200,000 loan for $   they pocket $ 36,000   if they make a million of these transactions every year that is $ 36 billion dollars in profit so wells fargo refinances one million homes every year and they make $ initial profit for selling the loan with absolutely no risk plus $ for doing the loan $ annually to service the loan very little risk since it is being paid by the owner of the loan as a service fee if they can retain the loans for their entire life keep us from refinancing with someone else they can make $ that is billion dollars in servicing fees the profit they make in a refinance is much greater than the money then can make by holding the loan for 30 years

most people will never need to pay federal gift taxes the federal gift taxes start after giving away million over the course of your life this number is adjusted annually for inflation there are only two states that i know of which impose state gift taxes connecticut and minnesota in connecticut you need to start paying taxes if the lifetime value of your gifts exceed two million in minnesota it starts at 1 million   the federal tax is paid for by the person making the gift unless other arrangements are made there is an annual exclusion amount of approximately $ 14,000 you can give up to this amount to any number of recipients and it is not considered taxable therefore when you give $ 100 to someone it is not a taxable event   if you do make a gift to an individual in excess of 14k you 'll need to file a gift tax return irs form 709 when you file form 709 you wo n't need to pay taxes until the million is exceeded instead you can claim an exemption since most people do n't exceed that amount its rare to ever pay taxes even when exceeding the annual exclusion amount the annual exclusion amount is adjusted each year for inflation

the optimal down payment is 100 the only way you would do anything else when you have the cash to buy it outright is to invest the remaining money to get a better return   when you compare investments you need to take risk into account as well   when you make loan payments you are getting a risk free return   you ca n't find a risk free investment that pays as much as your car loan will be   if you think you can game the system by taking a 0 loan then you will end up paying more for the car since the financing is baked into the sales price in those cases there is no such thing as free money   if you pay cash you have much more bargaining power    buy the car outright negotiating as hard as you can start saving what you would have been making as a car payment as an emergency fund and you 'll be ahead of the game for the inflation hedge you need to find investments that act as an inflation hedge taking a loan does not hedge against inflation since you 'll still be paying interest regardless of the inflation rate   the fact that you 'll be paying slightly less interest in real terms does not make it a hedge to answer the actual question if your reinvestment rate the return you can get from investing the borrowed cash is less than the interest rate then the more you put down the greater your present value pv if your reinvestment rate is less than the interest rate then the less you put down the better not including risk   when you incorporate risk though the additional return is probably not worth the risk so there is no optimal down payment in between those mathematically it will depend on how much liquid cash you need knowing that every dollar that you borrow is costing you interest

parts of what you want are possible but taken as a whole you 're out of luck first of all there is no master database of every cardholder in the country   the only way to check if information is correct is to ask the issuing bank   the avs system is a way to automate doing so but it 's possible to call the bank directly and verbally verify the address    that means you 're subject to the whims of what the issuing bank chooses to support   banks that are part of the visa and mastercard networks generally only verify the numeric parts address apartment number   amex can also verify the cardholder name   but if the bank does n't have support for validating something you ca n't validate it separately there is a verify only transaction which some processors support which will do exactly what you want   return avs values without ever charging the card   however processors require you to have the approved merchant account you do n't want to have to have   without being a merchant you should n't have access to other people 's credit cards anyway   would you really want anyone in the country to be able to verify anyone else 's address whenever they want in short whatever purpose you have for wanting this probably falls into one of three categories

really you should only use words you understand particularly if you 're going to throw one single word into an argument and act as if that 's all you need to say   if the price were perfectly elastic then for every increase in cost in airline flights people would spend exactly enough less on flights to counteract that     what you mean is that price will mitigate this   but in fact since the elasticity of the market is almost certainly negative like almost all markets the airlines will in fact lose some money for every such tax put on them   less money than the cost of the tax yes because of the of the market but some   wiki

assuming that the nre nonresident external account is in good standing that is you are still eligible to have an nre account because your status as a nonresident of india has not changed in the interim you can transfer money   back from your nre account to your us accounts without any problems but be aware that you bear the risk of getting back a much smaller amount than you invested in the nre account because of devaluation of the indian rupee inr   nre accounts are held in inr and whatever amounts in inr that you choose to withdraw will be converted to us$ at the exchange rate then applicable depending on whether it is the indian bank that is doing the conversion and sending money by wire to your us bank or you are depositing a cheque in inr in your us bank you may be charged miscellaneous service fees also to answer a question that you have not asked as yet there is no us tax on the transfer of the money the interest paid on your deposits into the nre account are not taxable income to you in india but are taxable income to you in the us and so i hope that you have been declaring this income each year on schedule b of your income tax return and also reporting that you have accounts held abroad as required by us law   see for example this question and its answer and also this question and its answer

what a lovely position to find yourself in there 's a lot of doors open to you now that may not have opened naturally for another decade if i were in your shoes benefiting from the hindsight of being 35 now at 21 i 'd look to do the following two things before doing anything else 1- put 6 months worth of living expenses in to a savings account a rainy day fund 2- if you have a pension i 'd be contributing enough of my salary to get the company match then i 'd top up that figure to 15 of gross salary into stocks shares isas with a view to them also being retirement funds now for what to do with the rest some thoughts first house if you do n't want to live in it just yet i 'd think twice about buying you would n't want a house to limit your career mobility or prove to not fit your lifestyle within 2 years costing you money to move on travel spending it all on travel would be excessive travel tends to be more interesting on a lower budget that is meeting people and riding trains and buses putting a amount in an account to act as a natural budget for this might be wise wealth managers approx 12 gain over 6 years so far equates to about 1.9 annual return not even beat inflation over that period so guessing they had it in ultra safe cash a guaranteed way to lose money over the long term give them the money to look after again i 'd sooner do it myself with a selection of low cost vehicles and equal or beat their return with far lower costs decisions a if you decided not to use the money for big purchases for at least 4 5 years then you could look to invest it in equities as you mentioned a broad basket of high yielding shares would allow you to get an income and give opportunity for capital growth the yield income could be used for your travel costs over a few years you could fill your isa allowance and realise any capital gains to stay under the annual exemption over 4 years or so it 'd all be tax free b if you do want to get a property sooner then the best bet would to seek out the best interest rates current accounts fixed rate accounts etc are offering the best interest rates at the moment usual places like and would help you identify them there 's nothing wrong with sitting on this money for a couple of years whilst you your way with it it might n't earn much but you 'd likely keep pace with inflation and you definitely would n't lose it or risk it unnecessarily c if you wanted to diversify your investment you could look to buy to let as the other post suggested this would require a 25 deposit and likely would cost 10 of rental income to have it managed for you there 's room for the property to rise in value and the rent should cover a mortgage but it may come with the headache of poor tenants or periods of so it 's not the buy and forget that many people assume with some effort though it may provide the best route to making the most of the money d some mixture of all of the above at different stages your money your choices and a valid choice would be to sit on the cash until you learn more about your options and feel the direction your heart is pointing you hope that helps i 'm happy to elaborate if you wish chris

buffett is a value investor his goal is to buy good companies when the market is overly worried and prices them below intrinsic value when the market is highly priced it is much more difficult for him to find things that he thinks are at an attractive price when people are very worried and the market has crashed stocks are then priced below their intrinsic value and he can use the cash he keeps in the company to make attractive purchases remember that buffett is not concerned with the ups and downs of the price of berkshire hathaway stock he is concerned with the economic value of the assets that the company owns so if all stock prices crash and he can buy things that are at bargain prices he is happy no matter what berkshire stock price does in the short run one consequence of value investing is that because you are buying assets at bargain prices the total value of your assets drops less in a bear market than the highly priced stuff that drives the major indexes

as someone who works in tech and has seen a thing or two the fallacy of moving to college towns to foster innovation is a farce the whole reason businesses do this is to get an endless supply of cheap labor from new graduates who do n't have families thus will work nights and weekends for free to make a name for themselves once those kids wise up and maybe want to start a family they move to suburbs away from these college towns and leave those companies which leads to high attrition rates for mid level employees this also leads to inferior products from a high technology standpoint because of lack of senior mentors and you end up with shit projects just slapped together that just barely work would you want your ge jet engines designed on the cheap by recent graduates or disciplined engineers i 'm not saying it 's a bad business decision it is totally valid and smart for some markets but it seems like ge has their hands in important technology that should n't be designed like this if they want to reinvent themselves why not make a boston technology center for innovation not move their whole business it just did n't make sense

from the 1st quarter 10q match funded advances on loans serviced for others result from our transfers of residential loan servicing advances to in exchange for cash the issue debt supported by collections on the transferred advances we made these transfers under the terms of our advance facility agreements these transfers do not qualify for sale accounting because we retain control over the transferred assets as a result we account for these transfers as and classify the transferred advances on our interim condensed consolidated balance sheet as match funded advances and the related liabilities as match funded liabilities we use collections on the match funded advances pledged to the to repay principal and to pay interest and the expenses of the entity holders of the debt issued by this entity can look only to the assets of the entity itself for satisfaction of the debt and have no recourse against    i 'm not an expert in the accounting of these things but i 'll take a stab from the view of a bond investor   let 's assume the in question have been pooled together and sold into the bond market in the form of a mortgage backed security mbs     when a homeowner falls behind on their payment scheduled principal and interest their monthly mortgage payment amount or is advanced as if the borrower is still current to the person who holds the mbs   this is typically done from the time they first fall behind until either they 1 catch up on their payments or 2 are foreclosed upon and the home is sold to repay the mortgage balance   in either instance the advanced monthly payments are recaptured by the servicer before the holder of the mbs is paid   in this sense the servicer develops a sort of prepaid asset over time by advancing money they are almost certain to recover at a future date usually via foreclosure and liquidation     due to a high number of borrowers falling behind on their payments since the housing crisis and the resulting time it takes to foreclose on a property the etc have built a large balance of advances on the asset side of their balance sheet   to free up this cash prior to liquidation of the home they have sold short term bonds against this asset via an thereby creating the liability you reference   so in essence they have say a home they expect to be liquidated in twelve months that they have advanced on   the short term bonds sold via the offset this asset at an equivalent term thereby making the asset and liability match funded

12 is ridiculously high and routine for loans with no credit history esp from the dealer i do n't think though paying off would hurt your credit you 've already got installment loan on your report and you have history of payments so it should n't matter how long the history is warning this is kind of guesswork compiled from personal experience and stuff read on the net since officially how credit score calculated is top secret   if you have the loan and credit card with good payments only thing you need to build credit is time and of course keeping everything nicely paid of course if you could find a loan with lower rate somewhere it 's be great to refinance but with low credit you would probably not get the best rates from anywhere unfortunately

that may be true but what will happen is that every carrier raises prices in an oligopoly it will be an opportunity to act as an so maybe after a while costs will be driven down but in the short it will probably only raise prices and also it creates a situation where the a service that was previously accessible to all customers will now only be available to the ones willing to pay whatever the cost of an actual human behind the telephone is   so in the short run it will only increase telecom costs also since having a phone or internet in something you can just opt out of everyone will be more or less forced to accept this practice again the oligopoly is where can find the cause

there are a lot of good answers above all of them will probably work for you in some way or another one point to note from the procrastination theme is that you could invest your free money that you have currently in some investment instrument which would require you to do some paperwork etc to get out this way the immediate cash flow is decreased and also invested now from each budget save a small amount for the things that you would like to buy give this small savings some months to accumulate so that you can afford only one of the items that you want to buy or target an item that you want to buy after the money is accumulated if you still want to buy the item then you probably should one point of note is that budgeting is also important on a monthly basis pete has provided excellent suggestion in this regard

from a slightly different perspective in my experience of buying a house you will find some unexpected costs due repairs that need to be made which were overlooked during the home inspection etc you will need some financial cushion to fall back onto for these unexpected costs so for that reason alone i 'd try to pay off as much of the credit card debt as i can

the short answer is that it depends on the taxation laws in your country the long answer is that there are usually tax avoidance mechanisms that you can use which may make it more economically feasible for you to go one way or the other consider the following the long term average growth rate of the stock market in australia is around 7   the average interest on a mortgage is 4.75   assuming you have money left over from a 20 deposit you have a few options   you could 1 put that money into an index fund for the long term understanding that the market may not move for a decade or even move downwards 2 dump that money straight into the mortgage 3 put that money in an offset account option 1 will get you over the course of 30 40 years around 7 return   if and when that profit is realised it will be taxed at a minimum of half your marginal tax rate probably around 20 netting you around 5.25 option 2 will effectively earn you 4.75 pa tax free option 3 will effectively earn you 4.75 pa tax free with the added bonus that the money is ready for you to draw upon on short notice of the three options until you have a good 3 + months of living expenses covered i 'd go with the offset account every single time once you have a few months worth of living expenses covered i would the adopt a policy of spreading your risk   in australia that would mean extra contributions to my super 401k in the us and possibly purchasing an investment property as well once i had the capital to positively gear it of course you should find out more about the tax laws in your country and do your own maths

what i 've found works best when working on my personal budget is to track my income and spending two different ways bank accounts and budget categories here is what i mean when i deposit my paycheck i do two things with it it goes into my checking account so the balance of my checking account goes up by the amount of my paycheck i also deposit the money from my checking account into my various budget category balances   this is separate from my bank account balances   some of my paycheck money goes into my groceries category some goes into clothing some into car fuel entertainment mortgage phone etc   some goes into longer range bills that only happen once or twice a year such as car insurance life insurance property tax etc   some goes into savings goals of ours such as car replacement vacation furniture etc every dollar that we have in a bank account or in cash in our wallets is also accounted for in a budget category   if you add up the balances of our bank accounts and cash and you add up the balances of our budget categories they add up to the same number when we make a purchase this also gets accounted for twice the appropriate bank account or cash wallet balance gets reduced by the purchase amount the appropriate budget category gets reduced by the purchase amount in this way we do n't really need to worry about having separate bank accounts for different purposes   we do n't need to put our savings goal money in a separate bank account from our grocery money if we do n't want to   the budget category accounting keeps track of how much money is allocated to each purpose    now the budget category amounts are not spent yet the money in them is still in our bank account and we can move money around in the categories if we change our mind on how to allocate them   for example if we do n't spend all of our gas money for the month we can either keep that money in the gas category or we can move it to a different category such as the car replacement category or the vacation category   if the phone bill is more than we expect we can move money around from a different category to cover it now back to your question we allocate some money from each paycheck into our furniture category   but the money is not really spent until we actually buy some furniture   when we do the furniture category balance and bank account balance both go down by the amount of the purchase all of this can be kept track of on the computer in a spreadsheet   however it 's not easy to keep track of so many categories and bank balances   an easier solution is custom budgeting software designed for this purpose   i use and recommend ynab

i will disagree with the other answers the idea that there is some to establish a credit history is largely a myth by who see it as positive propaganda to increase the numbers of their prospective customers you will find some people who claim they were rejected for a card because they had no credit history but in every case what these people are not telling you is they also had no income were students house wives or others with no steady income anyone who has income can get a credit card or other line of credit regardless of their credit history even people who have gone bankrupt can get credit cards if they have proven income if your answer to this is that you have no income but still want a credit card i would advise you to re read that sentence several times and think carefully about it i have never had a credit card and never missed having one except when trying to rent cars which was somewhat complex and annoying to do in the 2005 2010 time period without a credit card credit cards have a number of disadvantages i definitely agree with those who will tell you credit cards are convenient they are but for someone who wants to be financially prudent and build wealth they are unnecessary and unwise if you do n't believe me read the total money makeover by david ramsey one of the most famous and best selling books ever written on personal finance he actually will give you much better and detailed reasons to avoid ccs than me after all who am i just some dumb rich schmuck with lots of money and no debt and a happy life comment on culture i think it is pretty funny we have a lot of americans in this thread basically telling the op to get lots of credit cards as soon as possible if you asked the same question in japan you would get completely different answers and votes in japan its hard to even use credit cards the   people there are much more responsible financially than americans the average japanese person has much higher wealth than a person with the same income in the united states one of the reasons for this among many is that the average japanese person does not use credit cards a japanese person if you translated this question for them would think the whole thing a typical example of how foolish americans are

a minimum purchase quantity just means that you need to round your result up to the nearest 100 in your example it comes out evenly if we look at an example where it does n't come out even you 'd round up and round that up to 700 due to purchase quantities for a slightly more complex and accurate approach you 'd then evaluate how many of the extras you had to buy due to the minimum purchase quantity would need to be sold so you 'd have to sell of the 700 purchased to break even

here 's another answer on the topic saving for retirement how much is enough an angle on it this question made me think of a good approach here is to focus on savings rate which you can control rather than the final number which you ca n't plus it will fluctuate with the markets and make you nervous for example focus on saving at least 10 of your income annually 15 is much safer   if you focus on the final number the way it works in the real world is that you save as much as you can but there are lots of random factors and unknowns some people end up having to work a lot longer than they hoped to others end up able to retire early others retire on time but have to spend less than they hoped but the one thing you can often control as long as you have an income and no catastrophes anyway is that you spend less than you make

in a money market fund one share is worth $ 1 for your fund you 'll earn $ a year per share or 0.10   that is all that you will earn the apy is just another number to represent this interest rate not a separate income stream if you were expecting extra money from a separately credited dividend you were mistaken usually the apy is a slightly different number than the interest rate to reflect the way that the interest is compounded over the course of the year in this case the compounding is too slight to notice with just 2 decimal places if you were investing in a regular savings account you would see the rate you are paid expressed as an apy also but not as a dividend as no shares are involved and use that number to compare the two if you were buying a bond fund or stock fund that did not have a fixed price you could calculate the dividend yield based on the current stock price but you would not probably see an apy listed money market funds are kind of an odd hybrid of fund and savings so they list both

pension in this instance seems to mean pension income as opposed to pension pot this money would be determined by whatever assets are being invested in it may be fixed it may be variable completely dependant on the underlying investments an annuity is a product in simple terms you over a lump sum of cash and receive an agreed annual income until you die the underlying investment required to reach that income level is not your concern it 's the provider 's worry so there is a mount of security to the retiree in having an annuity the downside of annuities is that the level of income may be too low for your liking for instance £ would mean £ 400 for every £ 10,000 given to the provider that 's 4 and would take 25 years to break even ignoring inflation opportunity cost of investing yourself therefore the gamble is whether you outlive the deal you could hand over £ 50,000 to a provider and drop dead a year later your £ 50k got you say £ 2k and then you popped your provider wins or you could like 40 years after retiring and then you end up costing the provider £ 80k you win best way to think of an annuity is a route to guaranteed agreed income to secure that guarantee there 's a price to pay and that is a lower income rate than you might like hope that was the kind of reply you were hoping for if not edit your op and ask again chris ps the explanation on the link you provided is pretty dire very confusing use of the term pension and even if that were better the explanation is still bad due to this is much better

your gut feeling is absolutely spot on you should n't be worrying about pension now not at the age of 25 assuming that you 're not a in the middle of the most productive part of your career and already have a fat wad of crunchy banknotes under your pillow that you 're looking to set aside for a rainy day when you wo n't be able to play at your prime any longer that does n't mean you should n't invest nor that means that you must n't save there are several factors at play here   first of all as a young person you are likely to have a high tolerance for risk there is still plenty of time to recover should expected returns not even a pension fund with the most aggressive risk return strategy might just not quite do it for you you could invest into education instead improve health obtain a profitable skill create social capital by building connections pay for experience buy a house start a family or even a business next as a young professional you 're unlikely to have reached your full earning potential yet and due to the law of diminishing marginal utility a hundred pounds per month now have greater utility i.e. positive impact on your lifestyle than a seven hundred pounds will in 7 10 years time once your earnings that is to say it 's easier to save £ 700 month from £ 3000 and maintain a reasonable level of personal comfort than carve £ 100 from £ 1300 monthly income and last but not the least lets face it from a human point of view forty years is a very long investment horizon and many things might and will change one of the downsides of uk pensions is that you have very little control over the money until you reach a certain age i suggest saving up to build a cushion consisting of cash or near cash assets the size of the stash should be such that it is enough to cover all of your expenses from a minimum of 2 months to a maximum of a year the exact size will depend on your personal comfort level whatever social net you have parents wife partner and how hard it will be to find a new source of income should the current cease to produce cash on a strategic level you can start looking into investing any surplus cash into the foundation of what will bring joy and happiness into the next 40 years of your life your or your partners training and education is one of the most sensible choices whilst you 're young starting a family is another one both might help you reach you full earning potential much quicker finding what you love to do and learning how to do it really well cash can accelerate this process bringing you quicker there you want to be if you were a start up business in front of a huge market would you rather use cash to pay dividends or finance growth

us treasury securities are the safest investment you can buy short term by buying t bills   you buy t bills at a discount to face for example to buy a four week t bill the treasury will take $ out of your account in four weeks the treasury will deposit $ 100 into your account the $ 0.02 difference is your intrest on the loan compounded over a year 13 four week periods you get a interest but presumably more importantly to you you get your original $ back   your government can not nationalize money that you have on loan to the united states government   edit oops i dropped a decimal position in my original calculation of compounded rate of interest it is now corrected

you should total the items first to get $ 3.00 then add the tax then round up down accordingly   your two examples above do n't offer this option even though your second example arrives at the same result   in your first example a number of items taxed one at a time might result in many results which would round to .01 a long enough list of items would result in an error of many cents depending how many items there are totaling first then applying tax results in your saving or losing cents maximum due to rounding   see a guide to sales and use tax which is a document put out by the massachusetts dept of revenue in the chart for tax it shows that $ is taxed at five cents but at 5 it would be so at least for this state i believe i correctly stated the rounding process

it 's a tricky question w out more context if your only options are between stock funds and letting it sit i.e. in a saving or cd i 'd have to say option one is the way to go but that 's based on my situation and you did ask if you   however i think the true answer is it depends it depends on your risk tolerance and what are your short term vs. long term financial needs only after answering those questions you can then seek to and diversify investment accordingly

there 's several approaches to the stock market the first thing you need to do is decide which you 're going to take the first is the case of the standard investor saving money for retirement or some other long term goal he already has a job he 's not really interested in another job he does n't want to spend thousands of hours doing research he should buy mutual funds or similar instruments to build diversified holdings all over the world he 's going to have is money invested for years at a time he wo n't earn spectacular amazing awesome returns but he 'll earn solid returns there will be a few years when he loses money but he 'll recover it just by waiting the second is the case of the day trader he attempts to understand ultra short term movements in stock prices due to news rumors and other things which stem from quirks of the market and the people who trade in it he buys a stock and when it 's up a fraction of a percent half an hour later sells it this is very risky requires a lot of attention and a good amount of money to work with and you can lose a lot of money too the modern day trader also needs to compete with the high frequency trading desks of wall street firms with super optimized computer networks located a block away from the exchange so that they can make orders faster than the guy two blocks away i do n't recommend this approach at all the third case is the guy who wants to beat the market he 's got long term aspirations and vision but he does a lot more research into individual companies figures out which are worth buying and which are not and invests accordingly this is how warren buffett made it big you can make it work but it 's like starting a business it 's a ton of work requires a good amount of money to get going and you still risk losing lots of it   the fourth case is the guy who mostly invests in broad market indexes like 1 but has a little money set aside for the stocks he 's researched and likes enough to invest in like 3 he 's not going to make money like warren buffett but he may get a little bit of an edge on the rest of the market if he does n't and ends up losing money there instead the rest of his stocks are still chugging along the last and way is to treat it all like magic buying things without understanding them or a clear plan of what you 're going to do with them you risk losing all your money you also risk having it stagnate good to see you want to avoid it

i can do better i can show you policy docs   gt religious organization exception under title vii religious organizations are permitted to give employment preference to members of their own religion the exception applies only to those institutions whose purpose and character are primarily religious factors to consider that would indicate whether an entity is religious include whether its articles of incorporation state a religious purpose whether its day to day operations are religious e.g. are the services the entity performs the product it produces or the educational curriculum it provides directed toward of the religion whether it is not for profit and whether it affiliated with or supported by a church or other religious organization   looks like my plumbing example may have been extreme because it does n't necessarily have a religious purpose under those terms but to be fair neither does the fortune 500 christian insurance company whose primary purpose is to sell insurance i was referring to earlier whose large legal department said we were legally safe to hire only christian salesmen and board members

before going into specific investments i think it would be a good idea to assess how free is that $ 5000 how much do you have to rely on it in emergency you always want to buy low and sell high however if you need to make unplanned withdraw from an investment you risk unfavorable market conditions at the time when you need the money and lose money that way one common suggestion is to keep 3 6 months living expense in checking saving very very liquid short term investments after that you can invest the rest in more profitable ventures   assuming that you are all set in that regard next consideration is whether you have any goal for the money besides generating the maximum return is this for retirement buying a house apartment a few year down the road graduate school emergency cash store for the time between graduation and getting a job or traveling a year in europe after graduation there are myriad of other possible goals knowing that you get a better idea of the time frame involved in the investment and what you need to do with your money if this is for retirement you just need to generate the highest possible return for 40 50 years while minimize taxes when you have to withdraw that money there are more nuanced concerns but large idea wise that 's what you need to do if you want it for a trip to an exotic location in 2 year then your primary goal will be to preserve the value of your capital while assessing whether you need to manage foreign exchange risk   the time frame also rule in or rule out certain types of investments if you are planning to use the money to purchase a house in 5 years iras probably would not be what you are looking for if you are planning to retirement short term cd would not be the most effective way after figuring out a bit of what you are trying to do with the money i think how you want to invest it will be much more clear to you in case of retirement people seem to generally recommend no load index funds and mid cap growth funds nothing is really off the table since your investment time frame is so long and you can tolerate risk you might also be interested to check out i have no relation with them a friend recommended it to me and i think their pitch make sense   in other cases it really is case dependent and there might have more than one solution to any case there is just one more potential investment venture that people you might not immediately thinking of and that might be of interest to you that is to use the $ 5000 as your own budget to build maintain connections with people and network use it to take professors out to a meal to pick their brain travel to keep in touch with old friends network with potential future employers and peers to improve job prospect or get opportunities to meet interesting people   i hope this helps

you do n't need a book you need to dig into the business and understand what has changed how long has there been a struggle to make ends meet what seasonality exists for the business look at the period over period change for each product category as well as each line item expense and find correlations that may exist if it 's possible find similar insights about competition both brick and mortar as well as online    it 's important to analyze the results of the business to understand 1 the normal and flows of the jewelry store seasonality and 2 any erosion of the business to online or brick and mortar competitors the other important takeaway is that you have to identify any changes in the business expenses are utilities suddenly taking up more of a share of the profits or are the costs of raw materials on the rise   look at the cash flow to see where the money is going or if there is a revenue problem if business is down and revenue as a result you know where to start perhaps the answer is marketing or providing additional products or services that better match the needs of the clientele who are dropping off i.e. online ordering and free shipping or product pricing is elevated above the competition on the other side if expenses have gotten out of control you know where to apply controls keep in mind that these are not mutually exclusive and the business could have a revenue and an expense problem   if you 've studied economics you have the skills to understand the numbers and drive out the answers but this problem requires application and not philosophy sociology or economics no single book can give you the step by step process every business is unique and no one but your family can provide the insights necessary to analyze the results    best of luck reach out with any additional questions

many mortgages penalize early payment and i assume it 's possible to disallow it altogether it makes sense why they do n't want early payment if you pay off the loan early it is usually because you re financed it to a loan with a lower rate you would do this when the interest rate is low lower than when you got your original loan if you pay it off early that means they will have to re invest the money again or they will lose money if they just have it sitting around however recall above that people pay it off early when the interest rate is low that is the worst time for them to re invest this into another mortgage because the rate will not be as good for them as the one you were originally going to keep paying

yes and no this really should be taught at junior school level in a capitalist country but that is a different argument a company is influenced by its shareholders but not in the way you are hoping this is the only area where a company must behave democratically with one share one vote if you own one share in a company specifically a voting share then you are entitled to attend an agm where you will have a vote on issues presented by the board you might have an opportunity to make a statement or ask a question at the agm but i would n't rely on it you will not be able to influence the companies behavior beyond that unless you control enough shares to influence the board notice i said control not own if you get other shareholders to agree to vote with you then you effectively control their shares shareholders are there to get a return on their investment so you must convince them that they will get a better return by agreeing with you then by following the board that they put there convince them that for example a lawsuit will rob the company of more value then the profit to be made and they might agree to not morals ethics justice etc are human attributes and since most shareholders are other corporations not humans they have no place in your arguments with one exception goodwill is a value that appears on a balance sheet and you might be able to use emotional arguments to show that there is a risk of a loss of goodwill from the proposed actions you can make your argument stronger by generating media pressure on customers and suppliers of the company to make critical public comments

just came across this news companies moving abroad no substitute corporate tax reform how stop article they make it sound quite straight forward and i do n't think they can be called totalitarian leftists by any stretch   here is the money quote   gt america ’s corporate tax has two horrible flaws the first is the tax rate which at 35 is the highest among the 34 mostly rich country members of the oecd yet it raises less revenue than the oecd average thanks to myriad loopholes and tax breaks aimed at everything from machinery investment to nascar race tracks last year these breaks cost $ 150 billion in forgone revenue more than half of what america collected in total corporate taxes gt   gt the second flaw is that america levies tax on a company ’s income no matter where in the world it is earned in contrast every other large rich country taxes only income earned within its borders here too america ’s system is absurdly ineffective at collecting money firms do not have to pay tax on foreign profits until they bring them back home not surprisingly many do not american multinationals have some $ 2 trillion sitting on their foreign balance sheets and growing    it seems clear that the 35 rate is not the driving reason for these huge companies doing inversions that 35 rate should almost certainly be cut down but the loopholes and tax breaks need to stop as a condition of a rate cut    clearly this is not a dead simple issue but i just do n't want to hear the silly argument of oh our poor mega corporations are having to pay the highest taxes in the world when the tax environment in the us is clearly rigged in their favor small and mid sized companies that ca n't afford their own congressman sure are getting fucked though and that makes me sad

lotteries are like the inverse of insurance policies instead of paying money to mitigate the impact of an unlikely event which is extremely negative you are paying money to obtain a chance of experiencing an unlikely event which is extremely positive one thing to keep in mind regarding lotteries is the diminishing marginal utility of money if you know you 'll never use more than say $ 100 million in your entire life no matter how much money you might acquire then buying tickets for lotteries where the grand prize is over $ 100 million stops being increasingly worth the price of entry personally i 'd rather play a lottery where the grand prize is million and where there are no prizes which are million because i do not believe that any other amounts of winnings are going to be life changing for me in a way that i am likely to fully appreciate

adding a couple more assumptions i 'd compute about $ would be that pay out in 2018   this is computed by taking the current portfolio 's holdings par values and dividing by the outstanding for those wanting specific figures used now for those assumptions something to keep in mind is that bonds can valued higher than their face value if the coupon is higher than other issues given the same risk   if you have 2 bonds maturing in 3 years of the same face value and same risk categories though one is paying 5 and the other is paying 10 then it may be that the 5 sells at a discount to bring the yield up some while the other sells at a premium to bring the yield down   thus you could have bonds worth more before they mature that will eventually lose this capital appreciation

a long put you have a small initial cost the option premium but profit as the stock goes down you have no additional risk if the shock rises even a lot short a stock you gain if the stock drops but have unlimited risk if it rises the call mitigates this by capping that rising stock risk the profit loss graph looks similar to the long put when you hold both the short position and the long call   you might consider producing a graph or spreadsheet to compare positions you can easily sketch put call long stock short stock and study how combinations of positions can synthetically look like other positions often when a stock has no shares to short the synthetic short can help you put your stock position in place

setting a certain of income for pension actually depends on person   always pay yourself first this is the quote which i love the most and which i am currently following   if you are planning to do 8 then why do n't you stretch a little bit more to 10 i suggest you to do monthly review if you can stretch more increase a little more by challenging yourself this is rewarding for pension plan there is supplementary retirement plan where foreigners can also set aside of their money this is long term plan and you can enjoy tax relief too the catch is you can only withdraw the money when you reach certain age otherwise you have to pay tax again certain once you decide to withdraw banks in singapore offers to open this account i suggest to compare pro and cons if you are planning to work in singapore for quite long you may wish to consider this useful links

afaik they use entirely different lte frequencies in japan and the us hence the issues with the new ipad being lte in the states but not here     additionally there are still japanese manufacturers who are big brands in the japanese market but more or less unheard of overseas   so there 's likely to be relatively limited scope for economies of scale regarding handsets   sure with a limited number of handsets e.g. the iphone you may be able to place a larger order but when was the last time you heard of a network operator dictating terms to apple   that 's why only softbank had the iphone at launch because they were the only one willing to cede to apple 's high pricing demands     and that 's before you even get into language related issues   as far as lte equipment goes it depends on suppliers and whether the of ordering equipment for two very different territories thousands of miles apart with very different geography will bear a lot of fruit   as for people traveling between japan and the states its such a tiny proportion of customers it would barely make a dent   and most corporate customers historically favor anyway and given japanese business culture are unlikely to change any time soon   in a nutshell the synergies may not be as strong as it first seems

generally in a swift transaction there are 4 banks involved at times 2 or 3 or at times even 6 the 4 banks are sender originator of payment sender 's correspondent receiver 's correspondent receiver or beneficiary bank all these 4 banks charge for making a transfer in sha the charges of sender and correspondent are levied to customer who initiates the payment and the receivers correspondent and receiver charges are to beneficiary in our all the charges of 4 banks are to the customer and in ben all the charges of 4 banks are to the beneficiary or am i wrong to assume that transaction costs would be covered by that and in reality the are on top of transaction costs as explained above it is incorrect assumption in this case the charges will be more so best is go with sha this gives a better view of charges on a eur to usd transactions there would typically be only 3 banks in the chain and depending on the bank it could also be just 2 banks involved

there is economic value added to the marketplace by having many investors trading stocks the stock market itself can be thought of as a tool which provides additional liquidity to the marketplace liquidity is the ease with which you can convert your assets into cash for example how quickly could you sell your car if you needed money to pay a medical bill without a stock market funds would be very illiquid an investor would likely need to post advertisements to have other people consider buying his her shares until the match between a buyer and seller is found the person with the shares ca n't use the cash they need on the other side of the transaction are people who have an appetite for risk this means that for various reasons they are willing to take on more risk than you if it pays off on average they are young and have many years of salary earnings in front of them or they are rich can afford to lose money sometimes if it pays off on average consider this like a transaction between your insurance broker you do n't want to pay for a new car if you get in an accident and you 're willing to pay total annual premiums that on average will cost more than that same car over time you do n't want the risk but the insurance company does that 's how they make money so by participating in any marketplace you are providing value in the form of liquidity and by allowing the market to allocate risk to those willing to take it on

there is almost always money involved somewhere but it does n't have to come from you   it can be investors credit cards or even seller financing i 've done all 3 examples if you can find partners with the money to make the deals happen then your job is to put the deal together   find the properties negotiate the price even get the property under contract all without any obligation or cost on your part yes it absolutely can be done   then your partners will fund the deal if it 's good enough and their terms are met etc in some areas you can put a property on a credit card   if you find a house say for $ 25,000 that will rent for $ 300/month and you can put it on a credit card especially at zero percent for a year or something similar then you can generate cashflow as a landlord without putting up any cash of your own on the purchase   of course there are many risks associated with landlording and i could tell you horror stories but we 're not addressing that here you can negotiate a sale with an owner who agrees to finance the entire purchase for you   i once purchased 3 properties at once this way from a seller who financed the entire sale all closing costs everything this way   of course they needed a lot of repair and such so i had to fund that another way but at least the purchase itself cost me no money out of pocket so these courses are not inherently scams in the sense that what they are teaching is usually i 'm sure there are exceptions true   however they generally give you enough information to get into trouble and not out   but that 's what true learning is it 's getting into trouble and finding a way out that does n't kill you   =)   that 's called experience and you ca n't buy that for any price

simply put you can not beat the market if by being informed and following all relevant news you can arrive at the conclusion that company a will likely outperform company b in the future then having a stocks should be better than having b stocks or any e.g. index based mix of them but as the whole market has access to the very same information and will arrive at the same conclusion provided it is logically sound everybody will want a stocks which thus become expensive to the point where the expected return is average again   your only options of winning this race are to be the very first to have the important information insider trade or to arrive at different logical conclusions than the rest of the world which boils down do making decisions that are not logically sound good luck with that or assuming that almost everybody else is not logically sound go figure

another possibly significant issue is that the number ten thousand is very important in the japanese language   in japanese you count in ones tens hundreds thousands ten thousands but instead of a hundred thousand you have ten ten thousands   and then one hundred ten thousands and then a thousand ten thousands    the ten thousand yen note equivalent roughly to the $ 100 bill is the main base of japanese currency   if you go to the bank for example you will almost always take out your money in ten thousand yen notes    knowing a little about the language i would say it would become quite strange and un natural to suddenly start using a hundred as the main note value   i doubt the japanese people would ever even consider that and my guess is the only people who are even put out by the large number of zeroes are foreigners who are used to dealing in dollars and cents

in addition to what quid said i think your risk tolerance should depend on how likely you are to need the funds in the near future say that you have $ 100k saved up and you want to decide how to invest it then you should ask yourself the idea here is that if you invest say in stocks high risk then the value of your position could drop significantly and you 'd potentially have to wait for a long time before it recovers if you are forced to sell you could make a substantial loss if you do n't urgently need this cash however then you can feel relaxed and just wait for the market to reverse again this is viewing risk through the lens of how likely it is that you 'll have to wait a long time to get a substantial amount of your money back which itself is a function of how likely it is for a substantial downturn to occur in a certain market

how does one buy this quantity of tips do you simply buy directly from the us treasury you will might have to go through a financial institution like a broker or a bank edit you can also buy bonds directly with treasurydirect is it cheaper to buy a fund that invests in tips it might be cheaper depending on the fund   itself but you ca n't know for sure the price that the fund will be worth at you payout date since bonds can go up in value and are likely to with rates this low is there a way to measure potential downside statistically speaking yes you can look at the variation in price interest of the bonds in the last years to see how they usually move then compute the price range where they are likely to be that can be wide for volatile securities but there is no guarantee that there wo n't be some black swan event that will make the price shoot up down in another word it 's speculation can i mitigate downside risk by choosing different tips maturity there are quantitative strategies to do that like finding that some products that are negatively correlated such that a loss in one is be hedged by a gain in another however those correlation are likely to be just statistics and for every product that you buy you are likely to have to pay some fees for your bank broker which can be more devastating than the inflation itself is there some other strategy i should be considering to protect my cash against inflation or maybe a mixed strategy as i wrote above trying to use complex financial products can incurs loss and will have fees both for buying and selling is it really necessary to hedge from a 2 inflation by taking such risk personally i do n't think so if i were you i would just be buying bonds maturing for your payout date that would negate the reselling risk and reduce the fees

i started storing and summing all my receipts bills etc it has the advantage of letting me separate expenses by category but it 's messy and it takes a long time   it sounds from this like you are making your summaries far too detailed do n't instead start by painting with broad strokes for example if you spent $ at the grocery store do n't bother splitting that amount into categories like toiletries hygiene products food and snacks just categorize it as grocery spending and move on to the next line on your account statement similarly unless your finances are heavily reliant on cash do n't worry about categorizing each cash expense rather just categorize the withdrawal of cash as miscellaneous and do n't spend time trying to figure out exactly where the money went after that because honestly you probably spent it on something other than savings because really when you are just starting out getting a handle on your spending you do n't need all the nitty gritty details what you need rather is an idea of where your money is going figure out half a dozen or so categories which make sense for you to categorize your spending into you probably have some idea of where your money is going these could be loans cost of living mortgage rent utilities housing home insurance groceries transportation car payments fuel vehicle taxes savings and so on whatever fits your situation add a miscellaneous category for anything that does n't neatly fit into one of the categories you thought of go back something like 3 4 months among your account statements do a quick categorization for each line on your account statements into one of these categories and then sum them up per category and per month calculate the monthly average for each category that 's your starting point the budget you 've been living by intentionally or not after that you can decide how you want to allocate the money and perhaps dig a bit more deeply into some specific category turns out you are spending a lot of money on transportation which you did n't expect look more closely at those line items and see if there 's something you can cut are you spending more money at the grocery store than you thought then look more closely at that and so on once you know where you are and where you want to be such as for example bumping the savings category by $ 200 per month you can adjust your budget to take you closer to your goals chances are you wo n't realistically be able to do an about face turn on the spot but you can try to reduce some discretionary category by say 10 each month and transfer that into savings instead that way in 6 7 months you have cut that category in half

i 'm not sure what tim cook being gay has to do with anything and considering the fact that he hosted a fundraiser for paul ryan it 's kind of a moot point to make   while he may not be a fan of all of president trump 's policies he is openly willing to work with the organization   zuckerberg on the other hand has personally and through his organization actively work against the president   he also skipped an earlier tech meeting at the beginning of the year sending if i remember correctly an executive assistant instead     so again no surprise that he skipped this one as well

that is exactly the problem people are n't seeing automation it makes things cheaper and more reliable than people it also cuts the man hours needed down to a small fraction of what it was before there have n't been enough new jobs created to make up for the jobs lost from automation   in a perfect world we would all just work a shorter schedule each and still live increasingly better lives as time went on but we all know that is n't going to happen at least not without huge changes to the whole world

lending is n't profitable when interest rates are this low   consider what 's involved to offer a savings or checking account   the bank must maintain branches with tellers   the bank has to pay rent or buy and pay property taxes and utilities   the bank has to pay salaries   the bank has to maintain cash so as to make change   and pay for insurance against robbery   all of that costs money    at 6 interest a bank can sort of make money   not great money but it takes in more than it has to pay out   at 4 interest which is about where ten year mortgage rates are in canada the bank does n't make enough margin   they are better off selling the loan and closing their branches than offering free checking accounts    an additional problem is that banks tend to make money from overdraft fees   but there 's been a move to limit overdraft fees as they target the most economically vulnerable   so canadian banks tend to charge monthly fees instead   uk banks may also start charging monthly fees if interest rates stay low and other fees get curtailed

when paying off multiple debts there is a protocol that many support payoff your debts according to the snowball method the snowball method proposes that you make minimum payments on all debts except the smallest one payoff the smallest debt as quickly as possible as smaller debts are paid off that makes one less minimum payment you need to make leaving you with more money to put against the next smallest debt so in your case pay off the smaller debt completely then follow up on the larger one by making regular payments at least equal to the sum of your two current minimum payments you 'll see immediate progress in tackling your debt and have one less minimum to worry about which can serve as a little safety of it 's own if you have a bad month as to saving the thousand dollars that is pragmatic and prudent it 's not financially useful you wo n't make any money in a savings account but having cash on hand for emergencies and various other reasons is an important security for modern living   as suggested in another answer you can forgo saving this thousand and put it against debt now because you will have a freed up credit card credit can certainly give you that same security this is an alternative option but not all emergencies will take a credit card you typically ca n't make rent with your credit card for example good luck paying your debts and i hope you can soon enjoy the freedom of a debt free life

i think it should be as well but i wonder how much more doping contributes to a win in cycling versus other sports such as soccer i could be wrong but i would think that with regards to winning sports such as cycling have a greater weighting on physical performance and though it is also important in sports such as soccer there is also a great weighting on skill and teamwork
