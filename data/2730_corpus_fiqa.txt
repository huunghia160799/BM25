it depends on how you place your stop order and the type of stop orders available from your broker if you place a stop market order and the following day the stock opens below your stop your stock will be stopped out at or around the opening price meaning you can potentially end up with quite a large gap if you place a stop limit order say you place your stop at $ 10.00 with a limit price of $ 9.90 and if the price opens below $ 9.90 say at $ 9.50 your limit sell order of $ 9.90 will be placed onto the market but it will not be executed until the price goes back up to $ 9.90 or above the third option is to place a guaranteed stop loss and as specified you are guaranteed your stop price even if the price gaps down below your stop price you will be paying an extra fee for the guaranteed stop loss order and they are usually mainly available with cfd brokers so if you are in the usa you might be out of luck

the w4 specifies withholding for income taxes fica taxes are not impacted the tax withholding is do that you do not need to make estimated tax payments failing to make sufficient quarterly estimated tax payments or withholding a sufficient amount could result in you being hit with under payment penalties but nothing more the under payment penalties will be figured out as part of you income tax return   what you should have done when you discovered this was use the extra withholding line on the w4 to further increase your withholding the nice thing about withholding is that you back load it and the irs does not care   the company has no liability here it is your responsibility to update them when your personal circumstances change you will be fully responsible for the tax bill   there is no company paid portion of your income tax so they are not impacted the company only pays an employer share of fica and that is not impacted by how you fill out the w4 first thing to do is figure out how much you owe the irs then determine if you can pay it or if you need to investigate an installment option in any case make sure to file your return on time

if you think about it it 's really all one big pot of money   the idea behind an emergency fund is that you want to make sure your financial life has stability it 's not going to be suddenly driven into the red below $ 0   as long as that does n't happen you can figure out how to live your life as you want the reason we separate out an emergency fund is to simplify decision making   in theory every single purchase you make should include a consideration of how it you   every $ 100 you spend on groceries is $ 100 you wo n't be able to bring to bear if you get fired or have a major accident   in practice this would be a crippling way of thinking about things   you do n't know what emergencies can hit you nor when they will hit   that 's why they 're emergencies   if you had to think about them all the time it 'd be horrible   you would end up simply not thinking about it like most people and then the emergency hits when you do n't have enough cash to stay solvent the purpose of an emergency fund is to help make these decisions easier   if you have money set aside for emergencies that you only have to think about every now and then you can make the decisions in the rest of your financial life without too much concern for them   you do n't have to worry about that $ 100 in groceries because you are confident that if an emergency hits that $ 100 wo n't be the straw that broke the 's back because you have reserves to draw on so you should define an emergency fund in a way which is most helpful for you to remain stable and solvent without having to fret about it too much   for most people the criteria for tapping that fund is very high because the goal is to not have to think about it all that much   if you wanted to you could feel free to lump those medium predictability items into the emergency fund but it just means you have to spend more time and effort thinking about the state of the fund   every medium predictability purchase has to come with the thought process what is the state of the emergency fund could this purchase meaningfully destabilize my ability to handle emergencies   your emergency fund might yo yo under these extra purchases which could force you to think about the state of your emergency fund for normal purchases   that 'd be bad different people might want to think about things different ways   i 'm a big picture guy so i prefer to think about all of my assets as one big account when i make a lot of my decisions   my wife on the other hand prefers not to have to think that way when she makes her purchases   for her having a very discrete emergency fund has great value   for me it has less   so when i look at the finances i choose to lump the emergency funds in with say the funds to re do our backyard something we are looking at doing over the next 2 5 years   for me that is the most natural way to deal with analyzing the risks i just have to be aware of how backyard purchases interact with our safety net   my wife prefers to keep those funds separate in her head so that she can look at how to spend money on the backyard without thinking about how it affects our emergency   while complicated it shows that even within a household it 's possible to think about emergency funding two different ways   it causes minimal headaches though a fair bit of book keeping so define emergency fund however suits you and your life best   however practically speaking most people find it desirable to not put those medium predictability purchases into the same bucket as emergencies   those that do find it desirable to put them in the same bucket typically have a personal reason for why that suits their needs better

there is no law requiring someone to return a refused check you need to clarify whether this payment is to establish a retainer or to pay for services rendered either way you should stop payment on the check and send them a certified letter explaining that you are stopping payment on the check because they refused it if the payment is to establish a retainer then the issue is simple the lawyer requires $ 10,000 as a retainer before you can engage them and until then you have no relationship with them if that is the amount they want then less than that is not accepted if the payment is for services rendered already and you owe them money then it is a completely different situation refusing partial payment means they are getting ready to sue you in a collection suit the larger the amount is the better normally someone owed money will only refuse a partial payment if they anticipate having to sue the debtor and they want to maximize their leverage in case of a court judgement in their favor a creditor has the right to refuse a partial payment

in the long term a p e of 15 25 is the more normal range with a 90 p e facebook has to quadruple its earnings to get to normal it this possible yes likely i do n't know   i am not a stock analyst but i love numbers and try to get to logical conclusions i 've seen data that worldwide advertising is about $ and us about $ if facebook 's profit runs 25 or so and i want a p e of 20 it needs profit of $ 5b on sales of $ 20b to reconcile its current $ 100b market cap no matter what fb growth in sales is the advertising spent worldwide will not rise or fall by much more than the economy so with a focus on ads they would need about 5 of the world market to grow into a comfortable p e.   flipping this around if all advertising were 25 profit a crazy assumption there are $ 100b in profit to be had world wide each year and the value of the companies might total $ 2 t in aggregate     the above is a rambling sharing of the reasonable bounds one might expect in analyzing a stock it can be used for any otherwise finite market such as soft drinks there are only so many people on the planet and in aggregate the total soft drink consumption ca n't exceed say 6 billion gallons per day the pie may grow a bit but it 's considered fixed as an order of magnitude    edit for what it 's worth as of the price has dropped significantly currently $ 20 and the p e is showing as i 'm not making any predictions but the stock needs a combined higher earnings or lower valuation to still approach normal

get an education a bachelor 's degree preferably but aa or even a certificate are fine too it will increase your earning potential significantly and over your lifetime it will earn you a lot of money   you make around $ 30,000 a year now median salary for someone with a bachelors in the is around $ 45,000 if you degree is in the stem field that goes up to $ 55,000 $ 65,000 range second best option is to start a small business of some kind that does not require substantial investment handyman comes to mind as an example or some sort of billing service maybe i would not recommend self directed investment in the stock market most people lose money and since you do n't have a lot of money to invest commissions and fees will eat up a significant portion of it i would usually recommend a cd but interest rates it 's not really worth it

diversification is extremely important and the one true free lunch of investing meaning it can provide both greater returns and less risk than a portfolio that is not diversified the reason people say otherwise is because they are talking about true portfolio diversification which can not be achieved by simply spreading money across stocks to truly diversify a portfolio it must be diversified across multiple unrelated return drivers i describe this throughout my best selling book and am pleased to provide complimentary links to the following two chapters where i discuss the lack of diversification from spreading money solely across stocks including correlation tables as well as the benefits of true portfolio diversification jackass investing myth 8 trading is gambling investing is safer jackass investing myth 20 there is no free lunch

you are suggesting something called dollar cost averaging or its cousin dollar value averaging   this is certainly a valid investment strategy although personally i feel that for long term investment it is not necessary unless you plan on being an active trader i still strongly encourage you to research these two methods and see if they would work well for your personal investment strategy and goals as far as what sorts of investments for a taxable account i have three general recommendations as far as which company to use for your brokerage i personally have accounts at price and fidelity i would strongly recommend fidelity out of those three mostly due to customer service and quality and ease of use of their website vanguard is a great brokerage but you do n't have to choose them just because you plan to mostly invest in vanguard funds i also recommend you research how capital gains and dividend taxing works and things like lost harvesting so that you can structure your investments with taxes in mind do this ahead of time do n't wait until april of 2016 because it will be too late to save on taxes by then

it is true as noted that you generally do not know when stock that you 're holding has been loaned by your broker to someone for a short sale that you generally consent to that when you sign up somewhere in the small print and that the person who borrows has to make repay and dividends the broker is on the hook to make sure that your stock is available for you to sell when you want so there 's limited risk there there are some risks to having your stock loaned though   the main one is that you do n't actually get the dividend   formally you get a substitute payment in lieu of dividends   the payment in lieu will be taxed differently   whereas qualified dividends get reported on form 1099-div and get special tax treatment substitute payments get reported on form 1099-misc box 8 is just for this purpose   substitute payments get taxed as regular income not at the preferred rate for dividends the broker may or may not give you additional money beyond the dividend to compensate you for the extra tax whether or not this tax difference matters depends on how much you 're getting in dividends your tax bracket and to some extent your general perspective if you want to vote your shares and exercise your ownership rights then there are also some risks   the company only issues for the number of shares issued by them   on the broker 's books however the short sale may result in more long positions than there are total shares of stock financially the extra longs are offset by shorts but for voting this does not balance i 'm unclear how this is resolved i 've read that the the brokers essentially depend on shareholder apathy but i 'd guess there 's more to it than that if you want to prevent your broker from loaning out your shares you have some options

the biggest and primary question is how much money you want to live on within retirement the lower this is the more options you have available you will find that while initially complex it does n't take much planning to take complete advantage of the tax system if you are intending to retire early are there any other investment accounts that are geared towards retirement or long term investing and have some perk associated with them tax deferred tax exempt but do not have an age restriction when money can be withdrawn   i 'm going to answer this with some potential alternatives the us tax system currently is great for people wanting to early retire if you can save significant money you can optimize your taxes so much over your lifetime if you retire early and have money invested in a roth ira or a traditional 401k that money ca n't be touched without penalty until you 're let 's ignore roth contributions that can technically be withdrawn ok the 401k myth the i 'm hosed if i put money into it since it 's stuck perspective is n't true for a variety of reasons if you retire early you get a long amount of time to take advantage of retirement accounts one way is to primarily contribute to pretax 401k during working years after retiring begin converting this at a very low tax rate you can convert money in a traditional ira whenever you want to be roth you just pay your marginal tax rate which for an early retiree might be 0 then after 5 years you now have a chunk of principle that has become roth principle and can be withdrawn whenever let 's imagine you retire at 40 with 100k in your 401k pretax for 5 years you convert $ 20k assuming married because we get $ 20k between exemptions deduction it means you pay $ 0 taxes every year while converting $ 20k of your pretax ira to roth or if you have kids even more after 5 years you now can withdraw that 20k year 100 tax free since it has become principle this is only a good idea when you are retired early because you are able to fill up all your free income for tax conversions when you are working you would be paying your marginal rate but your marginal rate in retirement is 0 related thread on a forum you might enjoy this is sometimes called a roth pipeline basically assuming you have no income while retired early you can fairly simply convert traditional ira money into roth principle this is then accessible to you well before the age but you get the full benefit of the pretax money but let 's pretend you do n't want to do that you need the money and tax benefit now how beneficial is it to do traditional 401ks imagine you live in a state city where you are paying 25 marginal tax rate if your expected marginal rate in your early retirement is 10 15 you are still better off putting money into your 401k and just paying the 10 penalty on an early withdrawal in many cases for high earners this can actually still be a tax benefit overall the point is this just because you have to work to get money out of a 401k early does not mean you lose the tax benefits of it in fact current tax code really does let an early retiree have their cake and eat it too when it comes to the roth traditional 401k ira question are you limited to a generic taxable brokerage account currently a huge perk for those with small incomes is that long term capital gains are taxed based on your current federal tax bracket if your federal marginal rate is 15 or less you will pay nothing for long term capital gains until this income pushes you into the 25 federal bracket   this might change but right now means you can capture many capital gains without paying taxes on them this is huge for early retirees who can manipulate income you can have significant income and not pay taxes on it you can also stack this with before mentioned roth conversions convert traditional ira money until you would begin owing any federal taxes then capture long term capital gains until you would pay tax on those combined this can represent a huge amount of money per year so littleadv mentioned hsas but for an early retiree they can be ridiculously good what this means is you can invest the maximum into your hsa for 10 years let it grow 100 tax free and save all your medical receipts etc then in 10 years start withdrawing that money while it sucks healthcare costs so much in america you might as well take advantage of the tax opportunities to make it suck slightly less there are many online communities dedicated to learning and optimizing their lives in order to achieve early retirement the question you are asking can be answered in the above but for a comprehensive plan you might want other resources some you might enjoy

normally when thinking about whether it 's worth it to start a small business the biggest factor is your time there 's a big difference between spending 10 hours to make a profit of $ 50 vs spending 1 hour to make a profit of $ 50 your scenario is quite different though in that you suggest your wife is considering teaching for free instead of accepting payment in this case the time factor almost goes away since if you accept payment there is very little extra time involved for depositing checks tracking income and filling out some extra forms come tax time from a financial point of view there is no reason to turn down the money if people are willing to pay it there may be other reasons to prefer doing it for free but taxes social security payments and the small extra effort to run the business would n't normally be among those reasons i do n't know what your reasons for possibly preferring to do it for free are but an alternative option to consider is to donate all of her income to charity

does the 5 year rule apply on the after tax 401k > roth 401k > roth    ira conversion of the 20000 including 10000 earnings that was    originally pre tax no the after tax amounts are not subject to the 5 years rule the earnings are how does this affect roth ira withdrawal ordering rules with respect    to the taxable portion of a single conversion being withdrawn before    the non taxable portion taxable portion first until exhausted to better understand how it works you need to understand the rationale behind the 5-year rule consider you have $ 100 k in your ira traditional and you want to take it out just withdrawing it would trigger a 10 k statutory penalty on top of the taxes due but you can use the backdoor roth ira right so convert the 100 k and then it becomes after tax contribution to roth ira and can be withdrawn with no penalty one form filled ad 10 k saved to block this loophole here comes the 5 years rule you can not withdraw after tax amounts for at least 5 years without penalty if the source was taxable conversion thus in order to avoid the 10 k penalty in the above situation you have a 5-year cooling period which makes the loophole useless for most cases however amounts that are after tax can be withdrawn without penalty already even from the traditional ira so there 's no need in the 5 years cooling period the withdrawal attribution is in this order roth ira rollovers are sourced to the origin e.g. if you converted $ 100 to the roth ira at firm x and then a year later rolled it over to firm y it does n't affect anything and the clock is ticking from the original date of the conversion at firm x. 5-year period applies to each conversion rollover from a qualified retirement plan see here distributions are applied to the conversions in fifo order so in one distribution depending on the amounts you may hit several different incoming conversions the 5 years should be check on each of them and the penalty applied on the amounts attributable to those that do n't have enough time 5-year period for contributions applies starting from the beginning of the first year of the first contribution that established your roth ira plan the penalty applies to the amounts that were included in your gross income when conversion occurred i.e. does n't apply on the amounts converted from after tax sources note the difference from the traditional ira distributions from pre tax sources are prorated between the non deductible basis amounts and the deductible earnings amounts taxable that is why the taxable amounts are first in the ordering of the distributions

basically the balance you see in your account is the amount of money you currently have a right to based on the fact that you have deposited it with the bank you can of course take this money out pretty well whenever you like or move it however you like however your bank account is not physical money the currency you is and used as the bank sees fit your account is simply a statement keeping track of how much money the bank is holding for you    the banks ability to use deposited funds to make money relies on the fundamental assumption that not everyone is going to withdraw all of there deposited funds at once all banks will have legislated liquidity requirements how much money needs to be kept in cash or near cash securities short term interest bearing paper basically in order to allow for pretty much any reasonable number of people to withdraw any amount of money additionally the bank as you said makes money on its loans securities trading and investment banking activities that money belongs to the bank and gives them even more money to play around with   obviously there have historically been instances in which bank runs occur everyone tries to withdraw all there money at once bank have enough liquid assets to pay or cases in which a bank experiences solvency issues for other reasons having to pay out poorly thought out speculative securities transactions re north american housing crash in 2008 in these cases there are consumer protection agencies that insure financial institutions against insolvency varies by country but under most normal circumstances the bank uses some portion of deposited funds to make money and has systems in place to ensure an individual person can access there deposited funds as needed    tldr account statement just shows how much money you have given the bank and can thus claim back from them in the form of withdraw bank has legally dictated cash reserve percentage to allow for everyone to withdraw money when they need it under most normal circumstances

dollar cost averaging would be the likely balanced approach that i 'd take depending on the size of the sum i 'd likely consider a minimum of 3 and at most 12 points to invest the funds to get them all working while the sum may be large relative to my net worth depending on overall scale and risk tolerance i could see doing it in a few rounds of purchasing or i could see taking an entire year to deploy the funds in case of something happening i 'd likely do monthly investments myself though others may go for getting more precise on things

start with the tax delta for example you 'd hope to deposit at 25 bracket but take withdrawals while at a marginal 15 in this case you 're 10 to the good with the 401(k and need to look at the fee eating away at this over time pay an extra and after 10 years you 're losing money that 's too simple however along the way you need to consider that the capital gain rate is lower than ordinary income it 's easier to take those gains as you wish to time them where the 401(k offers no flexibly for this even with low fees this account is going to turn long term gains to ordinary income note in 2013 a couple with up to $ in taxable income has a 0 long term cap gain rate so if they wish they can sell and buy back a fund claim the gain and raise their cost basis a tiny effort for the avoidance of tax on the gains each year first paragraph do n't forget there are the standard deduction exemption and 10 bracket while you are in the range to save enough to create he income to fill the low end at withdrawal there 's more value than just the 10 i discussed earlier   last there 's a phenomenon i call the phantom tax rate zone when one 's retirement withdrawals trigger the taxation of social security   it further complicates the math and analysis you seek

bargaining existed before the government officially granted people that right    collective bargaining is an ambiguous term that could refer to many concepts there is voluntarily agreed to collective bargaining which has nothing wrong with it and then there are laws that force the employer to collectively bargain with a union if a union requests it which is a mandate and violates the employer 's contract liberty   gt;however we 've been through that in this country and child labor unsafe working conditions and 80 hour weeks    i r business to this claim made by another redditor as well   gt;the prevalence of child labor was decreasing long before any law was created prohibiting it child labor is necessary in poor countries because people are far less productive per hour worked as productivity increases parents can afford to send their children off to school instead of working since their own work is enough to support the family   labor is something that needs to disappear on its own in response to changing economic conditions if you introduced a law prohibiting child labor in a poor country like cambodia right now it would lead to widespread hardship and an increase in mortality   gt;in other words no government mandate created due to union pressure can possibly lead to beneficial change since laws that limit people 's economic rights under the assumption that 51 knows what 's better for the minority than they themselves do generally do much more harm than good   nothing good comes for the country from using the threat of violence as all laws do to deny people a right to manage their own property how they see fit   gt;like all laws there is a balance to be struck between individual rights and the common good and what can be seen as a right for one can often be seen as a right to violate another 's rights for someone else   there is no game reason to assume or empirical evidence that suggests that violating people 's property ownership rights leads to a greater betterment of the common good than would have happened with property ownership rights intact   gt;&gt;the mighty is those who use the force of government or the threat of violence e.g. violent strikes to prevent another party from exercising their contract liberty and firing them   gt;this is some pretty extreme hyperbole and hard to take seriously   as history over the last century has shown it 's no hyperbole labor unions backed regulations soft socialism has succeeded in spite of the resistance of employers   membership in this country has dwindled to around 10 down from around 50 during the middle of the century and the erosion of the middle class has been the undeniable result   because unions have destroyed nearly every major industry where they had a natural tendency to form large scale capital intensive manufacturing operations where large numbers of workers were concentrated in one place    in no union dominated industries did unions fade due to greater power by employers vehicle manufacturing low value high volume consumer goods manufacturing ship building passenger rail service us steel in all of these industries the number of unionized employees declined because the industries themselves contracted in the us   the force of government you know we may have the right to strike in this country but there 's no law that says a company ca n't hire replacement workers indefinitely   the force of government prevents companies from refusing to collectively bargain with a labor union   of violence violent strikes this is a straw man if i 've ever seen one who is threatening violence here   this existed before government laws were created that made legal threats on behalf of employees that want to keep unionized employees employed and force companies to collectively bargain with a union   now of course the themselves are not directly threatening violence since they are backed by the force of government   when you look at the wealth disparity in this country it 's pretty hard to argue that the right to collective bargaining has resulted in an unfair advantage for workers   collectively bargaining does n't benefit workers in general it benefits in the short term those workers who are employed and unionized at the expense of long term wage growth and employment opportunities for the unemployed and non unionized employees

the home owner does not start foreclosure the bank decides when to foreclose   therefore you can not really decide a time to foreclose if you are trying to time the decision the process you miss payments and the banks will send you a late notice for the missing payments   expect many notices the bank will call you at home on your cell phone and at work   they will mail you letters regarding the missing payments if you continue to miss payments the bank will probably demand the loan be paid in full   you will owe the bank the full balance of the principle all past due interest all past due late charges and junk fees   the bank wo n't even take a normal monthly payment from you should you try to pay your regular payment again some law enforcement will notify you on the bank 's intent to foreclose   the bank has begun legal proceedings legal notices are published in the local newspaper soon the notices and the legal waiting period will expire   court proceedings happen   the court will then allow the bank to foreclose notices to into the paper again about the updated status of the foreclosure the house is sold at auction money from the auction is used to pay taxes owned then mortgages then other liens or creditors who file further debt for the home owner taxes when sold if the mortgage debt exceeds the home 's fair market value us federal tax rules say the selling price as the fair market value the fair market value can still be higher than the tax basis which i think is the value of the house at the time of original purchase plus improvements    if the fair market value is higher you will own taxes on sale   however tax rules in the us say if you have owned the home more than two years and make less than $ 250,000 in the transaction $ 500,000 if married you will not owe any tax   state taxes can be different additionally if the mortgage lender the debt and does n't create a deficiency that income is taxable as well   this is more an more common these days   there are exceptions if the home is your primary residence this whole process an take several months to occur but depends on where you live   if you continue to live in the home after the auction the new owner must evict you from the property which is another set of legal proceedings your credit and ability to buy are home will be damaged for the next several years i am not so sure on how pmi works for the banks but i know they are getting some money back

ok looking at the balance sheet they have $ 42 m in cash but that is down from $ 325 m in december meanwhile their debt has increased from $ in december to $ as of june so their net cash has dropped by $ m in only 6 months it looks like they spent $ m give or take buying other companies in those 6 months otherwise their working capital an important measure of the ability to run the business looks ok at $ looking at the income statement they are making money $ m in the last quarter on revenue of $ m which is quite remarkable however they had an unusual item which increased earnings somewhat otherwise their earnings would have been about $ 39 m which is still pretty healthy   all in the company itself looks healthy and on a bit of a buying binge growing through acquisition i do n’t like the debt load but that is probably usual for the industry   when companies grow through acquisition they generally plan to reduce total employment because of redundancies because you sort of get economies of scale this usually factors into the decision to buy the company you increase revenues through the purchase and reduce costs by eliminating employees this is typically how they sell an acquisition to investors   if i was to guess and it would only be a guess this company has a team which looks at the employees of the company it just bought and decides where to downsize it may not downsize from the newly acquired company but from its own existing employees for a variety of reasons so most likely that is what you were a victim of it was n’t because the company was struggling or because you were necessarily not a good employee it is a process albeit sometimes unfair and you were a victim of it   the layoff decisions are not always prudent and it can be hard to understand why a particular group was cut instead of another one management does n’t always make the right call the broadcast industry has been going through consolidation companies buying companies for some time now most likely management is hoping to bulk up to make it harder for another company to buy it and/or to get a better price when it is bought    so in summary most likely they are doing this for reasons of greed ie they ’ll make more money with fewer employees sorry about your situation

in the uk recent changes to pension taxation mean that from april 2011 people earning between £ 150,000 and £ 180,000 total and making large pension contributions > £ 50,000 or so will pay a marginal tax rate on additional salary of > 100 this is because pension contributions normally attract tax relief at the highest marginal rate i.e. 40 if the gross salary is above about £ 40,000 and 50 for salaries above £ 150,000 but after april 2011 the rate of relief will be down for gross salaries above £ 150,000 reaching 20 for a gross salary of £ 180,000 so for example if you earn £ and make a contribution of £ 50,000 then an additional £ 1,000 in salary will incur £ 500 of direct tax and also lead to a 1 reduction in tax relief from 25 to 24 costing another £ 500 once you factor in national insurance of another 1 or so the net effect of the pay rise is negative

i 'm not an expert by any means but pretty much every source i 've seen says that one year is far too short for any sort of real investment   most guides suggest that anything less than 3 5 years should stay in no risk accounts like savings or cds   if you need to be sure you get all of the money back after just one year any sort of market based investment e.g. stocks or bonds is too risky one option is to buy i bonds   you can buy up to $ 10,000 worth in a calendar year and 12 months is the minimum holding period   the advantage of i bonds is that the interest rate is indexed to inflation so that roughly speaking they can not lose value in real dollars   right now they pay per year which is substantially better than you 're likely to get with a savings account or 12-month cd   this would come to $ if you buy $ 10k of i bonds if you sell before holding them for five years which you will under your plan you forfeit the last 3 months worth of interest   even so your effective rate will likely be better than a savings account or cd   also you could get 12 months worth of interest if you 're able to buy them slightly early and/or postpone your sabbatical slightly so that you hold them for 15 months your other option is to find the best rate you can in a cd or savings account   nerdwallet for instance suggests you could get between 1 and 1.1 for a $ 10k deposit in a 1-year cd which would be about $ 100 as you can see either way your money is not going to grow that much   you 'll be gaining somewhere in the ballpark of a couple hundred dollars at most   there just is n't a way to earn more than that in one year without some risk of losing principal i 'm assuming based on your texas flag pic that you live in the usa   to buy i bonds you must be a us citizen resident or government employee

any time someone starts asking you to provide personal information such as a birth date it could very well be a scam   this is especially true if it 's someone you do n't even know   be very careful about getting involved in such situations there is always some kind of almost believable story to what the scammers tell you and unless you 're willing to look deeper into it then it 's easy to get pulled in   on top of that you have to ask yourself why did they pick me for this because that 's the real question    you have no idea what else the software they 're asking you to download might do that you would n't know about but offering to pay you something is a good way for them to get you to bypass your own security by installing it yourself   if the offer sounds too good to be true or too easy you have to question it and in such cases your best bet is to stay away from it altogether

one key to trading is recognizing expectations   what you see in the market is not always a reflection of fundamentals sometimes it 's a reflection of what people expect to occur whether that actually happens or not is debatable when a currency experiences inflation such as the cpi being higher today for the usd it may see an increase because people expect that the central bank will raise rates   again this may not be the case and the traders with this expectation could be wrong   if you 're seeing a currency rise after reported inflation more than likely traders expect the inflation to benefit the currency in the longer run finally on the economics side and economists here can debate this at least in the past the view was that there was a relationship between inflation and unemployment see the phillip 's curve   this idea depending on who you ask was refuted in the 70s when we had both high inflation and high unemployment stagflation   supposedly if we have high unemployment we should have low inflation so we can always raise inflation to have low unemployment   note that you will still find some economists who think the phillip 's curve is true so refuted depends on who you ask from what i 've read austrian economists are the only economists who see inflation as always bad long story short i think it 's paul who argues that deflation is actually good like you 're seeing other economists might see it as a good sign and it 's only a concern when it 's very high hyperinflation

this is largely dependent on your overall investment goals gic 's provide protection of the invested capital and a guaranteed return at the end of the term however in real terms 1.4 over 18 months results in a loss of capital in real terms this is because inflation in canada is just about at or higher than 1.4 per year in other words at best you are inflation and gaining nothing in those 18 months if their typical rate is 1.2 over 12 months you are only gaining an additional 0.2 for the additional 6 months you know as well as i do 0.2 for 6 months is abysmal if you have no use for the money in the medium to long term you should look in to an index fund that is balanced and diversified and more likely to get you a higher real return over the time period of a few years look in to if you want to preserve the capital over the short term because you might need it after the 18 months period the gic is the safer and recommended option

i get the sense that this is a the world is unfair there 's no way i can succeed question so let 's back up a few steps income is the starting point to all of this   that could be a job or jobs or running your own business from there you can do four things with your income obviously spend and give do not provide a monetary return they give a return in other ways such as quality of life helping others etc save gives you reserves for future expenses but it does not provide growth so that just leaves invest   you seem to be focused on stock market investments which you are right take a very long time to grow although you can get returns of up to 12 depending on how much volatility you 're willing to absorb but there are other ways to invest   you can invest in yourself by getting a degree or other training to improve your income   you can invest by starting a business which can dramatically increase your income in fact this is the most common path to millionaire in the us and probably in other free markets you can invest by growing your own existing business   you can invest in someone else 's business you can invest in real estate that can provide both value appreciation and rental income   so yes investment is a key aspect of wealth building but it is not limited to just stock market investment you can also look at reducing expenses in order to have more money to invest also keep in mind that investment with higher returns come with higher risk both in terms of volatility and risk of complete loss and that borrowing money to invest is almost always unwise since the interest paid directly reduces the return without reducing the risk

someone posted a very insightful article on reddit a while back that basically explained the whole cable pricing model and why a la carte would n't work or would be so prohibitively expensive that nobody would go for it    iirc the breakdown was that basically a few super popular channels and live sports in the standard $ 100/mo package helped subsidize the rest of the less popular channels       most of the niche channels probably could n't exist in an a la carte environment unless they were ridiculously cheap and if they were ridiculously cheap they would n't be able to generate enough revenue to stay afloat    also how would the pricing work   could i subscribe to amc for 1 hour a week to watch mad men   or would i be locked into subscribing for a minimum of a day week month       imho what makes more sense is to allow people to subscribe to individual shows like rss feeds

because an equity option can be constructed at essentially any price by two willing counterparties on an exchange there are not enough to represent the entire i.e. infinite option chain for even a single stock on a single expiration date   as a result are not generated for each individual possible options contract   instead the isin is used only to refer to the underlying symbol and a separate formula is used to refer to the specific option contract for that symbol so that code you pasted is not an isin but rather the standard us equity option naming scheme that you need to provide in addition to the isin when talking to your broker note that and formulas for referring to option contracts in other countries can behave quite differently   also there are many countries and markets that do n't need because the products in question only exist on a single exchange   in those cases the exchange is pretty much free to make up whatever id scheme it wants p.s. now i 'm curious how option chains are identified for strike prices above $   i looked up the only stock i can think of that trades above that price brk.a but it does n't seem to have an option chain or at least google does n't show it

gt;the only explanation i can imagine is that production costs are too high     i think this is precisely it   it costs too much to produce in the us so production is outsourced   given that many people are payed based on working in production jobs outsourcing leads to less money   so eventually the us will lose money until the point where production in the us is cheap enough to bring it back     but anyway my point was that interpretation of keynesian economics by a few people does not mean that keynesian economics are wrong   these people may simply have an interest in not mentioning the exporting of production jobs   in which point they would be willfully manipulating the paradigm

in practice most maybe all stock indices are constructed by taking a weighted average of stock prices denominated in a single currency and so the index implicitly does have that currency as you suggest us dollars for the s&p 500 in principle you can buy one unit of the s&p 500 for $ or whatever by buying an appropriate quantity of each of its constituent stocks also in a more realistic scenario where you buy an index via a tracker fund you would typically need to buy using the underlying currency of the index and your returns will be relative to that currency if the index goes up by 10 your original investment in dollars is up by 10

what littleadv said is correct   his worth is based on the presumed worth of the total company value which is much greater than all investment dollars combined because of valuation in other words his worth is based on the potential return for his share of ownership at a rate based on the latest valuation of the company he is worth $ 17.5 billion today but the total funding for facebook is only $ 2.4 billion i do n't understand this in private companies valuations typically come from either speculation analysts or from investments   investment valuations are the better gauge because actual money traded hands for a percentage ownership however just as with public companies on the stock market there are at least two caveats just because someone else sold their shares at a given rate does n't mean that rate in both cases it 's possible the value may be much lower or much higher   some high value purchases surprise for how high they are such as microsoft 's acquisition of skype for $ 8.5 billion the formula for one owner 's worth based on a given acquisition is valuation = acquisition amount acquisition percent worth = owner 's percent × valuation according to wikipedia zuckerberg owns 24   in january goldman 's invested $ 500 million at a $ 50 billion valuation that is the latest investment and puts zuckerberg 's worth at $ 12 billion however some speculation places a facebook ipo at a much higher valuation such as as $ 100 billion   i do n't know what your reference is for $ 17 billion but it puts their valuation at $ billion between the january goldman valuation and current ipo speculation for instance originally invested $ 10,000 which at his estimated 5 ownership would now be worth $ 3 5 billion

firstly you mean resistance not support as a support is below the current price and resistance is above the price secondly using a ma as support or resistance would mean that that support or resistance level would move up or down as the price moved up or down and would not be static at $ 25 generally stocks will range trade more often than they will be trending either up or down so a stock can be range trading between a support and resistance levels for months and even years and usually the longer it range trades for the bigger the outbreak either up or down will be when it does happen using a ma especially shorter dated ones as support or resistance or as a up or down trend line works better when a stock is already trending up or down when a stock is moving sideways it will tend to keep crossing above and below the ma and you will be if you try to use them as your trigger for entry in these situations compare the two charts below   in the first chart the stock is up trending for over 6 months and the ema is being used as a support or up trending line as long as the price does not break through and close under the ema then the uptrend continues you could use this ema line as a means of entering the stock when prices move towards the ema and bounce off it back up again or you could use it as your stop loss level so if price closes below the ema line you would sell your position   in the second chart the stock has been range trading between the support line at about $ and the resistance line at about $ for 10 months in this case the price has been moving above and below the ema during these 10 months and you may have been many times if you were trading each break above or below the ema a better strategy here would be to buy the stock as it approached the support line and bounces up off it and then close and reverse your position go short when the price approached the resistance line and bounces down off it   edit when range trading you would have your stops just below the support line when going long and just above the resistance line when going short that way if it does break through support or resistance and starts trending you will be covered so this shows that different strategies should be used when a stock is trending to when it is range trading mas are better used as entry signal during an established uptrend or downtrend than when a stock is range trading

while i agree with ben a lot i feel like his answer is really poor here you do not call a number to give your credit card information out for a refund   that is ridiculous   just from his answer he has had 5 cases of fraud lately you should know that you should n't follow this advice i personally do n't ever give my credit card number over the phone unless it is the very very very last resort   it is not just about money and safety but it is about time   every time that you give your number out over the phone there is a chance that the employee on the other end by either scam or legitimate business will use or sell your info   so you need to determine if the time saved by doing a transaction over the phone is worth hours days of your time if your card has a fraud issue   and note that fraud sometimes is easily negated but if done smartly can be hard to prove via a quick call or email to card company what should you do tell company that you will simply get the refund through your credit card company and if we go back to time element   you fill out form on card website   card company goes back to vendor and says why are you asking for card numbers via email   card company either cancels vendor contract or more likely helps them understand the technology available so they do n't have to do this   therefore that quick form that you filled out will now keep this company from bugging you again   by going through their archaic systems you are enabling their behavior

adp does not know your full tax situation and while the standard exemption system actually designed by the irs not adp works fairly well for most people it is an approximation   this system is designed so most people will end up with a small refund while some people will end up owing small amounts   so while it is possible that adp has messed up the calculations it is unlikely this is the cause   the most likely cause is that approximation ends ups making you pay less tax during the year than you actually owe a few people like your friend may end up owing large amounts due to various circumstances   it is always your responsibility to make sure you pay enough tax throughout the year   while this technically means that you need to do your taxes every quarter during the year to make sure you pay the correct tax during the year for most people this ends up being unnecessary as the approximation works fine   it is possible the exemption system failed your friend but much more commonly people owe penalties because they put the wrong number of exemptions or had other side income on a related note most people in finance would argue that your situation where you owe some money at tax time but not so much that you have to pay a penalty is actually the best way to go   getting a tax refund actually means you paid more tax than you needed to   this is similar to giving an interest free loan to the government

for personal investing and highly risky securities wasting assets which is exactly what options are it is better to think in terms of sunk costs do n't chase this trade trying to make your money back you should minimize your loss unwind the position now while there is still some remaining value in those call options and take a short term loss or you could try this   let 's say you own an exchange traded call option on a listed stock very general case i do n't know how much time remains before the option 's expiration date be that as it may i could suggest this to effect a recovery   you 'll be long the call and short the stock this is called a delta hedge as you would be delta trading the stock delta refers to short term price volatility   in other words you 'll short a single large block of the stock then buy shares in small increments whenever the market drops slightly on an intra day basis when the market price of the stock rises incrementally you 'll sell a few shares back and forth in response to short term market price moves while maintaining a static hedge ratio as your original call option gets closer to maturity roll it over into the next available contract either one month or preferably three month time to expiration if you do n't want to or ca n't borrow the underlying stock to short you could do a synthetic short a synthetic short is a combination of a long put and a short call whose pay off replicates the short stock payoff   i personally would never purchase an unhedged option or warrant but since that is what you own right now you have two choices get out or dig in deeper with the realization that you are doing a lot of work just to trade your way back to a net zero   while you can make a profit using this sort of strategy i 'm not certain if that is within the scope of the website

first of all in the u.s. no federal gift tax has to be paid by the recipient of   the gift it is the donor who has to pay gift tax if any is due nor does the recipient have to pay federal income tax on the gift it is not considered taxable income   i do not believe that any states view matters differently for the purposes of state gift and income taxes but i am always ready to be of any such held notions if your parents were required to pay any gift tax that would have been at the   time the gift was originally given and only if they gifted more than the maximum allowable exemption per person for that year currently the exemption is $ 14 k from each donor per recipient per year additional gifts were made by your parents to you during your minority when your parents paid any income tax   due on the distributions in your account but these amounts would unlikely to have been larger than the exemption for that year in any case gift tax is   none of your concern if you have been declaring the income from distributions from the mutual funds all these years then the only tax due on the distributions from the funds in 2013 is the federal income tax for the 2013 tax year plus a special assessment of medicare tax on investment income if your income is large unlikely based on your question and follow up comment   if you sold all or part of your shares in the funds in 2013 then you would need to calculate the basis of your investments in the fund in order to figure out if you have capital gains or losses   ditto if you are thinking of cashing out in 2014 and wish to estimate how much income tax is due but if you want to just hang on to the funds then there is no immediate need to figure out the basis right away though taking care of the matter and keeping in top of things for the future will be helpful as a final note there is no tax due on the appreciation of the fund 's shares the increased value of your account because the fund 's share price rose is not a taxable event nor are decreases in the account deductible these are called unrealized capital gains or losses and you do not pay tax on them or deduct them as losses until you realize the gains by   disposing of the property

others have already made good points so i 'll just add a few more you say that if you bought it your mortgage insurance and taxes minus the rental income from the bottom floor would leave you with costs of 1/4 of your current rent that means you 're getting a fantastic deal on the purchase price i suspect you may be underestimating some of those costs so get exact figures on the mortgage insurance and taxes and do the math if it is that good go for it just make sure to get that home inspection in case there 's major problems and they 're trying to get out while the 's good also some advice be prepared to cover that entire monthly cost for a few months units can stand empty for a while also you may want to rent out slowly a good found after a couple months is much better than a bad found quickly also have some money set aside for as a renter you 've never really had to think about that before but as a homeowner you do as a landlord it 's even more important you can not fix something in your own home for a while if you needed to wait but in a unit you have to fix it immediately   finally taxes you do get to deduct interest and so on but it 'll work a little differently than you think you 'll have to split it in half if the units are the same size and deduct half the interest as a normal homeowner deduction the other half as a business expense same for pmi insurance and property taxes if you do maintenance that effects both units like fixing the roof half will be deductible the other half not however maintenance that only affects the tenant unit is fully deductible   you can claim depreciation but only for half so your starting amount you can depreciate would be purchase price land same thing here half is your home the other half is a business   note that some things you 'd think of as maintenance costs actually ca n't be deducted only depreciated over time take that leaky roof for example if you replaced it instead of repairing it you could not deduct your replacement costs it counts as an improvement and gets added to your cost basis where you depreciate it along with half the house   if your tenant 's refrigerator went out and you replaced it you could n't deduct that either however you can depreciate all of it on another schedule seperate from home depreciation if you repaired it instead you can deduct all of it immediately   taxes suck

given that you are starting with a relatively small amount you want a decent interest rate and you want flexibility i would consider fixed deposit laddering strategy let 's say you have to start with split this in to three components purchase all of the above at the same time 30 days later you will have the first fd mature if you need this money you use it if you do n't need it purchase another 90-day fixed deposit if you keep going this way you will have a deposit mature every 30 days and can choose to use it or renew the fixed deposit this strategy has some disadvantages to consider as for interest rates the length of the fixed deposit in positively related to the interest rate if you want higher interest rates elect for longer fixed deposit cycles for instance when you become more confident about your financial situation replace the 30 60 90 day cycle with a 6 12 18 month cycle the cost of maintaining the short term deposit and new purchases if your bank does not allow such transactions through on line banking you might spend more time than you like at a bank or on the phone with the bank you want a monthly dividend but this might not be the case with fixed deposits it depends on your bank but i believe most indian banks pay interest every three months

there is a significant tie between housing prices and mortgage rates   as such do n't assume low mortgage rates mean you will be financially better off if you buy now since housing prices are inversely correlated with mortgage rates   this is n't a huge correlation it 's r squared is a bit under 20 at a 1.5 2 year lag but there is a significant connection there   particularly in that era see chart at end of post for details in 1979 1982 there was a dramatic drop in housing price growth that with high interest rates there is a second major factor here though one that is likely much more important why the interest rates are at 10   interest rates are largely set to follow the federal funds rate the rate at which the federal reserve loans to banks   that rate is set higher for essentially one purpose to combat inflation   higher interest rates means less borrowing slower economic growth and most importantly a slower increase in the money supply all of which come together to prevent inflation those 10 and higher rates you heard about   those were in the 70 's and early 80 's   anyone remember the jimmy carter years   inflation in the period from 1979 to 1981 averaged over 10   inflation in the 70s from 1973 to 1982 averaged nearly 9 annually   that meant your dollar this year was worth only $ 0.90 next year which means inevitably a higher cost of borrowing    in addition to simply keeping pace with inflation the fed also uses the rate as a carrot stick to control us inflation   they were n't as good at that in the 70s they misread economic indicators in the late 1970s significantly lowering rates dramatically in 1975 from ~12 to ~5   this led to the dramatic double digit inflation of the 1979 1981 period requiring them to raise rates to levels nearly 20 at one point   yeah i hope nobody bought a house on a fixed rate mortgage from 1979 1981 the fed has gotten a lot more careful over the years alan greenspan largely was responsible for the shift in policy which seems to have been quite effective from the mid 1980s to the present though he 's long gone from his spot on the fed board   despite significant economic changes in both directions inflation has been kept largely under control since then and since 1991 have been keeping pretty steady around 6 or less   the current rate around 0 is unlikely to stay around forever that would lead to massive inflation eventually but it 's reasonable to say that prolonged periods over 10 are unlikely in the medium term    further if inflation did spike and with it your interest rates salaries tend to spike also   not quite as fast as inflation in fact that 's a major reason a small positive inflation around 2 3 is important to allow for wages to grow more slowly for poorer performers but still at 10 inflation the average wage will climb at a fairly similar pace   thus you 'd be able to buy more house or perhaps a better idea save more money for a house that you can then buy a few years down the road when rates drop ultimately the advice here is to not worry too much about interest rates buy a house when you 're ready and buy the house you 're ready for   interest rates may rise but if so it 's likely due to an increase in inflation and thus wage growth and it would take a major shift in the economy for rates to rise to the 10 11 level   if that did happen housing prices or at least growth in prices would likely drop significantly some further references

sovereigns can not go bankrupt basically when a sovereign government this includes nations and us states probably political in other countries as well becomes insolvent they default   sovereigns with the ability to issue new currency have the option to do so because it is politically sovereigns in default will negotiate with creditor committees to reduce payments creditors with debt backed by the full faith and credit of the sovereign are generally first in line creditors with debt secured by revenue may be entitled to the underlying assets that provide the revenue the value of your money in the bank in a deposit account may be at risk due to currency devaluation or bank failure a default by a major country would likely lock up the credit markets and you may see yourself in a situation where money market accounts actually fall in value

asking why the p e was so high is best answered because reported earnings were so low recall that the s&p500 bottomed in early march 2009 when the panic of the financial crisis reached exhaustion   as noted on the page you have linked the reported p e ratios are computed using reported earnings from the trailing twelve months   during those twelve months the banks were writing down all of the bad debt associated with the mortgage backed securities that has lost so much value   this meant that the banks were reporting negative earnings   since the financial sector is a large part of the s&p500 this alone had an enormous effect on the index p e   however the problem was compounded by a general collapse in earnings across the economy as consumers reacted to the resulting uncertainty   the same site reports earnings for the previous years at $ for the s&p500 compared to $ for the year prior to 2008   that is a collapse of about 78 in earnings   although the s&p500 has suffered badly during this time stock market investors being forward looking were starting to price in improved earnings by may 2009   indeed the s&p500 was up about 33 in just two months from its low in to mid   thus by may of 2009 prices were not suffering to the same extent as reported trailing earnings   this would account for the p e value reporting in

i 'm a woman in her early 30s who has a bachelors degree and a job   i rent an apartment own my car and spend within my means because that 's what i was taught   when my sister and now ex bro in law decided to buy a house in the middle of the bubble despite having no saved money and a child on the way i shook my head at them   they responded with real estate only goes up it 's an i laughed and told them they were fucking stupid to pay $ 350,000 for an older 2 bedroom house in phoenix az that was severely overpriced but they said well it 's 0 down and the interest rate is like nothing   cut to now the same house is worth maybe $ 110,000 but ya know that great interest rate they got at the beginning was n't so great when they had to refi so they did n't want to pay their payments for a $ 110,000 house with a $ 350,000 loan so they stopped paying their mortgage   nothing really happened except some letters were sent and was told that the only way to get a better interest rate was to have to miss a certain number of payments maybe 6 months in order to qualify for the loan the obama admin had created   at some point that year she decided to get a job tuck and and her and her husband felt the need to purchase all kinds of new things   she eventually did qualify for that government help and was totally forgiven for the 6 8 months of payments they missed so clearly purposely missing payments would have been considered very smart by those same analysts who called what american airlines did as very smart     so i sit here with my morals in tact and they sit there like a million other people in this country having their cake and eating it too so i have to wonder what the fuck was i the stupid one for not following the rest of the asshole idiot sheep and screwing all the people with what i would have thought were basic morals   it appears so

as you are not a tax resident in india the income you have earned can be moved to india tax free however if you are investing the funds into say shares fixed deposits etc the income you earn on these funds is taxable in india the funds can be transferred directly into savings account however its to open an nre nro account as its easier to track funds for tax purposes i.e. these accounts by nature certify that the funds received into them are from foreign sources and can easily be explained to the tax authorities however establishing the origin of funds in ordinary savings accounts needs more paper work whenever there is a scrutiny by tax authorities on this savings account it would need more efforts to establish that the credits are from foreign earnings

buffett is a value investor his goal is to buy good companies when the market is overly worried and prices them below intrinsic value when the market is highly priced it is much more difficult for him to find things that he thinks are at an attractive price when people are very worried and the market has crashed stocks are then priced below their intrinsic value and he can use the cash he keeps in the company to make attractive purchases remember that buffett is not concerned with the ups and downs of the price of berkshire hathaway stock he is concerned with the economic value of the assets that the company owns so if all stock prices crash and he can buy things that are at bargain prices he is happy no matter what berkshire stock price does in the short run one consequence of value investing is that because you are buying assets at bargain prices the total value of your assets drops less in a bear market than the highly priced stuff that drives the major indexes

paper money and coins cost real resources too but it does n't matter much that it costs resources except maybe for the environment   no institutions controlling the price and supply is a good thing i prefer a currency in which the global market decides the price and not some government i do n't trust that keeps printing more and more for decades causing the currency to lose value over time   bitcoin and cryptocurrencies will never replace normal currencies but they are already competing and it 's good that governments and banks   do n't have an oligopoly anymore    bitcoin is a great mix of a currency and for longterm inflation it 's easily and divisible without a third party and because it 's scarce yet more accessible than gold it 's a great place to store value to escape an economic crisis or simply monetary inflation   now you 'll probably say something volatile is n't safe enough for a but i think the higher the price and the longer it exists the less volatile the bitcoin price will be and that the longterm trend will be up even after it the of gold   meanwhile cryptocurrencies are a great way to interesting projects and create value out of nothing enriching young smart people whom will be able stimulate the global economy

in theory you can buy shares directly from someone else who owns them in practise if the stock is listed on an exchange they are unlikely to own them directly they are likely to own them through an intermediary you will have to pay fees to that intermediary to transfer the shares to your name there are thousands of small companies owned by the guy who started it and a few other investors you can buy stock in that kind of company directly from the existing owners as long as they are willing to sell you some it 's a super high risk investment strategy though this is the kind of deal that happens on dragons den

first of all you nit wit are a group of languages which includes arabic and the arabs by far outnumber you so i ca n't be anti semitic   how the jews have seemed to take the phrase semitic and coin anti semitic to mean a hatred of jews seems to me classic jewish misdirection you may rest assured i hate no language   now if you wish to speak about why i think the jews have been a plague on mankind through the centuries and always the root cause of strife and conflict i have many valid arguments to their display of despicable behavior starting with palestine and the apartheid regime the world looks away from in shame   right here in america we have the jewish control of the federal reserve and the treasury and banking system which continuously put us through the boom and bust cycle we have jews the white house and driving policies that are anti america and pro israel and the we can argue the subject for as long as you like   my point here was that the american people have become so blind and that america can be taken to war in iraq because israeli intelligence decided that they had wmd and it was a threat to israel syria is also a threat to israel and iran is also a threat to israel and so is afghanistan and of course pakistan and saudi arabia   from the looks of it israel and the jews seem to think a majority of the semitic world is out to destroy them so it would seem actually the pitiful few jews left over after the holocaust are actually the anti   and most surprising is the fact that the pitiful few jews actually grew in population during the course of wwii which would actually quite possibly with that rate of breeding make them rabbits thus i would have to plead guilty of being anti rabbits and thank the lord that rabbits have lots of natural predators or jews would grow as big as but fortunately the british had the foresight to not make israel in australia because while they took a pair of rabbits there in the 1700 hundreds look at their population now   we would have a serious jew population explosion on our hands and since they would then be a majority of the semitic languages would be forced to the rabbit population in australia using biological agents and the few potent ones left we could eat in what could later be called the big roast on the in the biggest act of antisemitism that never happened   i am afraid at this point i would like to take the phrase antisemitism back from you and suggest you use a phrase closer to what you are trying to say jew hater   as for me i absolutely hate fucking rabbits

i do n't know what you mean by claim for taxes i think you mean pay taxes    i 'm not sure how corps function in canada but in the us single owner limited liability entities typically pass the net income through to the owner to be included in their personal tax return    so it seems all of this is more or less moot because really you should probably already be including your income sourced from this project on your personal taxes and that 's not really likely to change if you formed something more formal   the formal business arrangements really exist to limit the liability of the business spilling over in to the owner 's assets   or trouble in the owner 's life spilling over to the business operation   i do n't know what kind of business this is but it may make sense to set up one of the limited liability arrangements to ensure that business liability does n't automatically mean personal liability a sole proprietorship or in the us we have dba doing business as paperwork will get you a separate tax i d number which may be beneficial if you ever have to provide a tax id and do n't want to use your individual id but this wo n't limit your liability the way incorporating does

1 yes both of your scenarios would lead to earning $ 10 on the transaction at the strike date if you purchased both of them call it scenario 3 you would make $ 20 2 as to why this transaction may not be possible consider the following the call and put pricing you describe may not be available what you have actually created is called arbitrage 2 identical assets can be bought and sold at different prices leading to a zero risk gain for the investor in the real marketplace if an option to buy asset x in january cost $ 90 would an option to sell asset x in january provide $ 110   without adding additional complexity about the features of asset x or the features of the options buying a call option is the same as selling a put option well when selling a put option you do n't have the ability to choose whether the option is exercised meaning buying options has value that selling options does not but ignore that for a moment that means that you have arranged a marketplace where you would buy a call option for only $ 90 but the seller of that same option would somehow receive $ 110   for added clarity consider the following what if in your example the future price ended up being $ 200 then you could exercise your call option buying a share for $ 90 selling it for $ 200 making $ 110 profit you would not exercise your put option making your total profit $ 110 now consider what if in your example the future price ended up being $ 10 you would buy for $ 10 exercise your put option and sell for $ 110 making a profit of $ 100 you would not exercise your call option making your total profit $ 100 this highlights that if your initial assumptions existed you would earn money at least $ 20 and at most unlimited based on a skyrocketing price compared to your $ 90 put option regardless of the future price therefore such a scenario would not exist in the initial pricing of the options now perhaps there is an initial fee involved with the options where the buyer or seller pays extra money up front regardless of the future price that is a different scenario and gets into the actual nature of options where investors will arrange multiple simultaneous transactions in order to limit risk and retain reward within a certain band of future prices   as pointed out by r this fee would be very significant for a call option which had a price set below the current price typically options are sold out of the money initially which means that at the current share price at the time the option is purchased executing the option would lose you money if you purchase an in the money option the transaction cost initially would by higher than any apparent gain you might have by immediately executing the option for a more realistic options example assume that it costs $ 15 initially to buy either the call option or the put option in that case after buying both options as listed in your scenarios you would earn a profit if the share price exceeded $ 120 the $ 120 sale price less the $ 90 call option = $ 30 which is your total fee initially or dropped below $ 80 the $ 110 put price less the $ 80 purchase price = $ 30 this type of transaction implies that you expect the price to either swing up or swing down but not fall within the band between $ perhaps you might do this if there was an upcoming election or other known event which might be a failure or success and you think the market has not properly accounted for either scenario in advance i will leave further discussion on that topic arranging options of different prices to create specific bands of profitability loss to another answer or other questions which likely already exist on this site or in fact other resources because it gets more complicated after that point and is outside the root of your question

it would be nice if the broker could be instructed to clear out the position for you but in my experience the broker will simply give you the shares that you ca n't afford then freeze your account because you are over your margin limit and issue a margin call this happened to me recently because of a dumb mistake options i paid $ 200 for and expected to expire worthless ended up slightly itm so they were auto exercised on friday for about $ 20k and my account was frozen only able to close positions   by the next monday market news had shifted the stock against me and i had to sell it at a loss of $ 1200 to meet the margin call   this kind of thing is what gives option trading a reputation for danger a supposedly turned into a 6x greater loss   i see no reason to ever exercise i always try to close my positions but these things can happen

in most jurisdictions both the goods raw materials and the service class are being sold to the customer who is the end user and thus the sale is subject to sales tax so when your friend charges for the class that $ 100 is subject to all applicable sales taxes for the jurisdiction and all parent jurisdictions usually city county and state the teacher should not have to pay sales tax when they buy the flowers from the wholesaler most jurisdictions charge sales tax on end user purchases only however they are required to have some proof of sales tax exemption for the purchase which normally comes part and parcel with the dba or other business entity registration paperwork in most cities states   wholesalers deal with non end user sales exempt from sales tax all the time but your average michael 's or hobby lobby may not be able to deal with this and may have to charge your friend the sales tax at pos depending on the jurisdiction if this happens your friend may be able to reduce the amount the customer is paying that is subject to sales tax by the pre tax value of the materials the customer has paid for which your friend already paid the tax on

it 's not a bad strategy i 'd rather owe money at 4 interest than at 6 7 however there is something to consider   consolidating debt into a new loan can backfire when you have money borrowed at 7 you want to get that paid off as quickly as possible once you have that converted to 4 if you think now i can take my time paying off this debt then you are n't really better off in fact if you take too long paying off the new loan you might end up paying more interest than if you had kept the high interest loan and paid it as soon as possible do n't lose your drive to get out of debt after you refinance   as far as how the student loans affect your debt to income ratio i 'm not sure however if they do count i think they do your ratio will not really be going up by taking out the new loan since you are using the money to pay other debt make sure the new lender knows this so they take that into consideration when making their decision   overall i like your strategy pay off what you can right away the car loan and the highest interest student loans and reduce the interest on the rest just make sure that you continue to pay down that debt as quick as you can

gt the essential reason for this is that rising premiums in silver plans would trigger an increase in tax credits for low income individuals whose premium paying responsibilities are limited by the aca   so if i 'm understanding this correctly a reduction in subsidies for silver plan recipients would result in higher premiums overall which would result in low income individuals losing enough income to qualify for other tax benefit programs that would cancel out these higher premiums    if that is the case what an odd take on that scenario it 's finding the one silver lining in a very very bad situation the case described would push a lot of people off the cliff of self sufficiency and the headline makes that sound like a good thing

another reason and to me the main reason not to buy a house if you 're in your early 20s regardless of your income is mobility if you rent you can move pretty much whenever you want after the first year of your rental lease is up even before then in some cases if your finishes school and gets a great job offer in another city or state you can move there pretty quickly when you own a house that is much harder to do your having two kids makes it harder in either case but at this point in your lives you really do n't know where your future will take you geographically speaking and renting gives you the option of moving easily if you have to

it depends on how much equity you have in your home scenario 1 your home is worth $ 100 k and your current mortgage is for $ 100 k or more which means you are underwater in this case you ca n't get a 2nd mortgage because that being said you can use different portions of equity in your home as collateral for multiple mortgages as long as none of the equity overlaps but you may need permission from the primary mortgage bank first for example scenario 2 your home is worth $ 100 k and your current mortgage is for $ 80 k meaning you currently have $ 20 k in equity it is possible to get a 2nd mortgage or home equity line of credit for $ 20k. as a side note if your loan agent is telling you to use a different bank it sounds like she is trying and willing to do something shady if you are in scenario 1 i 'd find a new agent

i think the key concept here is future value   the nav is essentially a book keeping you add up all the assets and remove all the liabilities   for a public company this is spelled out in the balance sheet and is generally listed at the bottom   i pulled a recent one from cisco systems because i used to work there and know the numbers   and you can see it here roughly $ 56 billion   another way to think about it in theory and we know about this right the nav is what you would get if you liquidated the company instantaneously   a definition i like to use for market cap is the current assets plus the perceived present value of all future earnings for the company so let 's that a little   the term present value is really important because a million dollars today is worth more than a million dollars next year   a company expected to make a lot of money soon will be worth more i.e. a higher market cap than a company expected to make the same amount of money but later   the all future earnings part is exactly what it sounds like   so again following our cisco example the current market cap is billion which means that the market thinks they will earn about $ 85 billion over the life of the company in present day dollars

i think wikipedia offers a very good explanation a dividend reinvestment program or dividend reinvestment plan drip is an equity investment option offered directly from the underlying company the investor does not receive quarterly dividends directly as cash instead the investor 's dividends are directly reinvested in the underlying equity the investor must still pay tax annually on his or her dividend income whether it is received or reinvested this allows the investment return from dividends to be immediately invested for the purpose of price appreciation and compounding without incurring brokerage fees or waiting to accumulate enough cash for a full share of stock so essentially a dividend reinvestment plan is offered by companies directly allowing investors to bypass brokerages and immediately re invests dividends rather than paying them out in cash investopedia also gives a definition a plan offered by a corporation that allows investors to reinvest their cash dividends by purchasing additional shares or fractional shares on the dividend payment date   a drip is an excellent way to increase the value of your investment most drips allow you to buy shares commission free and at a significant discount to the current share price most drips do n't allow much lower than $ 10   i had a hard time finding a comprehensive listing of companies that offered or drips but offers these suggestions   finding a dividend reinvestment plan offers one stop shopping for hundreds of dividend reinvestment plans they offer a searchable list that can be filtered to easily find a dividend reinvestment plan that fits your needs you can also use probably the best way to find out if a company offers a dividend reinvestment plan is to visit the company website most companies have an investor relations area that will highlight the various options available to for example coca cola disney and wal mart hope this helps

i ca n't speak for the us but i 've completed direct tax payments via my online bank account for business and personal in two countries south africa and the uk   i find it easier and with a better record that the transaction took place than any of the other methods available including going directly into a tax office to pay by cheque mail can go missing in their offices takes hours and the result can still be by them   ditto allowing them to do a pay run on your account they can make a mistake and you 'll have difficulty proving it   a payment via my bank account gives me an electronic record and i can ensure all the details are correct myself in addition in the uk paying online gives you a good few months extra grace to pay   even in south africa online payments are given a few weeks grace over physical payments   their that you paying electronically saves them processing time

a company has 100,000 shares and 100,000 unexercised call options company issued share price and strike price both at $ 1 what country is this related to    i ask because in the us most people i know associate a call option with the instrument that is equivalent to 100 shares    so 100,000 calls would be 10,000,000 shares which exceeds the number of shares you 're saying the company has    i do n't know if that means you pulled the numbers out of thin air or whether it means you 're thinking of a different type of option perhaps you meant incentive stock options meant to be given to employees   each one of those is equivalent to a single share   they just are n't called call options in the rest of my answer i 'm going to assume you meant stock options i assume the fact that these options exist will slow any price increases on the underlying shares due to potential dilution i do n't think the company can just create stock options without creating the underlying shares in the first place   said another way a more likely scenario is that company creates 200,000 shares and agrees to float 50 of them while reserving the other 50 as the pool for incentive employee stock   they then choose to give the employees options on the stock in the incentive pool rather than outright grants of the stock for various reasons   one of which is being nice to the employees in regards to taxes since there is no us tax due at grant time if the strike price is the current price of the underlying stock an alternative scenario when the company shares are traded is that the company simply plans to buy back shares from the market in order to give employees their shares when options are exercised   in this case the company needs the cash on hand or cash flow to take money from to buy those shares at current prices anyway in either case there is no dilution happening when the options get exercised   any dilution happened before or at the time the options were created    meaning the total number of shares in the company was already pre set at an earlier time   as a result the fact that the options exist in themselves will not slow price changes on the stock however price changes will be impacted by the total float of shares in the company or the impact to cash flow if the company has to buy shares to redeem its option commitments    this is almost the same thing you 're asking about but it is technically different as to timing if this is the case can this be factored into any option pricing models like black scholes you 're including the effect just by considering the total float of shares and net profits from cash flow when doing your modelling

you manage this account just as any other account petty cash refers to accounts where the cash money is intended for ad hoc purchases where you store an amount of cash in your drawer and take it out as needed however other than naming it petty cash there 's nothing petty about it it 's an account just as any other many choose to just deduct the amount transferred to petty cash account and not manage it at all here the amount matters some smaller amounts can fall under de minimis rules of the appropriate regulatory authority since you told nothing about where you are and what your business is we ca n't tell you what the rules are in your case if you track the usage of this account and from your description it sounds like you are then the name petty cash is meaningless it 's an account just like any other since you have an employee dealing with this cash you should establish some internal audit procedures to ensure that there 's no embezzlement and everything is accounted for you will probably want to reconcile this account more often than others and check more thoroughly on what 's going on with it since its a personal finance forum i 'm assuming you 're a sole proprietor or a very small business and sec sox rules do n't apply to you if they do you should have a licensed accountant cpa or whatever public accountancy designation is regulated in your area to help you with this

i completely agree with pete that a 401(k loan is not the answer but i have an alternate proposal reduce your 401(k contribution down to the 4 that you get a match on   if you are cash poor now and have debts to be cleaned up those need to be addressed before retirement savings   you 'll have plenty of time to make up the lost savings after you get the debts paid off    if your company matches 50 meaning you have to contribute 8 to get the 4 match then consider temporarily stopping your 401(k altogether a 100 match is very hard to give up but a 50 match is less difficult   you have plenty of years left ahead of you to make up the lost match   plus the pain of knowing you 're leaving money on the table will incentivize you to get the loans paid as quickly as possible   it seems to me that i would be reducing middle to high interest debt while also saving myself $ 150 per month   no you 'd be deferring $ 150 per month for an additional two years and not reducing debt at all just moving it to a different lender interest rate is not your problem   right now you 're paying less than $ 30 per month in interest on these 3 loans and about $ 270 in principal and at the current rate should have them paid off in about 2 years   you 're wanting to extend these loans to 4 years by borrowing from your retirement savings    i would buckle down reduce expenses wherever possible cable cell phone coffee movies restaurants until you get these debts paid off   you make $ 70,000 per year or almost $ 6,000 per month   i bet if you try hard enough you can come up with $ 1,100 fairly quickly then the next $ 1,200 should come twice as fast then attack the next $ 4,000 you can argue whether the $ 1,200 should come first because of the interest rate but in the end it does n't matter either one should be paid off very quickly so the interest saved is negligible maybe you can get one of them paid off get yourself some breathing room then loosen up a little bit but extending the pain for an additional two years is not wise some more drastic measures

from the etoro website in the financial trading industry rollover is the interest paid or earned for holding currency overnight each currency has an interest rate associated with it and because currencies are traded in pairs every trade involves two different interest rates if the interest rate on the currency you bought is lower than the interest rate on the currency you sold then you will pay rollover fees if the interest rate on the currency you bought is higher than the interest rate of the currency commodity you sold then you will earn rollover fees

in theory yes it makes sense to sell your current bonds in pursuit of higher yields in practice there are a lot of smart people out there who own bonds and the market is very efficient so you wo n't see opportunities to trade new bonds for old bonds with better yields from the same issuer if you do find someone willing to buy your old bond for a higher amount it probably points to a change in the contract that the new bonds were issued under see argentina for an example

the question is asking for a european equivalent of the so called couch potato portfolio couch potato portfolio is defined by the two urls provided in question as criteria for fund composition fixed income regardless of country or national market the fixed income fund should have holdings throughout the entire length of the yield curve most available maturities as well as being a mix of government municipal general obligation corporate and high yield bonds   equity the common equity position should be in one equity market index fund it should n't be a or or djia type fund instead you want a combination of growth and value companies the fund should have as many holdings as possible while avoiding too much expense due to transaction costs you can determine how much is too much by comparing candidate funds with those that are only investing in highly liquid large company stocks why it is easier for u.s. and canadian couch potatoes it will be easier to find two good funds at lower cost if one is investing in a country with sizable markets and its own currency that 's why the couch potato strategy lends itself most naturally to the u.s.a canada japan and probably australia brazil south korea and possibly mexico too in europe pre eu any of germany france spain italy or the countries would probably have worked well the only concern would be possibly higher equity transactions costs and certainly larger fixed income buy sell spreads due to smaller and less liquid markets other than germany these costs would be experienced by the portfolio manager and passed on to you as the investor for the eu couch potato remember the criteria especially part 2 and the intent as described by the couch potato name implying extremely passive investing you want to choose two funds offered by very stable reputable fund management companies you will be re balancing every six months or a year only that is four transactions per year maximum you do n't need a lot of interaction with anyone but you do need to have the means to quickly exit both sides of the trade should you decide for any reason that you need the money or that the strategy is n't right for you   i would not choose an etf from ishares just because it is easy to do online transactions for many investors that is important here you do n't need that convenience instead you need stability and an index fund with a good reputation you should try to choose an eu based fund manager or one in your home country as you 'll be more likely to know who is good and who is n't do n't use vanguard 's ftse etf or the equivalent as there will probably be currency and foreign tax concerns and possibly forex risk the couch potato strategy requires an emphasis on low fees with high quality funds and brokers if not buying directly from the fund as for type of fund it would be best to choose a fund that is invested in mostly or only eu or european economic union stocks and the same for bonds that will help minimize your transaction costs and tax liability while allowing for the sort of broad diversity that helps buy and hold index fund investors

if you have someplace to put the money which you think will yield significantly better returns by all means sell and buy that on the other hand if you think this stock is likely to recover its value you might want to hold it or even buy more as a contrarian investment buy low sell high as much as possible and diversify you need to make a judgement call about the odds we can point out the implications but in the end whether to sell buy hold or hedge is your decision this also suggests you need to sit down and draw up a strategy over every decision is not productive if you have a plan you make this sort of decision before you ever put money into the stock in the first place

well taking a short position directly in real estate is impossible because it 's not a fungible asset so the only way to do it is to trade in its derivatives investment fund stock indexes and commodities correlated to the real estate market for example materials related to construction     it 's hard to find those because real estate funds usually do n't issue securities and rely on investment made directly with them another factor should be that those who actually do have issued securities are n't usually popular enough for dealers and market makers to invest in it who make it possible to take a short position in exchange for some spread so what you can do is you can go through all the existing real estate funds and find out if any of them has a broker that let 's you short it in other words which one of them has securities in the financial market you can buy or sell one other option is looking for real estate property derivatives like this particular example personally i would try to find other securities that may in some way correlate with the real estate market even if they look a bit far fetched to be related like commodities and stock from companies in construction and real estate management etc and trade those because these have in most of the cases more liquidity hope this answers your question

tarp was billion of loans to institutions   loans that are to be paid back with interest albeit very low interest   a significant percentage of the tarp loans have been or will be paid back   so the final price tag of the tarp was only a few $ billion pretty low considering the scale of the program there is ~$10 trillion in mortgage debt outstanding   that 's a much higher price tag than tarp   secondly paying off the mortgages = no repayment to the government as there was with tarp   the initial price tag of your plan would be ~$10 trillion instead of a few $ billion furthermore how does a government with > $ 15 trillion in debt already come up with an extra ~$10 trillion to pay off people 's mortgages   should the government go deeper into debt   print more money and trigger inflation note   some people like to talk about a secret bailout by the fed implying that the true cost of tarp was much higher than claimed by the government   the secret bailout was a series of short term low no interest loans to banks   because they were loans which were paid back my point still stands   some other issues to consider remember that the principal balance of your mortgage is only a small portion of your payments to the bank   over 30 years you pay a lot of $ $ $ in interest to the bank that 's how banks make a profit   banks are expecting that revenue and it is factored into their financial projections   if those revenue streams suddenly disappeared i expect it would majorly screw the up the financial industry many people bought houses during the real estate boom when housing prices were inflated far beyond the real value of the house   is it right to overpay for these houses   this rewards the banks for accepting the inflated value during the appraisal process   loan modification forces banks to accept the real value of the house the financial crisis was triggered by people buying houses they could not afford   should they be rewarded with a free house for making poor financial decisions

i 'm in the us and i once transferred shares in a brokerage account from schwab to fidelity   i received the shares from my employer as rsus and the employer used schwab    after i quit and the shares vested i wanted to move the shares to fidelity because that is where all my other accounts are   i called fidelity and they were more than happy to help and it was an easy process   i believe schwab charged about $ 50 for the transfer the only tricky part is that you need to transfer the cost basis of the shares   i was on a three way phone call with schwab and fidelity for schwab to tell fidelity what the purchase price was

wells fargo   they have an account called an umbrella account for checking savings mortgage and brokerage accounts   it would cost $ but i never had to pay because i have a rollover retirement account that is enough to waive the fees   they count all accounts including mortgage which i used to have   oh and no restrictions   an added advantage is there are no fees for any of the accounts nor for some other things like bank checks outside atm fees etc     i 'm in california so i do n't know if the same deal exists in other states   but if you qualify for the free account it 's pretty good   actually most of my investments are vanguard funds   and i have another rollover account with vanguard and never pay fees but i only buy or sell from one vanguard fund to another and rarely since i have targeted retirement funds that are designed to be no maintenance   for some reason i trust vanguard more than most other funds maybe because i like their philosophy on low cost funds which they started but are now getting more popular

we can not know if you owe them anything but at the least i would expect that they do n't just say you owe us but we found out that we were supposed to pay you $ x but we paid you $ y which is more and then we can go from there   there are things like we should have paid you $ per hour for the last year but we paid you $ 12.50 per hour where you can tell them that by paying you that rate you assumed it was correct one you would n't have worked for less so they effectively gave you a raise on the other hand if they say you worked here for 38 hours a week but we paid you for 40 hours a week and you did indeed work only 38 hours then most likely they are correct

i think that history shows that it 's rarely necessary for violence to lead to social reform there 's always been a of war between the upper class and the middle lower classes the term working class was a way to unify middle and lower classes against the wealthy idle class unfortunately the wealthy were able to convince many white collar middle class people that they were upper middle class and that the upper middle class shares values and goals with the elite if you look at the numbers this could n't be more wrong   by any standard i am a very fortunate person i have a six figure income and some assets however the truly elite in the us enjoy household wealth and income that dwarf what i make i pay a much higher percentage of my income to taxes than a person with inherited wealth does why is the system this way it 's effectively a barrier no matter how hard we work or how well we do we ca n't break through to the upper class instead of a meritocracy we have an aristocracy this is the great lie at the center of american politics today   the have the many of the best and brightest convinced that we 're part of the club when we 're really not and never can be they 've turned us against the blue collar workers and the poor when we should all be together they 've convinced many that people like the current administration trying to create more upward mobility are anti american when it 's really the aristocracy that violates democratic values of equality and   however we can vote for leaders who might do better we can peacefully assemble think ows we can go on reddit and share our political and economic opinions because of these freedoms we can safely say violence is a remote last resort   nothing is inevitable economic growth is really just people finding ways to interact and deliver value to one another and fortune favors the bold i 'll stay optimistic and keep making money as well as trying to help my community i 'll bet dollars to donuts change can and will happen   just because enough people will get sick of the of the world all the wealth and we 'll find a political solution   tl;dr martin king we 'll work it out like with our words

every time you buy or sell a share for some price somebody must have thought that that was exactly the right moment to sell or buy that share at that price and to trade with you every time a trade is made both sides think they are doing the smart thing most of the time one will turn out to be wrong the other right nothing in your proposed method of trading explains why you would be the side that was right more often so they 'll probably even out or maybe there are people in the market who actually do have a slightly better than average method and you 'll be wrong somewhat more often than right each trade has transaction costs if you simply hang on to your shares that 's more or less the same as evening out good trades and bad trades but without the transaction costs

i do n't work for the po but i 'm a client this issue is the last straw for me with what 's happened to the us and a.   read the constitution people   article i section 8 clause wiki of the united states constitution known as the postal clause or the postal power congress to establish post offices and post roads i mean wtf its in the goddam constitution its not some sort of half assed law that was passed to test kids or make pizza a fucking vegetable the founding fathers put this in there on purpose   the post office has an awesome responsibility to provide a communication system for the entire country and overseas possessions you can send a letter to alaska texas california maine or guam yes you can send a letter to goddamn guam at 1st class rate zip code range for no extra charge the po has got army 's of trucks and that get the mail out pretty much all the time yeah shit happens weather disasters etc maybe you run into some asshole at the po but hey my mom tells me there 's a dick in every crowd i do n't take it personal imho truth of the matter is that if we could provide healthcare like we provide mailing services shit this country would be 1st tier again   but does fedex ups dhl etc do that do they have a facility in nearly every major population center does fedex ups dhl etc have offices that they operate in every town hell no they even use po services for things that are not economically viable   the establishment of the post office enabled the nation to grow rural free delivery sparked sears ward etc an entire retail industry the rail post which was way more efficient than trucking and was used as an organizational model for ma bell that 's right the exec who organized ma bell into a powerhouse was a former railway post employee   the republican congress and blue dog democrats too are killing this national asset the post office is essential to the basic components of our society its bullshit that electronic mail etc is making this form of communication obsolete much like the paperless office is still needed the service needs to be capable and free to move with the market not what some asshole senator rep who 's on the take from or   etc how would they be able to recruit new members anyway without their stupid solicitation junk mail you ca n't delete a piece of with a click you actually have to touch it why do you think business still make goddam catalogs victoria 's secret must have an entire forest dedicated to theirs   this is also a thinly veiled attack on veterans us veterans get preferential status when taking the postal exam yes exam that guy or gal behind the counter might just have taken a bullet for this pathetic excuse for a country he or she was repaid by getting a few extra points so that he she could potentially get a decent paying job with promotional potential you know not be fucking homeless wtf is wrong with that gee i think i know why the number of homeless veterans has increased in the past 10 years you become a career post office employee by taking an exam and what 's wrong with being a career postal employee a letter carrier a wtf do we look down upon these careers my kids watch and pbs kids programs and guess who brings goddam birthday cards it ai nt the goddam fedex ups or dhl man these are careers and individuals that are pillars of our society you meet people at the post office you interact with other citizens and the post office in your town give your town legitimacy    its really sad    tl dr   what congress is allowing to happen to the postal service is a fucking crime

the problem is the h1b program is currently being abused to fill entry level positions which it was n't designed to do   now we have a glut of american entry level tech workers unable to find work because companies use h1b workers to fill entry level spots why because it 's cheaper they can save $ 10k per year per worker and here 's the real kicker most of these h1b workers go back to their home country once finished so the talent and money does n't stay in the states and now we have a shortage of senior tech workers because who would have thought that not giving entry level workers here the chance to work while tossing away the h1b workers every five years would bite them in the ass

why would anyone listen to someone else 's advice because they believe that the person advising them knows better than they do it 's as simple as that   the fact that you 're doing any research at all indeed the fact that you know about a site on the internet where personal finance questions get asked and answered puts you way ahead of the average member of the population when it comes to pensions   if you think you know better than the adviser and i do n't mean that aggressively just as a matter of fact then by all means do your own thing but remember about unknown unknowns you do n't know everything the adviser might say depending on your circumstances and changes to them over time

your plan will work to increase your total credit capacity good for your credit score and reduce your utilization also good   as mentioned you will need to be careful to use these cards periodically or they will get closed but it will work the question is whether this will help you or not   in addition to credit capacity and utilization your credit score looks at things like these factors may hurt you as you continue to open accounts   you can easily get to the stage where your score is not benefitting much from increased capacity and it is getting hurt a lot by pulls and low average age btw you are correct that closing accounts generally hurts your score   it probably reduces average age may reduce maximum age reduces your capacity and increases your utilization

your question is unclear about whether you are moving from bi weekly payments or to bi weekly payments let 's calculate each case bi weekly pay means you will be paid every two weeks the amount for each payment will be your annual salary divided by 26 possibly with a small decrease around 0.3 to account for the fact that years are slightly longer than 52 weeks i.e. there are slightly more than 26 two week periods in a year and possibly an even smaller adjustment to take account of the fact that some years are a day longer than that you will be paid literally every 14 days with some adjustments if a payday falls on a holiday if you are going to be paid twice a month then each payment will be your annual salary divided by 24 typically you are paid on the same days of each month for example the 1st and the or the last business day before those

as stated in the other answer debit card payments even contactless ones do not debit instantly or anywhere near instantly they can take several days or even longer however the fact that the payment was approved would indicate that the contactless device used by the retailer managed to connect to your bank account and could see there were sufficient funds   at this time the payment should also have reserved the funds so it will be pending as such   your online banking may not show all types of pending transactions it may only show direct debits for example if you ring the bank i expect they will be able to see this payment and advise accordingly out of interest who do you bank with if you can see your available funds you should find that includes this payment having been reserved ie you ca n't use that money but if it 's a small amount you may struggle to spot it   again this will vary by bank and how their internet banking system has been implemented i would expect this payment to debit your account the working day after you made it or at worst the day after that   in theory with faster payment technology it could happened within 2 hours but not all banks implemented that system in the same way so delays can and do occur   if the retailer merchant banks with the same bank you do in theory the transaction could be instantaneous again depending on the bank short answer short the transaction is fine it wo n't be void you just need to wait probably a day or two this link has more info especially useful if you bank with natwest as i say the technology is likely to vary by bank to some extent   your own bank should have their own version of this

i am in a different situation because i earn more than i spend but i have found that i need to make the money inaccessible if i want to really avoid spending it   i used to just throw my paychecks into a high yield savings account but eventually the balance was large enough that a large purchase did n't seem like that much because i would have had so much left in the account after the purchase   it was way too easy for me to spend way too much now i invest my savings automatically   the obvious benefit is my money has a much higher growth rate than a simple savings account especially with fed interest rates so low   i invest most of my savings in retirement accounts where there are severe penalties for withdrawing prior to retirement age   then i invest a significant portion to a regular brokerage account where the money is invested in stock and bond funds   this money is accessible within a few days of whenever i need it   the remainder of my savings goes into a savings account as cash i can get to at any time   all 3 accounts grow with every paycheck market fluctuations aside    this system helps me to categorize my savings as never ever touch retirement accounts touch only if i can wait 3 days and am willing to pay taxes brokerage account or touch whenever you need it with no penalties savings account   if my savings account grows too much i 'll move money from there to the brokerage account where it has more growth potential   the longer my money is invested in the brokerage accounts the less taxes i 'll need to pay when i sell withdraw the funds so that 's even more incentive for me to keep those funds where they are i have credit cards so in my opinion having to wait 3 days for funds from my investment account to become accessible is considered accessible in an emergency because my credit cards can be used to cover a large purchase for 3 days and as long as i pay it off within the grace period there 's no interest charged tl;dr investing is probably the smartest way to both grow your money and prevent the urge to spend it right away   my advice is to start with a 401(k or ira as soon as you can since the younger you are the more time until retirement that your money has to compound   investing $ 100 more a month can mean hundreds of thousands of additional dollars in your account when you 're ready to retire

are the $ 18,000 401k 2017 limit and the $ 5,500 ira limit mutually exclusive for a combined limit of $ 23,500 under 49 yes but the amount that you can deduct from a traditional ira depends on your gross income and marital status see publication for details   also note that the limit applies to your combined traditional and roth ira contributions meaning you ca n't contribute $ 5,500 to both just a total of $ 5,500 between the two i 'm also assuming employee match $ count towards these limits is this correct no the limit for combined contributions between you and your employer is $ in 2017   so if you contribute $ 18,000 your employer can only contribute $ 36,000

the question that i walk away with is what is the cost of the downside protection disclaimer i do n't sell anything i am not a fan of insurance as an investment with rare exceptions i 'll stop there all else is a tangent there 's an appeal to looking at the distribution of stock returns it looks a bit like a bell curve with a median at 10 or so and a standard deviation of 15 or so this implies that there are some number of years on average that the market will be down and others about 2/3 up now you wish to purchase a way of avoiding that negative return and need to ask yourself what it 's worth to do so   the insurance company tells you a 2 off the top i.e. no dividends and b we will clip the high end over 9.5   i then am compelled to look at the numbers knowing that your product ca n't be bought and sold every year it 's appropriate to look at rolling returns the annual returns i see and the return you 'd have in any period i start with 1900 2012 i see an average 9.8 with std of 5.3 remember the 10 year rolling will do a good job pushing the std down the return the insurance would give you is an average 5.4 with std of .01 you 've bought your way out of all risk but at what cost   from 1900 2012 my dollar grows to $ yours to $ for much of the time treasuries were higher than your return much higher   it 's interesting to see how often the market is over 10 for the year clip too many of those and you really lose out   from 1900 2012 i count 31 negative years ouch but 64 years over 9.5 the 31 averaged the 64   the illusion of market gains is how this product is sold long term they lag safe treasuries

you answered your own question whether someone buys is a different thing you can ask any price that you want or given an electronic brokerage you can enter the highest value that the system was designed to accept the market demand will determine whether anyone will buy at the price you are asking a better strategy if you want to make an unreasonable amount of money is to put in a buy order at an unreasonably low price and hope a glitch causes a flash crash and allows you to purchase at that price there may be rules that unravel your purchase after the fact but it has a better chance of succeeding than trying to sell at an unreasonably high price

one reason this happens is due to dividends if the dividend amount is greater than the time value left on a call it can make sense to exercise early to collect the dividend   deep in the money puts also may get exercised early there 's usually little premium on a deep in the money put and the spread on the bid ask might erase what little premium there is if you have stock worth $ 5,000 but own puts on them that will give you $ 50,000 upon exercise and no spread to worry about the interest you can gain on the $ 50k might be more than the little to no time value left on the position even at several weeks to expiration

for the record i am the original question asker and i 'm reporting back to say that the approach described in the accepted answer did not work i am adding a new answer rather than commenting on the accepted answer because of the length of explanation required i applied for an itin by filing a w-7 with all appropriate documentation including a birth certificate death certificate and recognition of birth abroad i.e. proof of u.s. citizenship the irs rejected the application saying that people who are eligible for ca n't have that placed me in an untenable situation because even though the irs said she was eligible for an ssn the social security administration said they never issue to dead people as a matter of policy   so insult was added to injury it is true that i should have applied for an ssn while she was alive in which case it would have been a simple matter i just paid the extra tax that was due because of her not counting as a dependent during the years for which i was filing the amount was not worth fighting over further or renouncing my u.s. citizenship   moral of story live in all ways as if there is no guarantee your children will be alive tomorrow because there is no such guarantee

are there banks where you can open a bank account without being a citizen of that country without having to visit the bank in person i 've done it the other way around opened a bank account in the uk so i have a way to store gbp   given that britain is still in the eu you can basically open an account anywhere   german online banks for instance allow you to anything online should there be cards issued you would need an address in the country   and for opening an account a passport is sufficient you can identify yourself in a video chat   now what 's the downside   french banks online services are in french german banks services are in german   if that does n't put you off i would name such banks in the comments if asked are there any online services for investing money that are n't tied to any particular country can you clarify that   you should at least be able to buy into any european or american stock through your broker   that should give you an ease of mind being fca regulated   however those are usually global depository receipts and denominated in gbp pence so you 'd be visually exposed to currency rates by which i mean that if the stock goes up 1 but the gbp goes up 1 in the same period then your gdr would show a 0 profit on that day also and more dividends are distributed in the foreign currency then exchanged by the issuer of the gdr on that day and booked into your account so if you want to be in full control of the cashflows you should get a trading account denominated in the currency and maybe situated in the country you 're planning to invest in if you 're really serious about it some brokers banks offer multi currency trading accounts again i will name them if asked where you can trade a wide range of instruments i.e. on the primary exchanges and you get to manage everything in one interface   those accounts typically include access to the foreign exchange markets so you can move cash between your accounts freely well for a surcharge   also typically each subaccount is issued its own iban

there are two issues here arithmetic and psychology scenario 1 you are presently paying an extra $ 500 per month on your student loan above the minimum payments your credit card company offers a $ 4000 cash advance at 0 for 8 months so you take the cash advance pay it toward the student loan and then instead of paying the extra $ 500 per month toward the student loan you use that $ 500 for 8 months to repay the cash advance net result you pay 0 interest on the loan and save roughly 8 months times $ 4000 times the interest on the student loan divided by two i say divided by two because it 's not the difference between $ 4000 and zero but between $ 4000 and the $ 500 you would have been paying off each month clearly you are better off if you are not presently paying an extra $ 500 on the student loan or even if you are but it is a struggle to come up with the money then the question becomes can you reasonably expect to be able to pay off the credit card before the grace period runs out interest rates on credit cards are normally much higher than interest rates on student loans if you get the cash advance and then ca n't repay it after 8 months you are paying a very steep interest rate and anything you saved on the student loan will quickly be lost what i mean by psychological is that you have to have the discipline to really repay the credit card within the grace period if you 're not very that you can do that this plan could go bad very quickly personally i 've thought about doing things like this many times cash advances against credit cards home equity loans etc all give low interest money that could be used to pay off a higher interest debt but it 's easy to get into trouble doing things like this it 's easy to say to yourself well i do n't need to put all the money toward that other debt i could keep a thousand or so to buy that big screen tv i really need or to fail to pay back the low interest loan on schedule because other things keep coming up that you spend your money on instead whether frivolous luxuries or true emergencies and there 's always the possibility that something will happen to mess up your finances from a big car repair bill to losing your job you do n't want to paint yourself into a corner finally maxing out your credit cards hurts your credit rating the formulas are secret but i understand that if you use more than half your available credit that 's a minus how much it hurts you depends on lots of factors

there is a way to get a reasonable estimate of what you still owe and then the way to get the exact value when the loan started they should have given you amortization table that laid out each payment including the principal interest and balance for each payment if there are any other fees included in the payment those also should have been detailed determine how may payments you have maid did you make the first payment on day one or the start of the next month was the last payment the 24th or the next one the table will then tell you what you owe after your most recent payment to get the exact value call the lender the amount grows   between payment due to the interest that is accumulating they will need to know when the payment will arrive so they can give you the correct value to calculate how much you will save do the following calculation payment = monthly payment for principal and interest = number of payments made = 24 = number of payments remaining = 60 = 60 24 = 36 = number from loan company   savings = payment

if this matters to you a lot i agree you should leave my primary bank account raised chequing account and transaction fees i left when i was closing my account the teller asked for the reason they needed to fill out a form and i explained it was the monthly fees eventually if a bank gets enough of these they will change i want to get back those features for the same price it cost when i opened it they are in their rights to cancel features or raise prices just as you are in your rights to withdraw if they do n't give you a deal the reason why i mention this is that this approach is comical in some instances a grocery store may raise the price of carrots typically you either deal with it or change stores prices rise occasionally thus they will lose a lot of money from my savings from my understanding a bank makes a large chunk of their money from fees very little is from the floating kitty they can have because of your savings if you have an investment account with your bank not recommended or your mortgage that would matter more i 've had friends who have left banks and moved their mortgages because of the bank not giving them a better rate does the manager have any pressure into keeping the account to the point of giving away free products to keep the or they do n't really care depends i 've probably say no one data point is an anecdote it is expected in a client base of thousands that a few will leave for seemingly random reasons only if mass amounts of clients leave or complain will the manager or company care a note some banks waive monthly account or service fees if you keep a minimal account balance i have one friend who keeps x thousand in his bank account to save the account fee he budgets a month ahead of time and savings account rates are 0 so this costs him nothing

in addition to the money laundering lifestyle income tax etc   issues discussed already in other answers one other matter that   might concern the bank is whether that cash you are bringing in   to deposit is genuine currency or some or all of the bills   are counterfeit and you are using this mechanism to get them into   circulation   even if you withdraw a very large amount in cash from your bank step out the door and come back just a few minutes later saying that you have changed your mind and want to put that money back into your account there is still the question   as to whether the cash you have brought back is exactly the same as you took out or a substitution was made in the interim i once needed a bank draft for $ 1000 and went to my bank to get it taking with me a check made out to cash for $ the bank 's fee was $ 3 the bank would not give me a bank draft in exchange for the check or if i cashed the check right then and there and paid for the bank draft using the cash that the teller had just handed me i had to tear up the check write another one payable to the bank and then i got my bank draft as joetaxpayer says it is a matter of paper trail additional matter added in edit according to wikipedia because of the   bank secrecy act of 1970 many banks will no longer sell negotiable instruments when they are purchased with cash requiring the purchase to be withdrawn from an account at that institution which was exactly my experience   furthermore even the banks that will still sell you a cashier 's check or money order for cash must keep a monetary instrument log mil that records all such cash transactions for amounts between $ 3000 and $ 10,000 keep the records for at least five years and produce it upon request of a bank examiner or auditor and presumably upon subpoena by a district attorney or divorce lawyer cash transactions of $ 10,000 or over are of course reported to the irs on currency transaction reports   in short a paper trail exists for some time even for cash transactions quite a bit smaller than $ 10,000

i expect that the loan documents show both you and your ex partner as jointly and liable for the debt and thus you 're both responsible for it   it does n't really matter what other paperwork you have that says otherwise or what other promises might have been made   certainly the other agreements give you legal ground to go after your ex partner for the money but they give you no leverage with the bank if you end up paying this debt off to save your credit you need to make sure that the account is closed   make sure you have paperwork showing it as closed and showing that it was paid in full and then keep that paperwork forever re 1 i think it will eventually show up on your credit report   you could ask the bank for proof that you owe the money if you like but that will probably just delay the inevitable re 2 his bankruptcy filing really has no bearing on you and your obligation to repay the loan   if he did n't list this debt then he is still liable for it as well and you can still go after him under your other agreements   but either way you 're still on the debt

i have an econ ba from a small liberal arts school   my experience is unique but i 'll share what i know   as a lone degree job wise it 's not as sought after as accounting marketing etc   those roles are more tactical and immediately applicable in the roles new grads are hired into   econ is bigger picture more strategic in general   so for a company as an econ major your skills are n't as immediately applicable   is econ worthless   oh hell no   having that large perspective and that understanding of how things are interconnected will help you throughout your career and can be very insightful at times   sadly it 's not everyone 's cup of tea but those higher in the org likely have an understanding and appreciation although likely not the focused degree   full disclosure my undergrad did n't offer an accounting major and the school had a great relationship with one of the big 4 so accounting was my goal immediately after graduation despite it being an econ degree   my program had many required courses heavy in accounting and quantitative analysis so i 'm not suggesting my econ is the norm

if you 're looking to invest using stocks and shares i recommend you set up an account at something like google finance it is free and user friendly with lots of online help you can set up some virtual cash and put it into a number of stocks which it 'll track for you review your progress and close some positions and open others as often as you want but remember to enter some figure for the cost of the transaction say $ for a trade to discourage you from high frequency trading take it as seriously as you want if you stick to your original cash input you 'll see real results if you throw in more virtual cash than you could in real life it 'll muddle the outcome after some evaluation period say 3 months look back at your progress you will learn a tremendous amount from doing this and do n't need to have read any books or spent any money to get started knowing which stocks to pick and when to buy or sell is much more subtle see other answers for suggestions

defined benefit pension funds will typically target treasuries + a spread that depends on how well funded the plan is and the duration of the liabilities so for example if a db fund is 90 funded meaning assets are 90 of liabilities and the liabilities have a duration of 20 years they will target the 20 year treasury rate + a spread that will bring the plan to just over 100 funded in around 20 years this spread will usually be much lower than 8 p.a obviously it 's much more complicated than this but hopefully this gives a general idea

i kinda thought it had something to do with losing 2.6 million jobs in 2008 now that 's a lot of revenue gone oh also the bush tax cuts   all the more reason to keep increase spending by 5 10 a year right how about we create an envionment that yields more jobs rather than increasing the taxes of those left because that worked so well for social security originally supported by 5 10 employees per 1 receiving benefits now it 's only supported by 2 employees per 1 receiving ultra sustainable   gt;so almost 10 of our deficit i 'd say that 's a good start    10 of our deficit so the amount of debt interest we 'll pay this year a drop in the bucket either way spending is the real culprit   gt;i do agree we spend way too much on the pentagon but pretty sure that went up a lot without our two unfunded republican wars    and now we 're in a half dozen active and secret conflicts pakistan syria libya all the more reason for obama to immediately remove us from those wars but he has n't he has expanded them and our military costs keep going up it 's not about this is n't the right time to withdrawl it 's about his corporate masters being the same as the bush corporate masters telling him to continue it 's about oil gas and the pipelines and projection of power that comes with it obama has continued and expanded the same policies as bush he can not hide behind well bush was worse he ca n't say that because it is nt true infact we 're killing more peasants in other countries than ever just with military industrial complex built drones   gt;there 's also the unfunded bush medicare prescription drug plan    yep that prevents the government from negotiating prices on prescriptions for a token   $ 10 billion rebate but which will yield $ 10 trillion in revenues over the next 15 years sounds like a great roi while the costs of drugs is in the us   so what did obama do he fed that industry another 30 million new customers without so much as any discount the government purposely stays out of the negotiation of price why because the bill was written by insurance industry and healthcare industry executives like most bills are healthcare is nice but its the cost of healthcare that is the issue if the cost was more reasonable you would nt even need insurance but because they can charge $ 70 for a single pair of rubber gloves when the market price on a box is $ 5 10 we can plainly see the cost of medical care in the us is bloated and we get much less than comparative countries    obama is just like bush he has enriched the various industries the only difference between bush and obama are which industries are enriched you 'll notice i did n't mention enrichment of citizens because they are an afterthought obama only needs to sell the program to citizens he sold it we bought it   gt;you ca n't seriously think putting those people back in charge will lead to good things   no i do n't think republicans or people like bush or romney are necessarily good for us either the thing i have a problem with is that people like you think obama is any different he 's not new president same as the old president new speech writer new cabinet stuffed with corporate cronies and former lobbyists but business as usual and orders from corporate and private masters

on reading couple of articles some research over internet i got to know about diversified investment where one should invest 70 in equity related rest 30 in debt related funds yes that is about right although the recommendation keeps varying a bit however your first investment should not aim for diversification putting small amounts in multiple mutual funds may create paper work and tracking issues my suggestion would be to start with an index eft or large cap then move to balanced funds and mid caps etc   on this site we do n't advise on specific funds you can refer to or or quite a few other personal finance advisory sites to understand the top funds in the segments and decide on funds accordingly ps rather than buying paper buy it electronic better you can now buy it as demat if you already have an demat account it would be best to buy through it

first to mention one thing better analysis calls for analyzing a range of outcomes not just one assigning a probability on each and comparing the expected values then the choice based on risk tolerance but now just look at the outcome or scenario of 3 and time frame of 2 days let 's assume your investable capital is exactly $ 1000 multiply everything by 5 for $ 5,000 etc a. buy stock the value goes to 103 your investment goes to $ net return is $ 30 minus let 's say $ 20 commission you should compare these between brokers i use one that charges 9.99 plus a trivial government fee b. buy an call option at 100 for $ 0.40 per share with an expiration 30 days away december 23 this is a more complicated to evaluate this you need to estimate the movement of the value of a 100 call $ 0 in and out of the money 30 days remaining to the value of a 100 call $ 3 in the money 28 days remaining that movement will vary based on the volatility of the underlying stock an advanced topic but there are techniques to estimate that which become simple to use after you get the hang of it at any rate let 's say that the expected movement of the option price in this scenario is from $ 0.40 to $ 3.20 since you bought 2500 share options for $ 1000 the gain would be 2500 times 2.8 = 7000 c. buy an call option at 102 for $ per share with an expiration 30 days away december 23 to evaluate this you need to estimate the movement of the value of a 102 call $ 2 out of the money 30 days remaining to the value of a 102 call $ 1 in the money 28 days remaining that movement will vary based on the volatility of the underlying stock an advanced topic but there are techniques to estimate that which become simple to use after you get the hang of it at any rate let 's say that the expected movement of the option price in this scenario is from $ to $ 1.50 since you bought 8000 share options for $ 1000 the gain would be 8000 times = d. same thing but starting with a 98 call e. same thing but starting with a 101 call expiring 60 days out f. etc other option choices again getting the numbers right for the above is an advanced topic one reason why brokerages warn you that options are risky if you do your math wrong you can lose even doing that math right with a bad outcome loses anyway you need to score as many options as needed to find the optimal point but back to the first paragraph you should then run the whole analysis on a 2 gain or 5 or 5 in 4 days instead of 2 days do as many as are fruitful assess then pull the trigger and buy it try these techniques in simulation before diving in please one last point you do n't have to understand how to evaluate projected option price movements if you have software that   does that for you i 'll on that process except to mention it get the general idea edit p.s. i forgot to mention that brokers need love for handling options too check those commission rates in your analysis as well

i do n't know why there is so much confusion on such a simple concept the answer is very simple a stock must eventually pay dividends or the whole stock market is just a cheap ponzi scheme a company may temporarily decided to reinvest profits into r&d company expansion etc but obviously if they promised to never pay dividends then you can never participate in the profits of the company and there is simply no intrinsic value to the stock for all of you saying yeah but the stock price will go up please people get a life the only reason the price goes up is in anticipation of dividend yield otherwise why would the price go up   but the company is worth more and the stock is worth more a stocks value is not set by the company but by people who buy and sell in the open market   to think a stock 's price can go up even if the company refuses to pay dividends is analogous to person a says hey buy these paper clips for $ 10 but those paper clips are n't worth that it does n't matter because some fool down the line will pay $ 15 but why would they pay that because some fool after him will pay $ 20 ha ha

the main reason is that you move from the linear payoff structure to a non linear one this is called convexity in finance with options you can design a payoff structure in almost any way to want it to be for example you can say that you only want the upside but not the downside so you buy a call option it is obvious that this comes at a price the option premium or equivalently you buy the underlying and for risk management reasons buy a put option on top of it as an insurance the price of the put could be seen as the insurance premium you can of course combine options in more complicated ways so that you e.g. profit as long as the underlying moves strongly enough in either direction this is called a straddle

i do n't know what the op means when he says i want to invest in health insurance from now on so that i can use the policy after i retire generally a health insurance policy covers costs incurred during the current calendar year or specific period such as july 1 of one year through june 30 of the next year and does not cover future periods indeed many policies do not guarantee renewal when the current period ends with exceptions for employer provided coverage through cobra in case employment ends so investing in a health insurance policy meaning that you pay the premiums now and the insurance company provides the policy in the distant future is   something that is new to me besides what will the policy include if someone had bought such a policy many years ago say before cat scans and were developed would the policy cover such new developments or the policy would cover only those procedures tests and medications that are available when the policy is written and the insurance premiums start to be paid the long term health of the insurance company is also of some concern   when something is offered to me with a lifetime guarantee i ask my lifetime or the device 's life time or the company 's lifetime

you should only invest in individual stocks if you truly understand the company 's business model and follow its financial reports closely   even then individual stocks should represent only the tiniest most adventurous part of your portfolio as they are a huge risk a basic investing principle is diversification   if you invest in a variety of financial instruments then a when some components of your portfolio are doing poorly others will be doing well   even in the case of significant economic downturns when it seems like everything is doing poorly there will be some investment sectors that are doing relatively better such as bonds physical real estate precious metals b over time some components of your portfolio will gain more money than others so every 6 or 12 months you can rebalance such that all components once again have the same of money invested in them as when you began   you can do this either by selling off some of your well performing assets to purchase more of your poorly performing assets or if you do n't want to incur a taxable event by introducing additional money from outside your portfolio   this essentially forces you to buy relatively low sell relatively high now if you accept the above argument for diversification then you should recognize that owning a handful or even several of individual stocks will not help you achieve diversification   even if you buy one stock in the energy sector one in consumer discretionary one in financials etc then you 're still massively exposed to the day to day fates of those individual companies   and if you invest solely in the us stock market then when the us has a decline your whole portfolio will decline   and if you do n't buy any bonds then again when the world has a downturn your portfolio will decline   and so on that 's why index mutual funds are so helpful   someone else has already gone to the trouble of grouping together all the stocks or bonds of a certain type small cap large cap domestic foreign value growth so all you have to do is pick the types you want until you feel you have the diversity you need   no more worrying about whether you 've picked the right company to represent a particular sector   the fewer knobs there are to turn in your portfolio the less chance there is for mistakes

yes it can buy back the call but much before stock hits the $ 30 mark    let us say you got 1 $ from selling the call so the total money in your account is 4 $ + 1 $ = 5 $ when stock hits 10 $ your strike the maintenance margin is as soon as stock goes past 10 your maintenance margin is violated so broker will buy back your call at least ib does that it does not wait for a margin call now if the stock gapped up from 8 to yes broker will buy it back at 30 so your account will have a negative balance assume the call cost 20 $ when stock hit 30 your balance is 5 30 10 = -15 depending on broker i suppose they will ask you to bring your account balance back up to positive if they do n't do that they risk going out of business

do you need such a detailed budget   i have found that a detailed budget creates two problems i would suggest starting simple and adding complexity as you discover you need it   create a budget with just a few categories then i enforce my budget with my auto deposit    my required expenses which i have a pretty good notion of the total amount get paid from one online bank   enough money goes in and i electronically pay retirement money and e fund money get deposited into the brokerage and credit union where i keep those piles at finally my optional expenses go into a second bank i am using at the moment and i spend from there with a card   they have a nice reporting feature and if i want to save up for a toy or something i save up there   bonuses and other extra income end up there as well   this way i really only have to monitor the last account to see if i can have fun or buy a new item my bills and retirement are different pools of money and i do n't carry around a card that can access that money

the chances are good that the interest you are going to pay on the debt is going to be higher than the interest you are going to receive on any type of short term investments that would make the paying off of the debt worth more to you in the long run than saving your money note that without the particulars of your situation this is all just theory so consult the details of you loan agreements i can not imagine that a credit provider did not discuss this with you before you put pen on paper

my parents hooked up at a highschool party when they were 17 i was born because they most definitely were not careful   that being said when my mother met my when i was 3 we lived with him in his mom 's house he had just started as a cop and we were very poor for a very long time the reason we were so poor was because my dad was investing the majority of his money investing in stocks his pension anything he could he worked for years he eventually got a new job and when he retires in a few years his pension and a handful of really good investments is going to net him just over a million dollars so this whole article is kinda bullshit to me

no i did n't write anything about whether we should have invested in the just that comparing a public infrastructure project to private subsidy a tax break has the same economic effect as a direct subsidy more money circulating in the market not tied up in government is not an equal comparison if you really want to push that button i would argue that investment in public infrastructure is a better investment than giving tax breaks to corporations especially corporations like foxconn with a track record of not living up to promises like these

you do n't need to tell me your charity plans they do n't matter your comments still show lack of empathy a basic to put yourself in another ones shoes that actually is pretty important if you want to be a md   have you ever thought that these people work so that they do n't become criminals they maybe fucked up in the past or maybe not but the market is not a good judge for their worth they are people not a commodity or a number    the fact is even if you trained these people menial workers are needed in a society and therefore they should be able to make enough money to survive in the society   you know free market is not the magical solution for everything and you may not believe it but i do have the view that for the most part the govt screws up and should be given extremely limited powers   i do n't claim to know the solution for their problem but i do feel for them not only do they have to support their families with too less but they also have to listen to people telling them how worthless thy are

i 'm not asking if i should carry a balance to the end of the billing period and accrue interest typically i say typically because there may be some fringe outlier exception product that begins accruing interest immediately if you 're not carrying a balance already you will not be charged interest for carrying a balance during the billing period    you accrue a balance you 're issued a statement if you pay the statement before the due date indicated you do n't pay interest even if your statement balance is less than the current actual balance on the account   if you carry a balance through that due date you begin to accrue interest   not only on the balance carried but on all new charges as well   but as long as you consistently pay your statement balance before the statement due date you will not be charged any interest as for a reason why you may want to take advantage of this simply to ease the administration of your finances   you just do n't need to touch the accounts that frequently to avoid interest charges   sure you can let your money sit in an interest bearing account and earn a couple dollars a year but really you just do n't need to focus on your cc charges this frequently

try to get a second card in your business name with a separate card number like you would get one for a spouse they may or may not allow that free you would n't want to pay a second fee and it might be only possible with the second card bearing the same number which makes it useless but it is worth a try

reading irs regulations section more closely i see that this was a contingent payment sale with a stated maximum selling price therefore at the time of filing prior years there was no way of knowing the final contingent payment would not be reached and thus the prior years were filed correctly and should not be amended those regulations go on to give an example of a sale with a stated maximum selling price where the maximum was not reached due to contingency and states that in such cases when the maximum payment amount is subsequently reduced the gross profit ratio will be with respect to payments received in or after the taxable year in which an event requiring reduction occurs however in this case that would result in a negative gross profit ratio on line 19 of form which turbo tax reports should be a non negative number   looking further in the regulations i found an example which relates to bankruptcy and a resulting loss in a subsequent year for 1992 a will report a loss of $ 5 million attributable to the sale taken at the time determined to be appropriate under the rules generally applicable to worthless debts therefore i used a gross profit ratio of zero on line 19 and entered a separate stock sale not reported on a 1099-b as a worthless stock on form 8949 as a capital loss based upon the remaining basis in the stock sold in an installment sale   i also included an explanatory statement with my return to the irs stating in 2008 i entered into an installment sale of stock the sale was a contingent payment sale with a stated maximum selling price the sales price did not reach the agreed upon maximum sales price due to some contingencies not being met according to the irs    regulations section my basis in the stock remains at $ 500 in 2012 after the final payment rather than using a negative gross profit ratio on line 19 of form i 'm using a zero ratio and treating the remaining basis as a schedule d loss similar to worthless stock since the sale is now complete and my remaining basis is no longer recoverable

if you are the beneficiary of an annuity you might receive a single sum distribution when the annuity owner dies the amount of this death benefit might be the current cash value of the annuity or some other amount based upon contract riders that the owner purchased the tax on death benefits depends on a number of factors death benefits are taxed as normal income unlike other investments the named beneficiary of a non qualified annuity does not get a step up in tax basis to the date of death however that does n't mean the beneficiary will have to pay taxes on the full amount because the purchaser of the annuity made the investment with after tax dollars only the amount attributable to investment income is taxed but it will be taxed as ordinary income and not enjoy any special capital gains treatment when there is a death benefit that exceeds the value of the account that additional amount is also taxed as ordinary income   taxes on annuities depend on several circumstances for more information on distribution of inherited annuities and taxes go to annuities they go into details that could help you even more   one thing that annuities hq points out is if you take the lump sum payout you may be pushed into a higher tax bracket   along with doing research i would also contact a financial advisor

if you 've got shares in a company that 's filed for u.s. chapter 11 bankruptcy that sucks it really does   i 've been there before and you may lose your entire investment   if there 's still a market for your shares and you can sell them you may want to just accept the loss and get out with what you can however shares of bankrupt companies are often delisted once bankrupt since the company no longer meets minimum exchange listing requirements   if you 're stuck holding shares with no market you could lose everything but that 's not always the case chapter 11 is n't total and final bankruptcy where the company ceases to exist after liquidation of its assets to pay off its debts   rather chapter 11 is a section of the u.s. bankruptcy code that permits a company to attempt to reorganize or renegotiate its debt obligations during chapter 11 reorganization a company can negotiate with its creditors for a better arrangement   they typically need to demonstrate to creditors that without the burden of the heavy debt they could achieve profitability   such reorganization often involves creditors taking complete or majority ownership of the company when it emerges from chapter 11 through a debt for equity swap that 's why you as an investor before the bankruptcy are very likely to get nothing or just pennies on the dollar any equity you may be left holding will be considerably diluted in value   it 's rare that shareholders before a chapter 11 bankruptcy still retain any equity after the company emerges from chapter 11 but it is possible but it varies from bankruptcy to bankruptcy and it can be complex as pointed out investopedia has a great article an overview of corporate bankruptcy   here 's an excerpt if a company you 've got a stake in    files for bankruptcy chances are    you 'll get back pennies to the dollar    different bankruptcy proceedings or    filings generally give some idea as to    whether the average investor will get    back all or a portion of his    investment but even that is    determined on a case by case basis    there is also a order of    creditors and investors of who get    paid back first second and last in    this article we 'll explain what    happens when a public company files    for protection under u.s. bankruptcy    laws and how it affects investors       how it affects investors       when your company goes bankrupt there    is a very good chance you will not get    back the full value of your    investment in fact there is a chance    you wo n't get anything back wikipedia has a good article on chapter 11 bankruptcy at chapter 11 title 11 united states code
