the ftb as any government agency is understaffed and underpaid even if someone took a glance and it was n't just an automated letter consider the situation you filed as a llc and then amended to file as a partnership unless someone really pays attention the obvious assumption would be that you had a limited partnership yes you 'll need to call them and work with them on fixing this they do have all the statements you 've attached however there 's a lot of automation and very little attention to details when it comes to matching errors so do n't get surprised if no one even looked at these statements next time your elected government officials talk about small government and cutting government expenses you can remind yourself how it looks in action with this experience

as far as i can tell it works like this note i am assuming you were 18 on jan 1 2009 contribution limits so by the end of 2012 you will have been allowed to contribute $ 20,000 of new money you say you 've contributed $ 10,000 so you still can contribute another $ 10,000 of new money this year but let 's assume you do not now your original $ 10,000 has grown to $ 25,000   you can withdraw this without penalty   next year you will be given an allotment of another $ 5000 of new money bringing your total lifetime limit to $ 25,000 $ 10,000 = $ 15,000 new money plus you will be allowed to re contribute up to $ 25,000 of old money of course the government does n't make a distinction between old and new money so the net effect is assuming a 25k withdrawal 2012 limit $ 10 000 2013 limit $ 40 000 less 2012 contributions from the tfsa contribution room is made up of from this wording it means the 25 k you withdraw will go to the 2013 contribution room bullet 3   if you do n't re contribute it will roll over into the 2014 contribution room under bullet 2    for correctness i must add that i did not include any indexing of the annual amount

many services charge prices that do not scale linearly with usage   this is because the service provider has fixed costs that they must recoup by charging a rate with a fixed component   a taxi ride is unlikely to cost half what a taxi ride costs   even a half sandwich at a sandwich place usually costs more than half of what a full sandwich costs   in this respect insurance is no different from many other items you may purchase

none of that is filtered my way as a part owner sure it is it 's just not always obvious when a company makes money it either other then the fourth option the first three all increase the total value of the company   if you owned 1 of a company that was worth x and is now worth x+1 the value of that 1 ownership should go up as well one model of the value of a share of stock is the present value of all future cash flows that the company produces for its shareholders which would be either through dividends earnings provided that they are invested back into the company or through liquidation sale   so as earnings increase or more accurately as projected future earnings increase so does the value of a share of the company also note that the payment of dividends causes the price of a stock to go down when the dividend is paid since that 's equity cash that 's leaving the company reducing the value of the company by an equivalent amount of course there 's also something to be said for the behavioral aspect of investing meaning that people sometimes invest in companies that they like and sell stock of companies that they do n't like or disagree with e.g. 's

this is more of an economics question than personal finance that said i already started writing an answer before i noticed so here are a few points i 'll leave it open for others to expand the list advantages disadvantages advantages disadvantages the flip side to the argument that more users means more stability is that the impact of a strong economy on the value of the currency is diluted somewhat by all the other users indeed if adopted by another country with similar or greater gdp that economy could end up becoming the primary driver of the currency 's value   it may be harder to control counterfeiting perhaps not in the issuing country itself but in foreign countries that do not adopt new bills as quickly

none taken good thoughts it would be making the same mistake to blindly accept my criticism as many will make blindly accepting this journalist 's graphs let 's see if i can address your concerns   the reason the scale is problematic to me is exactly what you said   gt i hope people would be looking at more than just a line   and i do n't think that they do the scales were adjusted so that the lines were nearly identical on someone 's computer screen but that implies a false equivalency between the debts of households corporations state and local gov and the fed i think the author has left leaning read the accompanied article that outlines who you will vote for link on the last slide not necessarily a bad thing but he frames all of this from the idea that his statistics can not be skewed and he is therefore presenting central to the left 's argument is that the federal government 's size is not of the biggest concern and if you got the average american thinking that 15 trillion is no big deal because households have a huge debt too or corporations do too or states do too i believe that to be dangerous i think i identified his bias and that his graphs are slightly manipulated to coerce less individuals to his side happens all the time but all of those facts are dead on in regards to the data again trying to keep my politics out of this simply criticizing the graphs and the subtle message they are sending under the guise of being neutral   i would agree with your point normally since contractors are temporary and often as you pointed out cost efficient from a benefits standpoint they also tend to be more efficient but this is not central to our point the problem is that the government has the longest war in our history going but we are n't really fighting anyone for the scale of our spending trillions of dollars have gone into this effort and one of the results has been the development of a quasi economy in iraq and now the numbers are staggering of how many of these people are employed or make a living off of this war effort but this is not like most contractors where you would add them to the dod 's budget as you pointed out and the difference i would is the permanent status of the employment after what length of time would you say a contractor for the dod working on computer programs in the pentagon is the equivalent of an employee and therefore must be counted in statistics such as the one the graph in question purports to 2 years 5 years certainly after a decade right remember the graph is trying to show that the number of government employees is not a problem or at least not a significant but calling an apple a banana does n't make it yellow i think political slight in hand with statistics as important as these should be criminal   sorry i got long winded but i hope i addressed your concerns it sounds like you are one of the few people who thinks critically when presented with data such as that which is in these 64 slides but remember for every one of you there may be a thousand people who are brainwashed by any data you put in front of them

the largest problem and source of anxiety ruin for homeowners during the housing market collapse was caused by the inability to refinance many people had bought homes which they were stretched to afford by using variable rate mortgages   these would typically offer a very attractive initial rate with an annual cap on the potential increase of rate   many of these people intended to refinance their variable rate to a fixed rate once terms were more favorable   if their house wo n't appraise for the value needed to obtain a new loan they are stuck in their current contract with potentially unfavorable rates in the later years above prime was not unheard of also many people especially those in areas of high inflation in the housing market used a financial device known as a balloon mortgage which essentially forced you to get a new loan after some number of years 2 5 10 when the entire note became due   some of those loans offered payments less than principal + interest so say you move near los angeles and ca n't afford the $ 1.2 m for the ranch in which you wish to live   you might work out a deal with your mortgage broker banker in which you agree contractually to only pay $ 500/month with a balloon payment of $ 1.4 m due in 5 years which seemed like a good deal since you and everyone else actually expect the house to be worth $ 1.5 m in 5 years this type of thing was done all the time back in the day   now imagine the housing bubble bursts and your $ 1.2 m home is suddenly only valued at perhaps $ 750k   you still owe $ 1.4 m sometime in the next several years maybe very soon depending on timing and can only get approved financing for the current $ 750k value so you 're basically anticipating becoming homeless and bankrupt within the same year that is a source of much anxiety about being upside down on a loan see this question for an unfortunate example

it sounds like there are no provisions in the loan document for how to proceed in this case    i would view this as creating a brand new loan the amount owed is going to be principal remaining + interest from 2 years + penalties   if you created a new loan for 13 years that would not be how i would expect a lender to behave i would expect most repayment plans to be something like make double payments until you are caught up or pay an extra $ 1000 per month until caught up and then resume normal payments

my problem with your argument is the idea that we make a decision and reap the benefits sometime in the near and measurable future   where as the actual outcome of our decision may not be realized until many other decisions are made afterwards thus making the number of permutations very high   while i agree there tend to be people who can make better or more informed decisions given a situation i think you give them entirely too much credit given the long run possibilities of outcomes   my ultimate point being no matter who you are you are limited to being able to consider so many steps ahead or combinations at a single time   and there are certainly people who make bad choices but get good outcomes and vice versus   since we do n't see one person or a specific model for making decisions i have to believe that one simply does not exist   so call it luck or informed decisions i think at a certain point people make decisions and reap the rewards of those decisions independently   maybe more often than not the informed win but there have been plenty of smart people out there with brilliant models and ideas that go down in flames   likewise i 've meet some pretty dumb people who happen to be at the right place at the right time and turn the right knob   not sure i was clear in explaining my point its been a long day

without getting to hung up on terminology here the management of a company will often attempt to keep stock prices high because of a number of reasons ideally companies keep prices up through performance   in some cases you 'll see companies do other things spending cash and/or issuing bonds to continue to pay dividends e.g. ibm or spending cash and/or issuing bonds to pay for stock buybacks e.g. ibm   these methods can work for a time but are not sustainable and will often be seen as acts of desperation   companies that have a solid plan for growth will typically not do much of anything to directly change stock prices bonds are a bit different because they have a fairly straight forward valuation model based on the fact that they pay out a fixed amount per month   the two main reason prices in bonds go down are the key here is that bonds pay out the same thing per month regardless of their price or the price of other bonds available   most stocks do not pay any dividend and for much of those that do the main factor as to whether you make or lose money on them is the stock price the price of bonds does matter to governments however   let 's say a country successfully issued some 10 year bonds last year at the price of 1000   they pay 1 per month to keep the math simple   every month they pay out $ 10 per bond   then some stupid politicians start threatening to default on bond payments   the bond market freaks and people start trying to unload these bonds as fast as they can   the going price drops to $ 500   next month the payments are the same   the coupon rate on the bonds has not changed at all   i 'm oversimplifying here but this is the core of how bond prices work you might be tempted to think that does n't matter to the country but it does   now this same country wants to issue some more bonds   it wants to get that 1 rate again but it ca n't   why would anyone pay $ 1000 for a 1 per month bond when they can get the exact same bond with basically the same risks for $ 500   instead they have to offer a 2 per month rate in order to match the market price a government or company could in fact put money into the bond market to bolster the price of it 's bonds i.e. keep the rates down   the problem is that if you are issuing bonds it 's generally caveats apply because you need cash that you do n't have so what money are you going to use to buy these bonds   or in other words it does n't make sense to issue bonds and then simply plow the cash gained from that issuance back into the same bonds you are issuing   the options here are a bit more limited   i have to mention though that the us government via a quasi governmental entity did actually buy it 's own bonds   this policy of quantitative easing qe was done for more complicated reasons than simply keeping the price of bonds up

this is only a partial answer to your question 1 if you have a conservative approach to savings and actually even if you do n't you should not invest all of your money in any single industry or product   if you want to invest some money in oil okay but do n't overdo it if your larger goal is to invest the money in a manner that is less risky but still more lucrative than a savings account you should read up on personal finance and investing to get a sense of what options are available   a commonly recommended option is to invest in low cost index funds that mirror the performance of the stock market as a whole   the question of how should i invest is very broad but you can find lots of starting points in other questions on this site by googling or by visiting your local library

this kind of questions keeps repeating itself on this site and the answer is generally it does n't matter as you said yourself there are costs either way and these costs are comparable generally merchant fees differ tremendously between the different kinds of merchants and while gas stations and video rentals may pay up to 5 and even more charitable organizations and community services are usually not considered as high fraud risk operation and are charged much lower fees either way paying employees managing cash check deposits or paying merchant fees is part of the charity operational expenses together with maintaining offices postal office boxes office supplies postage expenses and formal stationary and envelopes needed for physical donations handling i would guess that if the charity 's majority of donations come on line as credit card paypal payments check handling will be more expensive so i suggest you take the route you consider majority of donors pay that would be the cheapest for them to handle i would guess credit cards being the most convenient would be the way to go

there is empirical data to suggest deregulation in healthcare would drive down prices in a free market where prices are transparent prices go down    as to your pharmaceutical example that is a form of protectionism regulation the reason why epipen is able to charge that price is because they have a patent protection protectionism that lasts through 2025 lack of there is no substitute    if there were a reform in pharma laws that made pharmaceutical company have to share their patents for licensing costs similar to how cellular providers must provide access to their networks for a fee then the price would go down    market forces do reign supreme it is supply and demand as simple as that if there is a market with a lot of profit in a free market participants will enter the market until the profit drops down to zero that is why you can not charge 10 dollars for a big mac in the same city where a mcdonalds 1 mile away charges 5 dollars

rich people use depositor banks the same way the rest of us use banks to keep a relatively small store of wealth for monthly expenses and a savings account for a rainy day the bulk of a wealthy person 's money is in investments money sitting in a bank account is not making you more money and in fact as correctly points out would be losing value to inflation now all investments have risk that 's why interest exists if in some alternate universe charging interest were illegal across the board nobody would loan money because there 's nothing to be gained and a lot to lose you have to make it worth my while for me to want to loan you my money because sure as you 're going to use my loan to make yourself wealthier a wealthy person will choose a set of investments that represent an overall level of risk that he is comfortable with much like you or i would do the same with our retirement funds early in life we 're willing to take a lot of risk because there 's a lot of money to be made and time to recover from any losses closer to retirement we 're much more risk averse because if the market takes a sudden downturn we lose a significant portion of our nest egg with little hope of it before we have to start cashing out the very wealthy have similar variances in risk with the significant difference that they are typically already drawing a living from their investments as such they already have some risk aversion but at the same time they need good returns and so they must pay more attention to this balancing act between risk and return managing their investments in effect becomes their new job once they do n't have to work for anyone else anymore the money does the real work and they make the executive decisions about where best to put it the tools they use to make these decisions are the same ones we have they watch market trends to identify stages of the economic cycle that large movements of money to or from safe havens like gold and t debt they diversify their investments to shield the bulk of their wealth from a sudden localized loss they hire investment managers to have a second pair of eyes and additional expertise in navigating the market you or i can do much the same thing by buying shares in managed investment funds or simply consulting a broker the difference is that the wealthy get a more personal touch so what 's the difference between the very wealthy and the rest of us well first is simple scale when a person with a net worth in the hundreds of millions makes a phone call or personal visit to the financial institutions handling their money there 's a lot of money on the line in making sure that person is well looked after if we get screwed over at the teller window and decide to close our the teller can often give us our entire account balance in cash without an our multimillionaire is at the lower end of being able to alter his banks profit loss statements by his decisions and so his bank will fight to keep his business second is the level of control the very wealthy the upper 1 have more or less direct ownership and control over many of the major means of production in this country the factories mines timber farms software houses power plants recording studios etc that generate things of value and therefore new wealth while the average joe can buy shares in these things through the open market their investment is typically a drop in the bucket and their voice in company decisions equally small our decision therefore is largely to invest or not to invest the upper 1 on the other hand have controlling interests in their investments often majority holdings that allow them far more control over the businesses they invest in who 's running them and what they do

i think you 're looking at the picture in an odd way when each of you made your initial investments and determined what portions you owned that gave the company capital that they could use to finance its operations in return you are entitled to the future profits of the company in proportion to your ownership any future investment by either of you is at your own discretion your company now faces a situation where it would like to pursue a potentially lucrative opportunity but needs more capital than it has to do so so you need to raise more capital that capital can come from one or both of you or from an outsider since that investment would be discretionary what the investor gets is a negotiation the company negotiates with the investor how much equity in the form of new shares to award in exchange for the new investment or whatever other compensation you decide on if not equity

there is some sense that negative interest rates make no sense because then two things appear to happen neither of these are true in reality but then we are edging towards a deflationary time during which the common understanding of money and what to do with money reverses during deflation spending is better to an extent because the buying power of money is less as time passes so also saving is less worthwhile but for the bond market and your question the reason why people are still investing in negative interest bonds is that they are going to be looking to capital gain to make their money over time the bond price fluctuates and as the bond approaches maturity the bond price equates to the face value minus whatever interest will be received or in this plus whatever interest will need to be payed

you should call your plan administrator and ask few plans allow people to take a hardship withdraw after leaving because their is no way to pay the funds back since you are no longer working there the repayment process is done via payroll deduction usually also you will most likely be required to withhold 20 for taxes from the 401k there is no way to defer the taxation unless you take it   next calendar year you may want to consider doing a rollover into an ira and taking the w d and you can do a 60 day rollover you only get 1 per rolling 12 months now rather than account do to a change in the rule ira 's not 401k do give you flexible withholding so you do n't have to pay taxes today though they would still be in the tax year based on the calendar date taken out so if you take it out in 2015 your going to be paying them at the end of this year when you file in april of 2016 your question seems to be mixing characteristics of both 401k and ira and while they are similar they do operate very differently

first bear in mind that you 're talking about having an average of saved up at any given time if you spend all your stipend every quarter at a steady rate you 'll start out with all of it and have none left at the end of the quarter along with any long term savings you manage to build up over time in today 's low interest rate environment of ~1 interest rates we 're talking about approximately £ interest so it 's not worth a huge amount of effort to this you mentioned a bonus but looking at the charter savings website i do n't actually see one listed for either the cash isa or the savings accounts you mention in general banks in the uk actually use bonus rates as a short term measure to suck in new customers and the bonuses typically expire after a while leaving you with a worse rate also i do n't think either of the rates you mention is guaranteed they are both listed as variable in reality i doubt they will go down too much more given that the likely next move in uk interest rates is upwards the typical main advantage of an isa is its tax free nature but from your question i assume you do n't have any other income so you wo n't need to pay tax on any interest you earn outside an isa either also given that your budget is quite tight and you expect to spend most or all of your stipend there 's no advantage to using an account where you can build up long term tax free savings even if you do have a few thousand pounds left over by the end of your phd you 'll easily be able to put those into an isa at that point given the annual limit of £ 20k. you 're right not to want to take any risks with the money and there are n't really any risk free investments other than savings accounts available at least on the you 're talking about so overall i 'd just go for the return edit as 's answer points out you will probably be able to find a loss leader current account that actually offers more interest than a savings account you 'll need to either use a single current account and manage your budgeting carefully or use a second current account as your savings account and make sure to set things up to satisfy the requirements of the account you choose such as incoming payments or outgoing direct debits

technically this does n't seem like a scam but i do n't think the system is beneficial   they use a lot of half truths to convince you that their product is right for you some of the arguments presented and my thoughts do n't buy term and invest the rest because you ca n't predict how much you 'll earn from the rest    also do n't invest in a 401k because you ca n't predict how much you 'll earn they are correct that you wo n't know exactly how much you 'll have due to stock market but that does n't mean the stock market is a bad place to put your money   investing in a 401k is risky because of the harsh 401k withdrawal rules   yes 401ks have withdrawal rules ca n't typically start before 59.5 must start by 70.5 but those rules do n't hamper my investing style in any way     most term life insurance policies do n't pay out   they are correct again but their conclusions are wrong yes most people do n't die while you have a term insurance policy which is why term life insurance is relatively cheap    but they are n't arguing you do n't need insurance just that you need their insurance which is better you need the guaranteed growth they offer   the chart used to illustrate their guaranteed growth includes non guaranteed dividends    they invest $ 10,000 per year for 36 years and end up with $ 1,000,000    that 's a 5 return   i use 10 for my estimate of stock market performance but let 's say it 's only 8    the same $ 10,000 per year results in over $ 2 million dollars   using 10.5 average return of the s&p 500 over it 's lifetime the result is a staggering $ 3.7 million    so if i 'm looking at $ 3.7 m vs. $ 1 m it costs me $ 2.7 million dollars to give me the same coverage as my term life policy that 's one expensive term life insurance policy my personal favorite blindly following the advice of wall street and financial gurus such as dave ramsey and suze orman got you where you are are you happy with the state of your finances do you still believe their buy term insurance and invest the difference   yes i sure do believe that and i 'm quite well thank you while i do n't think this is a scam it 's outrageously expensive and not a good financial choice

here 's the issue with ltc and really underwritten insurance in general no one has a crystal ball    based on today 's available rates where 's the sweet spot to buy ltc probably right around the because you probably wo n't pay much in before you start gutting the carrier assuming you can make it through underwriting in your the issue is what happens when some life event changes your underwriting status   would you rather buy prematurely or be excluded entirely   those are generally your two options when it comes to individual ltc   the underwriting eligibility window on ltc is very   narrow   there 's a very very small space between the best possible underwriting and being declined    look for an ltc agent in your area   likely someone in your circle of friends and family will know a reputable knowledgeable insurance agent who can run up some quotes at various underwriting classes   try to avoid looking at quotes for your age + 10 years to see what the quote will look like 10 years from now   10 years from now the rate tables will be significantly different whether or not you should buy ltc now rather than waiting will depend on a whole host of other criteria   personally if i was 50 and my biggest health concern was improving my run time and ltc is on my mind i 'd just pick up a policy now while i will likely be in a preferred underwriting class rather than waiting and hoping my health does n't betray me obviously i 'm a stranger on the internet and none of this is actual advice   you should find an agent local to you and talk about your options and situation

there 's nothing you can do if he has indeed deposited the check it would appear on your account fairly quickly i 've never seen it taking more than 2 3 business days however a check is a debt instrument and you can not close the account until it clears or until the unclaimed property laws of your state kick in if he claims that he deposited the check ask it in writing and have your bank or the bank where it was deposited investigate why it takes so long to clear if he 's not willing to give it to you in writing he 's likely not deposited it whatever the reason may be even just to cause you nuisance lesson learned next time cashier 's check with a signed receipt re closing the llc if you 're the only two partners you can just withdraw yourself from the llc take out your share and drop it on him leaving him the only partner check with your local attorney for details

in general economic theory there are always two markets created based on a need for a good a spot market where people who need something now can go outbid other people who need the same thing and a futures market where people who know they will need something later can agree to buy it for a pre approved price even if the good in question does n't exist yet like a grain crop options exist as a natural extension of the futures market in a traditional future you 're obligated by buying the contract to execute it for good or ill if it turns out that you could have gotten a lower price when buying or a higher price when selling that 's tough you gave up the ability to say no in return for knowing a month or three months or even a year in advance the price you 'll get to buy or sell this good that you know you need futures thus give both sides the ability to plan based on a known price but that 's their only risk reduction mechanism enter the option you 're the coors brewing company and you want to buy 50 tons of barley grain for delivery in december in order to brew up for the super bowl and other sports parties a co op up to close the deal but since you 're coors you compete on price with budweiser and miller and if you end up paying more than the grain 's really worth perhaps because of a mild wet fall and a bumper crop that the predicts then you 're going to have a real bad time of it in january you ask for the right to say no when the contract falls due if the price you negotiate now is too high based on the spot price the co op now has a choice for such a large shipment if coors decided to leave them holding the bag on the contract and instead bought it from them anyway on a depressed spot market they could lose big if they were counting on getting the contract price and bought equipment or facilities on credit against it to mitigate those losses the co op asks for an option price basically this is insurance on the contract and the co op will in return for this fee exactly how and when it 's paid is also negotiable agree to eat any future realized losses if coors were to back out of the contract   like any insurance premium the option price is nominally based on an simple formula the probability of coors exercising their option times the losses the co op would incur if that happened long term if these two figures are accurate the co op will break even by offering this price and coors either taking the contract or exercising the option however coming up with accurate predictions of these two figures such that the co op or anyone offering such a position would indeed break even at least is the stuff that keeps actuaries in business and awake at night

if you own 100 of the shares of a company then you own those shares personally   they are not owned by the company   if you sell 50 of you shares to a third party then you receive the proceeds of the sale not the company   in this case the company 's net equity is unchanged but you have exchanged 50 of your equity for cash if you wish the company to receive the proceeds of the sale of shares then you would have the company issue new shares in the company   in this case your company 's net equity would increase by the cash amount received and your personal equity would change accordingly edit in order to fairly sell 50 of equity by issuing new shares it would be necessary for the new investor to invest 50k.   this is because the new equity would be the original 50 k of equity plus the cash received for new shares   thus cost of 50 of equity = 50 of 50 k + cash recieved = cash received solving for cash received gives 50 k so that is the correct amount to charge the new investor

first in the money options are created because most options trade at the money with the rest evenly distributed between in and out so they are at best half the market when created they are also closed before expiration the reason is still unknown but one theory is barely in the money options carry enormous exercise risk because the chance that could be turned into a potentially solvency threatening unhedged liability is great therefore option sellers prefer to close barely in the money options so not to take on unhedged liability risk statistically option sellers are risk

an amortization schedule is often used to produce identical payments for the term repayment period of a loan resulting in the principal being paid off and the debt retired at the end of the loan this is in contrast to an interest only or balloon loan these loans require little or no payment against the balance of the loan requiring the loan to be paid indefinitely if there is no term or requiring the loan to be entirely paid off from cash or a new loan at the end of the term a basic amortization formula can be derived from the compound interest formula    this formula comes from the wikipedia article on amortization the basics of the formula are the periodic payment amount a your monthly payment can be determined by the principal loan p the rate r and the number of payments n.   lenders lend money to make a profit on the interest they 'd like to get back all the money they lent out amortization schedules are popular because the fixed low payments make it easier for borrowers to pay the loan off eventually they also tend to be very profitable for lenders especially at the start of the term because they make a lot of profit on interest just like the start of your mortgage the principal of a mortgage has more meaning than the principal of a revolving debt credit card the mortgage principal is fixed at the start and represents the value of the collateral property that is your home you could consider the amount of principal paid to be the percentage of your home that you actually own as part of your net worth calculation   a credit card has a new balance each month depending on how much you charge and how much you pay off principal has less meaning in this case because there is no collateral to compare against and the balance will change monthly in this case the meaning of the amortization schedule on your credit card is how long it will take you to pay off the balance if you stop charging and pay at the payment level over the term described given the high interest rate on credit cards you may end up paying twice as much for goods in the long run if you follow your lenders schedule amortizing loans are common for consumer loans unless a borrower is seeking out the lowest possible monthly payment lenders recognize that people will eventually die and want to be paid off before that happens balloon and interest only bonds and loans are more commonly issued by businesses and governments who are hopefully investing in capital improvements that will pay off in the long run thousands of people and businesses have gone bankrupt in this financial crisis because their interest only loans reached term and no one was willing to lend them money anymore to replace their existing loan

the issue is that housing price increases ca n't sustain themselves indefinitely in comparison to the rental market increases drive people back to the rental market which brings the rental market up   also just as a airbnb would drive property prices to go up it also allows people who would otherwise not be able to buy a house to make the house purchase example is a mortgage lender that will give you a cheaper loan if you put your house on airbnb. that enables people to purchase a home when they otherwise would n't be able to so over time many years the market should work itself out   in the short term airbnb can definitely cause market fluctuations for example it might enable people to continue to own their homes during a depression which would cause a supply shortage    the only factor that affects ownership prices differently than rental prices in the long term would be regulation here 's a good seattle builds apartments but vancouver bc builds about that aspect specifically

the stock market is no different in this respect to anything that 's bought or sold the price of a stock like many other things reflects what the seller is prepared to sell it at and what the buyer is prepared to offer for it if those things match then a transaction can take place the seller loses money but gains stocks they feel represent equivalent value the reverse happens for the buyer take buying a house for example did the buyer lose money when they bought a house sure they did but they gained a house the seller gained money but lost a house new money is created in the sense that companies can and do make profits those profits together with the expected profits from future years increase the value that is put on the company if we take something simple like a mining company then its value represents a lot of things and numerous other lesser things too the value of shares in the mining company will reflect all of these things it likely rises and falls in line with the price of the raw materials it mines and those change based on the overall supply and demand for those raw materials stocks do have an inherent value they are ownership of a part of a company you own part of the asset value profits and losses made by that company betting on things is different in that you 've no ownership of the thing you bet on you 're only dependent on the outcome of the bet

how do you know people want jobs    people get jobs because they want money not because they want a job    i think when a lot of people say they like their job they are lying to you and themselves because that job is the only viable option or all they know    nobody wants to admit they are not getting everything out of life they want    this system of economics people into financial slavery with threats of starvation and homelessness    i have never been opposed to hard work but the of full time jobs always sucked    i think a lot of people enjoy rewarding work not shitty go nowhere uninteresting jobs that suck all their energy serving others at their own personal expense    knowing how much money around in this country and how little is allocated for percent of us is depressing

it 's a tough question because there is society and individual to consider and the society 's effects on the individual   currently employers do n't have to provide insurance they do it to compete in the employee marketplace employers have an advantage over employees in that regard because they can procure insurance at a lower cost that employees can and they get tax breaks for doing so employers providing health insurance get a more stable relationship with their employees because employees always hold great value in having an employee who provides good benefits   the company i work for provides good benefits but suppose tomorrow they told me hey we 're not providing benefits anymore but we 'll bump your salary to what your benefits are worth plus enough to compensate for the tax break we get so now everything is equal to what it was before but i have to go out and find my own insurance which is a hassle but presumably because of the ppaca i can get a good value and carry this insurance with me wherever i go and never have to mess with changing every time i change jobs   but suppose all the employers do this so now there are no employer provided health plans and ten or twenty years down the line they 've all just taken advantage so that wages have n't kept up and they 've essentially pocketed the difference or passed it on to their customers now people have less money to buy health insurance and those near the bottom will now have to rely on the government to assist with providing health insurance   this is the way it works now with the minimum wage a recent report found that walmart employees rely on welfare to the tune of $ billion a fuels inequality epidemic taking advantage of our safety net while the company makes $ 15 billion in profit so 18 of walmart 's profits are an indirect subsidy from the us taxpayer which comes to about $ 48 per us citizen or about $ a year for the top 50 of wage earners   even so i think i 'd prefer to get my whole compensation package in one shot all else being equal that last part is important though i would need to get all the breaks my employer gets for providing myself with health insurance

whether or not you choose to buy is a complicated question   i will answer as what you should consider think about as i do n't think what should i do is on topic first off renting tends to look expensive compared to mortgages until you factor in the other costs that are included in your rent property taxes   these are a few grand a year even in the worst areas and tend to be more   find out what the taxes are ahead of time   even though you can often deduct them and your interest you 're giving up your standard deduction to do so and with the low interest regime currently unless your taxes are high you may not end up being better off deducting them home insurance this depends on home and area but is at least hundreds of dollars per year and could easily run a thousand   so another hundred a month on your bill and it 's more than renter 's insurance by quite a lot upkeep costs for the property   you 've got a lot of up front costs buy a etc types of things plus a lot of ongoing costs general repair plumbing breaks electrical breaks whatnot    sales commission as scott notes in comments   when you sell you 're paying about 6 commission so you wo n't be above water if housing prices stay flat until you 've paid off 6 of your loan value plus closing costs another couple of percent   you hit the 90 point on a 15 year about year 2 but on a 30 year you do n't hit it until about year 5 so you might not be above water when you want to sell risk of decrease in value whenever you buy property you take on the risk of losing value as well as the potential of gaining value   do n't assume that because prices are going up they will continue to remember that a lot of investors are well aware of possible profits from rising prices and will be buying and driving prices up themselves   2008 was a shock to a lot of people even in areas where it seemed like prices should 've still gone up you never know what 's going to happen   if you buy a house for 20 or so down you have a bit of a safety net if it drops 10 20 in value you 're still above water though you do of course lose money while if you buy it for 0 down and it drops 20 in value you wo n't be able to sell at all for years all that together means you should really take a hard look at the costs and benefits make a realistic calculation including all actual costs and then make a decision i would not buy simply because it seems like a good idea to not pay rent   if you 're unable to make any down payment then you 're also unable to deal with the risks in home ownership not just decrease in value but when your pipe bursts and ruins your basement or when the roof needs a replacement because a tree falls on it   yes home insurance helps but not always and the deductible will still get you just to have some numbers for my area we pay about $ 8000 a year in property taxes on a $ 280k house $ 200k mortgage $ 1k a year in home insurance so our escrow payment is about $ 750 a month   a 15 year for $ 200k is about $ 1400 a month so $ 2200 or so total cost   we do live in a high property tax area so someone in lower tax regimes would pay less say 1800 1900 but not that cheap   a 30 year would save you 500 or so a month but you 're still not all that much lower than rent

you are comparing market caps and enterprise value   if the company has four billion dollars cash in the bank then the value would be four billion plus whatever the business itself is worth as a business if the business itself is only worth 400 million then you would have market caps and 400 million enterprise value the enterprise value is basically how much the business would be worth if it had no cash or no debt   these numbers would be a very unusual situation it could happen for example if a big company has sold 90 of its business for cash when you buy a share of the company you get a tiny share of the business and you own a tiny share of the cash this stock will very likely keep its value but wo n't make much money   on the other hand more common would be a company where the business is worth 4bn but the company has also 4bn debt so it is worth exactly zero market caps close to zero but enterprise value $ 4bn because you ignore the debt in the enterprise value   edit sorry got the enterprise value totally wrong read millions instead of billions your numbers would mean that you have a huge huge company with close to debt most likely someone made a mistake here a normal situation would be say a company with a business that is worth $ 500 million but they have $ 100 million debt so market caps = $ 400 million but enterprise value = $ 500 million   ps yahoo has the same nonsense numbers on their uk site and for other companies i just checked marks and spencer 's which apparently has an enterprise value of 800 billion pound with a totally ridiculous p e ratio

the solution to this overly complex bullshit monetary system we currently find ourselves drowning in is to teach the next generation the concept of the   instead of competing for resources the apple farmer the hunter and the shoemaker must by necessity form a community and they must be taught that competing against each other capitalism will doom everyone 's existence thus they must develop a cooperative mindset   but this cooperative mindset must still hold each person accountable otherwise if someone becomes irresponsible and lazy the system will break down socialism    so there must be a cooperative mindset that holds individuals accountable cooperation is the to capitalism and accountability is the to socialism   reminds me of a principles that govern social most economically socially and philosophically sound choice that us from the slavery and burden of money in practical terms this means whenever you view a business as a stranger or whenever a business becomes a stranger to you big chains like walmart and home depot you 're competing against yourself and whenever refuse to a family member dysfunctional behavior unions and the welfare system you allow your community to rot from within    capitalism is an attack from the outside that will kill a family and socialism is an attack from within that will make a family die of and poor oversight a community mindset does not equate to an aggressive dog eat dog or a passive live and let live hippie the best fruit requires both a good soil and and the best society requires both cooperation and discipline

note my sister works for one of the largest clinical development testing and companies so i know some of the key issues but not all this answer does not constitute advice on any particular stock or other instrument this is mostly well researched opinion the problem with biotech companies and a few other areas of technology is that a lot of money is spent and debt incurred on ensuring that products are effective and safe to go to market at any stage these tests can fail and the product is essentially worthless at this stage the developers will have learnt a lot about the drug and how it is as as it is and so the next iteration of the potential drug will be better and hopefully less likely to cause complications and harmful side effects the process of gaining approval for this second iteration is just as expensive if not more so than the last this means that they are spending a lot of money on the drug and for small biotech companies concentrating on one or few drugs will have little to no income generation to offset this if the money runs out before they get the product out they are bankrupt even if the drug is perfect a second issue is that they are not the only firm looking for a cure they might have a very good drug that works very well but another company may have a better one in the pipeline that will either take their monopoly position or take all of their business based on the relative cost and efficacy the longer it takes them to get through testing the more likely it is that this will happen and the more likely it is that the competing drug will be first to market and receive all of the free publicity that goes with that in this case the risk is that they have a product eventually but no market for it and so will again run out of money another consideration is what the cure is actually worth prevention and awareness is already reducing the number of wealthy western people who have hiv and so the market size is falling where the most profit can be made in order to get any return on your investment a profit will be required where hiv rates are rising is in poor countries in africa asia and south america where the price at which people could afford to buy a cure is likely to be lower than even the break even price for the firm in this case you have a monopoly and a drug that works but no one can afford to buy it for a price that you can accept and still make a profit biotech is a very risky but potentially lucrative area because there are just so many risks at every stage price volatility occurs on and questionable statements from the company who are always trying to be positive so that their funding does n't dry up and even relatively small trades can move the market a large amount as few people want to sell an investment with so much potential there are also some charged political positions with regard to hiv and aids so a shift in political power could also derail a biotech firm that is researching this kind of drug

ah but that 's not how the game is played there are no free lunches but there are lunches that are free or mostly free to individuals as someone on the receiving end of a pension your only objective is to lock in the highest average payout the cost of that will be borne by shareholders and customers of the business so a higher number is always better right up to the point that the company folds and because of the pbgc there is a discount on the risk of the company being dragged under by its pension costs even if the company goes under the pensioners still probably get something*. likewise it 's in a company 's best interest to pensions as much as possible paying pensions from free cash flow keeps the least dollars tied up in poor investments leaving the company the most room to manage its assets efficiently likewise corporate bosses also know that they can be aggressive with   pension promises because they are allowed to under fund those liabilities it 's a taxpayer backed just because taxpayers are n't paying up front does n't mean they are n't the lender of last resort that 's just a political reality there 's no waiting to bail my ass out if the market crashes

interest rates do generally affect house prices but other factors do too especially the unemployment rate however everything else being equal when interest rates drop it makes the borrowing of money cheaper so tends to stimulate the economy and the housing market increasing the demand for houses and generally causes house prices to increase especially if the supply of new housing does n't increase with the demand when interest rates go up the opposite happens usually interest rates go down in order to stimulate   a slowing economy and interest rates go up to slow down an overheated economy regarding your situation you are able to get a 30 year fixed rate at today ’s interest rates in australia the longest fixed rate you can get is for 10 years and the rate is usually 1 or 2 percent higher than the standard variable rate most people here go for the variable rate or a fixed rate of between 1 to 3 years this means that even if rates do go up in the future you wo n't be paying a higher rate which is a positive for you you are buying the house to live in so as long as you can keep making the repayments you should not be too worried if the price of the house drops sometime in the future because if your house has dropped and you want to sell to buy another house to live in then that house would have also dropped relative to yours give or take so your main worry is that rates will go up causing both house prices to fall and unemployment to rise and you yourself losing your job and eventually your house it is a risk but what you need to consider is if you can manage that risk firstly i believe rates wo n't be going up in the us for a number of years and if and when they do start going up they will most probably start going up slowly so you have some time on your side secondly what can you do between now and when interest rates do start going up in a few years try to put more saving away to increase your safety net from 6 months to 12 months or more or make extra repayments into your home loan so that you are ahead if things do go wrong if you are worried that you could lose your job what can you do to reduce your chances of losing your job or increasing your chances of getting a new job quickly if you do lose it improve your current skills get new skills become an invaluable employee or look at possible opportunities to start your own business do your own research on the types of houses you are looking at buying the more houses you look at the better prepared you will be when the right house at the right price comes along and the less chance that you will be rushed into buying what might be an overpriced house so to sum it up do as much research as you can have an understanding of what your risks are and how you are going to manage those risks

firstly you should yourself with your options for your pension fund they changed as of 6th april 2015 so it 's all quite new the government 's guidance on it is here if you have n't already taken a tax free lump sum from your pension fund you can take up to 25 totally tax free immediately that makes getting a house for 40 k very accessible beyond the 25 you can take any of it out whenever you want access drawdown or lump sum payment depending on whether you take the 25 out up front or not that 'll be taxed as if you earned it as income so if you did n't have any other income you can take another £ without tax this tax year and then another £ or whatever the allowance goes up to next tax year and so on above that you 'd have to pay 20 tax until you reach the higher rate tax threshold at about £ 40k year you say you do have other income so you 'll have to take that into account as well when calculating what tax you 'd have to pay if you 've reached state pension age that will add some more income of course or as you suggest you can buy an annuity you can do that with some or all of the money and you can still take the 25 tax free first if you do buy an annuity the income from it will all be taxed but again your personal allowance will apply essentially an annuity is the least risky option particularly if you get one that is with inflation with inflation makes the initial income even lower but protects you against cost of living rises as you get older in exchange for avoiding that risk you probably lose out on average compared to some more risky options you might choose to get an annuity large enough to cover your basic needs and take more chances with the rest

cash back from credit cards is handled separately than the rest of the purchase i.e. interest begins accumulating on that day and likely at a higher rate and usually comes out of a lower limit than the credit allotted to that card given all these differences and the obvious revenue generation situation for the lender it makes sense for them to give the store an incentive rather than penalize them further for the use of such a feature   note i am not privy to the inner workings or agreements between large stores and credit lenders so i can not guarantee any of this

is my understanding okay if so it seems to me that this system is    rather error prone by that i mean i could easily forget to make a    wire some day and be charged interests while i actually have more than    enough money on the check account to pay the debt which is where the credit card company can add fees so you pay more and they make more money do n't forget that in the credit case you are borrowing money rather than using your own another thing that bothers me is that the credit card apparently has a    rather low credit limit if i wanted to buy something that costs $ 2500    but only have a credit limit of $ 1500 can i make a wire    from my check account to the visa account to avoid facing the limit    if so what is the point for the customer of having two accounts and    two cards for that matter if you were the credit card company do you believe people should be given large limits first there are prepaid credit cards where you could put a dollar amount on and it would reject if the balance gets low enough prepaid mastercard would be an example here that i received one last year as i was involved in the floods in my area and needed access to government assistance which was given this way part of the point of building up a credit history is that this is part of how one can get the credit limits increased on cards so that one can have a higher limit after demonstrating that they will pay it back and otherwise the system could be abused there may be a risk that if you prepay onto a credit card and then want to take back the money that there may be fees involved in the transaction generally with credit cards the company makes money on the fees involved for transactions which may come from merchants or yourself as a cash advance on a credit card will be charged interest right away while if you buy merchandise in a store there may not be the interest charged right away

partnerships do n’t work out unless you clearly define the roles and relationships hence why most partnerships fail i usually cringe when i hear partnerships also a background check never hurts think citizenship id cards having a good lawyer helps as well   i think an entire country ethnicity for the failure of your partnership is misguided but that ’s usually how our thinking defaults to when we ’re stressed like this being emotional is not a trait of good business acumen would it make you feel better if you were being lied to by indians israelis etc    you having lived in china for over 10 years should have taught you that there is a get rich quick mentality over there hopefully you did n’t put too much money into this venture i would definitely look into what they are doing in china are they break any laws over there is your business in compliance with import export controls in china amp us is this business relationship still or should you just walk away   most people are not cut out for starting their own business you might also need to support your wife in the infant stages of this enterprise or hire someone as her assistant looks like you have a lot of work discussing debating with your wife before you even get into it with the partners

i would n't recommend trying to chase a good return on this money   i 'd just put it into a savings account of some sort   if you can get a better interest rate with an online account then feel free to do that   i 'd recommend using this money to pay for as much of college out of pocket as you can   the more student loans you can avoid the better as bensin said trying to make money in the stock market in such a short time is too risky   for this money you want to preserve the principal to pay for school or to pay down your loans when you get out if you find you have more money than you need to finish paying for school then i 'd suggest setting some aside for an emergency fund setting aside enough to pay your loans off when you 're out of school saving for future purchases house car etc and then start investing maybe for retirement in a roth ira or something like that

all transactions within an ira are irrelevant as far as the taxation of the   distributions from the ira are concerned you can only take cash from an ira and a cash distribution from a traditional ira is taxable as ordinary income same as interest from a bank say without the advantage of any of the special tax rates for long term capital gains or qualified dividends even if that cash was generated within the ira from sales of stock etc in short just as with what is alleged to occur with respect to las vegas what happens within the ira stays within the ira note some ira custodians are willing to make a distribution of stock or mutual fund shares to you so that ownership of the 100 shares of ge say that you hold within your ira is transferred to you in your personal non ira brokerage account but as far as the irs is concerned your ira custodian sold the stock as the closing price on the day of the distribution gave you the cash and you promptly bought the 100 shares at the closing price in your personal brokerage account with the cash that you received from the ira it is just that your custodian saved the transaction fees involved in selling 100 shares of ge stock inside the ira and you saved the transaction fee for buying 100 shares of ge stock in your personal brokerage account your basis in the 100 shares of ge stock is the cash that you received as a distribution from the ira so that when you sell the shares at some future time your capital gains or losses will be with respect to this basis the capital gains that occurred within the ira when the shares were sold by your ira custodian remain within the ira and you do n't get to pay taxes on that at capital gains rates that being said i would like to add to what told you in his answer your mother passed away in 2011 and you are now 60 years old so 54 or 55 in 2011 it is likely that your mother was over 70.5 years old when she passed away and so she likely had started taking required minimum distributions from her ira before her death so you should have been taking rmds from the inherited ira starting with year 2012 the rmd for 2011 if not taken already by your mother before    she passed away should have been taken by her estate and distributed to her heirs in accordance with her will or if she died in accordance with state law and/or probate court there would    not have been any 10 penalty tax due on the rmds taken by you on the grounds that you were not 59.5 years old as yet that rule applies to owners your mom in this case and not to beneficiaries you in this case so have you taken the rmds for 2012 2016 or were you waiting to turn 59.5 before taking distributions in the mistaken belief that you would have to pay a 10 penalty for early   the penalty for not taking a rmd is 50 of the amount not distributed yes 50 if you did n't take rmds from the inherited ira for years 2012 2016 i recommend that you consult a cpa with expertise in tax law ask the cpa if he she is an enrolled agent with the irs enrolled agents have to pass an exam administered by the irs to show that they really understand tax law and are not just blowing smoke and can represent you in front of the irs in cases of audit etc

assuming you would still have a line of credit it makes plenty of sense to pay off the loan you 're paying 16 percent for money you do n't need right now pay it all off and you can start rebuilding your savings account so what do you do in a future emergency well first off you can use the savings you have rebuilt up to that point to fund some portion of it the rest you can borrow again as long as you have a line of credit somewhere the icing on the cake though is that once you stop carrying a balance your credit card purchases will have grace periods again once that grace period kicks in it 's an effective short term free loan and if you really wanted to you could move money that would otherwise immediately go to purchases into savings the difference is that you 're paying in full again and are n't charged any interest on the float just remember that if you fail to pay in full by the due date they charge retroactive interest and fees an alternative is to find a way to consolidate your credit card bill into a collateralized loan helocs for example the rates are much cheaper than your cc bill but require you to have some equity in the home one thing to consider is that helocs are an open line of credit that ca n't be easily taken away the interest is also tax deductible unlike your credit card interest there 's also unsecured lines of credit from banks and credit unions and if you have the credit score the can be cheaper than credit cards i think i 've shown here that there 's plenty of alternatives to carrying credit card debt for the unexpected in life pay it off

you 've asked a number of questions i can answer a few i 've quoted your question before each answer    what are the ins and outs of a foreigner like myself buying rental    property in canada this is a pretty broad question which can address location finances basic suggestions etc   here 's some things to consider provincial considerations   some ins and outs will depend on what province you are considering and what area in that province if you plan on owning in montreal for example that 's in the province of quebec and that means you or someone will need to be able to operate in the french language there are other things that might be different from province to province see stat info below canadian vs. us dollar   now might be a great time to buy property in canada since the canada dollar is weak right now to give you an idea at a non cash rate of a little over $ us will get you over $ 100k canadian that 's using the currency converter at   taxes for non resident rental property owners   according to the income tax guide for electing under section 216 2015 when you receive rental income from real or immovable property in canada the payer such as the tenant or a property manager has to withhold non resident tax at the rate of 25 on the gross rental income paid or credited to you the payer has to pay us the tax on or before the 15th day of the month following the month the rental income is paid or credited to you if you prefer to send a separate canadian tax return you can choose to elect under section 216 of the income tax act a benefit of this way is that electing under section 216 allows you to pay tax on your net canadian source rental income instead of on the gross amount if the non resident tax withheld by the payer is more than the amount of tax payable calculated on your section 216 return they will refund the excess to you   you can find this guide at canada revenue 's site stats a good place for stats is the canada mortgage and housing corporation cmhc   so if you are interesting in vacancy rates for example you can see a table that will show you that the vacancy rate in ontario is 2.3 and in british columbia it 's 1.5   however in new it 's 8 the rate for metropolitan areas across canada is 2.8   if you want to see or download this table showing the vacancy rates by province and also by metropolitan areas go to the canada mortgage and housing corporation site   you can get all sorts of housing information reports and market information there   i 've done well with condos town homes and would be interested in the    same thing over there is it pretty much all the same see the stat site mentioned above to get market info about condos etc what are the down payment requirements for non owner occupied properties the down payment is at least 20 update in response to comments about being double taxed regarding being taxed on income received from the property if you claim the foreign tax credit you will not be double taxed according to the irs the foreign tax credit intends to reduce the double tax burden that would otherwise arise when foreign source income is taxed by both the united states and the foreign country from which the income is derived   from irs topic 856 foreign tax credit    about property taxes from my understanding these would not be claimed for the foreign tax credit but can be deducted as business expenses there are various exceptions and stipulations based on your circumstance so you need to read publication 856 foreign tax credit for individuals   here 's an excerpt in most   cases   only   foreign   income   taxes   qualify for the foreign tax credit other taxes such as foreign real and personal property taxes do not qualify   but   you   may   be   able   to   deduct   these other   taxes   even   if   you   claim   the   foreign   tax credit for foreign income taxes in most cases you can deduct these other taxes   only   if   they   are   expenses incurred   in   a trade   or   business   or   in   the   production   of     however   you   can   deduct   foreign   real property taxes that are not trade or business   as   an   itemized   deduction   on   a form 1040 disclaimers   sources irs topic foreign tax credit and publication 856 foreign tax credit for individuals

as much as people on the internet and zh like blogs like to harp on auto and other narrow metrics as broader statements about how life around us is all a sham i feel this article does a good job at discussing the here   notably 1 that the sub prime auto market is rather small so while delinquencies may rise it wo n't represent a catalyst for a broader financial crisis    2 the securitized products santander and others are putting together are structured in a way to account for these defaults and loss rates so while the relative uptick in default rates is interesting to note it does n't necessarily spell doom in absolute terms    3 the fact that many auto dealers do n't verify income is n't uncommon and in fact an industry standard practice due to point 2 above the statement these dealers have been lying about incomes and/or is not verifying incomes certainly pulls at the heart strings of the 2008 housing crisis but when discussed within the context of how the auto lending market works it is n't nearly as scary as those statements would suggest in isolation

because this question seems like it will stick around i will flesh out my comments into an actual answer i apologize if this does not answer your question as asked but i believe these are the real issues at stake for the actual questions you have asked i have paraphrased and below firstly do n't do a real estate transaction without talking to a lawyer at some stage note a real estate broker is not a lawyer secondly as with all transactions with family get everything in writing feelings get hurt when someone mis remembers a deal and wants the terms to change in the future being cold and calculated now by detailing all money in and out will save you from losing a brother in the future should my brother give me money as a down payment and i finance the remainder with the bank if the bank is not aware that this is what is happening this is fraud calling something a gift when really it 's a payment for part ownership of your house is fraud there does not seem to be any debate here though i am not a lawyer if the bank is aware that this is what is happening then you might be able to do this however it is unlikely that the bank will allow you to take out a mortgage on a house which you will not fully own by given your brother a share in the future value in the house the bank might not be able to foreclose on the whole house without fighting the brother on it therefore they would want him on the mortgage the fact that he ca n't get another mortgage means a the banks may be unwilling to allow him to be involved at all and b it becomes even more critical to not commit fraud you are effectively tricking the bank into thinking that you have the money for a down payment and also that your brother is not involved now to the actual question at hand which i answer only for use on other transactions that do not meet the pitfalls listed above this is an incredibly difficult question what happens to your relationship with your brother when the value of the house goes down and he wants to sell but you want to stay living there what about when the market changes and one of you feels that you 're getting a raw deal   you do n't know where the housing market will go as an investment that 's maybe acceptable because risk forms some of the basis of returns but with you getting to live there and with him taking only the risk that risk is maybe unfairly on him he may not think so today while he 's optimistic but what about tomorrow if the market crashes whatever the terms of the agreement are get them in writing and preferably get them looked at by a lawyer consider all scenarios like what if one of you wants to sell does the other have the right to delay or buy you out or what if one if you wants to buy the other out etc etc etc there are too many clauses to here which is why you need to get a lawyer

if you are going to put it into a banking system just deposit it why did breaking it up even cross your mind like what would that even have accomplished so you could pretend like you started as a club if you were ever casually asked by a bank teller or federal agent if you have to ever account for the source of your money you will have to account for it regardless you should n't worry about things that may trigger higher scrutiny on you because it is pretty random the financial institution may file a suspicious activity report any time they feel like it which they routinely do without the customer 's knowledge for a wide range of reasons and actually attempting to break it up into smaller deposits would mean the suspicious activity report would escalate into criminal charges and regarding the irs if they ever audited you then you will still have to account for that $ 25,000 no matter what you did with it

in many espp programs i.e. every one i 've had the opportunity to be a part of in my career your purchase is at a discount from the lower of the stock prices at the start and end of the period so a before tax 5 return is the minimum you should expect if the price of the stock appreciates between july 1 and december 31 you benefit from that gain as well more concretely stock closes at $ 10/share on july 1 and $ on december 31 the plan buys for you at $ if you sell immediately you clear $ in profit or a nearly 16 pre tax gain if the price declines instead of increases though you still see that 5 guaranteed profit combine that with the fact that you 're contributing every paycheck not all at once at the start and your implied annual rate of return starts to look pretty good so if it was me i 'd pay the minimum on the student loan and put the excess into the espp

i had this problem when i finished my job in canada in sept 2013    you 'll likely have to open the account in person in canada at least if you do n't already have a relationship with a broker there do not go to virtual brokers   they told me that my us citizenship was no problem but right before i left canada to double check   it was n't until i asked specifically which us states they were licensed in that they realized they were licensed in no us states they told me that they 'd freeze my account when i left i then moved my former pension to a locked in rrsp at bmo   as of september 2010 bmo could handle residents of most us states but it took some tooth pulling to get the list out of them   however after i flew to the usa bmo called to demand more id   my account was frozen until i flew back to canada in person just to show id annoyed i closed the bmo account and moved it to td waterhouse   td waterhouse can handle accounts for residents of all the us states except virginia louisiana and nebraska   i only got the complete list of exceptions when i made my first trade since the guys at the trading desk are much more knowledgeable about such things than the guys in the branch   td was extremely friendly about my usa citizenship residence   many canadian brokers simply wo n't accept us residents at least as of the end of 2013 whichever broker you choose bring lots more id than they require   insist that they it all make sure to include your social security card   you do n't want them to demand more id after you 've left the country like bmo did   they may even make such a move simply to get rid of us customers because the fatca is a pain for foreign banks

if we 're including psychological considerations then the question becomes much more complicated will having a higher available credit increase the temptation to spend will eliminating 100 of a small debt provide more positive reinforcement than paying off 15 of a larger debt etc if we 're looking at the pure financial impact the question is simpler the only advantage i see to prioritizing the lower interest card is the float when you buy something on a credit card interest is often calculated for that purchase starting at the beginning of the next billing cycle rather than immediately from the purchase date i 'm not clear on what policies credit card companies have on giving float for credit cards with a carried balance so you should look into what your card 's policy is   other than than paying off the higher interest rate card is better than paying off the lower interest rate on top of that you should look into whether you qualify for any of the following options presented from best to worst

somebody will have to file all the required paperwork and fees with the local government state government and even the federal government this paperwork is used by these governments to record who owns the property and how it is owned   prior to the settlement date they also will need to verify how the property is described and owned so that you are sure that you are being sold the exact property you expect and that it is delivered to you free and clear of all other debts if this is done wrong you might discover years later that you paid money for something that you do n't really own in some jurisdictions this has to be done via a law office in others there is no requirement for a lawyer because a mortgage company bank or credit union is giving you money for the loan they may require you to use a settlement attorney they do n't want to discover in 5 years that a simple mistake will cost them hundreds of thousands to fix the mortgage company is required to give you a more detailed estimate of all the closing costs before you are committed to the loan the quoted paragraph is not good enough even if you can avoid the use of a lawyer these functions still need to be done by somebody and that will still cost money

you would need to check the original mortgage papers you signed with the originators   chances are you agreed to allow the mortgage to be sold and serviced by other parties refinancing would also put you in the same boat unless you got them to take that clause out of the mortgage refinance papers also chances are most small banks and originators simply can not keep mortgages on their books there are also third parties that service loans too that do not actually own the mortgages as well this is another party that could be involved out of many in your mortgage   i would also not worry about complaints out of loans most probably were underwater on their mortgage but i am sure a few are legitimate complaints   banks make mistakes i know right   anyway good luck and let me know if you find out anything different

they would definitely buy at premium but how much higher would depend on how they value the company there are many ways how a pe firm would do this and it ’s not easy to guess without knowing more financial information    i ’m a bit curious when you say they would want to buy all shares typically pe firm would n’t buy out all since they would still require the owner proprietor to continue developing the products unless the products are matured and it ’s a 100 makeover transformation while this is possible it ’s quite rare at least from my experience    if your shares are significant enough and you want to keep it you may do so but it ’ll require massive efforts when you ’d want to liquidate later since it ’ll be in a private market it ’ll hard to value for other buyers and the known buyers might squeeze you if you ’re desperate to sell    disclaimer some years of experience in pe regulations might differ in your geographical location

someone has to hand out cash to the seller even if no physical money changes hands and i 've bought a house i can tell you a lot of money changes hands at closing in at least the form of a personal check and regardless of exactly how the bank accounts for the actual disbursement of the loan the net result is that the buyer has cash that they give the seller and are now in debt to the bank for least that amount but they now have a house now the bank probably did n't have that money just sitting in its vault money sitting in a vault is money that is not making more money for the bank therefore most banks keep only fractionally more than the percentage of deposit balances that they are required to keep by the feds there are also restrictions on what depositors money can be spent on and loans are not one of them the model of taking in money in savings accounts and then loaning it out is what caused the savings and loan collapse in the 80s so to get the money it turns to investors the bank sells bonds putting itself in debt to bond holders then takes that money and loans it out at a higher rate covering the interest on the bond and making itself a tidy profit for its own shareholders banks lose money on defaults in two ways first they lose all future interest payments that would have been made on the loan technically this is n't revenue until the interest is calculated for each month and accrues on the loan therefore it does n't show on the balance sheet one way or the other however the holders of those bonds will expect a return and the banks no longer have the mortgage payment to cover the coupon payments that they themselves have to pay bondholders creating cash flow problems the second and far more real and damaging way that banks lose money on a foreclosure is the loss of collateral value a bank virtually never offers an unsecured signature loan for a house certainly not at the advertised 3 4 interest rates they want something to back up the loan so if you disappear off the face of the earth they have a clear claim to something that can help them recover their money usually that 's the house itself if you default they get the house from you and sell it to recover their money now a major cause of foreclosure is economic downturn like the one we had in 2009 and are still recovering from when the economy goes in the crapper a lot of things we generally consider stores of value lose that value because the value of the any really is based on what someone else would pay to have it when fewer people are looking to buy that demand drops bringing prices with it homes and real estate are one of the real big ticket items subject to this loss of value when the average joe does n't know whether he 'll have a job tomorrow he does n't go house hunting this average joe may even be looking to sell an extra parcel of land or an income property for cash increasing supply further decreasing prices economic downturn can often increase crime and decrease local government spending on upkeep of public lands as well as homeowners upkeep of their own property by the broken window effect this makes the neighborhood even less desirable in a vicious cycle what made this current recession a double whammy for mortgage lenders is that it was caused in large part by a housing bubble cheap money for houses made housing prices balloon rapidly and then when the money became more expensive such as in sub prime arms a lot of those loans which should never have been signed off on by either side went belly up between the loss of home value a lot of which will likely turn out to be permanent that 's the problem with a bubble things never recover to their peak and the adjustment of interest rates on mortgages to terms that will actually pay off the loan many homeowners found themselves so far underwater and sinking fast that the best financial move for them was to walk away from the whole thing and try again in seven years now the bank 's in a they have this loan they 'll never see repaid in cash and they have this home that 's worth maybe 75 of the mortgage 's outstanding balance if they 're lucky some homes in extremely distressed areas like detroit are currently trading for 30 40 of what they sold for just before the bubble burst multiply that by say 100,000 distressed homes with similar declines in value and you 're talking about tens of billions of dollars in losses on top of that the guarantor basically the bank 's insurance company against these types of losses is now in financial trouble themselves because they took on so many contracts for debt that turned out to be bad aig fannie freddie they may very well declare bankruptcy and leave the bank holding the bag even if the guarantor remains solvent as they did thanks to generous taxpayer bailouts the bank 's swap contract with the guarantor usually requires them to sell the house thus realizing the loss between what they paid and what they finally got back before the guarantor will pay out but nobody 's buying houses anymore because prices are on their way down the only people who 'd buy a house now versus a year from now or two or three years are the people who have no choice and if you have no choice you 're probably in a financial situation that would mean you 'd never be approved for the loan anyway in order to get rid of them the bank has to sell them at auction for pennies on the dollar that further increases the supply of cheap homes and further drives down prices making even the nicer homes the bank 's willing to keep on the books worth less there 's a reason these homes were called toxic assets they 're poisonous to the banks whether they keep or sell them meanwhile all this price depression is now affecting the people who did everything right even people who bought their homes years before the bubble even formed are watching years of equity building go down the crapper that 's to say nothing of the people with prime credit who bought at just the wrong time when the bubble was at its peak even without an adjusting arm to contend with these guys are still facing the fact that they paid top dollar for a house that likely will not be worth its purchase price again in their lifetime even with a fixed mortgage rate they 'll be underwater effectively losing their entire payment to the bank as if it were rent for much longer than it would take to have this entire mess completely behind them if they just walked away from the whole thing moved back into an apartment and waited it out so these guys decide on a strategic default give the bank the house which does n't cover the outstanding balance of course and if they sue file bankruptcy that really makes the banks nervous if people who did everything right are considering the hell of foreclosure and bankruptcy to be preferable to their current state of affairs the bank 's main threat keeping people in their homes is hollow that makes them very reluctant to sign new mortgages because the risk of default is now much less certain now people who do want houses in this market ca n't buy them further reducing demand further decreasing prices you get the idea that 's the housing collapse in a nutshell and what banks and our free market have been working through for the past five years with only the of a turnaround picking up home sales

the advice is always to not get a big refund from the irs because that is giving them an interest free loan you actually have an opportunity to get an interest free loan from them   when you file your taxes for 2013 note how much you paid in taxes not the check you had to send in with your tax form or the refund you received but the total amount in taxes you paid multiply that amount by 1.1 or 110 for example $ 8,000 1.10 = $ when you get your paychecks in 2014 you goal is to make sure that your federal taxes not state social security or medicare taken from your paycheck will get you over that number $ or a paycheck keep in mind that the later you start the more each check needs to be you will owe them a big check in april 2015 but because of the 110 rule you will not owe interest penalties or have to deal with quarterly taxes the 110 rule you from these if you end them 110 as much a you paid in taxes the previous year note that no matter how you pay your taxes for 2014 big check now extra per paycheck or minimum now you will have to watch your withholding during 2015 because the 110 rule wo n't protect you

usually not the total interest but all interest accrued and unpaid to date this is called the loan payoff amount and repays the bank their principal plus the true cost of capital on that principal since your last amortized payment which is probably never since you just signed the loan papers there may also be a prepayment penalty this is something that should have been disclosed to you if it exists but it 's fairly rare in u.s. mortgages anymore   the theory is the bank got the money they paid you at the start of the loan by selling a bond package backed by your mortgage and others of similar credit history and/or about the same time a mortgage backed security by turning around and paying early you meet your obligation but the bank is now stuck with at least 10 years of quarterly coupon payments on that bond which they were expecting to pay using your mortgage interest for their trouble you would pay an additional amount that either covers their call price on the portion of the bonds used for your principal or simply buys them the time to re issue a new mortgage using your repaid principal to back the bond again in the modern housing market such a prepayment penalty is very rare because so many lenders are willing to give you a mortgage without one and so many buyers balk at the thought of having to pay more if they pay early the whole point is to pay less by paying early just something to look up in your mortgage documentation

it sort of depends on what happens in the future if the economy eventually comes back and the old norm returns then it will certainly be gen x who lost out the most because as stated this is the time gen x'ers should be taking the period the millenials are in right now and using it to maximize their wealth that 's a 10 20 year period and so far from 2008 2012 it 's been that 's up to 1/4 of their maximization period gone and they can never really get that back millenials still have time   on the flip side if the economy doesn't return then millenials will be in a lot of trouble what with the college debt they 've incurred and no means of ever really finding a career however if that ends up being the case i think we 're going to all be in a lot of trouble anyway so probably the millenials problems will end up paling in comparison to whatever else presents itself

this article is interesting but deeply biased the writer manages to write pages and pages on a feature about charney that only tells charney 's story he interviews i think unless he 's always just quoting other sources a few other folks but only ones who think he 's brilliant and was wronged    it was only in the last 25 of a very long article when the author even bothers to reference the criticisms and discussion of sexual harassment and culture of women that was part of what started the blowback from customers and though it says something like you ca n't talk about charney 's story without mentioning the it seems like an afterthought basically a lot of people said charney was a creep and some of them sued him but he says the allegations are false so let 's move on   it was n't just increasingly uncomfortable ads it was also people saying they were coerced into those ads people saying the workplace was almost toxic in it 's sexual charge charney saying stuff like then they should n't work here the fact that people working in the stores were rated on their attractiveness and size that aa would n't make or sell clothes past a certain size because he did n't want large people wearing his clothes the fact that the clothes cost $ 50 for a shirt then fell apart etc    charney certainly has his side of things but i personally think it was irresponsible to write a feature this long without giving more than a paragraph or two of context into why it was n't just a cruel board doing him wrong but that even many of his employees and customers turned away from the brand

from wikipedia a hard money loan is a specific type of asset based loan financing through which a borrower receives funds secured by the value of a parcel of real estate hard money loans are typically issued at much higher interest rates than conventional commercial or residential property loans and are almost never issued by a commercial bank or other deposit institution hard money is similar to a bridge loan which usually has similar criteria for lending as well as cost to the borrowers the primary difference is that a bridge loan often refers to a commercial property or investment property that may be in transition and does not yet qualify for traditional financing whereas hard money often refers to not only an asset based loan with a high interest rate but possibly a distressed financial situation such as arrears on the existing mortgage or where bankruptcy and foreclosure proceedings are occurring this implies to me that these loans are only against real estate presumably because it does n't move and ca n't be simply taken away as in the case where you have say a high value diamond or painting

2.5 whoa you are being robbed there   straight up stripped down and bent over a table robbed never agree to fees   if they do n't want to do the work to give you a loan there are other lenders who do rarely agree to points   if you know and i do n't mean think i mean know if you know that you are going to hold that loan much longer than it would take to repay those points then maybe   for example if they are charging one point to lower your rate 0.25 you want to be totally sure you will stay in the house at least four years and probably more like six or eight years before moving or refinancing it 's more or less ok to pay for the appraisal   if something goes wrong with the loan application the appraisal will be valid for a few more months you can try again i once had 14 cash for a down payment   the loan officer said if i could come up with 15 the rate would be reduced by 0.25   to get the money i took a reverse point which paid me 1 but raised my the rate by 0.25 the loan officer who was n't too bright asked why did you do that   the two things cancel each other out i did it i explained because you paid me 1 of the value of my house to sign my name twice

there are a few situations in which it may be advantageous to exercise early wikipedia actually has a good explanation option style difference in value to account for the american 's higher value there must be some    situations in which it is optimal to exercise the american option    before the expiration date this can arise in several ways such as an in the money itm call option on a stock is often exercised just    before the stock pays a dividend that would lower its value by more    than the option 's remaining time value   a put option will usually be    exercised early if the underlying asset files for   a deep itm currency option fx option where the strike currency has a    lower interest rate than the currency to be received will often be    exercised early because the time value sacrificed is less valuable    than the expected depreciation of the received currency against the    strike   an american bond option on the dirty price of a bond such as    some convertible bonds may be exercised immediately if itm and a    coupon is due   a put option on gold will be exercised early when deep    itm because gold tends to hold its value whereas the currency used as    the strike is often expected to lose value through inflation if the    holder waits until final maturity to exercise the option they will    almost certainly exercise a contract deep itm minimizing its time    needed

update unfortunately citibank have removed the standard account option and you have to choose the plus account which requires a minimum monthly deposit of 1800 sterling and two direct debits absolutely there is   i would highly recommend citibank 's plus current account   it 's a completely free bank account available to all uk residents there are no monthly fees and no minimum balance requirements to maintain   almost nobody in the uk has heard of it and i do n't know why because it 's extremely useful for anyone who travels or deals in foreign currency regularly in one online application you can open a sterling current account and deposit accounts in 10 other foreign currencies when i opened mine around 3 years ago you could only open up to 7 accounts at any one time citibank provide a visa card which you can link to any of your multi currency accounts via a phone call to their hotline unfortunately not online which frequently annoys me but i guess you ca n't have everything   for usd and eur you can use it as a visa debit for usd eur purchases for all other currencies you ca n't make debit card transactions but you can make atm withdrawals without incurring an fx conversion best of all for your case a free usd cheque book is also available you can fund the account in sterling and exchange to usd through online banking   the rates are not as good as you would get through an fx broker like xe.com but they 're not terrible either you can also fund the account by usd wire transfer which is free to deposit at citibank but the bank you issue the payment from will likely charge a swift fee so this might not be worth it unless the amount is large enough to justify the fee if by any chance you have a citibank account in the us you can also make free usd transfers in out of this account subject to a daily limit

the risk of the particular share moving up or down is same for both    however in terms of mitigating the risk investor a is conservative on upside ie will exit if he gets 10 while is ready to take unlimited downside his belief is that things will not go worse while investor b is wants to make at least 10 less than peak value and in general is less risk averse as he will sell his position the moment the price hits 10 less than max peak value so it more like how do you mitigate a risk as to which one is wise depends on your belief and the loss appetite

profit has nothing to do with the level of interest rates is this correct in theory yes the difference that you 're getting at is called net interest margin as long as this stays constant so does the bank 's profit according to this article as long as the interest rate charged on loans does n't decline faster than the interest rate received on deposit accounts banks can continue to operate normally or even reduce their bad loan exposure by offering lower lending rates to already proven borrowers so banks may be able to acquire the same net interest margin with lower risk however the article also mentions new research from a federal agency their findings show that net interest margins get worse during low rate environments defined as any time when a country 's three month sovereign bond yield is less than 1.25 so in theory banks should remain profitable when interest rates are low but this may not actually be the case

i have n't read the terms here but the question may not have a good answer   that wo n't stop me from trying    call the real rate interest rate inflation and you 'll have what is called negative real rates it 's rare for the overnight real rate to be negative   if you check the same sources for historical data you 'll find it 's usually higher   this is because borrowing money is usually done to gain an economic benefit ie make a profit   that is no longer a consideration when borrowing money short term and is imo a serious problem   this will cause poor investment decisions like you see in housing notice i said overnight rate   that is the only rate set by the boc and the longer rates are set by the market   the central bank has some influence because a longer term is just a series of shorter terms but if you looked up the rate on long canadian real return bonds you 'd see them with a real rate around 1 what happens when the central bank raise or lowers rates will depend on the circumstances   the rate in india is so high because they are using it to defend the rupee   if people earn more interest they have a preference to buy that currency rather than others   however these people are n't stupid they realize it 's the real rate that matters   that 's why japan can get away with very low rates and still have demand for the currency they have or had deflation   when that changed the preference for their currency changed so if canada forex driven inflation then the boc will have to raise rates to defend the dollar for the purpose of lowering inflation from imports   whether it works or not is another story   note that the canadian dollar is very dependant on the total dollar value of net oil exports if canada has inflation due too an accelerating economy this implies that there are profitable opportunities so businesses and individuals will be more likely to pay a positive real rate of interest   in that scenario the demand for credit money will drive the real rate of return

i work at bats chi x europe and wanted to provide some clarity answers to these questions bats chi x europe is a recognised investment exchange so it is indeed a stock exchange   sometimes the term equity market could be used when explaining our business but essentially we are a stock exchange   as some background bats chi x europe was formed by the acquisition of chi x europe by bats trading in november 2011 at the time of the acquisition each company operated as a trading facility for the trading of pan european equities via a single trading platform the category of was introduced by markets in financial instrument directive in 2007 which introduced competition in equities trading and allowed european stocks to be traded on any european platform until 2007 many european stocks had to be traded only their local exchanges due to so called concentration rules following the acquisition bats chi x europe became the largest in europe offering trading in more than 2,000 securities securities by september 2013 across 15 major european markets on a single trading platform   in may 2013 bats chi x europe received recognised investment exchange status from the uk financial conduct authority meaning that bats chi x europe has changed from an status to full exchange status in response to question 1 the equities traded on bats chi x europe are listed on stock exchanges such as the lse but also listed on the other european exchanges the term third party equities is not particularly useful as all stock trading in europe is generally a second hand   business referred to as secondary market trading at the time of listing a firm issues shares trading in these shares after the listing exercise is generally what happens in equity markets and these shares can be bought and sold on stock exchanges across europe secondary market trading describes all trading on all exchanges or that takes place after the listing in response to question 2 bats chi x europe trades over stocks on its own trading platform when trading on bats chi x europe orders are executed on their own platform and will not end up of the lse order books or platform the fact that a stock was first listed on the lse does not mean that all trading in this stock happens via the lse however settlement process ensures that stocks end up being logged in a single depository this means that a stock bought on bats chi x europe can be offset against the same stock sold on the lse   in response to question 3 as noted above bats chi x europe received recognised investment exchange status from the uk financial conduct authority in may 2013 meaning that bats chi x europe has changed from an status to full stock exchange status as an exchange bats chi x europe is authorised to offer primary and secondary listings alongside its existing business   according to the of european securities exchanges bats chi x europe has been the largest equity exchange in europe by value traded in every month so far in 2013 in august of european equities trading in the 15 markets covered were traded on bats chi x europe in july and august the average notional value traded on bats chi x europe was around € 7.2 billion per day hope this information is helpful

the current tax regime   not sure if you are being serious or facetious but   us citizens and resident aliens abroad filing individuals international taxpayers us citizens and resident aliens abroad filing requirements   gt;if you are a u.s. citizen or resident alien living or traveling outside the united states you generally are required to file income tax returns estate tax returns and gift tax returns and pay estimated tax in the same way as those residing in the united states   in contrast corporations do n't pay taxes on profits earned abroad until repatriation economy corporate taxes inversion index.html economy corporate tax   so guess what they never do   this is why literally every large us multi national corporate person pays next to nothing in taxes   it is quite obvious that this is a violation of the spirit if not the letter of tax law     that simple fix would wipe out massive amounts of government debt and force multi national corporations and their shareholders to become engaged stake holders in the efficiency of government   but if unlike w-2 paid human counterparts you can dodge all taxation who cares if the government is using funds efficiently   that is incentive to actually game the system to force the government into wasteful spending because the subsequent fallout of increased taxation and/or failure of the state can be dodged without consequence

there are a few of ways to do this ask the seller if they will hold a vendor take back mortgage or they essentially hold a second mortgage on the property for a shorter amortization 1 5 years with a higher interest rate than the bank held mortgage the upside for the seller is he makes a little money on the second mortgage the downsides for the seller are that he does n't get the entire purchase price of the property up front and that if the buyer goes bankrupt the vendor will be second in line behind the bank to get any money from the property when it 's sold for amounts owing look for a seller that is willing to put together a lease to own deal the buyer and seller agree to a purchase price set 5 years in the future a monthly rent is calculated such that paying it for 5 years equals a 20 down payment at the 5 year mark you decide if you want to buy or not if you do not the deal is if you do the rent you paid is counted as the down payment for the property and the sale moves forward find a private lender for the down payment this is known as a hard money lender for a reason they know you ca n't get it anywhere else expect to pay higher rates than a ask your mortgage broker and your real estate agent about these options

you 'd need to test the assumptions here in effect you 're saying that in 15 years your account will have a balance 10x your income but normally you 'd expect your income to grow over the years e.g. promotions and so you 'd hope that your income in 15 years would be significantly larger than what it is now    but even in the case where your account eventually does grow to 10x your salary at that time it may still be worth continuing to contribute in effect adding a further 1 to your account is boosting the compounding return on your account by 1 after fees and risk free this additional 1 return in effect makes your retirement plan safer you either get a higher total return for the same investment mix or you can get the same total return for a slightly safer investment mix in effect you 're treating your salary as a safe annuity and each year putting 10 of the return from that into your more risky retirement account

gt but their strategy is not debt spending to increase demand   they deficit spend   they increase prosperity and thus demand   they do it consistently and repeatedly   claims that it 's effects are unintentional do n't hold up starve the beast is political cover   what they are doing is pushing profits up for the rich by cutting their taxes   why has as many answers as there are politicians pursuing these policies but the deficit spending is fairly obviously designed to make the economy appear to be doing better   the interesting side effect is that they are making the economy do better    gt deficit spending does drive demand short term but as this debt rises so does the rent seeking cost of that debt   this is not where rent seeking occurs the net cost of national debt is negative    gt most such debt spending is a complete waste   only if you do n't understand that people having money is a prerequisite for people spending money    gt your tax rate is not determined by how much money the government takes from you   the government gives you more income than it takes from you in taxes   every bit of cut spending removes income from the population   since we all work for each other and one person 's income becomes another 's relatively quickly it 's an appropriate approximation to average that income out over the population and when you do that you quickly see that government taxes and spending have a net positive effect on how much money we have   this is why we can dump so much into defense spending and still have a viable economy and why removing that spending would do more harm than good     our economic trouble has nothing to do with efficiency and how much work needs to be done and everything to do with how much money people have to spend   government taking on more debt thus creating more money and handing it to it 's population makes that problem better and thus the economy gains strength   fixing the core problem that is causing the population to run out of money is a harder task but piling on the debt in the meantime the symptoms

the vix is a mathematical aggregate of the implied volatilities of the s&p 500 index components it itself can not be traded as there currently is no way to only hold a position on an implied volatility alone   implied volatility can only currently be derived from an option relative to its underlying   further the s&p 500 index itself can not be traded only the attempts to replicate it   for assets that are not tradable derivatives can be cash settled where the value of the underlying is delivered in cash   cash settlement can be used for underlyings that in fact due trade but are frequently only elected if the underlying is costly to deliver or there is an incentive to circumvent regulation currently only futures that settle on the value of the vix at the time of delivery trade in other words vix futures holders must deliver on the value of the vix in cash upon settlement   options in turn trade on those futures and in turn are also cash settled on the value of the underlying future at expiration the vxx etf holds one to two month vix futures that it trades out of before delivery so while it is impossible to know exactly what is held in the vxx accounts unless if one had information from an insider or the vxx published such details one can assume that it holds vix futures contracts no later than two settlements from the preset   it should be noted that the vxx does not track the vix over the long run because of the cost to roll the futures and that the futures are more stable than the vix so it is a poor substitute for the vix over time periods longer than one day underlying now implies any abstract from which a financial product derives its value

afternoon /u    gt it is not right to force people to buy any product or service period   i think i understand why you feel this way but i disagree   taxation is forcing someone to purchase products and services provided by the government that he may or may not want   it is not ideal but just as a family would fall apart without demands on it 's members a country will do the same   government can not exist if your position is applied across the board and we are all better off with government   gt this mandate is just one of the terrible things about obamacare   nobody likes the mandate just like nobody likes taxes but both are required to keep their systems functioning   pointing to the mandate as bad is n't going to change my mind on obamacare any more than pointing to taxes is going to convince me to support dissolving government   you will need to show me that what we get for the mandate is n't worthwhile   gt obama effectively gave people the option to get insurance after they get sick without consequence of higher prices    obama did not give people this option   this is precisely the scenario the obamacare mandate prevented because you were forced to get insurance before you got sick   by saying he wo n't enforce the mandate president trump is giving people this option and you are absolutely correct on how that will play out   gt i am not a bad person i 'm not greedy either   of course not   you put a lot of time into your answer just to explain your position to some guy on the internet   i appreciate that   gt running water in your home central air life saving surgery drugs and physical therapy being able to turn on and off electricity with a switch make a pot of coffee right at your kitchen counter top the government did not of this people did   government is instrumental in providing all of this   think about it   gt running water in your home   that is water you and your state have a right to collect because of agreements handled by the federal bureau of   it was collected and stored in public which exist because of dams built by public works projects   your municipality then and the water and pumps it to your house in public facilities and treats the resultant sewage   gt central air   people used to install air conditioners with which are responsible for the hole in the wiki   it was n't until the epa called attention to the problem and the government outlawed the in the 80 's that things changed   in addition is an energy heavy technology but the energy grid does n't have to do rolling because the government mandates minimum insulation on homes and efficiency standards     gt life saving surgery drugs and physical therapy   the us governments funds a little less than half the drug check us government share basic research funding falls we also know these items improve peoples lives because the fda and have demanded clinical trials to prove new treatments are safe and effective   do n't forget that government institutions like the and cdc have pushed and outbreak responses to effectively nasty diseases like and   gt being able to turn on and off electricity with a switch   electricity has been recognized as a public wiki and those companies are strongly regulated   the transmission lines that bring power to your house are required to be open so one power company does not have a monopoly on supplying your house power   are air is no longer with because of the epa and the doe monitors and regulates nuclear waste   gt make a pot of coffee right at your kitchen counter top   coffee is imported from south american or african countries thanks to us trade agreements and is safe because of the fda   your coffee maker was probably made in china but does n't burn your house down because the manufacturer is required to follow regulations from the and if there is a problem you can do something about it thanks to the ftc and/or court system   gt and if the government can get the hell out of our way we can continue to improve the quality of life like we have been for hundreds of years now in this country   the quality of life in the us has been improving in the us for hundreds of years because of government   a capitalistic market is important too but free market principles exist today in somalia but their lives still suck   the reason is that they are missing a strong central government to fill in the gaps keep the playing field somewhat fair and yes make a few demands of its citizens in exchange   i hope you 're having a great weekend

sadly most jurisdictions do n't think this way when they assign property taxes   you have x acres our standard for this county is $ y per acre so you owe $ property taxes     and if you tax by dwelling size and features you are saying a poor person can not live in a nice house   lets say joe millionaire buys a fancy $ 2 m house with a fancy pool and all the trimmings   sure joe millionaire can afford the high taxes of say $ 20k year   but what if jim who makes only $ 35k year spends 10 years and about $ 100k building a similar nice house out of scrap materials he finds purchases on sale or on craigslist etc   he rents a and   a gun and builds himself a fancy pool it really nice and the county comes in and says well jim that 's a $ 2 m house you owe us $ 20k year in taxes for it   jim ca n't afford it and the county takes his house for unpaid taxes   screw you and your efforts poor person   and before you say he can just sell it for $ 2 m well what if he made it unique to his tastes and no one wants to buy it   or the market is bad right now     and yes this has happened to someone i know though the house was valued at $ 500 k he still could n't afford the taxes   and since it was not yet fully finished he had to sell it for only about $ 100k after working on it for several years   so yes as long as you want to make sure poor people can not live in nice places property tax is the way to go

i do n't think bb sells $ 300 suits i think they 're going to be more like + $ 800 but it has been awhile since i 've looked    as far as shoes yeah i meant allen edmonds for ae they 're like the entry level for nice shoes they 're not cheap tho the benefit to them is that they look a little nicer and should last much longer if you take care of them ae sells their factory seconds at      i ve gotten two pair from there and have n't been able to find the defect as far as which black shoe that 's up to you you can not go wrong with their park ave 's but they might be a bit formal i have the 's but i would n't recommend monk straps for your first pair   maybe consider a dark brown shoe it will look a little more natural with the navy suit and is arguably a bit more versatile the stand is always a good option

a rather good irs paper on the topic states that a donation of a business in kind inventory would be   under irc however the fair market value must be    reduced by the amount of gain that would not be long term capital gain if the    property had been sold by the donor at the property 's fair market value determined    at the time of the contribution under this rule deductions for donated inventory    are limited to the property 's basis generally its cost where the fair market value    exceeds the basis   there are references to irc regulations in a narrative context you may find helpful this paper goes on for 16 pages describing detailed exceptions and the political reasons for the exceptions most of which are concerned with encouraging the donation of prepared food from restaurants to hunger charities by guaranteeing a value for something that would otherwise be trashed valueless and a worked out example of that had a cost of goods of $ 200 and a market value of $ 1000

while i agree that highly processed foods including plant based meat substitutes are probably not the best things we could be eating them with scare words like chemicals is unhelpful and certainly does n't account for the bigger picture   all food is made of water is a chemical is full of various chemicals   looking at the specific nutritional profile of meat alternatives most of them fall somewhere between marginally better and no worse than meat based foods   getting protein from greens whole grains nuts and would probably be better but meat alternatives still make it easier for people to adopt plant based diets and see them as viable which is likely to have a positive health impact or again at least be no worse than an diet   you also discount the non health related reasons that people choose these options   many people may be choosing meat alternatives because of concerns over animal welfare or the environment   other people may simply like the many options are different enough from meat to not be comparable from a taste standpoint and many plant based meat alternatives are much better tasting than similar frozen convenience foods made from animals

it 's called extracting consumer surplus basically i have a bunch of movie who have paid a lot for their tickets some of them do n't like popcorn and some do of the people in the latter group there are some who are willing to pay a lot for it that 's partly because i have a select group rich movie and partly because some of these people would be willing to pay more for popcorn with a movie than without if i were just selling popcorn i 'd have to charge a competitive price but i 'm really selling movies which have more than covered my costs rent heat etc so my costs of selling popcorn are less than that of a non movie popcorn seller and i do n't really need to sell it ironically it means that i can take my chances and sell a relatively small amount at a high price thereby maximizing my unit profit i do n't mind having people not buy popcorn because i 've already made my profit from them with the movie from the point of view of the consumer most consumers see popcorn as an afterthought they will seldom   think i can buy popcorn $ 2.00 cheaper at theater a than theater b and there 's a 20 percent chance that i will want to buy popcorn so theater a is 40 cents $ cheaper than theater b. instead most make the decision to buy the popcorn after they 've arrived at theater b because it as impulse item   and even if they do the 40 cents calculation theater b might be selected because other factors convenience location etc outweigh the 40 cent extra cost of popcorn purchased sometimes put another way the cost of popcorn is usually heavily discounted because of its to other facets of the decision

with student loans at 2 i would n't pay a dime over minimum on that and i certainly would n't sell an investment property to pay them off you can get cd 's that beat 2 interest with the rentals you could sell the one that is n't performing as well and pay no capital gains tax if you lived in it 2 of the last 5 years counting 5 years back from sale date that 'd be a nice chunk of money for your down payment the risk of using proceeds to buy a different rental property is that you may find you do n't like being a distance landlord and then you 'd lose money selling or be stuck doing something you do n't enjoy for a while until you can sell without a loss like you mentioned the risk of selling either both rental properties is that if the arizona housing rental markets do well you 'd have given up your position and missed out ultimately i think it 's about your desired timeline if you are content to wait a while to buy in san diego you could have a handsome down payment will know whether or not you like being a distance landlord and can sell keep the rentals accordingly alternatively if you want to get a house in san diego sooner then selling one or both rentals gets you there faster if i was in your position i 'd probably sell the rental that i lived in and put that toward a down payment on a primary residence keeping the other rental for now and trying my hand at being a distance landlord

one of the best answers to this question that i 've ever read is in a paper published by robert lucas in the journal of economic perspectives that journal is meant to a be a place for experts to write about their area of expertise in economics for a general but still technically minded audience they recently opened up the journal as free to the public which is a fantastic resource you no longer need a subscription to or whatever to read it   you can read the abstract to the paper and find a link to it here one of the things that i like a lot about this paper is that it strips out absolutely everything even slightly unnecessary to thinking about a and just discusses what one can arrive at with a very very simple model of course with great simplicity come sacrifice about details however it does a great job of answering your question why do people care about growth a quick note the key to understanding the answer to your question is to think about things in terms of the long term   not even looking forward to the future because we 'll be dead by then but looking back to the past the key to the importance of growth is that for the last years the us has on average had maybe 2 3 real growth per year i 'm pulling these numbers out of my head i think much better numbers are in that paper somewhere on average over that period of time this growth has meant that the quality of life that one has if one lives in a country experiencing this growth is enormous compared to countries that do not experience this average growth over that period   statistically speaking growth is also somewhat auto correlated roughly speaking if it was low the last few periods you can expect it to be low the next period same thing if it 's high    then the reason we care about growth right now if you have too many periods of low growth pretty soon the average over the long term growth will be pulled down and then quality of life ca n't be higher in the future which quickly becomes someone 's present the paper above makes this point with a very simple model of course none of this touches on issues which are another issue entirely with respect to the economy needs to grow to just keep up with its debt repayments i think the answer is along the lines of sometimes countries get into debt expecting that growth will increase their resources in the future and thus they can pay back their debt that strategy is of course the strategy that anyone borrowing taking out a loan should be employing you should expect that your future income will be enough to pay back your on a loan you took otherwise you 're irresponsible at the aggregate level production is the nation 's income it is what you have all that you have as a nation to pay back any debt you 've incurred at the national level

i think i have a better answer for this since i have been an investor in the stock markets since a decade and most of my money is either made through investing or trading the financial markets yes you can start investing with as low as 50 gbp or even less if you are talking about stocks there is no restriction on the amount of shares you can purchase the price of which can be as low as a penny i investing in stocks when i was 18 with the money saved from my pocket money which was not much but i made investments on a regular period no matter how less i could but i would make regular investments on a long term remember one thing never trade stock markets always invest in it on a long term the stock markets will give you the best return on a long term as shown on the graph below and will also save you money on commission the broker charge on every transaction the brokers to make money for themselves will ask you to trade stocks on short term but stock market were always made to invest on a long term as warren buffet rightly says and if you want to trade try commodities or forex forex brokers will offer you accounts with as low as 25 usd with no commissions the commission here are all inclusive in spreads   is this true can the average joe become involved yes anyone who wants has an interest in the financial markets can get involved knowledge is the key not money is it worth investing £ 50 here and there or is that a laughable idea 50 gbp is a lot i started with a few indian rupees if people laugh let them laugh only morons who do n't understand the true concept of financial markets laugh there are fees rules involved is it worth the effort if you just want to see the problem with today 's generation of people is that they fear a lot unless you crawl you do nt walk unless you try something you do nt learn the only difference between a successful person and a not successful person is his ability to try fail fall get back on feet again try he succeeds i know its not instant money but i 'd like to get a few shares here and there to follow the news and see how companies do i hear that bric russia india and china is a good share to invest in brazil india the good thing is share prices are relatively low even the commissions mostly roi return on investment on a long term would almost be the same can anyone share their experiences maybe best for community wiki always up for sharing please ask questions no matter how stupid they are i love people who ask for when i started i asked and people were generous enough to answer and so would i be

disallowed losses due to the wash sale rule are added to the basis of the repurchased shares   in your example on day two you paid $ per share then the disallowed $ 0.30 loss from the previous day gets added to the basis making your total basis $ 1.00 per share when you sell at the end of the day for $ 1.00 per share your net gain loss is zero furthermore you can recapture disallowed losses by selling the last lot of abc completely yourself of all holdings in abc for at least 31 days even if that last lot was a loss when taking into account the increased basis from previously disallowed wash sale losses you can claim the loss fully on this last non wash sale

here 's an alternative there are hundreds maybe thousands of contract engineering firms job shops in the united states probably hundreds in california alone   they are in the business of doing what your employer wants you to do they know how to do it they have been doing it for decades working with the biggest most established companies in the country   they have forgotten more about providing engineering services to clients and paying the engineers than you can learn in a lifetime call a few of them   set up meetings   budget a few hours for it   you want to talk with the most experienced recruiter in the office the old guy who has been there and done that   explain your situation and tell them that rather than go through all of the headaches yourself you want to investigate the possibility of them handling all the headaches for their usual markup of course   you can probably word this better than i can but you get the idea the shop may or may not be willing to talk about their markup   my personal opinion is that this is perfectly ok   what they make off of you after your rate is paid is their business also talk about what you do and your recommended rate   it would not surprise me to learn that you are currently grossly underpaid and mention that if the client declines you 're going to be available immediately and you 'd certainly be open to working with them   you will see this again   in fact if they have any current leads that you fit you would certainly be interested in hearing about them   they may already have a from another client for which you fit for which the client is willing to pay much more than your current employer if it were me personally i 'd start with and maybe tad technical   these are three of the oldest and best i 'd also hit up ce weekly get a subscription and find some other shops with offices in your area once you have a shop lined up then ask your employer if rather than you setting up a personal corporation they 'd be willing to work with an established contract engineering firm   who does this kind of thing for a living who does this every day who has been doing this for decades   doing this is simpler for everyone and by going through an established firm they avoid having to teach you how to do business with them   they also avoid the risk of having you reclassified by irs as an employee which exposes them to all kinds of legal and financial liability if they say no walk away from them   immediately   they 've just thrown up a huge red flag   this is where the other discussions with the shop come into play

based on your situation i 'm not sure it should be an either or sort of choice   the less debt you have the better but because the heloc is secured debt the interest rate should be rather low   if you 're trying to build a cash cushion for emergencies it may help to figure out a few things first once you know how much you want to save and how long it will take you can figure out how much longer it would take of some of the savings were diverted to debt reduction if your credit is good enough to get a heloc in the first place putting some of your cash flow toward both goals is an option worth considering

i think it depends a lot on your idea of how you should relate to your neighbors personally i think that i should be allowed to do just about whatever i want with my property and i grant my neighbor the same right if my neighbor wants to paint his house purple with orange stripes and fill his front lawn with pink i think that 's his right if i do n't like it i do n't have to look at his house i would draw the line at things that i can not avoid by simply looking the other way like running jet engines in his back yard at 2 in the morning as i could not avoid the noise or dumping toxic waste on the street as it will cause health problems etc others think it is their business what their neighbor does with his property and want to be able to control it they want someone who has the authority to force everyone in the neighborhood to paint their house in colors deemed acceptable to meet certain requirements for yard work and that 's what home owners associations are for to require that everyone in the neighborhood maintain their property according to a standard set by the hoa which should theoretically represent the wishes of the majority of course the price you pay for giving you the right to tell your neighbor what kind of fence he is allowed to have is that now your neighbors can tell you what kind of fence you can have advocates of often say that they are necessary to protect property values personally i think this is something of a circular argument i must have the right to prevent my neighbor from doing something that in my opinion makes his house ugly not because i necessarily have no choice but to stare out my window at his house all day and be by it but because someday i may want to sell my house to someone who will have no choice but to stare out the window at his house all day and be by it and so will not want to buy my house of course if we all just minded our own business this would n't be an issue okay this was pretty much an anti hoa post but i did try to state the other side of it

comparing index funds to long term investments in individual companies a counterintuitive study by jeremy siegel addressed a similar question would you be better off sticking with the original 500 stocks in the s&p 500 or like an index fund changing your investments as the index is changed the study long term returns on the original s&p 500 companies siegel found that the original 500 including spinoffs mergers etc would do slightly better than a changing index this is likely because the original 500 companies take on a value rather than growth aspect as the decades pass and value stocks outperform growth stocks index funds main strength may be in the behavior change they induce in some investors to the extent that investors genuinely set and forget their index fund investments they far outperform the average investor who mis times the market the average investor enters and leaves the market at the worst times underperforming by a few percentage points each year on average this buying high and selling low timing behavior damages long term returns paying active management fees e.g. 1 per year makes returns worse returns compound on themselves a great benefit to the investor fees also compound to the benefit of someone other than the investor paying 1 annually to a financial advisor may further dent long term returns but robert shiller notes that advisors can dissuade investors from market timing for clients who will always follow advice the 1 advisory fee is worth it

no i get that   but if you do n’t want risk then buy bonds   long term an s&amp;p index has very low risk   on the other hand actively managed funds have fees that take out a ton of the gain that could be had   i do n’t have time to look for the study but i read recently that 97 of actively managed funds were outperformed by s&amp;p indexes after fees   now i do n’t know about you but i think the risk of not picking a top 3 fund is probably higher than the safe return of index ’s

off the top of my head i do n't know of any publicly traded companies that routinely earmark distributions as return of capital but theoretically it 's certainly applicable to any publicly traded company the wikipedia article gives one situation in which a publicly traded company may use return of capital public business may return capital as a means to increase the debt equity ratio and increase their leverage risk profile since return of capital is a distribution it shrinks the firm 's equity thus increasing its leverage investopedia also has an article dividend facts you may not know that gives an example of when return of capital might be used sometimes especially in the case of a special large dividend part of the dividend is actually declared by the company to be a return of capital in this case instead of being taxed at the time of distribution the return of capital is used to reduce the basis of the stock making for a larger capital gain down the road assuming the selling price is higher than the basis for instance if you buy shares with a basis of $ 10 each and you get a $ 1 special dividend 55 cents of which is return of capital the taxable dividend is 45 cents the new basis is $ and you will pay capital gains tax on that 55 cents when you sell your shares sometime in the future a company may choose to earmark some or all of its distribution as return of capital in order to provide shareholders with a more beneficial tax treatment the irs describes this different tax treatment distributions that qualify as a return of capital are not dividends a return of capital is a return of some or all of your investment in the stock of the company a return of capital reduces the basis of your stock these distributions do n't necessarily count as taxable income except in some instances once the basis of your stock has been reduced to zero any further non dividend distribution is capital gain the irs also states a distribution generally qualifies as a return of capital if the corporation making the distribution does not have any accumulated or current year earnings and profits in this case the firm is lowering its equity because it 's paying distributions out of that equity instead of accumulated earnings profits a company may use return of capital to maintain a distribution even in times of financial difficulty   in the context of closed end funds however return of capital can be much more complicated and can affect the fund 's performance and reputation in numerous ways also jb king is correct in you that return of capital is not the same thing as return on the latter is a method for valuing a company and determining how efficient a company is where it comes to using its resources to quote jb king 's comment again

i would say it 's a bit more complicated than that do you understand what a market maker does   an ecn electronic communication network is a virtual exchange that works with market makers using a rebate structure that works by paying for orders adding liquidity and charges a fee for removing liquidity so liquidity is created by encouraging what are essentially limit orders orders that are outside of the current market price and therefore not immediately these orders stay in the book and are filled when the price of the security moves and triggers them   so direct answer is nyse arca is where market makers do their jobs these market makers can be floor traders or algorithmic when you send an order through your brokerage your broker has a number of options your order can be sent directly to an ecn exchange like nyse arca sent to a market making firm like americas formerly knight capital or is when the broker uses an in house service to execute your trade brokerages must disclose what they do with orders for example etrade 's this is a good graphic showing what happens in general along with the names of some common liquidity providers

another way to look at it is that deductibles are intended as incentives or subsidies to particular industries in this case the healthcare industry guaranteeing a decent standard of living and making sure everybody can meet the costs of necessities can be achieved much more easily by a low tax rate on the first of income and/or generic welfare benefits rather than any measure focused on making healthcare food or whatnot cheaper or free under certain conditions incidentally many countries do have different forms of benefits or tax breaks for accommodation related expenses

dollar cost averaging will allow you to reduce your risk while the stock prices falls provided you must invest a fixed amount $ x on a fixed time scale i.e. every y days by doing this you will be able to take advantage of the lowering price by obtaining more shares per period as the price falls but at the same time if it starts to rise you will already have your pig in the race   example suppose you wanted to invest $ 300 in a company we will do so over 3 periods as the price falls your average dollar cost will as well but since you do n't know where the bottom is you can not wait until the bottom by trying to guess the bottom and dumping all of your investment at once you expose yourself to a higher level of risk

yield on a treasury bond increases this primarily happens when the government increases interest rates or there is too much money floating around and the government wants to suck out money from the economy this is the first step not the other way around the most recent case was fed buying up bonds and hence releasing money in to the economy so companies and people start investing to push the economy on the growth path   banks normally base their interest rates on the treasury bonds which they use as a reference rate because of the probability of 0 default as mortgage is a long term investment so they follow the long duration bonds issued by the fed they than put a premium on the money lent out for taking that extra risk so when the governments are trying to suck out money there is a dearth of free flowing money and hence you pay more premium to borrow because supply is less demand is more demand will eventually decrease but not in the short run why do banks increase the rates they loan money at when people sell bonds not people per se but primarily the central bank in a country i.e. fed in us

i think you 're a little confused about taxes first i 'm guessing that you feel your lack of home ownership makes your taxes higher   that might be true or it might not   the main tax break you would get from home ownership is the mortgage interest deduction and that is a fraction of what you 're paying in interest   so yeah your tax bill is lower but 3 4 times that amount is going out the door in interest   plus when you buy a property you may have substantial taxes on that property that your landlord is paying now secondly yes you can deduct expenses on a business but that only can be done without income for so long before the irs begins your deductions   but if you 're making money the expenses come right off of your income third owning a business means that you get the privilege of paying a self employment tax which is the same thing that your employer now pays into social security on your behalf   more taxes so in short owning and operating a business has the potential to be more rewarding than holding down a job and i recommend starting up a side business just to get another income stream going but the tax savings really are n't that appealing to do it just for those

if i open and fill an isa then leave the account alone for an entire year will i then be able to add an additional £ insert isa limit here to the original money i put in the account   yes you can will the full sum of £ last years limit + £ this years limit that is in the account have interest paid on it yes it will will the account be closed at the end of the period regardless no the account would only be closed if you requested it to be closed otherwise it would sit there with the original balance in it earning interest at the stated rate the only way i can see an isa being of any worth is by building up a substantial amount this way but you would need so much cash laying around to max the isa year on year just think of an isa as like a completely normal savings account except that you do n't pay tax on the interest and there is a limit to how much you can deposit in any given year   right now while interest rates have been low for a while the savings rates on any account including isas are not desperately attractive additionally with the recent changes to how interest on normal savings accounts are taxed isas are not quite such a big deal as they used to be   if you look back to a time when interest rates were around 5 a higher rate tax payer with £ 50,000 in a normal savings account would earn £ 2500 interest in a year on which they would pay £ 1000 in tax that made an isa a very attractive option indeed

you want a fee only advisor   he charges like an architect or plumber by the hour or some other flat fee that is his only compensation he is not paid on commission at all   he is not affiliated with any financial services company of any kind    his office is starbucks   he does not have a well lit office like the commission broker down the street   he does not want you to hand him your money it stays in the brokerage account of your choice within reason some brokerage accounts are terrible and he 'll tell you to get out of those   he never asks for the password to your brokerage account   edit the uk recently outlawed commission brokers   these guys were competitive sales types who thrive on commissions and probably went into other sales jobs   so right now everyone is clamoring for the few proper financial advisors available   high demand is making them expensive   it may not be cost effective to hire an advisor you may need to learn it yourself   it 's not that hard   ever hear of a plumber who works totally for free and makes his money selling you wildly overpriced pipe   that 's what regular financial advisors are    they sell products that are deliberately made unnecessarily complex the purpose is first to conceal sales commissions and high internal fees and second to confuse you so the financial world feels so daunting that you feel like you need their help just to navigate it    they 're trying to fry your brain so just give up and trust them    products like whole life and variable annuities are only the poster children for how awful all of their financial products are   these products exist to fleece the consumer without quite breaking the law   of course everyone goes to see them because they have well lit offices in every town and they 're free and easy to deal with do n't feel like you need to know everything about finance to invest   you do n't need to understand every complex financial product that the brokerage houses dreamed up they are designed to conceal and confuse as i discuss above and you do n't want them   the core of it is fairly simple and that 's all you really need to know    look at any smaller university and how they manage their endowments if whole life annuities and those complex financial products actually worked university endowments would be full of them    but they 're not   endowments are generally made of investments you can understand   partly because university boards are made of investment bankers who invented those products and know what a ripoff they are    some people refuse to learn anything   they are done with college and refuse to learn anything more    i hope that 's not you    because you should learn the workings of everything you 're investing in     if you do n't understand it do n't buy   and a fee only financial advisor wo n't ask you to   1000 well well advised university endowments seek the most successful products on the market and end up choosing products you can understand   that 's good news for you

i tried automation and it did n't work as well automation is great if you want to sell or buy when a stock drops or rises however automation is terrible for day trading specifically because it is impossible to automate a program to scan every news feed even then automation is only if you want to be the effect of a rise or drop in the market a stock rises or drops and you sell or buy the problem that arises is that it is nearly impossible to make money off of automating trades you need to buy the stock before it rises and sell it before it drops there is no way any program will ever be able to do that accurately

of course they make money they double dip in a lot of instances they make 2 3 plus $ 0.30 per transaction from the merchant and then whatever interest you pay on your card so let 's just say in one day you make stops at starbucks for a $ 4 latte then at wendy 's for lunch for about $ 8 then you put about $ 20 worth of gas in your tank then you stop at kroger for some $ 40 groceries and may you pick up some dinner for about $ 15   that 's 5 transactions at $ 0.30 which is a $ 1.50 then at 3   starbucks is $ 0.12 wendy 's $ gas is $ then kroger $ 1.20 then dinner $ 0.45 so the total that they get is $ multiply this by about   a million people per day that is about $ 4.1 million per day that they get that is a nice penny just from the merchant so you are making them a lot of money by just using it

systemic and well know patterns in sales are priced in to the security   typically companies with very cyclical earnings like this will issue guidance of earnings per share within a range   these expected earnings are priced in before the earnings are actually booked   if a company meets these expectations the stock will likely stay relatively flat   if the company misses this expectation the stock generally will get slammed    this kind of wall street behavior typically media outlets when a company 's stock declines after reporting a record high level of whatever metric   the record high is irrelevant if it misses the expectation there is no crystal ball but if something is both well known and expected it 's already been priced in   if the well known expected event does n't occur maybe it 's a new normal

total capital this is a very old fashioned term that really is mostly only used in the finance industry today like when everyone was obsessed with bank capital total capital = preferred equity + common equity + liabilities true blue preferred shares are almost only used by financial companies banks specifically   the more modern ones that convert to common are used by all other companies notes payable this is another old fashioned term that now carries a different meaning in generally accepted account principles gaap the oldest definition of a note or a promissory note is a promise to pay a fixed amount of money on a specific date    this has been modified to resemble more a bond and evolved into the zero coupon bond a bond that makes no cash interest payments but makes one final payment that includes principal interest    a bank note like a one dollar bill is a note that pays something in this case one dollar never technically the repayment date is simply not specified in the contract   while it pays one dollar it never pays it back so it has a constant value of one dollar   the constant nature inflation notwithstanding is what makes bank notes the preferred medium of exchange gaap has taken its own definition to mean any debt payable within 12 months as it is a current < 12 months liability

already hit on some of this   it 's hard to explain this to a five year old because there are some fairly abstract concepts involved but here goes    all actual money is debt all of it including monetary gold etc do n't argue with me yet i 'll get to that   imagine a pretend world with no money some kind of primitive or something now let 's invent paper money you ca n't just print a bunch of paper that says people have to give you stuff because nobody would honor it but you could print ious let 's walk through this   let 's say you 're an apple farmer and i 'm a hunter you want some meat but have n't harvested your crops yet you say to me hey go hunt me some meat and i 'll give you 1/10th of my apple harvest in the fall fair enough i give you meat you owe me apples there 's probably a lot of this kind of stuff going on in addition to normal barter in time standard prices start to emerge a deer is worth a bushel of apples or whatever    now let 's say a week later i realize that my kid needs a new pair of shoes more than i need a bushel of apples i come back to you and say   hey remember that bushel of apples you owe me could you write a marker redeemable for one bushel of apples that i can give to the shoemaker in trade for a pair of shoes you say okay and we have invented a transferable note something a lot like money    in time our little starts to figure out that a note redeemable for a bushel of apples can be swapped for all kinds of things the fisherman who does n't even like apples will accept apple certificates in trade for fish because he knows he can trade them to boat builder who loves apples in time you can even start to hire farm workers without giving them anything except a note promising a cut of the future harvest    now you are issuing debt a promise to provide apples the money is a transferable your workers get a promise to provide value equal to a day of farm work or whatever and it 's transferrable so they can use it to buy whatever they want the worker gets fish from the fisherman not in exchange for doing any work or giving him anything he can use but in exchange for an iou that the fisherman can redeem anywhere    so far so good but there are a couple of in the road here on the way to a realistic monetary system that we 'll address separately   what happens if your apple orchard is destroyed in a wildfire suddenly all the notes that everyone has been trading are basically wiped out it did n't go anywhere it 's just gone it does n't exist real value was genuinely destroyed there is no law of the conservation of monetary just as you and i created it by creating transferable debt it can also be genuinely destroyed we 'll get back to this in a minute it gets interesting    the second issue is that in all probability the whole town is not just trading apple certificates i could also issue promises to catch deer the fisherman could issue promises of fish and so on this could get pretty messy especially if you got the notion to issue more apple certificates than you can grow you could buy all kinds of stuff with self issued debt that you could never repay and the town would n't find out until harvest time comes once again value has been destroyed people worked and made stuff and gave you stuff in exchange for something that does n't exist and will never exist all that stuff they made is gone you consumed it and there is nothing to show for it   the above two concerns are likely to become manifest in our village sooner or later and probably sooner   this leads to the question of credit which is at its most basic a measure of every time you issue an apple certificate you are borrowing with a promise to repay from future apple    after the first couple of town scandals people will start taking a closer look at the credibility of the issuer let 's say the town potato farmer comes up with a scheme where his potato certificates are actually issued by some credible third party say the town priest or whatever who starts every growing season with a book of numbered certificates equal to the typical crop yield and no more and keeps half of the certificate on file issuing the other half now there is an audit trail and a very credible system that is likely to earn the potato grower a lot of credit compared to other farmers in town that means that the potato grower can probably issue more notes at a better exchange rate than some system similarly the town drunk probably wo n't get much value for his certificates promising a ship of gold    now we have something like a credit market emerging and the potato farmer is issuing something closer to what we might call a modern bond   continued in a reply to this post

there are some loan types where your minimum payment may be less than the interest due in the current period this is not true of credit cards in the us   separately if you have a minimum payment amount due of less than the interest due in the period the net interest amount would just become principal anyway so differentiating it is n't meaningful with credit cards in the us the general minimum calculation is 1 of the principal outstanding plus all interest accrued in the period plus any fees   any overpayment is applied to the principal outstanding because this is a revolving line of credit and unpaid interest or fees appear as a charge just like your coffee and also begin to accrue interest   the issue arises if you have multiple interest rates   maybe you did a balance transfer at a discounted interest rate does that balance get credited before the balance carried at the standard rate   you 'll have to call your lender   while there is a regulation in place requiring payment to credit the highest rate balance first the banks still have latitude on how the payment is literally applied explained below    when there is an amortization schedule the issue is not principal or interest the issue is principle or the next payment on the amortization schedule   if the monthly payment on your car loan is $ 200 but you send $ 250 the bank will use the additional $ 50 to credit the next payment due   when you get your statement next month it 's usually monthly it will indicate an amount due of $ 150   when you 've prepaid more than an entire payment the next payment is just farther in to the future   you need to talk to your lender about principal payments because the process will vary by lender and by specific loan call your lender   you are a customer you have a contract they will explain this stuff to you   there is no harm that can possibly come from learning the nuances of your agreement with them regarding the nuance to the payment regulation a federal credit card reform law enacted in may 2009 requires that credit card companies must apply your entire payment minus the required minimum payment amount to the highest interest rate balance on your card   some credit card issuers are aggressive here and apply the non interest portion of the minimum payment to the lowest interest rate first   you 'll need to call your bank and ask them

i think many of you are making unrelated comments and taking unjustified conclusions from the news without reading the research many of the mentioned share provisions are not exclusive to silicon valley technology firms or the rest of private equity i.e. ex vc   the paper says   gt;these generous terms are not necessarily evidence of active post money valuation manipulation and could simply be due to a difficult fund raising environment   and   our discussion does not imply that these terms were given for the purpose of manipulating spacex ’s value   that is not to say that i am not skeptical of many of the business models and valuations of the companies in the sample but that is off the research topic    what the authors suggests is that valuation is often by many people in the industry and provides some relevant cases from mutual funds who market those shares at the value of the most recent funding round regardless of share provisions to employees that wrongly perceive their wealth   i have some trouble accepting brownian motion to model exit prices or pretty much anything else it seems a bit off from reality but nevertheless i think the paper is worth the read

one of the things i have enjoyed about consulting is the exposure to multiple companies and multiple business units within those companies in the year i have been at the group i have already worked with multiple clients on projects that span across the respective organizations it has been very interesting to contrast the clients and more specifically the corporate cultures that exist within those companies   i have participated in and watched various projects being driven in different parts of a client 's business and it is interesting to see which projects have been are and will be successful the other day i was reading a report of some analysis done by one of the world 's largest and most respected consulting firms the analysis was essentially outlining a path for success for a broad spectrum of projects of varied and complexities the analysis which was very good by the way touched on a lot of elements of the business that would impact the likelihood of project success elements like governance data analysis process design etc the analysis and the accompanying recommendations were undoubtedly sound given the caliber of the firm the background research done to support the report and my own confirmation based on what i have picked up about the client i try and get my hands on these types of reports whenever possible to see how the big boys are doing it to shape my own thinking and to have examples of successful presentations i am however always surprised that these reports fail to mention what i consider to be a very big influence on the success of a project and ultimately the success of the organization as a whole   at their core companies are merely people a group of people with a collective identity a corporate culture if you will reflecting back on my many interactions with the people that make up these organizations it has become very evident to me that a collaborative corporate culture is a huge in determining the success of any project although it is a macro factor the collaborative spirit of an organization everything that the company does and/or attempts to do   here is an example to give context of the premise i am talking about   at client a the project team i worked with was designing an extremely innovative complex and challenging system that has the potential to alter the way they do business without going into too much detail it was a massive undertaking with relatively limited   at client b the scope of work i was involved in was relatively straightforward and mirrored business practices at other organizations the bulk of the effort on my part was driving the creation and adoption of a framework to promote cross functional interaction amongst project teams a very realistic undertaking with appropriate   below are that illustrate typical exchanges in both organizations in both organizations i have been directed to connect with a particular individual or group of individuals as it was thought that our respective works may be related in some fashion   client a me let me give you a brief overview of the project i am working on john doe recommended i connect with you as your project may with mine in some manner we may be able to help each other continue with my overview   other party wow this is great i actually have really in depth knowledge of x and would love to get involved in the work you are doing i am actually simultaneously driving y effort and it would be great if we were aligned at a high level we are both supporting strategy a so connecting now would really set us up for success feel free to include me on your future meetings and i will pass along our high level overview also have you thought about connecting with so and so they are working in the z space on a project and it may help to drive your project forward as well   client b me let me give you a brief overview of the project i am working on john doe recommended i connect with you as your project may    other party well we have already gotten our project approved at such and such level and we have found that we really do n't have any with your project   me oh ok well i am not really looking to create additional work for anyone i am just looking to leverage the work we are both already doing we may be able to help each other    other party again our project team is really busy and we are on a tight deadline we do n't have the resources we need i have told john doe time and again we need more help but until we get it i just really need to focus on x.   me ok well how about i jump in to what it is we are actually doing and if there are n't any opportunities for collaboration or any synergies to be gained from working together that is fine i just wanted to be proactive about connecting the dots across the organization continue with my overview   other party meeting concludes   these are n't of a single event they are of month 's of interactions that give a good representation of single events in a variety of contexts on a daily basis of course there are exceptions however i have found that exceptions within both cultures are extremely rare based on my personal experience this only my point can you begin to see why a collaborative corporate culture is so foundational to the success of any endeavor regardless of scope complexity etc   the other aspect that adds to the importance of a sound corporate culture is the self fulfilling nature of culture which organization do you think future collaborative behavior even those people that want to collaborate within client b are consistently met with resistance those in client a are inspired by the positive interactions enhanced results and they are more likely to actively seek out others to help and work with both are accelerated in opposite directions just by the nature of the prevailing culture   so how do you create and a culture that collaboration that my friends is a question i do n't pretend to have all the answers too maybe i 'll be so lucky to figure that one out someday

energy transfer partners lp stock symbol is the parent company of dakota access llc the developer of the dakota access pipeline   since is a publicly traded company it is certainly possible to purchase the stock to answer your questions would it not be possible to buy their stocks bring down the price of the stocks and keep it there until investors pull out because it is financially unwise to these investors you can not artificially bring the price of a stock down by buying the stock   purchasing large enough amounts would theoretically cause the price to go up not down you could theoretically cause the stock to go down by shorting the stock borrowing shares and then selling them but it would take a lot of shares to do this and may not be successful   if not successful your losses are potentially unlimited would it alternatively be possible to buy enough stock to have a voice in the operations of the company yes you could theoretically purchase enough of the stock to control the company   the market capitalization of is currently $ billion if you owned half of the stock you would have complete control of the company   but buying that much stock would certainly influence the price of the stock so it would cost you more than half of that amount to buy that much stock you could get yourself a voice at the table for less without owning a full half of the stock but you would not have full control and would need support from others to get the outcome you want alternatively someone determined to exert their influence could theoretically make an offer to purchase the dakota access subsidiary from which might be less costly than purchasing half of the entire corporation even if an extremely wealthy person were to try one of these options and destroy this company it would n't necessarily stop another company from building something similar   the investors you purchased the company from would have billions of dollars to do so with

gt taxation has caused unproductive investing practices   it certainly can it 's well established that capital gains taxes do cause investors to leave capital in mediocre or even fairly bad investments as suffering say a potential 20 loss for business reasons can be preferable to creating a guaranteed irreversible 37 loss due to state and federal ltcg taxes

as far as i know there is no direct equivalent an ira is subject to many rules   not only are there early withdrawal penalties but the ability to deduct contributions to an ira phases out with one 's income level   qualified withdrawals from an ira wo n't have penalties but they will be taxed as income   contributions to a roth ira can be made post tax and the resulting gains will be tax free but they can not be withdrawn early another tax deductable investment is a 529 plan   these can be withdrawn from at any time but there is a penalty if the money is not used for educational purposes a 401 k or similar employer sponsored fund is made with pre tax dollars unless it is designated as a roth 401k.   these plans also require money to be withdrawn specifically for retirement with a 10 penalty for early withdrawal   qualifying withdrawals from a regular retirement plan are taxed as income those from a roth plan are not as with an ira money can be made harder to get at by investing in all of the types of funds you can invest in using an ira through the same brokers under a different type of account but the contribution will be made with post tax non deductable dollars and the gains will be taxed

a big issue for historical data in banking is that they don't can't reside within a single system archives of typical bank will include of different archives made by different companies on different incompatible systems for example see as an illustration of bank mergers and acquisitions and afaik that does n't include many smaller deals for any given account it 's 10-year history might be on some different system often when integrating such systems a compromise is made if bank a acquires bank b that has earlier acquired bank c then if the acquisition of c was a few years ago then you can skip integrating the archives of c in your online systems keep them separate and use them only when if needed and minimize that need by hefty fees   since the price list and services are supposed to be equal for everyone then no matter how your accounts originated if 10 of archives are an expensive enough problem to integrate then it makes financial sense to restrict access to 100 of archives older than some arbitrary threshold

i 'm interested in the answer to this question too i got a job as an accounts receivable analyst about 4 months ago it mostly involves running sql queries on the companies database and determining whether things like the timing and movement of products cash are appropriate    about 95 of my day is spent in excel either analyzing data trends correcting accounts where product or cash is out of alignment and writing my boss the c level conclusions based on the state of all things ar   the other 5 of my day is staring at a blank piece of paper as i try to wrap my head around what i should be asking our database and how to organize the results to find out what i need to be finding out i would honestly say 30 of the work is mindlessly easy for me now that i know what i 'm doing 50 of the work is smash my face against the wall confusing and 20 is i am solving problems by learning new things hooray   i was not particularly interested in finance in fact my skill set was computers then i found languages and went on a decade long tangent learning that turns out languages do n't pay the bills very well and i need a career i can get my company to pay for some education but i do n't know if finance is what i really want to do   having read the rest of the comments in the thread i will say i am not at all competitive with others though i hold myself to very high standards and if i feel others are too aggressive i will shut them out i sometimes hear higher ups in my company on the phone using their a type personalities and wrestling with 3rd party companies and picture myself hanging up on them if i were on the other end of the phone

you did n't put what country you 're in so i 'll work off the basis you 're in the united states i think you 're going to have a very hard time accomplishing what you 're talking about after such an extraordinary amount of time   one has to assume that there would still be records that could be retrieved in order for anyone to determine the amount you 'd have to pay and after 40 years the paper records would be long gone   it 's possible there might be somewhere but i would n't have a clue how easy or possible it would be for it to be retrieved    i assume you 're wanting to repay this as a way to boost social security or other government benefits in your retirement but it 's really hard to say whether repaying the money would make much if any difference    this is really something you 'll have to contact the irs about but unless they are trying to collect funds from you that they say you owe then it 's highly unlikely they have any record of what you 're asking about and they probably do n't even have a mechanism for accepting and crediting such monies   the real issue here is the amount of time that has passed because there would be little compelling reason for the government to keep detailed records they perhaps maintain summaries but little else for extended periods   we all have the impression the government knows all and never forgets but that simply is n't the case

usually sell every month arguably every day you own the house it is costing you money for mortgage and taxes and upkeep unless it is also producing income or you are actually living in it that is a serious problem in any sane market it is extremely unlikely that the house can gain enough value to offset that loss   renting it out even if you lose money versus the costs would at least slow the bleeding but unless you actually want to deal with rental or strongly expect to return very soon selling rapidly for a good price is usually optimal of course when setting the asking price and negotiating offers you are going to have to consider exactly this trade off

i 'd agree that this can seem a little unfair but it 's an unavoidable consequence of the necessary practicality of paying out dividends periodically rather than continuously and differential taxation of income and capital gains to see more clearly what 's going on here consider buying stock in a company with extremely simple economics it generates a certain constant earnings stream equivalent to $ 10 per share per annum and all of that profit as periodic dividends let 's say once annually assume there 's no intrinsic growth and that the firm 's value which we 'll say is $ 90 per share is completely neutral to any other market factors under these economics this stock price will show a evolution accruing from $ 90 to $ 100 over the course of a year and resetting back down to $ 90 after each dividend payment now if i am invested in this stock for some period of time the fair outcome would be that i receive an appropriately time weighted share of the $ 10 annual earnings per share less my tax if i am invested for an exact calendar year this works as i 'd expect the stock price on any given day in the year will be the same as it was exactly one year earlier so i 'll realise zero capital gain but i 'll have collected a $ 10 taxed dividend along the way on the other hand what if i am invested for exactly half a year spanning a dividend payment i receive a dividend payment of $ 10 less tax but i make a capital loss of overall pre tax i 'm up $ 5 per share as expected however the respective tax treatment of the dividend payment which is classed as income and the capital gains is likely to be different in particular to benefit from the negative taxation of the capital loss i need to have some positive capital gain elsewhere to offset it if i ca n't do that i 'm much worse off compared to half the full year return further even if i can offset against a gain elsewhere the effective taxation rates are likely to be different but note that this could work for or against me if my capital gains rate is greater than my income tax rate i 'd actually benefit and if i 'm invested for half a year but not spanning a dividend i make $ 5 of pure capital gains and realise a different effective taxation rate again in an ideal world i 'd agree that the effective taxation rate would n't depend on the exact timing of my transactions like this but in reality it 's unavoidable in the interests of practicality and so long as the rules are clear i would n't say it 's unfair per se it just adds a bit of complexity

no the more conservative approach is to use the market value of debt at least assuming its trading at a discount a company would n't necessarily have to come to an agreement with creditors they would just default on their obligations in which case the company may file for bankruptcy protection which allows for a variety of scenarios to play out both consensual and not    as for when debt trades at a premium we 're talking about two different factors that effect bond prices credit risk and interest rate risk but yes a company does have a higher financial obligation if interest rates decline they 're stuck paying 8 in an environment where they could refinance for 6 if they refinance then creditors more than likely are n't going to take less than par if they do n't refinance then they have the opportunity cost of essentially overpaying on their cost of debt

there is no strict need to do that you can consider yourself to be consulting a 10 of your payment will be withheld and paid as tax by the company you can deduct up to 60 of your income as expenses and pay tax on the rest factoring the tax deducted at source in another approach you could register for service tax and charge service tax on your invoice and pay to the service tax department the tax calculations are similar to above it will be good if you speak to a chartered accountant and get more clarity as for business card you could print it with your name and qualification there are no restrictions on that

is it worth it that is for you to judge the risks are having it in your face and you having to pay a penalty or go to jail the issue is how you keep it secret and who you keep it secret from if you have money in a secret account and keep it hidden even though you you are taking a big risk if the knowledge of the contents of the secret stash would cause a judge or government agency to make a different decision you could face penalties ranging from monetary to jail time the government could also decide that they need to determine the source of the funds they may want to know if the money was earned through illegal means they will want to determine if the funds should haven taxed not just on the interest but if the original income tax was ever collected   if the amounts are large enough the taxing authority   and police will have a lot of fun pulling apart your entire financial history oh and the lawyers you pay to keep you out of jail will also have their fun why do some people do it they are greedy or paranoid or they do n't trust others or they are criminals

you sound like you 're well educated well spoken and so i 'm going to assume that you are somewhere in the neighborhood of top 5 material that means you can pretty much do anything you want to if you put enough effort into it there are two types of people in this world those who run the world and those who live comfortably in it and of course everyone else but they are irrelevant to the discussion who do you want to be i 've been around a lot of wildly successful people and they have two consistent traits   connections and freedom first everyone always told me that it 's not what you know it 's who you know but i never appreciated it until after college the world runs on connections   the more connections you have and the more successful they are the more successful you will be second the more freedom you have the more opportunity you will have to take chances which is how you become wildly successful freedom comes from not being in debt first and having money second why do you think harvard grads are the guys that end up having so much money and power it 's probably because they grew up in a rich family which provided them money freedom and a wide social circle of rich people connections so you 're not rich   what to do well the easiest way to get into that group is to go to college with them and that means you need to get into harvard or another ivy league stanford if you want to be an engineer college will be where you will make your most intense and long lasting friendships   that roommate at harvard that you went on the crazy four day road trip with may someday be ceo of a company and when he needs a cio you can be damn sure you 'll be at the top of the list if you 're qualified but harvard costs a lot of money which means you 'll be in debt a lot when you get out of college you 'll have lots of rich important but you 'll be deeply in debt no freedom most of these type of people end up becoming consultants at big firms because they pay well    you 'll live a comfortable life and pay off your student loans in five or 10 years    then you 'll continue to live comfortably   but at that point you 'll be too old to take huge chances and too comfortable to change things or perhaps you 'll have a big mortgage =   no freedom with a heavy debt load it 's almost impossible to say join an early stage startup and really be able to take huge chances   you can do it maybe   or as an alternate option you can do what i did go to a cheap state school and graduate with no debt that puts you on the other side of the fence   freedom but no connections   then in order to be successful you have to figure out how to get connections goldman sachs wo n't hire you and everyone you meet is going to automatically assume you 're mediocre because of where you went to college at this point your only option is to take big chances move to new york or san francisco offer to work for free as an intern somewhere or something   it can be done and it 's really not too hard you just have to have lots of spending restraint because the little money you have has to go a long way so what are the other options well some people are recommending that you think about not going to college at all that will certainly save you money and give you a four year head start on whatever you decide to do freedom but you 'll forever be branded as that guy without a college degree   think my second option above but just two or three times worse    you wo n't even get that free internship and you 'll be that weird guy at dinner parties who answer the first question so where did you go to college   it does n't matter if you 're self taught   life is n't a meritocracy   if you 're very good you 'll end up getting a nice cushy job pushing ones and zeros a nice cushy golden job well you could go to community college they 're certainly cheap you can spend very little money so you 'll end up with fairly good freedom    i might add though that community colleges teach trades and not high level things like management and complex architecture    you 'll be behind technically but not as bad as if you did n't go at all how about connections your fellow students will probably lack ambition money and connections they 'll be candidates for entry level wage slave jobs at fortune 500 companies after they graduate if they get lucky they 'll work up to middle management there 's no alumni association and there 's certainly no club in downtown boston at new york and silicon valley dinner parties having a community college degree is almost as bad as having nothing at all   indeed the entire value of the community college degree will be what you learn and you 'll be learning at the speed and level of your classmates my advice if you get into an ivy league school go and hope you get some grants to help you out the debt will suck but you 'll be well positioned for the future otherwise go to a cheap second tier school where you can get a large scholarship there are also lots of third party scholarships that are out there on the internet you can get i got a couple from local organizations do n't work during college focus on expanding your network instead the future value of a minimum wage job while you 're trying to go through school is practically zero

the simple answer is that you are correct you should not purchase a house until you are financially stable enough to do so a house is an asset that you must maintain and it can be expensive to do so   over the long term you will generally save money by purchasing however in any given year you may spend much more money than a similar rental situation even if the rent is higher than your mortgage payment if you are financially stable with good cash savings or investments plus a 20 down payment then anytime is a good time to buy if that is part of your financial plan as of now in 2016 is is safe to assume that mortgage rates    would should not get back to 10    does this mean that one should always buy a house only when mortgage    rates are low is it worth the wait if the rates are high right now the mortgage rates are not the primary driver for your purchase decision that might be like saying you should buy everything on sale at target because it 's on sale do n't speculate on future rates also keep in mind that back when rates were high banks were also giving much better savings cd rates that is all connected   is refinancing an option on the table if i made a deal at a bad time    when rates are high you need to make sure you get a loan that allows it always do a break even analysis looking at the money up front you spend to refi vs the savings per year you will get this should give you how many years until the refi pays for itself if you do n't plan on being in the house that long do n't do it how can people afford 10 mortgage buying a house they can afford taking into consideration the entire it should be a reasonable amount of your monthly income generally 25 or less note that this is much less than you will be approved for by most lenders   do n't let good rates suck you into a deal you will regret make sure you have the margin to purchase and maintain a home consider where you want to be living in 5 years do n't leave so little financial breathing room that any bump will place you at risk of foreclosure   that said home ownership is great i highly recommend it

many businesses will request that you get a bank issued check for large amounts of money the exception is often in cases where you 're not going anywhere you can write a 50,000 check for a deposit on a new house and you 'll never have a problem but a car dealer will probably request a counter check for the same sum

they changed the way trailing interest is calculated back in 2008 if i recall correctly the idea at the time was that the interest charges to the customer were somewhat less but it made trying to get a payoff quote a they used to take payments for more than the current balance due at that time however i ca n't provide any insight as to why they wo n't now though
