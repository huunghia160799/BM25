the best description of p2p lending process i saw comes from the sec proceedings they are very careful about naming things that are happening in the process prosper got back to business after this order but the paper describes succinctly how prosper worked when its notes have n't yet been registered by the sec these materials contain a lot of responsible comments on how crowdfunding including p2p lending works

having been recently evicted she is unlikely to find any one willing to rent to her at anything close to reasonable terms   any landlord that would consider it is likely to require a huge deposit her best solution may be a hotel motel with weekly monthly rates   it is generally much easier to get someone out of a hotel motel for non payment than it is an actual apartment with a lease and landlord tenant laws   but when you pay they take care of all utilities and you can receive mail and register them as your permanent address for finding employment any other place that is willing to take someone who they know is a high risk for nonpayment eviction is probably not going to be the type of place you want your children

shop lots of houses   find at least three you want and start by offering a low price and working your way up   your risk is that houses you would have liked get bought by someone else while you are negotiating that is how you discover how much you actually have to pay to get a house    brokers only get paid if a deal closes   that is their incentive to get you a better price   if they know you will buy a different house unless the one they are selling gets your business then they will work to make that happen

in general you most definitely can in some cases you must however for each state you 'll have to check whether you can choose how to depreciate many states require you to take the same depreciation as on the federal schedule including sec 179 others wo n't allow sec 179 at all specifically to pa i have n't found any current guidance but the rules from 2012 put pa in the bucket that requires you to take the same sec 179 on the state return as appears on your federal return if you elect to expense section 179 property for fit purposes you are    required to expense the property for pit purposes however pa limit for sec 179 is $ 25 k so if your federal deduction is larger you can depreciate the rest check with a pa licensed cpa or ea for a more reliable opinion since i 'm not a tax adviser just googled it

gt no it 's really not i have no illusions that private school is any better than the public schools around here the problems with them differ but one is no better than the other our education system in florida is broken the voucher system they instituted created broken schools and soon to be bankrupt private schools every state that 's done so has or soon will have the same problems even states that are n't screwing their public schools with vouchers are screwing them with poor funding at every level   how do vouchers fuck over our education system does n't it allow parents to pick the best school for their kids despite their economic condition i may be mistaken on what vouchers are is n't it just the government paying for what ever school you decide to go to   gt;every state that 's done so has or soon will have the same problems   source please   broke and getting more broke every year eventually it might get fixed but i 'm not going to play maybe games with my kids i 'd rather move them to a country that is n't supporting the most expensive military on the planet   as long as you send your kids to a school where they do n't fear for their lives have teachers that at least do the bare minimum and you are involved in your kid 's school life then they will be fine it is n't a school that makes the kids successful it is the parents who are active in their kids lives if the school is also good then that is all the better    canada is n't a magical i get the feeling that you surround yourself in an echo chamber of other parents who are mad at the education system you guys build off each other to make america 's education system seem like hell on earth

i was able to attend an open discussion on illinois pensions a few years back   dick head of the illinois teacher 's retirement system spoke as did a public employee union leader governor 's budget director and who is a state   it was eye opening on many levels   some of the points that stick with me are       the state has never over 30 years followed standard practice and used an actuary to determine how much to put into the pension funds each year   the legislators just pulled numbers out of the air each year   as a result the pensions have never been properly funded    the benefits are rich but according to the people on this panel the main issue is this under funding      some years the state declared a pension holiday and put nothing into the pension funds at all   when this was brought up the largely union crowd started to turn on but she held up her hand said she had voted against that and then commented that the unions all signed off on the pension holidays   as one the crowd 's heads turned to the union rep on the board   he turned red and at the floor      2/3 of the teacher 's pension hole is for people already retired   changing benefits for current teachers will not help enough      i asked mr how much additional tax he would need to plug the hole in the system he manages   he answered double   i asked for how long   he said it does n't work like that   i 'd need double the current amount forever   i came away much better informed but deeply   like 69 of the people polled i want these teachers and public employee to get their money   i just do n't see how it can happen

my take on this is that this reduces your liquidity risk stocks bonds and many other investment vehicles on secondary markets you may think of are highly liquid but they still require that markets are open and then an additional 3 5 business days to settle the transaction and for funds to make their way to your bank account   if you require funds immediately because of an emergency this 3 5 business days which gets longer as week ends and holidays are in the way can cause a lot of discomfort which may be worth a small loss in potential roi   think of your car breaking down or a water pipe exploding in your home and having to wait for the stock sale to process before you can make the payment admittedly you have other options such as margin loans and credit cards that can help absorb the shock in such cases but they may not be sufficient or cause you to pay interest or fees if left unpaid

a large number of bond holders decide to sell their bonds   if they all decide to do this at the same time then there will be a large supply of bonds being sold in the market   this will drive down the price of the bonds which will increase yields why do bond yields move inversely to bond prices you purchase a $ 100 bond today that yields 5   you spent $ 100   the very next day the same bonds are being sold with a yield of 10   if you wanted to sell your bond to someone you would have to sell it so it competed with the new bonds being sold   you could not sell it for $ 100 which is what you paid for it   you would have to sell it for less than the $ 100 you paid for it in order for it to have the equivalent yield of the new bonds being sold with a 10 yield   this is why bond yields move inversely to bond prices why does rising yields increase the cost of borrowing if someone is trying to sell new bonds they will have to sell bonds that compete with the yields of the current bonds already in the market if yields are rising on the existing bonds then the issuer of the new bonds will have to pay higher interest rates to offer equivalent yields on the new bonds the issuer is now paying more in interest making it more expensive to borrow money what are the incentives for the bond to sell his her bonds one reason a bond holder will sell his her bonds is they believe inflation will outpace the yield on the bond they are holding   if a bond yields 3 and inflation is at 5 then the bond holder is essentially losing purchasing power if they continue to hold onto the bond   another reason to sell would be if the bond holder has doubts in the ability of the issuer to repay the interest and/or principal of the bond

would be interesting to compare with how it used to work in the pre internet days   newspapers you paid for the physical object the printing the delivery if you did n't pay then you did n't get the object you did n't get the content   radio television free broadcasts paid for by advertising no paywall   cable satellite pay for installation and subscription which delivers content if you did n't pay no content   the internet basically delivers content for free so i 'd think it 's very difficult to implement a paywall since you 'll be undercut by others who are willing to deliver content for free or something almost free about the only caveat would be that delivering the internet itself is n't free so if your content was attached to the isp it would be more similar to the newspaper cable model than the radio tv model

the thing about the glide path is that the closer you 're to the retirement age the less risk you should be taking with your investments all investments carry risk but if you invest in a volatile stock market at the age of 20 and lose all your retirement money it will not have the same effect on your retirement as if you 'd invest in a volatile stock market at the age of 65 and then lose all your retirement money static allocation throughout your life without changing the risk factor will lead you to a very conservative investment path which would mean you 're not likely to lose your investments but you 're not likely to gain much either the point of the glide path is to allow you taking more risks early with more chances of higher gains but to limit your risks down the road also limiting your potential gains that is why it is always suggested to start your retirement funds early in your life to make sure you have enough time to invest in potentially high return stocks with high risk but when you get close to your retirement age it is advised to do exactly the opposite the date targeted funds do that for you but you can do it on your own as well as to the academic research you do n't need to go that far just look at the graphs to see that over long period investments in stocks give much better return than conservative bonds and treasuries especially when averaging the investments as it usually is with the retirement funds but over a given short period investments in stocks are much more likely to significantly lose in value

i have looked at the conditions of a car rental company and i believe it provides the answers upon pick up of your vehicle you must present a valid credit card    used to make the booking and which must be in the name if    you do not have a valid credit card we will accept your debit card    when you pick up your vehicle however as we can not reserve credit to    cover the potential damage or costs you will need to take    and a fuel tank of fuel at the start of the rental we will    refund the value of the unused fuel at the end of the rental unless    otherwise agreed with you visa mastercard and american express    are accepted credit card or third party insurance important in case of damage we    will charge you the incurred amount up to the excess you will then    need to reclaim this amount from the provider of the credit card or    third party insurer we strongly recommend that you fully read and    understand the terms and conditions of any cover provided by your    chosen provider before you decline any of our optional services    without our should you damage the vehicle during your    rental period we will charge you the corresponding amount up to the    excess regardless of whether you can subsequently reclaim this amount    from the provider of the credit card or the third party insurer in    the event you would like to dispute any of the above mentioned charges    you should send your request by mail or email to the location    state on your rental agreement from that we can conclude that it 's likely that disputes with customers in case of damage cost a lot to car rental companies and for the 2 above reasons demanding a credit card may alleviate it

given that the laws on consumer liability for unauthorized transactions mean no cost in most cases the cvv is there to protect the merchant   typically a merchant will receive a lower cost from their bank to process the transaction with the cvv code versus without as far as the netflix case goes or any other recurring billing for that matter they would n't care as much about it because visa mc amex regulations prohibit storage of the cvv   so if they collect it then it 's only used for the first transaction and just use the rest of the card info name expiration date address does the presence of cvv indicate the merchant has better security   maybe maybe not   it probably means they care about their costs and want to pay the bank as little as possible to process the transaction

signing bonuses are probably the most variable of all as there is a general understanding that more personal factors are taken into account as a result hr is n't under a huge obligation to explain away the differences in comparison for salary there 's the wide expectation that same job = same pay since there 's so variable but also fairly rare budget is n't a main concern for many hr departments and they certainly wo n't have a finely grained budget breakdown this year we 'll pay $ for $ 50000 for relocation payments $ 100,000 for pension transfers $ for stock option losses it 's generally tossed on one big heap cost of hiring so what can you ask for that 's really a market question what 's your value to the company how much of that is already reflected in salary and other benefits the main downside to signing bonuses is that a company wo n't know how long you 'd stay your value to the company is probably your monthly work therefore they can not amortize that bonus over a fixed amount of months what if you leave after 3 months for that reason a conditional signing bonus is a reasonable offer from your side e.g. ask for one month salary conditional on you staying for 24 months and otherwise you 'll repay them from your last salary

you are correct that you do not need to file under a certain circumstances primarily related to income but other items are taken into account such as filing status whether the amount was earned or unearned income interest dividends etc and a few other special situations which probably do n't apply to you   if you go through table 2 on page 3 and 4 of irs publication 501 attached there is a worksheet to fill out that will give you the definitive answer    as far as the 1099 goes that is to be filed by the person who paid you   how you were paid i.e. cash check etc makes no difference   you do n't have a filing requirement for that form in this case

the cause of incomplete inaccurate financial data 's appearing on free sites is that it is both complicated and expensive to obtain and parse these data even within a single country different pieces of financial data are handled by different authorities   in the us for example there is one generally recognized authority for stock prices and volumes but a completely different authority for corporate earnings data sec   for futures and options data the only authority is each individual exchange   each of these sources might have a vastly different interface to their data some may have websites others may have others may have to which you must subscribe etc now throw in the rest of the world and all their exchanges and regulatory agencies and you can see how it 's a difficult job to gather all this information parse it on a daily or more frequent basis and check it all for errors there are some companies e.g. bloomberg whose entire business model is to do the above   they spend tens of millions of dollars per year to support the infrastructure and manpower required to keep such a complex system working and they charge their consumers a pretty penny in return do google yahoo pay for bloomberg data access just to display information that we then consume for free   maybe   maybe they pay for some less expensive reduced data set   or a data set that is less rigorously checked for errors even if they pay for the best data available there 's no guarantee that a company 's last earnings report did n't have a glitch in it or that bloomberg 's latest download from the canadian agency for corporate dividends and census taking did n't get cut off in the middle or that the folks at yahoo built a robust system that can handle a particular file 's not arriving on time   bloomberg has dozens or even hundreds of employees focused on just this one task yahoo probably has 5 moral if you really need the best available data you must go to the or you must pay a provider to whom you can then complain when something is wrong   with free data you get what you pay for

if some one ever offers high returns and low risk they are either extremely stupid or scamming you if they did find a high return low risk investment a smart person would buy it then it as a low return low risk investment and then sell it to you people would still buy and they would make a ton    either they are lying scam or a as bad

this very topic was the subject of a question on workplace se tl dr   from tax publication 521 moving expenses table regarding how to report if your form w-2 shows your entire reimbursement reported    as    wages in box 1          and you have moving expenses     then file form showing all allowable   expenses but do not    show any    reimbursements there are tax implications covered in tax publication 521 moving expenses and employers tax guide to fringe benefits related to moving expenses from the employers view moving expense reimbursements this exclusion applies to any amount you directly or indirectly give to an employee including services furnished in kind as payment for or reimbursement of moving expenses you must make the reimbursement under rules similar to those described in chapter 11 of publication 535 for reimbursement of expenses for travel meals and entertainment under accountable plans the exclusion applies only to reimbursement of moving expenses that the employee could deduct if he or she had paid or incurred them without reimbursement however it does not apply if the employee actually deducted the expenses in a previous year    deductible moving expenses    deductible moving expenses include only the reasonable expenses of moving household goods and personal effects from the former home to the new home and traveling including lodging from the former home to the new home deductible moving expenses do not include any expenses for meals and must meet both the distance test and the time test the distance test is met if the new job location is at least 50 miles farther from the employee 's old home than the old job location was the time test is met if the employee works at least 39 weeks during the first 12 months after arriving in the general area of the new job location for more information on deductible moving expenses see publication 521 moving expenses employee    for this exclusion treat the following individuals as employees a current employee a leased employee who has provided services to you on a substantially full time basis for at least a year if the services are performed under your primary direction or control exception for s corporation shareholders    do not treat a 2 shareholder of an s corporation as an employee of the corporation for this purpose a 2 shareholder is someone who directly or indirectly owns at any time during the year more than 2 of the corporation 's stock or stock with more than 2 of the voting power treat a 2 shareholder as you would a partner in a partnership for fringe benefit purposes but do not treat the benefit as a reduction in distributions to the 2 shareholder exclusion from wages    generally you can exclude qualifying moving expense reimbursement you provide to an employee from the employee 's wages if you paid the reimbursement directly to the employee report the amount in box 12 of form w-2 with the code p. do not report payments to a third party for the employee 's moving expenses or the value of moving services you provided in kind   from the employees view the not be included as income the expenses must be from an accountable plan accountable plans to be an accountable plan your employer 's reimbursement arrangement must require you to meet all three of the following rules your expenses must have a business connection that is you must have paid or incurred deductible expenses while performing services as an employee of your employer two examples of this are the reasonable expenses of moving your possessions from your former home to your new home and traveling from your former home to your new home you must adequately account to your employer for these expenses within a reasonable period of time you must return any excess reimbursement or allowance within a reasonable period of time also what is interesting is the table regarding how to report if your form w-2 shows your entire reimbursement reported    as    wages in box 1          and you have moving expenses     then file form showing all allowable   expenses but do not    show any    reimbursements

it does n't really make sense to worry about the details of what counts as saving unless you also move beyond a simplistic rule of thumb like save 10 of your income that said most of the sources i see pushing rules of thumb like that are talking about saving for retirement   that is you need to sock that money away so you will be able to spend it after you retire   this cnn page is one example   on that theory it only counts if you put it away and do n't touch it until you retire so things like car and computer funds would not count as saving another thing you 'll see some people say e.g. this nerdwallet article is to use 20 of your income for financial priorities   this would include retirement saving but also things like paying off debt and saving for a down payment on a house saving for a small purchase in the near future would not usually be considered saving at all since you 're not going to keep the money   if you put $ 5 in your wallet tonight so you can buy a hamburger for lunch tomorrow you would n't call that saving likewise setting aside a few hundred dollars for a new computer would n't count as saving under most definitions   some people might count saving for something like a house since that is a long term plan and the house unlike a computer may rise in value after you buy it   but you would n't want to fully count the house as part of your retirement savings unless you 're willing to sell it and live off the proceeds however none of these rules will help that much if your goal is as you say at the end of your question to know if i need to save more than what i actually am saving currently   saving 10 of your income wo n't magically ensure that you 're saving enough   to assess whether you personally are saving enough you need to actually start running some numbers on how much money you personally will need in retirement   this will depend on any number of factors including where you live what sources of retirement income you might have besides savings e.g. pensions etc   in short to know if you 're saving enough you ca n't listen to the generic stuff that everyone says you need to consider your own situation in a deliberate focused way

there are a lot of false claims around the internet about this concept the fact of the matter is you are giving yourself the ability to have money in a tax favored environment with consistent steady growth as well as the ability to access it whenever you want   compare this to a 401k plan for example money is completely at risk you ca n't touch it and you 're penalized if you do n't follow the government 's rules as far as commissions to the agent an agent will cut his commission in half by selling you an infinite banking style policy as opposed to a traditional whole life policy @duffbeer703 clearly does n't understand life insurance in the slightest when he says that the first three years of your premium will go to the agents pocket   and as usual offers no alternative except pick some high yielding stocks and mlps someone needs to wake up from the dave ramsey and realize that there is no such thing as a 12 mutual fund do your research on the stock market research   do n't just listen to dave who still thinking getting 12 15 year in and year out is possible it 's frustrating to listen to people who are so uneducated on the subject remember the internet has turned everyone into experts if you want real advice talk to a legitimate expert that understands life insurance and how it actually works

a futures contract is based upon a particular delivery date   in the case of a stock index futures contract is a cash settled futures contract based upon the stock index value at a particular point in time i.e. this is when the final settlement is determined in your example the s&p 500 spx is a price return index that is it is not affected by dividends and therefore dividends are not incorporated into the index value   dividends will affect the price of the constituent stocks not necessarily by the same amount as the dividend so they do have influence on the stock index value   since the dividends are known ahead of time or at least can be estimated this has already been factored into the futures price by the market in terms of the impact of a dividend by aapl aapl is 3.6 of the index   apple pays out dividends 4 times a year currently paying out $ dividends   assuming the market is otherwise steady and aapl drops by $ due to the dividend and apple is priced at around $ 105 this would result in a drop in the index of or around 0.35 points interesting fact   there are some futures contracts that are based upon total return indexes such as the german dax and the above logic would need to be reversed

here 's my crude reasoning let 's say you have just one recently acquired credit card with a $ 5000 limit the company that issued the credit card set the $ 5000 limit based on however they assessed your risk now if you 're using a significant portion of of the $ 5000 limit it means at least for them that you are stretching your wallet even if you 've been paying monthly consistently and since you are heavily using your limit it also means that if you lose your primary source of money for even one month income etc then your risk to the lender increases sharply had you been making more money compared to this $ 5000 limit then either you 'd have used less of your available credit or you would've gotten your limits raised by asking your bank to re evaluate your risk and increase the limit also your statement why is a us credit score based on credit utilization is slightly incorrect as per fico credit utilization has 35 weight while your payment history has a weight of 35 to sum it up we can debate if the weight for credit utilization should be higher or lower but unfortunately as others have pointed out these scores are meant to help lenders not consumers so whether we like it or not the secret algorithms to calculate the scores and the actual weights variables and rules they use are completely out of our hands

the short answer is no the cgt discount is only applied against your net capital gain so your net capital gain would be $ 25,000 $ 5,000 = $ 20,000 your cgt discount is $ 10,000 you will then pay cgt on $ 10,000 of course you could sell abc in this financial year and sell def next financial year   if you had no other share activities next financial year than that net capital loss can be carried forward to a future year in that case your net capital gain this year would be $ 25,000 your cgt discount is $ 12,500 you will then pay cgt on $ 12,500 next year if sell def you 'll have a $ 5000 net capital loss which you can carry forward to a future year as an offset against capital gains reference

the value of a company is simplified the sum of the value of the equity and the value of the debt there are some other things to add subtract to that but just think about those for now   you could also say the value of a company is the value of its assets or more precisely the value of the net cash flows those assets will generate in the future   so let 's say you want to start a company so you want to buy some assets maybe you want to buy a $ 200 asset well you only have $ 100 so you take out a loan debt for $ 100 for the remainder you buy the asset and start generating income   let 's say after a month you get bored and decide to sell the company let 's assume the value of the assets has n't changed your equity is worth $ 100 and you find a buyer who is willing to pay $ 100 for your company great right   well there 's still the $ 100 loan you owe so you have to pay that back and suddenly you now have $ 0    so in fact you should have negotiated $ 200 with the buyer because that 's what the assets are actually worth then you can pay back the loan and still have the $ 100 in equity you deserve alternatively you could have negotiated the buyer to assume responsibility for the loan same outcome for you   did that help

did he say why he wants double your asking price did you explain to him how you came up with the offer you made sometimes exploring interests why people make their decisions is more helpful than bargaining over positions if you understand why he wants double your offer and he understands why you 're offering a lower price you might get closer to an agreement another option is to defer to a disinterested third party who will pick a valuation for the company and you can agree to abide by their decision and pick a payout schedule if necessary think about what you 'll do if you ca n't come to an agreement is walking away from the business an option and going out on your own what would happen to him if you simply walk away it might be in his best interest to negotiate or will you pay his asking price or can you sell the business to him one option when partners need to split up is to have one of them set a value for the company and the other decides if he wants to be the buyer or seller it 's like the trick with kids where one cuts the cake and the other selects which slice he wants maybe you can come up with a fair way of valuing the company a lawyer will be needed to draw it all up but you can agree on the framework of the deal ahead of time and save some money and stress last thought when a win win agreement is n't possible sometimes the next best compromise is where everyone feels like he got equally screwed that 's ok too

assuming these are standardized and regulated contracts the short answer is yes   in your example trader a is short while trader b is long   if trader b wants to exit his long position he merely enters a sell to close order with his broker trader b never goes short as you state   he was long while he held the contract then he sold to close as to who finds the buyer of trader b 's contract i believe that would be the exchange or a market maker   therefore trader c ends up the counterparty to trader a 's short position after buying from trader b.   assuming the contract is held until expiration trader a is responsible for delivering contracted product to trader c for contracted price   in reality this is generally settled up in cash and trader a and trader c never even know each other 's identity

it 's quite common for vat registered businesses to quote ex vat prices for supply to other businesses   however you 're right that when you make an order you will be invoiced and ultimately have to pay the vat inclusive price assuming your supplier is vat registered   if you 're not clear on this then you should check since it obviously makes quite a difference since your business is not vat registered you can not charge vat to your customers

a dividend is a cash disbursement from the company   the value of the company goes down the same amount of the dividend so it is analogous to having money in a savings account and taking a withdrawal every month   obviously you are going to have less in the end than if you just kept the money in the account suppose that i own 10 different stocks and do n't reinvest dividends but keep them on account and each month or two as i add more money to invest either in one of my existing stocks or perhaps something new i add whichever dividend amount is currently available in cash to my new purchase would this strategy provide the same results roughly yes   reinvesting dividends is essentially buying more stock at the lower price which is a net zero effect in total balance   so if you invested in the same stocks yes you 'd be in the same place   if you invested in different stocks then you would have a performance difference depending on what you invested in the risk is the temptation to take the cash dividend and not reinvest it but take it in cash thereby reducing your earning power that is is there some particular reason that the brokers are recommending automatically reinvesting dividends as opposed to reinvesting them manually perhaps not always in the same item i 'd like to think that they 're looking after your best interest and they might be but the cynical part of me thinks that they 're either trying to keep your business by increasing your returns or there 's some uk regulation i 'm not aware of that requires them to disclose the effect of reinvesting dividends     £ 100 invested in the uk stock market since would have grown into just £ after adjusting for inflation this figure seems ludicrous to me   i have n't actually measured what the historical returns on the uk market are but that would mean an annualized return adjusted for inflation of just 0.5   either uk stocks pay a ridiculous amount of dividends or there 's something wrong with the math edit i still have not found a definitive source for the real uk market return but according to this inflation calculator £ 100 in would equate to almost £ 12,000 today for an average inflation rate of percent which would put the cagr of the uk market at about 4.9 which seems reasonable   the cagr with dividend reinvestment would then be about making dividend reinvestment a no brainer in the uk market at least

i can not speak for paypal specifically and i doubt anyone who does n't actually work on their internal automated payment systems could however i can speak from experiencing in working on automated forex transaction systems and tell you what many institutions do and it is often not based on live rates there is no law stating an institution must honor a specific market exchange rate institutions can determine their own rates how and when they want to however there is some useful information on their website the most readily available information on currency exchange rates is based on interbank exchange rates interbank exchange rates are established in the course of currency trading among a global network of over 1,000 banks and are not available through consumer or retail channels this leads me to believe they pull exchange rates from either oanda or xe periodically and then use these rates throughout the day to conduct business paypal does not disclose who they use to determine rates and it 's highly doubtful they do this for every transaction using live rates even if they did there would be no way for you to check and be certain of a particular exchange rate as paypal states consumers may use these rates as a reference but should not expect to use interbank rates in transactions that involve currency conversion to obtain actual retail rates contact your local financial institution or currency exchange or check the rate displayed in your paypal transaction this is partly because rates can change by the second just like stock prices or anything else which is susceptible to the open market 's variables of supply demand news events etc so even if you check the rates on oanda which you can do here you are not going to get a 100 accurate representation of what you would get by doing an exchange immediately afterwards from paypal or any other financial institution however if you want to estimate using oanda 's currency converter will likely get you close in most scenarios that is assuming paypal does n't charge a premium for the exchange which they may that is also assuming they use live rates it 's also possible they only update their rates based on market rates periodically and not for every transaction you may want to test this by checking the exchange rate on your transaction and comparing that to the oanda rates at the same time

the difficulty is that you are thinking of a day as a natural unit of time   for some securities the inventory decisions are less than a minute for others it can be months   you could ask a similar question of why would a dealer hold cash they are profit maximizing firms and subject to a chosen risk level will accept deals that are sufficiently profitable   consider a stock that averages 1,000 shares per day but for which there is an order for 10,000 shares   at a sufficient discount the dealer would be crazy not to carry the order    you are also assuming all orders are idiosyncratic   dividend reinvestment plans drip trigger planned purchases on a fixed day usually by averaging them over a period such as 10 days   the dealer slowly accumulates a position leading up to the date whenever it appears a good discount is available and fills the drip orders out of their own account   the dealer tries to be careful not to the market leading up to the date and allows the volume request to shift prices upward and then fills them

while open interest usually correlates to volume the mark of liquidity is the bid ask spread even when trading options with spreads as large as an ask 2x the bid a more realistic price that traders are willing to accept lies somewhere in the middle any option can easily be exited at intrinsic value underlying price exercise price for calls exercise price underlying price for puts   for illiquid options this will be the best price obtained   for longer term options something closer to the theoretical price is still possible if an underlying is extremely liquid yet the options are n't quite then options traders will be much more ready to trade at the theoretical price for exiting illiquid options small < 4 contracts and infrequent > 30 minute intervals orders are more likely to be filled closer to the theoretical price however if one 's sells are the only trades traders on the other side will take note and accept ever lowering implied volatilities with knowledge of what traders will accept it is always more optimal to trade out of options rather than exercise because of the added costs and uncertainty involved with exercising and liquidating

yes there are times when co signing is the right choice one is when you know more about the person than the loan issuer does consider a young person who has just started working in a volatile field the kind of job where you can be told on friday that you only get one shift next week but things might pick up the week after and who makes maybe $ 12 an hour in that job you 've done the math and with 40 hour weeks they can easily afford the loan furthermore you know this person well and you know that after a few weeks of not enough shifts they 've got the to go out and find a second job or a different job that will give them 40 hours or more a week and you know that they have some savings they could use to ensure that no payments will be missed even on low wage weeks you can cosign for this person say for a car loan to get them a car they can drive to that job knowing that they are n't going to walk away and just stop making the payments the loan issuer does n't know any of that   or consider a young person with poor credit but good income who has recently decided to get smart about money has written out a budget and a plan to their credit and who you know will work passionately to make every payment and get the credit score up to a place where they can buy a house or whatever their goal is again you can cosign for this person to make that happen because you know something the lender does n't or consider a middle aged person who 's had some very hard knocks laid off in a plant closing perhaps marriage failure lost all their house equity when the market collapsed that sort of thing they have a chance to start over again somewhere else and you have a chance to help again you know this is n't someone who is going to their money and walk away from the payments and leave you holding the bag if you would give the person the money anyway say a car for your newly graduated child then cosigning instead gives them more of a sense of accomplishment since they paid for it and gives them a great credit rating too if you would not give the person the entire loan amount but would make their payments for many months or even a year say your brother 's mortgage for the house where he lives with a sick wife and 3 small children then cosigning is only making official what you would have done anyway   arrange with the borrower that if they ca n't make their payments any more you will backstop them and the item car house whatever is going up for sale to cover your losses if you do n't think you could enforce that just from the strength of the relationship reconsider co signing then sign what you need to sign and step away from it it 's their loan not yours you want them to pay it and to manage it and to leave you out of it until it 's all paid off and they thank you for your help if things go south you will have to pay and it may take a while for you to sell the item or otherwise stop the paying so you do need to be very confident that the borrower is going to make every single payment on time my point is just that you can have that confidence based on personal knowledge of character employment situation savings and other resources in a way that a lender really can not

if human beings were i.e. textbook rational and self interested economic minded beings as opposed to simply human then yes simple advice like just stay out of debt and your credit score will take care of itself could work   your simplification would be very persuasive to such a being however people are not perfectly rational   we buy something we should n't have we charge it on a credit card we ca n't afford to pay it off at the end of the month   we lose our job   our furnace breaks down or our roof leaks and we did n't anticipate the replacement cost   some of this is our fault some of it is n't basically shit happens and we get into debt   maybe even knowing all the while we should n't have our credit history and score takes a hit   only then do we find out there are consequences our interest rates go up our insurance companies raise premiums our prospective new employers or landlords run credit checks and either deny us the job or the apartment telling a person who asks for help about their credit history score that they should n't have taken on debt in the first place is like telling the farmer he should have kept the barn door shut so the horse would n't run out   while it is not bad advice it 's not the only kind of advice to offer when somebody finds themselves in such a situation adding advice about actions is more helpful   the person probably already know that they should n't have overspent in the first place and got into debt   yes remind them of the value of being sensible about debt in the first place it 's good reinforcement but add some helpful advice to the mix   e.g. so you 're in debt   you should n't have lived beyond your means   but now that you are in this mess here 's what you can do to improve the situation

your wife could open a non registered margin trading account with a canadian full service or discount broker an account at one of the top canadian brokers should provide access to trade u.s listed options i 've traded both canadian and u.s listed options with my own broker on the application you 'd need to indicate an interest in trading options and more specifically what kind of option trades e.g. long puts and calls only covered writing combination trades etc and yes part of the application approval process at least when i went through it is to answer a few questions to prove that the applicant is aware of the types of risks with trading options be sure to do some research on the fees and currency fx aspects before you choose a broker   if you plan to exercise any options purchased or expect to be assigned for any you write be aware that those fees are often different from the headline cost per trade advertised by brokers for instance i pay in excess of $ 40 when a call option i write gets assigned vs. ~$10 that i 'd pay if i just plain sold the stock one other thing to investigate is what kind of online option trading research and order entry tools are available not every broker has the same set of features with respect to options especially if it is n't a big part of their business

from some of your previous questions it seems like you trade quite often so i am assuming you are not a buy and hold person if that is the case then have you got a written trading plan considering you do n't know what to do after a 40 drop i assume the answer to this is that you do n't have a trading plan before you enter any trade you should have your exit point for that trade pre determined and this should be included in your trading plan you should also include how you pick the shares you buy do you use fundamental analysis technical analysis a combination of the two a dart board or some kind of advisory service then finally and most importantly you should have your position sizing and risk management incorporated into your plan if you are doing all this and had automatic stop loss orders placed when you entered your buy orders then you would have been out of the stock well before your loss got to 40 if you are looking to hang on and hoping for the stock to recover remember with a 40 drop the stock will now need to rise by 67 just for you to break even on the trade even if the stock did recover how long would it take there is the potential for opportunity loss waiting for this stock to recover and that might take years if the stock has fallen by 40 in a short time it is most likely that it will continue to fall in the short term and if it falls to 50 then the recovery would need to be 100 just for you to break even leave your emotions out of your trading as much as possible have a written trading plan which incorporates your risk management a good book to read on the psychology of the markets position sizing and risk management is trade your way to financial freedom by van tharp i actually went to see him talk tonight in sydney all the way over from the usa

the home owner will knock 20 off the price of the house if the house is worth $ k then 20 is just a discount your landlord is offering   so your actual purchase price is $ 237 k and therefore a bank would have to lend you $ since the house is worth more than the loan you have equity   20 to be more accurate   another way to say is the bank only wants to loan you 80 of the value of the item securing the loan if you default on day one they can sell the house to somebody else for $ k and get a 20 return on their loan so this 20 you are worried about is n't actually money that anybody gives anybody else it is just a concept

in the united states the general policy is that the irs would consider it income when you have access to the money i work for a company that has a contract with another company near the end of the year i turn in a time card that has my hours that i worked as of that date because they do n't pay me until early january the money on the check is counted in the new year i could n't touch the money until they issued the check if they had paid me on december 31st it would have counted as the old year even if i only had a short window to have access to it before the year ended it would even count as old year money if i held on to the december check but did n't deposit it until march so it would become income when you could use it so if you could access it via a check or debit card or transfer it to the bank it is now income of course that is in the united states you would need to see what the situation is in singapore the edge cases always depend on the country

first of all i 've raised vc money before so i have experience in this area the other commenter who said they 'll only cause trouble is wrong as a general statement some may but that just means you 've chosen your investors poorly choosing an investor is a very important decision and you should choose someone who you think will be able truly add value to your business rather than just someone who is willing to write a check cultural alignment is important and having a shared set of goals and timelines for the business is important    that said no one here is going to be able to tell you how to structure your deal because it varies so much based on the business in general i think it 's a good idea to only take money when you need it and have a solid plan for how you 're going to use it every time you take money you 're diluting your ownership and reducing your long term upside keep in mind that as the other commenter said if you take a deal now that means that you maintain 51 and then you take more money in the future that 51 will be diluted further that said with more investors in the mix you still are likely to be the largest shareholder but again that depends on how the deals are structured    my advice seek out as much advice from as many sources as you can and hire a good law firm to handle your financing transaction because their advice is invaluable as you negotiate terms finally you should have more conditions than just retaining 51 ownership there are a lot of terms that get baked into these deals that have an impact on the long term upside learn those terms do a bunch of googling and a bunch of reading and ask for more advice

you need to be clear about who gets your money if you pay the existing owner $ 25 k and s)he gives you half the business then you now own half of a $ 50 k business an the original owner has an extra $ 25 k in spending cash   the value of the business has not changed if you contribute $ 25 to the company new equity shares are created   shares should be priced correctly meaning you now own $ 25 k worth of shares in a company worth $ 75k so you should have 1/3 of the outstanding shares counting both old and new shares   if you get more or less than this then the transaction has happened in an unfair way if this is a public company that would most likely be illegal and the sec may throw you in jail   if it was a private company and your friend created enough shares that you own half the company then s)he has given you a gift if you are contributing to the company at a fair price you would need to contribute $ 50 k in order to end up with half the equity of the new and now more valuable firm in that case the firm would be worth $ 100 k after your contribution bottom line this is a common and not complex transaction and should end up with a completely fair outcome   any unfair situation you can imagine is probably based on false assumptions or a situation where a non arms length transaction is transferring wealth contrary to normal rules and procedures

1 how long have you had the car   generally accounts that last more than a year are kept on your credit report for 7 years while accounts that last less than a year are only kept about 2 years iirc could someone correct me if that last number is wrong 2 who is the financing through   if it 's through a used car dealer there 's a good chance they 're not even reporting it to the credit bureaus i had this happen to me the dealer promised he 'd report the loan so it would help my credit i made my payments on time every time and nothing ever showed up   it pissed me off because another positive account on my credit report would have really helped my score   banks and brand name dealers are more likely to report the loan 3 what are your expected long term gains on the stocks you 're considering selling and will you have to pay capital gains on them when you do sell them   the cost of selling those stocks could possibly be higher than the gain from paying off the car so you 'll want to run the numbers for a couple different scenarios optimistic growth pessimistic etc and see if you come out ahead or not 4 are there prepayment penalties or costs associated with paying off the car loan early   most reputable financiers wo n't include such terms or they 'll only be in effect during the first few months of the loan but again it depends on who the loan is through in short it depends   i know people hate hearing answers like that but it 's true   hopefully though you 'll be able to sit down and look at the specifics of your situation and make an informed decision

the 20x number is drawn directly from the assumption that it should be easy to get more than 4 average return on investment after lots of historical studies   monte carlo simulations and the like there was a consensus that saving more did n't significantly increase the odds of achieving at least the desired yearly income sustainably that 's the same calculations the insurance firms use as the starting point for writing annuities there are also some assumptions about inflation and its interaction with the market built into this rule of thumb note that this is 20x what you want as post retirement income not necessarily 20x your current income i have a moderately frugal lifestyle and my budget confirms that my actual spending even in years when i allow myself a splurge is well below my current income with the excess going into the investments to sustain my lifestyle i need that lower number plus any taxes that 'll be due on it plus whatever i want to allocate as average emergency reserve and theoretically i should be able to base the 20x on that lower number when i run estimates quicken has a tool for this so does my credit union i   presume others are widely available they tend to confirm this i 'm still using the higher number for planning though i do n't feel any need to retire early though i have issues with my current manager and i have no objection at all to being able to afford better toys on occasion or to leaving a legacy to friends relatives and/or charity but it 's nice to know exactly when i could the day job if i wanted to

this is a good idea but it will barely affect your credit score at all   credit cards while a good tool to use for giving a minor boost to your credit score and for purchasing things while also building up rewards with those purchases are n't very good for building credit    this is because when banks calculate your credit report they look at your long term credit history and weigh larger longer term debt much higher than short term debt that you pay off right away   while having your credit card is better than nothing it 's a relatively small drop in the pond when it comes to credit    i would still recommend getting a credit card though it will if you have n't already started paying off a debt like a student or car loan give you a credit identity and rewards depending on the credit card you choose   but if you do do not ever let yourself fall into delinquency   failing to pay off loans will damage your credit score   so if you do plan to get a credit card it is much better to do as you 've said and pay it all off as soon as possible    edit   in addition to the above using a credit card has the added benefit of having greater security over debit cards and ensures that your own money wo n't be stolen though you will still have to report a fraudulent charge

unless you have an actual hardship bankruptcy or other emergency you will be better off leaving that money alone this excellent answer gives more than enough reasons why a withdrawal or loan is not recommended   i would love some advice because i need to know if i should contribute more into my 401k or less if your priority to purchase is high enough it may be worth considering stopping 401k contributions for a short time to help pile up a down payment   i also encourage you to consider that if you can not pool the money from non retirement sources then you can not afford that much house at this time this might mean looking for cheaper houses or delaying purchase for a number of years

so my understanding is that google is prioritizing it 's own comparison shopping services at the expense of others since it is acting essentially as the gateway to the internet in the eu   some people say this is like coke being forced to put pepsi in its machines but i do n't see it that way i see it as google unfairly giving its own services priority in google search listings when the algorithm they use should be non biased   overall a very interesting decision which could have great ramifications in the us

right now we 're producing enough food feed everyone on the planet per day around twice of what they need in the us we 're throwing away around 40 of the food we produce and we 're not using all available land have n't even tried optimizing land use and not all land used for animal farming is usable for growing crops   and meat is n't a problem for emissions i posted this in another r documentaries     global emissions from animal agriculture including deforestation is just 14.5 news story en and in the us where you do n't have deforestation issues all agriculture including crops grown for human consumption is just 8.1 of emissions   gt in 2012 emission sources accounted for in the agricultural chapters were responsible for 8.1 percent of total u.s. greenhouse gas emissions   environmental protection agency sources of greenhouse gas emissions climatechange downloads us   the 2015 draft also shows that this is declining as a percentage to 7.6 chapter climatechange pdfs us   meanwhile we have 31 from electricity and another 27 from transportation   sector emission   epa sources of greenhouse gas climatechange   switching to clean energy solar wind nuclear and moving to alternative fuels would make a huge impact and address the actual problem far more efficiently blaming animal agriculture is just a red wiki pushed by groups with other motivations than climate change it 's not based on actual science

there 's nothing to rebalance the index fund rebalances itself to continue matching the index however you need to understand that such an investment is not diversified and you only invest in a very specific market and very specific stocks on that market s&p 500 is large 500 different companies most of the time but still not as broadly diversified as your retirement investment portfolio should be you should talk to a financial adviser cfp for example many companies provide access to these for 401k plan participants but in any case i 'd suggest considering target date funds funds that are investing based on your expected retirement year and become more conservative as you get closer to that year

what you 're getting at is the same as investing with leverage usually this comes in the form in a margin account which an investor uses to borrow money at a low interest rate invest the money and hopefully beat the interest rate   is this approach unwise that completely depends on how your investments perform and how high your loan 's interest rate is the higher your loan 's interest rate the more risky your investments will have to be in order to beat the interest rate if you can get a return which beats the interest rates of your loan then congratulations you have come out ahead and made a profit if you can keep it up you should make the minimum payment on your loan to maximize the amount of capital you can invest if not then it would be better to just use your extra cash to pay down the loan   are there really are investments aside from stocks and such that i can try to use to my advantage with interest rates as low as they are right now at least in the us you 'll probably be hard pressed to find a savings account or cd that will return a higher interest rate than your loan 's if you 're nervous about the risk associated with investing in stocks and bonds as is healthy then know that they come in a wide spectrum of risk it 's up to you to evaluate how much risk you 're willing to take on to achieve a higher return

first lets understand what convexity means convexity   convexity refers to non in a financial model in other    words if the price of an underlying variable changes the price of an    output does not change linearly but depends on the second derivative    or loosely speaking higher order terms of the modeling function    geometrically the model is no longer flat but curved and the degree    of is called the convexity okay so for us idiots this means if the price of abc we will call p is determined by x and y. then if x decreases by 5 then the value of p might not necessarily decrease by 5 but instead is also dependent on y is y who cares its not important for us to know we can understand what convexity is without knowing the math behind it so if we chart this the line would look like a curve clearly this is an over simplification of the math involved but it gives us an idea so now in terms of options convexity is also known as gamma it will probably be easier to talk about gamma instead of using a confusing word like is the convexity of options so lets define gamma gamma the rate of change for delta with respect to the underlying asset 's price so the gamma of an option indicates how the delta of an option will change relative to a 1 point move in the underlying asset in other words the gamma shows the option delta 's sensitivity to market price changes or gamma shows how volatile an option is relative to movements in the underlying asset so the answer is if we are long gamma convexity of an option it simply means we are betting on higher volatility in the underlying your case the vix really that simple well kinda to fully understand how this works you really need to understand the math behind it but yes being long gamma means being long volatility an example of being long gamma is a long straddle side note i personally do trade the vix and it can be very volatile you can make or lose lots of money very quickly trading vix options some resources what does it mean to be long gamma in options trading long gamma how to make a long gamma position work for you delta investopedia straddles strangles further reading if your interested even more reading

very likely this refers to trading speculating on leverage not investing of course as soon as you put leverage into the equation this perfectly makes sense   2007 2009 for example if one bought the $ spx at its highs in 2007 at to the lows from 2009 at that with only 2:1 leverage a $ account would have received a margin call at least here in europe i can trade index cfd 's and other leveraged products if i trade lets say > 50:1 leverage it does n’t take much to get a margin call and/or position closed by the broker no doubt depending on which investments you choose there ’s always risk but currency is a position too to answer the question i find it very unlikely that > 90 of investors referring to stocks lose money purchasing power anyway i would not deny that where speculators not investors use leverage or try to trade swings news etc have a very high risk of losing money purchasing power

this seemed very unrealistic i mean who would do that but to my immense surprise the market price increased to 5.50 $ in the following week why is that this is strange it seems that people mistakenly believe that the company should be at 5.5 and currently available cheap this looks like irrational behaviour most of the past 6 months the said stock in range bound to 4.5 to 5 the last time it hit around 5.5 was so this is definitely strange if the company had set a price of 6.00 $ in the rights offering would the price have increased to 6 $ obviously the company thinks that their shares are worth that much but why did the market suddenly agree possibly yes possible no it can be answered more often the rights issue are priced at slight discount to market price why did this happen obviously management thinks that the company is worth that much but why did the market simply believe this statement without any additional information i do n't see any other information if the new shares had some special privileges in terms of voting rights dividends etc then yes however the announcements says the rights issues is for common shares

you are incorrect in saying that you have a capital gains of $ 0 you either have no capital gains activity because you have n't realized it or you have an unrealized capital gains of if you were to sell immediately after receiving the dividend you would end up as a wash investment wise the 10k of dividend offsetting the 10k capital wash though due to different tax treatments of money you may be slightly negative with respect to taxes   you are taxed when you receive the money and you realized that 10k in dividends even if you did n't want too   in the future if this bothers you you need to pay attention to the dividend pay out dates for funds but then just after they payout a dividend and have drain their cash account the issue is that you unknowingly bought 90k of stock and 10k of cash this information is laid out in the fund documentation which you should be reviewing before investing in any new fund

i am not familiar with this broker but i believe this is what is going on when entering combination orders in this case the purchase of stocks and the writing of a call it does not make sense to set a limit price on the two legs of the order separately in that case it may be possible that one order gets executed but the other not for example instead you can specify the total amount you are willing to pay net debit or receive net credit per item for this particular choice of a buy and write strategy a net credit does not make sense as joetaxpayer has explained hence if you would choose this option the order would never get executed for some combinations of options it does make sense however it is perhaps also good to see where the max gain numbers come from in the first case the gain would be maximal if the stock rises to the strike of the call or higher in that case you would be payed out $ 100 = $ 250 but you have paid $ 100 for the combination hence this leaves a profit of $ 109 disregarding transaction fees in the other case you would have been paid $ for the position hence in that case the total profit would be $ = $ but as said such an order would not be executed by the way note that in your screenshot the bid is at 0 so writing a call would not earn you anything at all

first you need to understand that not   every investor 's goals are the same some investors are investing for income they want to invest in a profitable company and use the profit from the company as income if that investor invests only in stocks that do not pay a dividend the only way he can realize income is to sell his investment but he can invest in companies that pay a regular dividend and use that income while keeping his investment intact   imagine this let 's say i own a profitable company and i offer to sell you part ownership in that company however i tell you this upfront no matter how much profit our company makes you will never get a penny from me you will be getting a stock certificate a piece of paper and that 's it you can watch the company grow and you can tell yourself you own it but the only way you will personally benefit from your investment would be to sell your piece to someone else who would also never see a penny in profit does that sound like a good investment the fact of the matter is stocks in companies that do not distribute dividends do have value but this value is largely based on the potential of profits dividends at some point in the future if a company never ever to pay dividends why would anyone invest   an investment would be more of a donation like kickstarter at that point   a company that pays dividends is possibly past their growth stage that does n't necessarily mean that they have stopped growing altogether but remember that an expansion project for any company does not automatically yield a good result if a company does not have a good opportunity currently for a growth project i as an investor would rather get a dividend than have the company blow all the profit on a ill gamble

sometimes what happens is that a creditor will hand over accounts to a collection agency for action and after a period of time it may be to yet another collection agency if the first one was not successful   theoretically this should not be cause to reset the date of collections on your bureau file but that very well could have happened here another instance when this happens is when someone contacts a creditor about a collection item on their report either to pay or dispute it   either way this the clock on that collection item so if a debt is old enough sometimes the best course of action is to let it go   if a debt has been in collections for 4 years let 's say and you decide to pay it off now your score is n't going to improve because you paid the collection enough to offset the effect of having it refreshed on your bureau file   besides creditors know how old the debt is so waiting 4 years to pay it is n't going to win you any favors in their eyes anyway to your question though it seems to me the most likely thing is that somehow the debt was refreshed through some action by the creditor or one of the agencies assigned to collect on it i hope this helps good luck

cart 's answer describes well one aspects of puts protective puts which means using puts as insurance against a decline in the price of shares that you own   that 's a popular use of puts   but i think the wording of your question is for another strategy writing puts consider cart 's strategy refers to the buyer of a put   but on the transaction 's other side is a seller of the put and ultimately somebody created or wrote that put contract in the first place   that first seller of the put that is the seller that is n't just selling one they themselves bought is the put writer when you write a put you are taking on the obligation to buy the other side 's stock at the put exercise price if the stock price falls below that exercise price by the expiry date   for taking on the obligation you receive a premium like how an insurance company charges a premium to insure against a loss example   imagine abc co. stock is trading at $ 25.00   you write a put contract agreeing to buy 100 shares of abc at $ 20.00 per share the exercise price by a given expiration date   say you receive $ premium from the put buyer   you now have the obligation to purchase the shares from the put buyer in the event they are below $ 20.00 per share when the option expires or technically any time before then if the buyer chooses to exercise the option early assuming no early assignment one of two things will happen at the option expiration date abc trades at or above $ 20.00 per share in this case the put option will expire worthless in the hands of the put buyer   you will have pocketed the $ 200 and be from your obligation   this case where abc trades above the exercise price is the maximum profit potential abc trades below $ 20.00 per share   in this case the put option will be assigned and you 'll need to fork over $ 2000 to the put buyer in exchange for his 100 abc shares   if those shares are worth less than $ in the market then you 've suffered a loss to the extent they are below that price times 100 because remember you pocketed $ 200 premium in the first place   if the shares are between $ to $ 20.00 you 're still profitable but not to the full extent of the premium received you can see that by having written a put it 's possible to acquire abc stock at a price lower than the market price because you received some premium in the process of writing your put   if you do n't succeed in acquiring shares on your first write because the shares did n't get below the exercise price you can continue to write puts and collect premium until you do get assigned i have read the book money for nothing and your stocks for free by canadian author derek foster   despite the flashy title the book essentially describes derek 's strategy for writing puts against dividend paying value stocks he would love to own   derek picks quality companies that pay a dividend and uses put writing to get in at lower than market prices   four pillars reviewed the book and interviewed derek foster money for nothing book review and interview with derek foster writing puts entails risk   if the stock price drops to zero then you 'll end up paying the put exercise price to acquire worthless shares   so your down side can easily be multiples of the premium collected   do n't do this until and unless you understand exactly how this works   it 's advanced note also that your broker is n't likely to permit you to write puts without having sufficient cash or margin in your account to cover the case where you are forced to buy the stock   you 're better off having cash to secure your put buys otherwise you may be forced into leverage borrowing when assigned   additional resources the montreal exchange options guide pdf that cart already linked to is an excellent free resource for learning about options   refer to page 39 writing secured put options for the strategy above other major options exchanges and organizations also provide high quality free learning material

although i do n't think you need to factor in risk tolerance to get the probabilities i agree with joetaxpayer that you will need to factor in risk tolerance in order to make a practical decision about what to do   in fact i think that to make a practical decision you will need more than the specific probability you ask for you in the question rather you would like to see the complete probability distribution of possible outcomes in other words it 's not enough to know that there is a 51 chance that investing will outperform paying down debt   you actually need to know much it outperforms when it does outperform and how much it underperforms when it underperforms   as joetaxpayer 's comment suggests you might not choose to make an investment that had a 99 chance of outperforming debt payment by 1 and a 1 chance of underperforming by 99 i think it possible to address these questions by doing simulations   this can be done even with a spreadsheet but more flexibly with simple programming   essentially you can create some kind of probabilistic model of the various factors e.g. chance that your investment will go up or down and see what actually happens how often you lose a lot of money lose a little money gain a little money or gain a lot of money   then based on that you can consult your inner spirit animal to decide whether the probability distribution of possible gains outweighs that of possible losses

well first off i would advice you to do this research yourself you should not base your selection off someone 's opinion such as mines   with that being said these are some factors i suggest you consider and research before talking to an offshore bank account now when opening an offshore account most offshore banks do not require you to be present at all you can open an account simply by calling them or filling out their application online however be prepared to provide them with some information to verify who you are and the nature of your business such as a notarized passport along with other various forms of information that they may require just think of what your local bank requires is generally what they will ask as well here is a compiled list of offshore bank accounts to consider these banks overall have a range between $ 0 $ 1 million domestic currency minimum deposits most of them ranging from $ it all depends on the type of account the nature of the account and the business associated with the account

many individual states counties and cities have their own income taxes payroll taxes sales taxes property taxes etc you will need to consult your state and local government websites for information about additional taxes that apply based on your locale wages salaries tips cash bonuses and other taxable employee pay strike benefits long term disability earnings from self employment earned income is subject to payroll taxes such as earned income is also subject to income taxes which are progressively higher depending on the amount earned minus tax credits exemptions and/or deductions depending on how you file there are 7 tax rates that get progressively larger as your income rises but only applies to the income in each bracket 10 for the first 2017 through 39.6 for any income above the full list of rates is in the above linked article about payroll taxes earned income is required for contributions to an ira you can not contribute more to an ira than you have earned in a given year interest ordinary dividends short term capital gains retirement income pensions distributions from tax deferred accounts social security unemployment benefits worker 's compensation alimony child support income earned while in prison non taxable military pay most rental income and s corp passthrough income ordinary income is taxed the same as earned income with the exception that social security taxes do not apply this is the pure taxable income referred to in the other linked question dividends paid by us corporations and qualified foreign corporations to stock holders that are held for a certain period of time before the dividend is paid are taxed at the long term capital gains rate explained below ordinary dividends like the interest earned in your bank account are included with ordinary income   stocks bonds real estate carried interest held for more than a year income from assets that increase in value while being held for over a year long term capital gains justified by the idea that they encourage people to hold stock and make long term investments rather than buying and then quickly reselling for a short term profit   the lower tax rates also reflect the fact that many of these assets are already taxed as they are appreciating in value real estate is usually taxed through local property taxes equity in us corporations realized by rising stock prices and dividends that are returned to stock holders reflect earnings from a corporation that are already taxed at the 35 corporate tax rate taxing capital gains as ordinary income would be a second tax on those same profits another problem with long term capital gains tax is that a big portion of the gains for assets held for multiple decades are not real gains inflation increases the price of assets held for longer periods but you are still taxed on the full gain even if it would be a loss when inflation is calculated capital gains are also taxed differently depending on your income level if you are in the 10 or 15 brackets then long term capital gains are assessed at 0 if you are in the 25 28 33 or 35 brackets they are assessed at 15 only those in the 39.6 bracket pay 20 capital assets sold at a profit held for less than a year income from buying and selling any assets such as real estate stock bonds etc that you hold for less than a year before selling after adding up all gains and losses during the year the net gain is taxed as ordinary income collectibles held for more than a year are not considered capital assets and are still taxed at ordinary income rates

one big deciding factor will be what standard of living you want to maintain once you move out   your parents have had years to get raises accumulate savings and establish the standard of living you are used to    regardless of how much you save up now you 'll still have to be living at or below your means once you move out that means that all the expenses you currently have covered by your parents have to come out of something you are currently spending elsewhere   if they can come out of whatever extra money you have now then great   if not you 'll have to re align your budget to align with your income in my experience seeing my friends and i move out this was the biggest issue   those who settled into a new standard of living until their wages went up did fine even the few who moved out at 18 with no savings   those who could n't drop the extra expenses and wanted to continue living at their parent 's standard of living either never left home ended up moving back or ended up massively in debt   we 're only just hitting 30 now so it did n't take long for things to settle out

a simple and low interest loan is probably the least likely to cause aside from a direct gift you seem to be describing an equity stake in their house where some portion of the appreciation in value accrues to you relative to your initial investment   an equity stake in their house probably does n't make much sense   you sound as though you 're not going to do any of the work aside from the contribution of money   equity might make sense as a way to reward you for efforts such as home design or renovation that increase the value of the home   you probably do n't want to be in a position where you are together improving the property and your payback only comes when she sells for more money   what if you have different ideas of how to do it   she has to live there and may want improvements for her needs rather than for buyers   what if she asks you to pay for a portion of the improvement costs or you not offering   what if she does n't want to sell for some reason so your money is locked up with her family choices   renovations can often be stressful so these decisions may be made at difficult times either a gift or a low interest family loan may be simpler for your needs   you can just set the loan terms you want say payoff over 10 years or a deferred payment schedule   if she gets in trouble you could perhaps delay or forgive payments   i do n't know the uk tax consequences of a loan of this nature if any as a general proposition it 's best to set clear and simple expectations at the beginning and avoid agreements that require multiple decisions to be made in the future possibly during a time of stress

so like any market the housing market will on average trend upward but the extreme prices we 're seeing in toronto or san francisco are not part of the normal market growth there 's a lot of factors that can affect housing outside of just increased demand here 's a few of the big ones   1 low interest rates since 2008 i think interests rates have been really low meaning mortgages are really low if you can borrow money at 4 and the inflation rate is 8 you 've borrowed expensive dollars and are paying back in cheap dollars   not in my back yard if you have enough land to build 10 houses or one 100 apartment building what do you build theoretically the apartment building but in reality the people that already paid for their million dollar house do n't want a giant apartment complex bringing down the value of the neighborhood and ruining their views so they pass laws preventing new and bigger buildings meaning higher prices for the homes that already exist and as a bonus it 's easier on the city to have 10 people who make a million dollars a year than a 100 people who make 100,000 a year   foreign investment so there 's a lot of places where people have money but because of corruption or shaky economies it 's not safe to hold it there so you buy properties in the u.s. or canada because you know no one 's going to seize it and it 's generally not going to lose value so you end up with foreign dollars competing with the local markets for housing driving the price up

for example started an animation studio and production developing company to produce something in the ballpark of $ and he had a $ 12k yearly salary i have no clue what you mean as others have mentioned i 'm not sure what the 12 million refers to   do you mean total cost of created by the company in a year or   if so 12 million would amount to say 5 to 20 major brand name tv commercials for example   do you mean the cost of plant so for a tv commercial production company you mean purchasing desks drawing pads and so on your specific example of a film or tv commercial production company is a bad example it 's not really a business that is to say it does not rely on capital and return on capital the way famous film or tv commercial production companies happens is precisely like this a young guy girl g perhaps a designer or is working just as you say for a menial wage at a film company g got that first job perhaps out of art school   g gets a chance at doing a photo shoot animation or helping direct a tv commercial   g does a fantastic job later that year a large important animation or commercial job arrives at the company due to the earlier excellent result g is allowed to work on the new one g again he does a fantastic job   soon within that company g is a highly regarded or director and has attracted fame amongst colleagues and clients eventually g hears of a company xyz hotel that needs a tv ad made or an animation or whatever g says to xyz look you could spend $ 230,000 with a production company and in reality they 'd have me direct it anyway i 'm leaving to work independently so i will do your job for only $ 190,000 in a word xyz says yes and hands over a cheque for $ 190,000   g spends $ 160,000 on the usual actors editing etc and uses 2 months of g 's own time and pockets $ 5000 after tax g then does n't get a job for a couple months and then gets three more in the new year because the commercial for xyz was so good xyz gave him another couple to do for another product line eventually g has just enough money coming in that he hires a few freelance people for a few weeks here and there a and so on   eventually g has enough tv ads solidly booked g can risk actually hiring long time friend p as a producer   p spends most of her time actually bringing in more work and it builds from there eventually you have a very busy well known in the industry tv commercial production company with many staff and endless clients example say it might be at some point in there say around year three g would like to borrow the odd million bucks to basically help with cashflow the answer to that is nothing more than through business contacts g knows a wealthy dentist whoever who is prepared to do that but note carefully that at that point g 's company is already very firmly established famous for doing 20 spectacular commercials and so on   note too that 999 times out of 1000 when this happens the money evaporates and the dentist d never sees a penny back in that case g only much much later once the company has many many staff and great cashflow could the production company actually borrow from a bank or perhaps from actual investors which is more what you have in mind regarding your four categories   numbers 1 and 3 are totally wrong they do not work at all like you are asking indeed the very simple answer is borrow money to start a category 1 or 3 type of business it 's totally the only exception would be if you literally just have an extremely rich uncle who loans you a few million to start an animation studio which would be completely   because in that example company xyz could not care less if you have an animation studio ie your uncle has given you a platinum card and you bought a building some drawing pads and a few dozen macs   xyz just could n't care less   all they care about is your folio of work   in this example rsa would get the job     my guess is you 're thinking people somehow magically go around borrowing money to get businesses like that started   your examples 1 and 3 the simple answer is they do n't and ca n't   your fears are

imo what it seems like you 've done is nothing more than having screened out a company worth further investigation the next step would be a thorough analysis of the company 's past financials and current statements to arrive at your own opinion forecast of the immediate and far future of the company 's prospects   typically this is done by looking at the company 's regulatory filings and maybe some additional searching on comparison businesses   there are many sources of instruction for how one might value or analyze a company or that provide help on reading a balance sheet   this is not an easy skill to learn but it is one that will prove invaluable over a lifetime of investing it is possible that you 'll uncover a deteriorating business where the latest selling and subsequent drop in price that caused the high yield is well deserved   in which case you know to stay away and move on to the next idea on the other hand you might end up confident that the company is not suffering from a drop in sales rise in expenses growing debt payments loss of moat etc   in which case you 've found a great investment candidate   i say candidate because you still may decide this company is n't for you even if the financials are right because you might find better opportunities for an equal or acceptable return at lower risk while you 're researching as to the yield being high when there are no problems with the fundamentals of the business this may simply be because of panic selling during this past few week 's downturn or some other sort of temporary and superficial scare   however be warned that the masses can remain irrational and thus the price stay suppressed or even drop further for longer than you 're willing to wait for your roi   the good news is that in that case you 're being well compensated to wait at a yield

based on your information   the house is $ 130,000 all in this might not be the case   your payment term is 30 years   your interest rate is about   your payments are about $   your total payments will total $   that 's not a very good interest rate for a mortgage but this might be due to poor credit or limited credit history too low income or too much home value being financed or a combination of the above and other factors   northern alabama may not specifically be higher interest rate it might honestly just be you   the reason that you 're paying $ 320,000 is that you 're taking $ 130,000 from a bank and promising to pay it back with interest keep in mind that 's over thirty years that 's a long time and the bank needs to earn enough interest to combat inflation roughly 2 annually generally during that time the bank ca n't invest that money elsewhere return it to depositors etc   a good rule to keep in mind is the rule of 72 it 's a simple trick to determine based on an interest rate how quickly the value of something will double in this case the value of your loan payments if your interest rate was exactly 7.2 this method would calculate 10 years until doubling    in your case 72 = years    now you 're paying off your loan simultaneously which lowers your interest over time so your payments total of loan value at origination that still sucks but remember it 's over a time

this question and your other one indicate you 're a bit unclear on how capital gains taxes work so here 's the deal you buy an asset like shares of stock or a mutual fund   you later sell it for more than you bought it for   you pay taxes on your profit the difference between what you sold it for and what you bought it for   what matters is not the amount of money you withdraw but the prices at which assets are bought and sold in fact often you will be able to choose which individual shares you sell which means you have some control over the tax you pay   for a simple example suppose you buy 10 shares of stock for $ 100 each in january an investment of $ 1000 we 'll call these the early shares   the stock goes up to $ 200 in july and you buy 10 more shares investing an additional $ 2000 we 'll call these the late shares   then the stock drops to $ 150   suppose you want $ 1500 in cash so you are going to sell 10 shares the 10 early shares you bought have increased in value because you bought then for $ 100 but can now sell them for $ 150   the 10 late shares have decreased in value because you bought them for $ 200 but can now only sell them for $ 150   if you choose to sell the early shares you will have a capital gain of $ 500 $ 1500 sale price minus $ 1000 purchase price on which you may owe taxes   if you sell the late shares you will have a capital loss of $ 500 $ 1500 sale price minus $ 2000 purchase price is which you can potentially use to reduce your taxes   or you could sell 5 of each and have no gain or loss selling five early shares for $ 150 gives you a gain of $ 250 but selling five late shares for $ 150 gives you a loss of $ 250 and they cancel out the point of all this is to say that the tax is not determined by the amount of cash you get but by the difference between the sale price and the price you purchased for known as the cost basis and this in turn depends on which specific assets you sell   it is not enough to know the total amount you invested and the total gain   you need to know the specific cost basis i.e. original purchase price of the specific shares you 're selling   this is also the answer to your question about long term versus short term gains   it does n't matter how much money you make on the sale   what matters is how long you hold the asset before selling it that said many brokers will automatically sell your shares in a certain order unless you tell them otherwise and some wo n't let you tell them otherwise   often they will use the first in first out rule which means they will always sell the earliest purchased shares first to finally get to your specific question about betterment they have a page here that says they use a different method   essentially they try to sell your shares in a way that minimizes taxes   they do this by first selling shares that have a loss and only then selling shares that have a gain   this basically means that if you want to cash out $ x and it is possible to do it in a way that incurs no tax liability they will do that what gets me very confused is if i continue to invest random amounts of money each month using betterment then i need to withdraw some cash what are the tax implications   as my long answer above should indicate there is no simple answer to this   the answer is it depends   it depends on exactly when you bought the shares exactly how much you paid for them exactly when and how much the price rose or fell and exactly how much you sell them for   betterment is more or less saying do n't worry about any of this trust us we will handle everything so that your tax is minimized a final note if you really do want to track the details of your cost basis betterment may not be for you because it is an automated platform that may do a lot of individual trades that a human would n't do and that can make tracking the cost basis yourself very difficult   almost the whole point of something like betterment is that you are supposed to give them your money and forget about these details

i do n't have any experience in this but this is my academic understanding of business pricing   the lowest amount a seller would accept is the liquidation value for a b&b what would the value of the land the house the furnishings accounts payable etc be if it had to be sold today minus any liabilities   the amount the seller would like to pay for is going to be a multiple of its annual earnings one example of this is the discounted cash flow analysis you determine the ebitda the earnings a company generated before interest   depreciation taxation and amortization   once you have this amount you can project it out in perpetuity or you use an industry multiplier   perpetuity   you project this value out in discounted by the going interest rate in other words if you project the business will earn $ the business should grow at a 5 rate and the going interest rate is 8 using a growing perpetuity formula one value of a business would be 100,000 .08 = $ 2,000,000   this is a very high number and the seller would love to get it   it 's more common to do a multiple of the you can do some research into the valuation of the particular industry to figure out the multiplier for the industry for example this article suggests that the 2011 ebitda multiplier for hospitality industries is it 's valuing large hotel chains but it 's a start so the value of this b&b would be around $ here is an online sme valuation tool to help with the multiple based valuation also from my research it looks like many small business use seller discretionary earnings   instead of ebitda i do n't know much about it but it seems to serve a similar purpose as ebitda   a potential buyer should request the financial statements of the business for the last few years to determine the value of the business and then can negotiate with the owner a price you would probably want to enlist a broker to help you with the transaction

the reason to put more money down or accept a shorter maximum term is because the bank the deal or fails to sour it in some fashion   for example typically if there is less than 20 down you have to pay an premium called private mortgage insurance which makes it bad deal but i see banks offering the same rate for a mortgage as for a 30-year one and i think fools and their money   take the 30-year and if you feel like it pay more every month   although why you would feel like it i do n't know since it 's very difficult to get that money back if you need it

every bank and credit union in the us has a deposit agreement and disclosures document bank of america is no different our general policy is to make funds from your cash and check deposits    available to you no later   than the first business day after the day    of your deposit however in some cases we place a hold   on funds that    you deposit by check a hold results in a delay in the availability of    these funds that sounds great but for determining the availability of your deposits every day is a    business day except saturdays    and federal holidays    if    you make a deposit on a business day that we are open at one of our    financial centers before    p.m. local time or at one of our atms    before p.m. local time in the state where we   maintain your    account we consider that day to be the day of your deposit however    if you make   a deposit after such times or on a day when we are not    open or that is not a business day we   consider that the deposit was    made on the next business day we are open some locations have     different cutoff times so if you deposit a check on friday afternoon the funds are generally available on tuesday but not always in some cases we will not make all of the funds that you deposit by    check available to you by the   first business day after the day of    your deposit depending on the type of check that you deposit   funds    may not be available until the second business day after the day of    your deposit the first   $ 200 of your deposits however may be    available no later than the first business day after the day   of your    deposit   if we are not going to make all of the funds from your    deposit available by the first business   day after the day of your    deposit we generally notify you at the time you make your deposit we    also tell you when the funds will be available ok what happens when the funds are available in many cases we make funds from your deposited checks available to    you sooner than we   are able to collect the checks this means that    from time to time a deposited check may be   returned unpaid after we    made the funds available to you please keep in mind that even though     we make funds from a deposited check available to you and you withdraw    the funds you are   still responsible for problems with the deposit    if a check you deposited is returned to us unpaid   for any reason you    will have to repay us and we may charge your account for the amount of    the   check even if doing so your account fidelity has a similar document each check deposited is promptly credited to your account   however    the money may not be available until up to six business   days later    and we may decline to honor any debit that is applied   against the    money before the deposited check has cleared if a deposited check does not clear the deposit will be removed   from    your account and you are responsible for returning any   interest you    received on it i would think that the longer holding period for fidelity is due to the fact that they want to wait long enough to make sure that the number of times they have to undo investments due to the funds not clearing is nearly zero

my answer is not specific or even maybe applicable to microsoft companies do n't want to cut dividends so they have a fixed expense but the cashflow that funds it might be quite or cyclical depending on the industry another more general issue is that taking on debt to retire shares is a capital allocation decision a company needs capital to operate this is why they went public in the first place to raise capital debt is a cheaper form of capital than equity equity holders are last in line in a bankruptcy bondholders are at the front of the line to compensate for this equity holders require a larger return often called a hurdle rate so why does n't a company just use cheaper equity and no debt some do but consider that equity holders participate in the earnings where bondholders just get the interest nothing more and because lenders do n't participate in the potential upside they introduce conditions debt covenants to help control their downside exposure for a company it 's a balance very much the same as personal finances a reasonable amount of debt provides low cost capital which can be used to produce greater returns but too much debt and the covenants are breached the debt is called due immediately there 's no cash to cover and bankruptcy a useful measure if a bit difficult to calculate is a company 's cost of capital and the return on that capital cost of capital is a blended number taking both equity and debt into account good companies earn a return that is greater than their cost of capital seems obvious but many companies do n't succeed at this in cases where this is persistent the best move for shareholders would be for the company to dissolve and return all the capital unfortunately as in the railroad tycoon example above managers incentives are n't always well aligned with shareholders and they allocate capital in ways advantageous to themselves and not the company

of course you do n't have to pay them you just might not like the result as a matter of law given that i am not a lawyer i am not aware of any requirement for a company to pay employees business related expenses an example might be having a cell phone and according to this article companies are n't required to pay for you to have a cell phone even if they require you have one and use it as part of your employment the primary areas where law does exist relates to company uniforms with a logo in a very limited number of us states and necessary personal safety equipment in california and maybe only few other states all other tool requirements for a job are not prohibited by law so long as they are not illegally discriminatory such as requiring people of a certain race or sex to buy something but no one else etc so a company can require all sorts of things from having an internet connection to cell phone to laptop to specialty tools and equipment of all sorts and they are even allowed to deduct the cost of some things from your pay just so long as you still get paid minimum wage after the deductions with all that said the company 's previous payments of fees and willingness to pay a monthly internet fee does not them to pay other fees too such as moving installation etc they may even decide to no longer provide internet service at their expense and just require you to provide it as a condition of employment you can insist on it with your employer and if you do n't have an employment contract that forbids it they can fire you or possibly even deduct it from your pay anyway and this reason might not be one that allows you to collect unemployment insurance benefits but you 'd need to check with an expert on that you can refuse to pay at&t directly and they can cancel the internet service and your employer can then do the same as in the previous condition or you can choose to pay it or ask your employer to split the cost over a few checks if it is rather high and that 's about it like the cost of anything else you have to pay   from your own food to your computer clothes etc it 's best to just consider it your own cost of doing business and decide if it 's still in your interest to keep working there and for something to consider in future pay negotiations you may also qualify for an itemized employee business expense deduction from the irs but you 'll need to read the requirements carefully and get keep a receipt for such expenses

there are cases in which some lease agreements will allow you to exit them without charge but you can not simply a location without paying cases that would allow you to leave the lease if they are stated within the lease are usually for reasons like if you can prove that you have a job that is over a certain distance from the place you are currently residing in there may be a clause that would allow you to break you lease or simply the landlord may be more willing to allow you to go if situations have changed and conditions are now such that you can not safely live in the place you may be able to break the lease   if you have a copy of your lease look for these clauses or others near the end that 's where they appear in mine   there are also other situations where if you give sufficient notice and have been a long time tenant breaking a lease may be only a small fee certainly worth looking into rather than facing any legal recourse

i think you have to go back to this without prosperity to really understand   tldr buybacks boost ceo pay and hurt the long term value of companies but i 'm not convinced that they 're the root of inequality    consider the companies in the s&amp;p 500 index that were publicly listed from 2003 through 2012 during that period those companies used 54 of their earnings a total of $ 2.4 trillion to buy back their own stock almost all through purchases on the open market dividends absorbed an additional 37 of their earnings that left very little for investments in productive capabilities or higher incomes for employees   why are such massive resources being devoted to stock repurchases corporate executives give several reasons which i will discuss later but none of them has close to the explanatory power of this simple truth stock based instruments make up the majority of their pay and in the short term buybacks drive up stock prices   trillions of dollars that could have been spent on innovation and job creation in the u.s. economy over the past three decades have instead been used to buy back shares for what is effectively stock price manipulation   most are now done on the open market and my research shows that they often come at the expense of investment in productive capabilities and consequently are n’t great for long term shareholders   research by the academic industry research network a nonprofit i and lead shows that companies that do buybacks never resell the shares at higher prices   many academics have warned that if u.s. companies do n’t start investing much more in research and manufacturing capabilities they can not expect to remain competitive in a range of advanced technology industries   specific examples   pharmaceutical drugs   in response to complaints that u.s. drug prices are at least twice those in any other country pfizer and other u.s. pharmaceutical companies have argued that the profits from these high prices enabled by a generous intellectual property regime and lax price regulation permit more r&amp;d to be done in the united states than elsewhere yet from 2003 through 2012 pfizer funneled an amount equal to 71 of its profits into buybacks and an amount equal to 75 of its profits into dividends in other words it spent more on buybacks and dividends than it earned and tapped its capital reserves to help fund them the reality is americans pay high drug prices so that major pharmaceutical companies can boost their stock prices and pad executive pay     intel executives have long lobbied the u.s. government to increase spending on research in 2005 intel ’s then ceo craig r. argued that it will take a massive coordinated u.s. research effort involving academia industry and state and federal governments to ensure that america continues to be the world leader in information technology yet from 2001 when the u.s. government launched the national initiative through 2013 intel ’s expenditures on buybacks were almost four times the total budget

i think you 're asking yourself the wrong question the real question you should be asking yourself is this   do i want to a give my parents a $ 45,000 gift b make them $ 45,000    loan or c neither the way you are talking in your question is as if you have the responsibility and authority to manage their lives whether they choose bankruptcy and the associated stigma and/or negative self image of financial or moral failure or choose to muddle through and delay retirement to pay off their debt is their question and their decision    look you said that loaning it to them was out because you 'd rather see them retire than continue to work but what if they want to continue to work for all the stress they 're dealing with now entrepreneurial people like that are not happy   you 're about in their lives like you can run it stop it you do n't have the right they 're adults there may come a time when they are too to be responsible for themselves and then you can and should step up and take responsibility for them in their old age just as they did for you when you were a child but that time is not now and by the way from the information you 've given the answer should be c neither if giving or loaning them this kind of money taps you out then you ca n't afford it

short answer liquidity well you have to see it from an exchange 's point of view   every contract they put up is a liability to them   you have to allocate resources for the order book the matching engine the clearing etc   but only if the contract is actually trading they start earning the big money now for every new expiry they engage a long term commitment and it might take years for an option chain to be widely accepted and hence before they 're profitable   compare the volumes and open interests of big chains versus the weeklies and you 'll find that weeklies can still be considered illiquid compared to their monthly cousins having said that like many things this is just a question of demand   if there 's a strong urge to trade july weeklies one day there will be an option chain   but personally i think as long as there are the summer there will be no rush to ask for jul and aug chains

discount brokers come and go they tend to come with ridiculously cheap prices and they go when they fail to gain traction or raise their prices at which point they can be undercut by a new player some brokers are nicer to people with more money while others cater to small traders on simple low commissions no matter which broker you choose you are n't liable to make much money doing frequent trades with a small account you either risk most of your money on every trade or several small trades get by commissions it is understandable that you want to pay less given the disadvantages of a small account   usaa etc have each been reasonable options in the < $ 4 a trade range many websites will give you a list of the top discount brokers of the year as with any heavy deal that is too good to be true find reputable referrals from people who use the service and complaints from customers who have been burned

the short of it is that bonds are valued based on a fundamental concept of finance called the time value of money stated simply $ 100 one year from now is not the same as $ 100 now if you had $ 100 now you could use it to make more money and have more than $ 100 in a year conversely if you did n't invest it the $ 100 would not buy as much in a year as it would now and so it would lose real value therefore for these two benefits to be worth the same the money received a year from now must be more than $ 100 in the amount of what you could make with $ 100 if you had it now or at least the rate of inflation or the amount received now could be less than the amount recieved a year from now such that if you invested this lesser amount you 'd expect to have $ 100 in a year the simplest bonds simply pay their face value at maturity and are sold for less than their face value the difference being the cost to borrow the cash interest these are called zero coupon bonds and they 're around if maybe uncommon the price people will pay for these bonds is their present value and the difference between the present value and face value determines a yield a rate of return similar to the interest rate on a cd now zero coupon bonds are uncommon because they cost a lot if i buy a zero coupon bond i 'm basically tying up my money until maturity i see nothing until the full bond is paid as such i would expect the bond issuer to sell me the bond at a rate that makes it worth my while to keep the money tied up so basically the bond issuer is paying me compound interest on the loan the future value of an investment now at a given rate is given by fv = to gain $ 1 million in new cash today and pay a 5 yield over 10 years a company or municipality would have to issue $ million in bonds you see the effects of the compounding there the company is paying 5 a year on the principal each year plus 5 of each 5 already accrued adding up to an additional 12 of the principal owed as interest instead bond issuers can offer a coupon bond a coupon bond has a coupon rate which is a percentage of the face value of the bond that is paid periodically often annually sometimes semi annually or even quarterly a coupon rate helps a company in two ways first the calculation is very straightforward if you need a million dollars and are willing to pay 5 over 10 years then that 's exactly how you issue the bonds $ worth with a 5 coupon rate and a maturity date 10 years out a $ 100 5 coupon bond with a 10-year maturity if sold at face value would cost only $ 150 over its lifetime making the total cost of capital only 50 of the principal instead of 62 now that sounds like a bad deal if the company 's paying less then you 're getting less right well yes but you also get money sooner remember the fundamental principle here money now is worth more than money later because of what you can do with money between now and later you do realize a lower overall yield from this investment but you get returns from it quickly which you can turn around and reinvest to make more money as such you 're usually willing to tolerate a lower rate of return because of the faster turnaround and thus the higher present value the income yield from your table is also referred to as the flat yield it is a very crude measure a simple function of the coupon rate the current quote price and the face value r p v for the first bond in your list the flat yield is 100 = this is a very simple measure that is roughly analogous to what you would expect to make on the bond if you held it for one year collected the coupon payment and then sold the bond for the same price you 'd earn one coupon payment at the end of that year and then recoup the principal the actual present value calculation for a period of 1 year is pv = which to r = fv pv 1 plug in the values present value future value and you get exactly the same result this is crude and inaccurate because in one year the bond will be a year closer to maturity and will return one less coupon payment therefore at the same rate of return the present value of the remaining payout of the bond will only be $ which makes a lot of sense if you think about it the bond will only pay out $ 112 if you bought it a year from now so why would you pay $ 114 for it another measure not seen in the list is the simple apy quite simply it is the yield that will be realized from all cash flows from the bond all coupon payments plus the face value of the bond as if all those cash flows happened at maturity this is calculated using the future value formula fv = pv where fv is the future value the sum of the face value and all coupon payments to be made before maturity pv is present value the current purchase price r is the annual rate which we 're solving for n is the number of times interest accrues and/or is paid for an annual coupon that 's 1 and t is the number of years to maturity for the first bond in the list the simple apy is this is the effective compound interest rate you would realize if you bought the bond and then took all the returns and stuffed them in a mattress until maturity since nobody does this with investment returns it 's not very useful but it can be used to compare the yield on a zero coupon bond to the yield on a coupon bond if you treated both the same way or to compare a coupon bond to a cd or other compound interest bearing account that you planned to buy into and not touch for its lifetime the yield to maturity which is seen is the true yield percentage of the bond in time valued terms assuming you buy the bond now hold it to maturity and all coupon payments are made on time and reinvested at a similar yield this calculation is based on the simple apy but takes into account the fact that most of the coupon payments will be made prior to maturity the present value of these will be higher because they happen sooner the ytm is calculated by summing the present values of all payments based on when they 'll occur so you 'll get one $ 4 payment a year from now then another $ 4 in two years then $ 4 in 3 years and $ 104 at maturity the present value of each of those payments is calculated by flipping around the future value formula pv = the present value of the entire bond its current price is the sum of the present value of each payment = + + + you now have to solve for r which is difficult to isolate the easiest way to find the rate with a computer is to goal seek intelligently guess and check   based on the formula above i calculated a ytm of for the first bond if you bought on sept 7 2012 and thus missed the upcoming coupon payment buying today you 'd also be entitled to about 5 weeks worth of the coupon payment that is due on sept 07 2012 which is close enough to the present day that the discounted value is a rounding error putting the ytm of the bond right at this is the rate of return you 'll get off of your investment if you are able to take all the returns from it when you receive them and reinvest them at a similar rate similar to having a savings account at that rate or being able to buy fractional shares of a mutual fund giving you that rate

in general stock markets are very similar to that however you can also put in limit orders to say that you will only buy or sell at a given price these sit in the market for a specified length of time and will be executed when an order arrives that matches the price or better traders who set limit orders are called liquidity or price makers as they provide liquidity i.e. volume to be traded to be filled later if there is no counterparty i.e. buyer to your seller in the market a market maker a large bank or brokerage who is licensed and regulated to do so will fill your order at some price that price is based on how much volume i.e. trading there is in that stock on average this is called average daily volume adv and is calculated over varying periods of time we use which is the 30 day average you can always sell stocks for whatever price you like privately but a market order does not allow you to set your price you are a price taker therefore that kind of order will always fill at a market price as mentioned above limit orders will not fill until the price is hit but will stay on book as long as they are n't filled expired or cancelled

it 's important because it shows that the amount you owe does not decrease linearly with each payment and you gain equity as a correspondingly slower rate at the beginning of the loan and faster at the end this has to be figured in when considering refinancing or when you sell the place and pay off the mortgage it also shows why making extra payments toward principal if your loan permits doing so is so advantageous unlike a normal payment that lowers the whole curve by a notch reducing the length of time over which interest is due and thus saving you money in the long run possible lost costs of course

this bbc article says that nuclear power notes came about when the french energy company edf purchased british energy in 2008 the note changes in value with wholesale energy prices and power output levels from british energy 's existing nuclear stations edf energy 's website describes these notes under the section titled nuclear power notes when edf acquired british energy in january 2009 nuclear power notes were issued to british energy shareholders who chose to take them in lieu of 74 pence of cash per british energy share held the nuclear power notes are ten year financial instruments 2009 2019 which give ex british energy shareholders a continuing interest in the edf energy nuclear generation fleet they are traded on the securities derivatives exchange formerly known as the plus quoted exchange    each year a pre defined calculation is performed to determine whether any cash will be paid to nuclear power note holders the calculation is dependent on the nuclear output of the edf energy nuclear generation fleet eligible nuclear output and market power prices power prices this calculation may or may not result in a cash payment each year to nuclear power note holders the are figures you see are measures of watt hours i.e. energy output the value of nuclear power notes is tied to this output looking at the most recent statement june 2013 you can see a line that looks like this month ahead price in respect of july 2013 gbp which is an energy spot price for the output of the nuclear plants i 'm not entirely sure of the relationship between this and the payment to shareholders but if you look at the 2012 yearly payment calculation notice on the same page you 'll see this in the first section a the yearly payment for the period 1 january 2012 to 31 december 2012 the    relevant year payable in respect of each on 31 january 2013 shall be zero the payments were also zero for 2010 and 2011 the 2009 calculation notice however states that a the yearly payment for the period 1 january 2009 to 31 december 2009 the relevant year payable in respect of each on 31 january 2010 shall be pence stated to 6 decimal places i presume that payment would have appeared in whatever account holds these notes e.g. your brokerage account technically the financial statements above refer to a contingent value rights instrument which is a derivative linked to the nuclear power notes this site sums it up better than i can the british energy were created by the issue of nuclear power notes to the target ’s shareholders who opted to take up this alternative the were issued by barclays bank plc and were linked to guaranteed contingent value rights instruments that were issued to barclays by edf ’s acquisition vehicle lake acquisitions and which were ultimately guaranteed by edf energy plc lake barclays is required to make yearly payments to for 10 years the amount of which is limited to the corresponding amount paid by lake acquisitions to barclays for the lake basically there is a chain of payments through these derivatives that eventually links back to nuclear energy output

it all depends on your loan contract and the way most are written the 10 day thing will not help   however assuming that the contract is written in such a way to allow this the difference will be negligible by saving money i assume you mean the amount of interest paid    there is really two ways of doing this   if you carry the loan to term paying the indicated amount on the due date you will pay $ in interest   an increase of over 33 to the cost of the car   yikes that is a lot of money    you should seek to minimize your interest expense    one way to do this is to reduce your rate   applying for a new loan that is at a more reasonable 6 and continuing to pay the per month will reduce the term to 59 months and only cost you $ in interest   a large savings    even better is to work a second job and earn an extra 1,000 per month   then bundle it with your payment and shoot that at the loan   this way you will only pay $ in interest and have it paid off in a year   once you do that you can stick $ 300/month or so in a savings account or other investment and pay for every other car in cash   making choices like these leads to building wealth   so the question becomes do you want to spend the rest of your life on the wheel of car payments or do you want to spend one year in pain so you make smart choices in the future   the choice is yours

well it would appear that you had a wash sale that canceled out a loss position   without seeing the entire report i could n't tell you exactly what was happening or how you triggered 1091   but just from the images it appears as though your purchase of stock was layered into multiple tranches perhaps you acquired more of the stock in the period than you sold possibly because of a prior holding    if in the period around the sale of stock 30 days before and 30 days after you also acquire the same stock including by contract or option then it out your loss   if you held your stock for a while then in a period bought more and sold some then any loss would be washed out by the acquisition   of course it is also a wash sale if your purchase of the stock follows your sale rather than it   your disallowed loss goes into the basis of your stock holding so will be meaningful when you do have a true economic sale of that stock from irs pub 550 a wash sale occurs when you sell or trade stock or securities at a loss and within 30 days before or after the sale you buy substantially identical stock or securities acquire substantially identical stock or securities in a fully taxable trade acquire a contract or option to buy substantially identical stock or securities or acquire substantially identical stock for your individual retirement account ira or roth ira if you sell stock and your spouse or a corporation you control buys substantially identical stock you also have a wash sale looking at your account images we can see a number of positions sold at a loss sale proceeds less than basis but each one is adjusted to a zero loss   i suspect the fuller picture of your account history and portfolio will show a more complicated and longer history with this particular stock   that is likely the source of the wash sale disallowed loss you might be able to confirm that all the added numbers are appearing in your current basis in this stock or were reflected upon your final exit from the stock

the answer is mathematics let 's say you have $ 100 capital to invest with with a mortgage with a unit trust assuming you do n't put in borrowed money 5 growth on the property is $ 25 but a $ 25 profit on a unit trust requires 25 growth well that 's assuming zero interest and zero fees let 's say interest is 3 but so are trust fees a property now requires 8 growth for $ 25 profit in a year where a unit trust now requires 29 growth for $ 25 profit which one is more likely the above calculations do n't take in to consideration all associated costs and is obviously exaggerated but it shows the answer is not black and white but is instead just mathematics on a bunch of variables debt is n't a bad thing so do n't be afraid of using debt with debt you can borrow more to invest having a fully paid off house is not a good investment if some of that equity could be earning you more else where if the math makes sense

you are looking for the internal rate of return if you have a spreadsheet like microsoft excel you can simply put in a list of the transactions every time money went in or out and their dates and the spreadsheet 's xirr function will calculate a percentage rate of return here 's a simple example investment 1 was 100,000 which is now worth so it 's made about 5 per year investment 2 is much more complicated money was going in and out but the internal rate of return was 7 so money in that investment on average grew faster than money in the first investment

your calculations are correct it is likely that the bank 's software has a rounding error   in effect either your bank is overstating your interest by eight cents per month or your bank is insisting that you prepay your principal by eight cents per month   if the bank 's ongoing interest calculations are correct your final payment will be slightly smaller because of the prepaid principal and because of compound interest on those prepayments   i have performed similar calculations for my mortgages over the years and except upon early payoff in the middle of the month i have always matched my banks calculations to the penny   ironically this means that my banks formulas are a bit weird after making these adjustments even my calculations for the mid month payoff matched to the penny

a couple ways but its not a guarantee   you have to have special charts instead of each tick being 1 min 5 min or whatever it is a set number of trades say 2000 since retail investors only buy and sell in small amounts there will be small volume per tick an institutional investor however would have a much much higher trade lot size even if using an algo thus large volume spikes in such a chart would signal institutional activity over retail similarly daily charts showing average trade size can help you pick out when institutional activity is highest as they have much larger trade sizes you could also learn how the algos work and look for evidence one is being used ie every time price hits vwap a large sell order goes through would indicate an institutional investor is selling especially if it happens multiple times in a row

this is a gross simplification as there are a few different ways to do this the principle overall is the same though to short a stock you borrow x shares from a third party and sell them at the current price you now owe the lender x shares but have the proceeds from the sale if the share price falls you can buy back those shares at the new lower price return them to the lender and pocket the difference the risk comes when the share price goes the other way you now owe the lender the new value of the shares so have to find some way to cover the difference this happened a while back when porsche made a fortune buying shares in volkswagen from short sellers and the price unexpectedly rose

any business like any household has items that are wasted unlike a household a business does keep track of all items that are depending on the reason for the item being they are accounted for differently items that can be returned to the manufacturer are done so and the business is given credit for that item for the business the time spent processing stocking and that item plus any time spent handling a return for that customer is harder to track if they see the percentage of bad items is too large compared to sales they will want to address this with the manufacturer items that are spoiled by the business which will include spoiled food items will also be tracked they will examine their choice of products their procedures for those products and the quantities produced to try an minimize the spoilage they do n't just throw the items away they keep track of the exact items and their worth when they have to dispose of meat that has reached their sell by date they will actually scan the items into the computer   in some cases products can be transformed into other products bread into bread in other situations they are reduced for quick sale in other cases they are donated to a charity or food kitchen all of this is also tracked of course any losses that the company ca n't recover by returning items to manufactures or will be reflected in the price of their items stores that can minimize their waste can offer lower prices

how to use your shares if you own common shares in a company as opposed to a fund then you have the right but not the obligation to one vote per share on questions put before the shareholders usually this occurs once a year usually these questions regard approval of auditors sometimes they involve officers such as directors on the board you will be mailed a form to fill out and mail back in   preferred shares usually are not voting shares but common shares always are   by the way i do not recommend owning shares in companies i recommend funds instead either etfs or mutual funds owning shares in companies puts you at risk of a failure of that company owning funds spreads that risk around thus reducing your exposure   there are really two purposes for owning shares 1 owning shares gives you the right to declared dividends 2 owning shares allows you to sell those shares at some time in the future hopefully at a profit   one obscure thing you can do with owned shares is to write sell covered put options but options are not something that you need to concern yourself with at this point   you may find it useful to sign up for a free daily email from

during a stock split the only thing that changes is the number of shares outstanding   typically a stock splits to lower its price per share   sometimes if a company 's value is falling it will do a reverse split where x shares will be exchanged for y shares   this is typically done to avoid being de listed from an exchange if the price per share falls below a certain threshold usually $ 1   again the only thing changing is the number of shares outstanding   a 20 for 1 reverse split means for every 20 shares outstanding the shareholder will be granted one new share example x co. has 1,000,000 shares outstanding for a price of $ 100 per share   it does a 1 for 10 split   now there are 10,000,000 shares outstanding for a price of $ 10 per share example y co has 1,000,000 shares outstanding for a price of $ 1 per share   it does a 10 for 1 reverse split   now there are 100,000 shares outstanding for a price of $ 10 quickly looking at the news for it looks like it a 20 for 1 reverse split   you should probably look at your statements and ask your broker how the arithmetic worked in your case investopedia links for reverse stock split and stock split

it has little to do with money or finance   it 's basic neuroscience   when we get money our brains release read your money and your brain and receiving dividends is getting money   it feels good so we 're more likely to do it again what you often see are because the above explanation sounds irrational so many people want to make their behavior look more rational   ceteris paribus a solid growth stock is as good as a solid company that pays dividends in value investing terms dividend paying stocks may appear to give you an advantage in that you can keep the dividends in cash and buy when the price of the security is low underpriced   however as you realize you could just sell the growth stock at certain prices and the effect would be the same assuming you 're using a free brokerage like robin hood you can easily sell just a portion of the shares periodically to get a    stream of cash like dividends that presents no problem whatsoever    so this can not be the explanation to why some people think it is    smart to be a dividend investor yes if you 're using a brokerage like robin hood there may be others but i think this is the only one right now then you are right on

concerning the general problem of short selling and the need to borrow shares to complete the transaction selling short is a cash transaction   unlike a futures contract where a short seller is entering into a legal agreement to sell something in the future in the case of short selling a share the buyer of the share is taking immediate delivery and is therefore entitled to all of the benefits and rights that come with share ownership   in particular the buyer of the shares is entitled to any dividends payable and where applicable to vote on motions at   if the short seller has not borrowed the shares to sell then buyer of non existent shares will have none of the rights associated with ownership the cash market is based on the idea of matching buyers and sellers   it does not accommodate people making promises consider that to allow short sellers to sell shares they have not borrowed opens up the possibility of the aggregate market selling more shares than actually exist   this would lead to all sorts of problematic consequences such as heavily distorting the price of the underlying share   if everyone is selling shares they have not borrowed willy nilly then it will drive the price of the share down much to the disadvantage of existing share holders in this case short sellers who have sold shares they have not already borrowed would be paying out more in dividends to the buyers than the total dividends being paid out by the underlying company there are instruments that allow for short selling of shares on a futures basis   one example is a cfd = contract for difference   in the case of cfds sellers are obliged to pay dividends to buyers as well as other   costs related to financing edit regarding your comment note that borrowing shares is not a market transaction   your account does not show you buying a share and then selling it   it simply shows you selling a share short   the borrowing is the result of an agreement between yourself and the lender and this agreement is off market   you do not actually pay the lender for the shares but you do pay financing costs for the borrowing so long as you maintain your short position edit i realise that i have not actually read your question correctly   you are not actually talking about naked short selling   you are talking about selling shares you already own in a hope of maintaining both a long and short position gross   the problem with this approach is that you must deliver the shares to the buyer   otherwise ask yourself what shares is the buyer actually buying if you want the bought shares to remain in your account if you are not going to deliver your long position shares then you will need to borrow the shares you are selling short for the reasons i have outlined above

make a list of all your expenses i use an excel spreadsheet but you can do it on the back of a napkin if you prefer list fixed expenses like rent loan payments insurance etc i include giving to church and charity as fixed expenses but of course that 's up to you list regular but not fixed expenses like food heat and electricity gas etc come up with reasonable average or typical values for these keep records for at least a few months so you 're not just guessing though remember that some will vary with the season presumably you spend a lot more on heat in the winter than in the summer etc you should budget to put something into savings and retirement if you 're young and just starting out it 's easy to decide to postpone retirement savings but the sooner you start the more the money will add up even if you ca n't put away a lot try to put away something and if you budget for it you should just get used to not having this money to play with then total all this up and compare to your income if the total is more than your income you have a problem you need to find a way to cut some expenses i wo n't go any further with that thought that 's another subject hopefully you have some money left over after paying all the regular expenses that 's what you have to play with for entertainment and other non essentials make a schedule for paying your bills i get paid twice a month and so i pay most of my bills when i get a paycheck i have some bills that i allocate to the first check of the month and some to the second for others whatever bills came in since my last check i pay with the current check i have it arranged so each check is big enough to pay all the bills that come from that check if you ca n't do that if you 'll have a surplus from one check and a shortage from the next then be sure to put money aside from the surplus check to cover the bills you 'll pay at the next pay period   always pay your bills before you spend money on entertainment always have a plan to pay your bills do n't say oh i 'll come up with the money somehow if you have debt student loans car loans etc have a plan to pay it off one of the most common traps people fall into is saying i really need to get out of debt and i 'm going to start paying off my debt next month because this month i really want to buy this way cool toy they put off getting out of debt until they have away huge amounts of money on interest or worse they keep accumulating new debt until they ca n't even pay the interest

depends what kind of expenses you intend to use this money for if you plan to buy housing in the future eg you 're saving a deposit then you need to ensure that the value does n't deteriorate relative to the value of the housing you are likely to buy so you could buy a residential reit or buy some investment property if you expect to use this money for food then you should buy suitable assets eg wheat futures etc link the current asset to the future expense and you will be fine if you buy gold then you are making a bet that gold will retain its value compared to the thing you want to purchase in future it does n't matter what the price of gold does in $ us

common sentiment that no investor can consistently beat the market on returns   i guess its more like very few investor can beat the market a vast majority can not do not what evidence exists for or against this obviously we can have a comparison of all investors if we start taking a look at some of the actively managed funds given that fund managers are experts compared to common individual investors if we compare this we can potentially extend it more generically to others most funds beat the markets for few years as you keep increasing the timeline i.e. try seeing 10 year 15 year 20 year return this is easy the data is available you would realize that no fund consistently beat the index few years quite good few years quite bad on average most funds were below market returns especially if one compares on longer terms or 10 20 years hence the perception of course we all know warren buffet has beat the market by leaps and bounds after the initial success people like warren buffet develop the power of self fulfilling prophecy there would be many other individuals

if you engage in any kind of dangerous activity the training courses will often state that an accident is not the result of a simple error   examples of this include and motorcycle training   properly maintained equipment and training will mitigate many emergencies   recently my dive buddy was 60 down and ran out of air due to a tank o ring failure   she did not panic and all of the dive team rallied to get her to the surface without anyone getting hurt or even coming close to it financial are similar   in some cases a single event triggers an avalanche of events that leads to tragedy   for example hard economic times may lead to an employer doing 5 pay cuts across the board   however they also cut bonuses and other ancillary pay items   this leads to a real cut of 20 25 of income   leading a true cash flow emergency   as such cutbacks are needed and this might put a strain on an already shaky relationship this leads to that relationship ending requiring more cash   perhaps a car dies in this process or some household item needs repairing   sure one can borrow money but this tends to the avalanche rather than solve it     having a low debt and a liquid emergency fund stops the avalanche in its tracks in the case cited above issues would have been solved if the person lived off of 50 of their income rather than the way most people live paycheck to paycheck   also if there were savings for the car repair then that becomes a pain but not a true stress think of a liquid emergency fund as properly maintained equipment   it allows you to build a financial life on a solid foundation    in my own case i attempted to live and invest without an emergency fund   it just did not work   i often had to liquidate investments at in opportune times and could never really hold onto money   with the foundation of an emergency fund one can build a prosperous life for one 's self you are welcome to try it your way but if you fall hopefully you will remember this answer and build your foundation first

the idea of self regulating free markets is every bit of a naive utopian idea as anything karl marx ever wrote   people who wish to limit the government have the best interests of corporations at heart   that is why there are vast sums of money behind libertarian groups like the tea party     there will always be corruption in government just as there will never be truly free markets   that is why our founding fathers set up multiple branches of government with all the checks and balances   things are broken right now because the american people have lost faith in our government     what we need is for a true patriotic spirit to return to the american people not this unproductive flag waving nationalism

the one thing that i saw in here that raised a big red flag is that you said you overpaid on your interest   always make sure you tell them that any extra money should be applied to principal only not to interest   you accrue interest based on your outstanding principal amount so getting that lower reduces the overall amount of interest you end up paying   paying the interest ahead saves you nothing   however make sure you pay the current interest owed that month they can capitalize past due interest in affect change that to be considered an addition to the loan principal amount and you end up paying interest on the interest

i think what you 're asking is   can i buy 1000 shares of the stock at $ 1   for $ 1000    it goes up to $ 2 then sell 500 shares of the stock with proceeds of $ 1000 now    having my original $ 1000 out of it and still owning 500 shares     and that not create a taxable event since all i    did was take my cost basis back out and did n't collect any gains    and then i want to repeat that over and over nope not in the usa anyway    each sale is a separate taxable event the first sale will have proceeds of $ 1000 and a cost basis of $ 500 with $ 500 of capital gains and taxes owed at the time of that sale the remaining stock will have a cost basis of $ 500 and proceeds of whatever you sell it for in the future the next batch of stock will have a cost basis of whatever you pay for it    the only thing that works anything like the way you 're thinking is a roth ira    you can put your cost basis in pull it back out and put it back in again all tax free    but every time your cost basis cycles in that counts your contribution limits unless you do it fast enough to call it a rollover

here 's another attempt at explanation it 's basically because are flat at the bottom let me explain   as you might know the variance of the log stock price in black scholes is t in other words variance of the log stock price is linear in time to expiry now that means that the standard deviation of your log stock price is square root in time this is consequential   for normally distributed random variables in 68 of cases we end up within one standard deviation so basically we expect our log stock price to be within something something times square root of t. so if your stock has a vol of 16 it 'll be plus minus 32 in 4 years plus minus 16 for one year plus minus 8 for 3 m plus minus 4 for weeks and plus minus 1 for a business day as you see the decay is slow at first but much more rapid as we get closer   how does the square root function look it 's a sideways as we come closer to zero the slope of the square root function goes to infinity that is related to the fact that brownian motion is almost surely no where differentiable it just shoots off with infinite slope returning immediately of course another way of looking at it is the old traders rule of thumb that an at the money option is worth approximately s 0.4 vol just do a taylor expansion of black scholes again you have the square root of time to expiry in there and as outlined above as we get closer to zero the square root drops slowly at first and then precipitously

last week barack obama went to kansas to kick off a more populist phase in his 2012 re election bid this is a make or break moment for the middle class declared the us president who chose the same venue that roosevelt used in 1910 to call for a new progressive era i believe that this country succeeds when everyone gets a fair shot   saying everyone should get a fair shot always makes political sense particularly at a time when us income inequality rivals that of mark ’s age but it might have been a stretch for mr obama to suggest the american middle class is facing a unique make or break moment in reality the labour force has been for most of the past generation in a trend that has sharply accelerated since 2000   america used to be exceptional it maintained lower unemployment than the europeans and a higher rate of jobs turnover enabling it to get away with more benefits a fair day ’s work for a fair day ’s pay was within the grasp of most that gave america a booming middle class that until recently was the most important engine of global demand   no longer today somewhat remarkably us is higher than in much of europe and the us consumer is mired in high personal debt as the jobs crisis so too does us political allegations of class warfare are a staple of washington debate in contrast to the 1960s dominated by protests for peace and civil rights today ’s battles are economic yet there are few signs that either policymakers or economists are closer to finding answers nothing mr obama has been able to accomplish since 2008 including off a second great depression and pushing through an overhaul of the healthcare system appears to have resolved that underlying structural challenge indeed the signs are that the problem is in the words of david a leading labour economist at harvard university the labour force is suffering from a growing missing middle   in short the middle skilled jobs that once formed the of the world ’s wealthiest middle class are disappearing they are being supplanted by relatively low skilled and low paid jobs that can not be replaced either by new technology or by offshoring such as home nursing and landscape gardening jobs are also being created for the highly skilled notably in science engineering and management for the remainder of the workforce including college graduates it is both increasingly hard to find a secure job and tougher for those who do find jobs to be paid in line with inflation most people know that median us income has declined sharply since the late 1990s fewer are aware that real incomes also fell sharply in the same period for those with degrees only those with qualifications particularly phds saw net gains for some spectacular   the jobs crisis has many worrying of which three are worth highlighting perhaps the most troublesome is the waning of the market people used to describe the us labour market as after the austrian economist who depicted the cycle of creative destruction jobs might be lost rapidly in a downturn but were swiftly to more productive sectors when economic growth that is not now the case

you also need to remember that stock options usually become valueless if not exercised while an employee of the company   so if there is any chance that you will leave the company before an ipo the effective value of the stock options is zero   that is the safest and least risky valuation of the stock options    with a google or facebook stock options can be exercised and immediately sold as they are publicly traded   in fact they may give stock grants where you sell part of the grant to pay tax withholding   you can then sell the remainder of the grant for money at any time even after you leave the company   you only need the option grant to vest to take advantage of it   valuing these at face value current stock price makes sense   that 's at least a reasonable guess of future value    if you are absolutely sure that you will stay with the company until the ipo then valuing the stock based on earnings can make sense   a ten million dollar profit can justify a hundred million dollar ipo market capitalization easily   divide that by the number of shares outstanding and multiply by how many you get   if anything that gives you a conservative estimate    i would still favor the big company offers though   as i said they are immediately tradeable while this offer is effectively contingent on the ipo   if you leave before then you get nothing   if they delay the ipo you 're stuck   you ca n't leave the company until then without sacrificing that portion of your compensation   that seems a big commitment to make

interest rates are near 0 and the banks are very risk adverse right now so they sit on reserves instead of lending them out   there is a very significant reason actually a couple that the banks are sitting on reserves   1 the large banks have huge derivative exposure and huge potential losses and anyone who denies that has apparently been hiding under a rock and missed the news of while the reserves held are not enough to cover all of those potential derivative losses nor do they have to the bankers are uncertain of what their real exposure is and so they want to and indeed are probably being told to hold onto enough to prevent a catastrophic insolvency situation   2 the fed is paying interest on excess reserves likewise this is no secret this serves a two fold purpose of making the banks appear to be solvent even in the face of potentially huge derivative exposure and secondarily it is a way to gift the banks with money known as them   what krugman is engaging in is simple misdirection now whether this is because he actually believes his own bullshit or whether he is being intellectually dishonest is anyone 's guess 's razor would tell us it is the former rather than the latter but that is n't really in a single case and is rather a general principle occam 's razor does n't tell us anything in regard to this since either is a fairly simple and straight forward explanation and given the history of economists as being professional amp in service of the financial amp government establishment the latter is at least as likely as the former

this will depend on individual bank policy federal reserve regulation d is the regulation that requires banks to disallow more than 6 convenient transactions in a month on savings accounts   if they do allow it they will fail their audits and be fined as a result banks will do one of several things either prevent you from any more transactions for the month charge you a fee convert your account to a checking account or simply close the account altogether   if they do that they will give you the money in it probably by mailing you a check you have a few options before that happens   first of all if this is an account that you regularly spend money out of the appropriate account type is a checking account   you could go to the bank and open a checking account which will not have a transaction limit if you are unable or unwilling to do that you 'll need to stay under this limit   however you should be aware that not all withdrawal types fall under this 6 transaction limit   the regulations talk about convenient transactions which generally include things like automated payments debit card check internet transfers etc   cash withdrawals in person or at an atm generally do not fall under this limit so that is an option for you if you hit your limit for the month

if you withdraw the money regardless of how small the balance is the irs will still insist you pay a 10 penalty when you file your taxes assuming you 're under 59 1/2 your 401 k plan provider might have a policy that allows you to avoid the usual automatic withholding you should check with them $ 600 in additional income is n't likely to move your tax bill much unless you 're really close to a boundary in the tax brackets rather than withdrawing the money you can transfer the 401 k to your next 401 k or roll it over to an ira plenty of no fee options around once in a traditional ira you can convert the money to a roth ira you pay the taxes on the amount but no 10 penalty converting to a roth has eligibility rules you should double check with your financial institution before doing it edit you can withdraw without the 10 penalty if you leave your job after age 55 credit to @joetaxpayer for the correction this irs page lists the conditions under which the penalty can be avoided edit the original question has been edited to add more background details due to op 's investment preferences i would also recommend that he simply withdraw the funds pay the taxes and the $ 60 penalty and put the $ 500 or so dollars somewhere else

you normally only pay taxes on the difference between the sale price and the cost basis of the asset in your example you would probably pay taxes on the $ 10 difference not the full sale price of $ 110 if you paid a commission however you would be taxed on your gain minus the commission you paid since you held the asset for less than a year you would n't pay the long term capital gains rate of 20 you 'd be taxed on the capital gain as if it were ordinary income which depends on your federal income tax bracket also littleadv makes a good point about the implications of buying the asset with after tax funds too so that 's another part of the equation to consider as well
