unemployment insurance provides a temporary safety net to workers who lose their jobs by replacing a portion of their salary for certain periods each state administers its own unemployment insurance program so some rules may vary from state to state to receive unemployment insurance payments you must have lost your job through no fault of your own if you quit your job or lost it because of poor performance or another justifiable reason you are not eligible for unemployment insurance benefits state unemployment insurance programs require claimants to have worked sufficiently before they can claim benefits as soon as you apply for unemployment insurance an agency with the state in which you live will verify that you were a victim of a layoff by contacting your previous employer and making sure you lost your job due to lack of work and not an action within your control after the state verifies you were indeed the victim of a layoff your weekly payment is calculated your payment will be a percentage of what you made in your previous job generally between 20 percent and 50 percent depending on your state unemployment insurance replaces only a portion of your previous pay because it is intended to pay only for the essentials of living such as food and utilities until you find new employment before you begin receiving benefits you must complete a waiting period of typically one or two weeks if you find a new job during this period you will not be eligible for unemployment benefits even if the job does not pay you as much as your previous job after the waiting period you will begin to receive your weekly payments employers pay for unemployment insurance through payroll taxes so while employees work and earnings history are important to funding their unemployment benefits the money does not come from their pay employer unemployment insurance contributions depend on several factors including how many former employees have received benefits employers pay taxes on an employee 's base wages which vary by state california for example taxes employers on the first $ 7,000 of an employee 's annual earnings while neighboring oregon taxes up to $ of wages employers must set aside funds each payroll period and then report taxes and pay their states quarterly states have several categories of tax rates they charge employers new businesses and those first adding employees pay the new rate which is typically lower and geared toward small businesses established businesses who have n't paid their taxes recently or properly are usually assessed the standard rate the highest possible tax rate which in 2010 ranged from 5.4 percent in several states including georgia hawaii and alaska to percent in pennsylvania businesses in good standing may receive discounts under the experienced rate depending on the number of employees a business has and how many former employees have claimed unemployment states can give sizable rate reductions the fewer claims the lower the rate a business pays in unemployment insurance taxes as a result of the economic crisis legislation has been passed to extend unemployment benefits   regular unemployment benefits are paid for a maximum of 26 weeks in most states however additional weeks of extended unemployment benefits are available during times of high unemployment the unemployment extension legislation passed by congress in february 2012 changed the way the tiers of emergency unemployment compensation are structured a tier of unemployment is an extension of a certain amount of weeks of unemployment benefits there are currently four tiers of unemployment benefits each tier provides extra weeks of unemployment in addition to basic state unemployment benefits emergency unemployment compensation tiers june august 2012 source and further information can be found here unemployment tiers about.com sources unemployment us dept of labor how does unemployment insurance work ehow percentage of pay that goes to unemployment insurance ehow additional info you can file for ui over the internet here are some useful resources ows links state unemployment offices about.com how to apply for unemployment over the internet ehow

congratulations on deciding to save for retirement since you cite dave ramsey as the source of your 15 number what does he have to say about where to invest the money if you want to have instantaneous penalty free access to   your retirement money all you need to do is set up one or more ordinary accounts that you think of   as your retirement money just be careful not to   put the money into cds since federal law requires a penalty of three months interest if you cash in the cd before its maturity date penalty or put the money into those pesky mutual funds that charge a redemption fee penalty if you take the money out within x months of investing it where x can be anywhere from 3 to 24 or more in federal tax law and in most state tax laws as well a retirement account has special privileges accorded to it in that the interest dividends capital gains etc earned on the money in your retirement account are not taxed in the year earned as they would be in a non retirement account but the tax is   either deferred till you withdraw money from the   account traditional iras 401ks etc or is waived completely roth iras roth 401ks etc in return for this special treatment penalties are imposed in addition to tax if you withdraw money from your retirement account before age 59.5 which presumably is on the distant horizon for you there are some exceptions including first time home buying and extraordinary medical expenses to this rule that i wo n't bother going into but you are not required to invest your retirement    money into such a specially privileged retirement    account it is perfectly legal to keep your retirement money    in an ordinary savings account if you wish and pay taxes on the    interest each year   you can invest your retirement    money into municipal bonds whose interest is free of    federal tax and usually free of state tax as well    if the municipality is located in your state of    residence if you like you can keep your retirement money in a    sock under your mattress if you like or buy a    collectible item e.g. a painting with it    this is not permitted in an ira etc in short if you are concerned about the penalties imposed by retirement accounts on early withdrawals forgo the benefits of these accounts and put your retirement money elsewhere where there is no penalty for instant access   if you use a money management program such as mint or quicken all you need to do is name one or more accounts or a portfolio as and voila it is done but those accounts portfolios do n't have to be retirement accounts in the sense of tax law they can be anything at all

do you need such a detailed budget   i have found that a detailed budget creates two problems i would suggest starting simple and adding complexity as you discover you need it   create a budget with just a few categories then i enforce my budget with my auto deposit    my required expenses which i have a pretty good notion of the total amount get paid from one online bank   enough money goes in and i electronically pay retirement money and e fund money get deposited into the brokerage and credit union where i keep those piles at finally my optional expenses go into a second bank i am using at the moment and i spend from there with a card   they have a nice reporting feature and if i want to save up for a toy or something i save up there   bonuses and other extra income end up there as well   this way i really only have to monitor the last account to see if i can have fun or buy a new item my bills and retirement are different pools of money and i do n't carry around a card that can access that money

i 'm no expert but this is my understanding   not necessarily for example the canadian dollar has jumped up recently because people are expecting a rate hike at the central bank this week some time that is the canadian dollar is being traded for more because people expect that the currency will be harder to get later this deflation or inflation is being priced in before it even happens   for inflation to propagate through an entire domestic supply chain of a good or service takes time raises are n't tied to inflation nor the price of a big mac or price of a movie ticket or toaster that has been sitting on the shelf for a month   the price of the good in foreign currency will however hit the export as soon as it crosses the border

as one of the answers described its going to depend on many factors and the environment at the time but there is no sure way to know which strategy is better if any are at all i would say over several hundred years the strategies would be equally as profitable in a free market the longer dated bonds would be priced lower higher yield because they are higher risk and over a long enough time period that higher risk may end up resulting in that bond being worth less or maybe nothing at all in a free market price discovery would factor all this in and the two strategies would become equal the same is true for the price during inversion events having said that we do nt live in a free market with central bankers monetizing debt in so many countries sometimes investing in short term bonds including us treasuries is a guaranteed way to lose purchasing power as these yields are below inflation and sometimes even negative

i get the sense that this is a the world is unfair there 's no way i can succeed question so let 's back up a few steps income is the starting point to all of this   that could be a job or jobs or running your own business from there you can do four things with your income obviously spend and give do not provide a monetary return they give a return in other ways such as quality of life helping others etc save gives you reserves for future expenses but it does not provide growth so that just leaves invest   you seem to be focused on stock market investments which you are right take a very long time to grow although you can get returns of up to 12 depending on how much volatility you 're willing to absorb but there are other ways to invest   you can invest in yourself by getting a degree or other training to improve your income   you can invest by starting a business which can dramatically increase your income in fact this is the most common path to millionaire in the us and probably in other free markets you can invest by growing your own existing business   you can invest in someone else 's business you can invest in real estate that can provide both value appreciation and rental income   so yes investment is a key aspect of wealth building but it is not limited to just stock market investment you can also look at reducing expenses in order to have more money to invest also keep in mind that investment with higher returns come with higher risk both in terms of volatility and risk of complete loss and that borrowing money to invest is almost always unwise since the interest paid directly reduces the return without reducing the risk

none taken good thoughts it would be making the same mistake to blindly accept my criticism as many will make blindly accepting this journalist 's graphs let 's see if i can address your concerns   the reason the scale is problematic to me is exactly what you said   gt i hope people would be looking at more than just a line   and i do n't think that they do the scales were adjusted so that the lines were nearly identical on someone 's computer screen but that implies a false equivalency between the debts of households corporations state and local gov and the fed i think the author has left leaning read the accompanied article that outlines who you will vote for link on the last slide not necessarily a bad thing but he frames all of this from the idea that his statistics can not be skewed and he is therefore presenting central to the left 's argument is that the federal government 's size is not of the biggest concern and if you got the average american thinking that 15 trillion is no big deal because households have a huge debt too or corporations do too or states do too i believe that to be dangerous i think i identified his bias and that his graphs are slightly manipulated to coerce less individuals to his side happens all the time but all of those facts are dead on in regards to the data again trying to keep my politics out of this simply criticizing the graphs and the subtle message they are sending under the guise of being neutral   i would agree with your point normally since contractors are temporary and often as you pointed out cost efficient from a benefits standpoint they also tend to be more efficient but this is not central to our point the problem is that the government has the longest war in our history going but we are n't really fighting anyone for the scale of our spending trillions of dollars have gone into this effort and one of the results has been the development of a quasi economy in iraq and now the numbers are staggering of how many of these people are employed or make a living off of this war effort but this is not like most contractors where you would add them to the dod 's budget as you pointed out and the difference i would is the permanent status of the employment after what length of time would you say a contractor for the dod working on computer programs in the pentagon is the equivalent of an employee and therefore must be counted in statistics such as the one the graph in question purports to 2 years 5 years certainly after a decade right remember the graph is trying to show that the number of government employees is not a problem or at least not a significant but calling an apple a banana does n't make it yellow i think political slight in hand with statistics as important as these should be criminal   sorry i got long winded but i hope i addressed your concerns it sounds like you are one of the few people who thinks critically when presented with data such as that which is in these 64 slides but remember for every one of you there may be a thousand people who are brainwashed by any data you put in front of them

gt;i hear lots of interesting stories about teaching the most recent involves an experimental program where the teacher performance is n't graded on student outcomes but how well they 're following the narrative defined by the program every few years teachers are handed new programs that the district curriculum people bought and told you 're going to teach $ subject using this program now sometimes those programs work better for different groups of students the ones that it was evaluated with do great the ones in different neighborhoods are failed by the program the programs are implemented district wide and the teachers are told not to deviate from the programs   nothing really new there at all and it is n't local control it is the opposite standard central planning typically driven by federal and state department of education bureaucrats in combination with teacher 's union officials but i am being redundant because they are one and the same there being a revolving door and then it is pressed down on the school by an administrator who is attempting to please the higher ups and/or to guarantee the flow of funds linked to said program on one of their several ridiculously inane metrics   gt;a recent example from the town i grew up in   that letter is hilariously sad and not for the reasons that you think   this teacher with a masters degree in reading from which i assume they believe they understand reading better than anyone   be interesting to know the last time this master of reading actually read a book that was n't strictly required the answer is probably a decade or more ago   this teacher is really just one central planning disciple who is to a different central planning program than the one they themselves were indoctrinated into   the whole thing is very revealing regarding the sheer lunacy of the scientific and scientific education paradigm   this teacher like the administrators the teacher is concerned about the wrong things there is really no concern about whether kids are learning how to read and to enjoy utilize reading which is a rudimentary skill kids can pick up on their own provided they have n't had it turned into torture by some brainless amp teacher   but rather it is all about what to use for reading language arts   the phrasing of that question and the misguided emphasis of it reveals the fact that the teacher really does n't have a clue how to truly get kids reading and understanding the english language   basically he she just wants to work a program by a semi mindless rote and is really only pissed because the programs keep being changed on them    fortunately a least a small part of the kids will learn to read mostly due to authors industry putting out things they are interested in all hail jk amp collins not because of but despite the formal schooling systems attempts to teach them

if you can afford the cost and risk of 100 shares of stock then just sell a put option   if you can only afford a few shares you can still use the information the options market is trying to give you see below a standing limit order to buy a stock is essentially a synthetic short put option position 1   so deciding on a stock limit order price is the same as valuing an option on that stock options and standing limit orders are hard to value and the generally accepted math for doing so the black scholes merton framework is also generally accepted to be wrong because of black so rather than calculate a stock buy limit price yourself it 's simpler to just sell a put at the put 's own midpoint price accepting the market 's best estimate options market makers whole job and the purpose of the open market is price discovery so it 's easier to let them fight it out over what price options should really be trading at the result of that fight is valuable information use it sell a atm put option every month until you get exercised after which time you 'll own 100 shares of stock purchased at this will typically give you a much better cost basis several dollars better versus buying the stock at spot and it the valuation math onto the options market   meanwhile you get to keep the cash from the options premiums as well disclaimer markets do make mistakes   you will lose money when the stock drops more than the option market 's own estimate if you ca n't afford 100 shares or for some reason still want to be in the business of creating synthetic options from pure stock limit orders then you could maybe play around with setting your stock purchase bid price to approximately see your statistics book for how to set 1 standard deviation gives you a 30 chance of a fill 2 gives you a 5 chance etc disclaimer the above math probably has mistakes do your own work   it 's somewhat invalid anyway because stock prices do n't follow a normal curve so standard deviations do n't really mean a whole lot   this is where market makers earn their keep or not if you still want to create synthetic options using stock limit orders you might be able to get the options market to do more of the math for you try setting your stock limit order bid equal to something like this where is the strike price of a put option for the equity you 're trading   which option expiration and strike you use for depends on your desired time horizon and desired fill probability   to get probability you can look at the delta for a given option   the relationship between option delta and equity limit order probability of fill is approximately disclaimer there may be math errors here   again do your own work also while this method assumes option markets provide good estimates see above disclaimer about the markets making mistakes

i think you 're right that from a pure expected future value perspective it makes sense to pay this loan off as quickly as possible including not taking the next year 's loan the new student loans with the higher interest rates have changed the balance enough that it 's no longer automatically better to keep it going as long as possible the crucial point in your case which is n't true for many people is that you will likely have to pay it off eventually anyway and so in terms of net costs over your lifetime you will do best by paying it off quickly a few points to set against that that you might want to consider not paying it off is a good hedge against your career not going as well as you expect e.g. if the economy does badly you have health problems you take a career break for any reason if that happens you would end up not being forced to pay it off so will end up gaining from not having done so voluntarily the money you save in that case could be more valuable to you that the money you would lose if your career does go well not paying it off will increase your net cash earlier in life when you are more likely to need it e.g. for a house deposit having more free cash could increase your options making it possible to buy a house earlier in life or it could mean you have a higher deposit when you do buy reducing the interest rate on the entire mortgage balance the savings from that could end up being more than the 6 interest on the loan even though when you look at the loan in isolation it seems like a very bad rate

contrary to popular belief you can build your credit if that is important to you without paying a penny in interest   this is done through the responsible use of credit cards paying the bill in full each month without accruing any interest charges if i were you i would pay off the loan today if possible   after that if you decide you need to build up your credit apply for a credit card   if you have difficulty with that you can get a small secured credit card or retail store credit card until you have enough history to get a regular credit card

an equity tax does seem to make some sense it would probably help to stave off deflation as well because it would encourage growth and investment where people would otherwise choose to sit on their money or worse   an equity tax on currency or liquid investments of even .5 apr would have a huge effect on the behavior of corporations sadly the largest of them would have the resources to avoid the tax by keeping all of their money out of the country

's answer is spot on with the advice to avoid repeated conversions but i 'd like to provide some specifics on the fees involved each time you round trip canadian dollars cad through a u.s dollar usd priced security at td waterhouse and leave your proceeds in cad you 're paying a total foreign exchange fee implied in their rate   spread of about 3 give or take that 's ~3 per buy sell combination or on each end you can imagine if you trade back forth frequently you can quickly lose a lot of money   do it back and forth ten times in a year and you 're out ~30 on the fees alone the td u.s. money market fund that td waterhouse is referring to has no direct commission to buy or sell but it does have a management expense ratio mer of 0.20 per year basically a fee which is deducted from the fund 's returns which today are also close to zero   practically speaking that 's a very slim fee to hold some usd in your canadian dollar tfsa while 0.20 is cheap a point to keep in mind is if you maintain a significant usd balance you are maintaining currency risk   you can lose money in cad terms if the cad appreciates vs. usd additional references canadian capitalist describes td waterhouse and the use of and wash trades at how to wash your trade   he 's referring to rrsps but the same applies to tfsas which came out after the post was written canadian couch potato has two relevant articles are us listed etfs really cheaper and lowering your currency exchange fees

evaluate if the rs 5 million term insurance is sufficient typically the term insurance provided by employer is in the range of 1 to 3 times the gross generally one should be covered in the range of 5 to 10 times the gross the sooner you start the lesser the premium and you can get insured for a large amount for a long duration at very nominal rate   note   you can also buy a health insurance for your father note these typically come at high cost generally if over 70 years of age 25 is the premium amount and 25 as co pay so if your dad does n't fall ill once in 3 years its a loss making proposition edit accident insurance best take is along with rider on term plan additional health insurance is a good idea and helps if you are in between jobs plus the new company health insurance can reject a particular treatment as pre existing i.e. certain illness in certain plans require one to have coverage for 3 years before the claim for it can be covered

should i invest the money i do n't need immediately and only withdraw it next year when i need it for living expenses or should i simply leave it in my current account this might come as a bit of a surprise but your money is already invested we talk of investment vehicles an investment vehicle is basically a place where you can put money and have it either earn a return or be able to get it back later or both the neither case is generally called spending there are also investment classes which are things like cash stocks bonds precious metals etc different things that you can buy within an investment vehicle you currently have the money in a bank account bank accounts currently earn very low interest rates but they are also very liquid and very secure in the sense of being certain that you will get the principal back now when you talk about investing the money you are probably thinking of moving it from where it is currently sitting earning next to no return to somewhere it can earn a somewhat higher return and that 's fine but you should keep in mind that you are n't really investing it in that case only moving it the key to deciding about an asset allocation how much of your money to put into what investment classes is your investment horizon the investment horizon is simply for how long you plan on letting the money remain where you put it for money that you do not expect to touch for more than five years common advice is to put it in the stock market this is simply because in the long term historically the stock market has outperformed most other investment classes when looking at return versus risk volatility however money that you expect to need sooner than that is often recommended against putting it in the stock market the reason for this is that the stock market is volatile the value of your investment can fluctuate and there 's always the risk that it will be down when you need the money if you do n't need the money within several years you can ride that out but if you need the money within the next year you might not have time to ride out the dip in the stock market so for money that you are going to need soon you should be looking for less volatile investment classes bonds are generally less volatile than stocks with government bonds generally being less volatile than corporate bonds bank accounts are even less volatile coming in at practically zero volatility but also have much lower expected rates of return for the money that you need within a year i would recommend against any volatile investment class in other words you might take whichever part you do n't need within a year and put in bonds except for what you do n't foresee needing within the next half decade or more which you can put in stocks then put the remainder in a simple high yield deposit insured savings account it wo n't earn much but you will be basically guaranteed that the money will still be there when you want it in a year for the money you put into bonds and stocks find low cost index mutual funds or exchange traded funds to do so you can not predict the future rate of return of any investment but you can predict the cost of the investment with a high degree of accuracy hence for any given investment class strive to minimize cost as doing so is likely to lead to better return on investment over time it 's extremely rare to find higher cost alternatives that are actually worth it in the long term

cryptocurrency is undoubtedly at the peak of gartner hype cycle but it very well could the way we use currency for our daily needs in the future   stay with me on this at present cryptocurrency appears no more than a speculation that is sugar coated by individuals who have vested interest in it however if we overlook this excitement the actual use of cryptocurrency is mind boggling    suppose you had a mid life crisis and went on a journey to the middle of the earth to find where humans supposedly originated from and you met and connected with a local coffee farmer named in a very remote part of ethiopia he invited you for an evening coffee and you obliged and six months later you for this same coffee whilst you were having another wave of existential thoughts in your that overlooked the urban jungle   suddenly you remembered that had a cheap but functional smartphone with a bitcoin wallet and afterwards you communicated with him on whatsapp and decided to enter in a transaction with him is delighted with this technology but mainly because he does not have to travel 100 km to and fro the nearest city where his bank is located and he is also happy that he can send a sack of coffee beans to his friend who lives in a land and all he needs to do is hand over the coffee sack to delivery truck en route the shipping port ultimately saving lot of his precious time and resources   now use this one example and multiply it by hundreds of millions of people around the world who have a very remote access to a but have an access to a basic smartphone imagine the possibility of connecting people like to the world and having a seamless cross border trade finance transaction using currency that is not controlled by any government   like many others i am keen to see the developments of cryptocurrency in the coming years but for now i remain that said i am more interest in the countless opportunities that will be unlocked by the very technology that is fundamental to all the cryptocurrencies the blockchain   is one branch of blockchain technology which has proved useful there are million other possibilities which i 'm sure will benefit many industries in the coming decade and i for one am very excited

this answer is specifically for the uk but one building society has an account set up specifically for this you actually refer your friend family member to set up an account and then it can be linked to your mortgage they do n't get any interest for their account as it 's all offset against your mortgage if you then happen to give them a cash gift up to £ 250 or possibly £ 3000 per year i ca n't work out which is the reliable number as of 2015 then it 's all completely above board

since you are considering dumping your savings into your student loans when they are equal you should go ahead and do it now   you will immediately reap the benefit of paying less interest per month   also your minimum monthly payments will decrease so if you had unexpected expenses pop up you could shrink your payments for a limited time   if you do n't have emergency expenses more of your regular monthly payment will go toward the principle of your loan and pay it off faster make a goal to get your savings back up as soon as you can after your loans are paid off   in the mean time see what other things you can cut back on like eating less expensive food or switching to a less expensive phone plan   if you have stuff you do n't need anymore try selling it on or ebay   or just focus on doing more at work so you can get a raise   these things are not necessary but it 's a good feeling to be able to shave another month or two off paying a debt

i think that the answer by is good   i 'd add that the there 's a mathematically precise difference   gambling games are typically zero sum games which means that every dollar won by one person is lost by another if there 's a house taking a cut then it 's worse than zero sum but let 's ignore that for the moment    none of the markets that you mentioned are zero sum because it 's possible for both parties in the transaction to win since they typically have different objectives   if i buy stock i typically desire for it to go up to make money but if i sell stock i typically sell it because i want the money to do something else completely   the something else might be invest in another instrument if i think it 's better or i 'm rebalancing risk   it might also be to buy a house pay for college or if i 'm in retirement living on my investments to buy food   if the stock goes up the buyer won increased investment but the seller also won got the other thing that they wanted needed which they would not have been able to get had there not been a buyer willing to pay cash for the stock of course it 's possible that in some cases not everyone wins because there is risk but risk should not be considered synonymous with gambling because there 's varying degrees of risk in everything you do

a few reasons   first it 's hard to buy a stock that has never gone up and is n't necessarily wise to do so   even if you just wait for a stock go down what if you wait and it goes up two dollars then drops 10 cents   has it gone up or down   when should you buy it in general your idea is correct the higher the price the less you should want the stock   but in some sense the past price is irrelevant you ca n't buy it at the past price   you should buy it now if it 's the best option now   and that is based on your assessment of whether it 's future prospects are worth the current price and in fact enough worth enough to make buying the stock the best economic decision you can currently make finally the price may have gone up for a reason   the company may have done something or some information about the company may have become known that affects it 's future prospects   that might make it a better deal perhaps even better than it was before the price increase

if you have the cash on hand to pay the tax on the amount you are transferring i recommend moving to a roth ira an ira is tax deferred you put in pretax contributions in to an ira and you are taxed on that money your contributions and interest earned when you withdraw it at retirement age 59 1/2   the idea being that you will be taking less out per year in your retirement years putting you into a lower tax bracket the major problem is most people draw out as much or more a year in their retirement years than when they were working a roth ira grows tax free you put after tax contributions into a roth ira you have paid taxes on the contributions and you are never taxed on the growth when you draw the money out at retirement you do n't pay any income taxes on that money let me give you an example for this example we will use the following information for both scenario we will invest $ 400 per month for a total of $ 4800 the current maximum is $ 5000 if you are under 50 years old $ 400 dollars after taxes is $ 300 invest $ 300 a month at age 65 you have you owe no taxes on this money it does n't matter how much you take out a year $ 400 dollars a month is taken pretax out of your paycheck invest $ 400 per month at age 65 you have $ you owe taxes of 25 as you draw that out for at total tax of = cash in your pocket the problem is if you draw out more than $ current 2010 filing single per year you will be pushed to a higher tax bracket and take more of your money away if you decide to buy a vacation home and you take out $ 250,000 to pay for it that 's counted as income for that year any you will be in the 33 tax bracket even if you can keep yourself to a low income the government forces your hand and makes you draw out more money at age 70 based on their tables forcing you into a higher tax bracket

it seems like you do n't understand much about what you have a strong opinion about   most public employees who fly do fly coach senior leadership and executive class employees the kind responsible for tens of thousands of employees and/or manage federal budgets worth hundreds of millions or more you put them in business class so they can be productive it 's not about comfort it 's about productivity   secondly neither you as an owner nor the public pay the costs for union reps so no one needs to or should care what uninformed opinion you have that would be like me how you or some other business owner should be able to spend their operating budget   it 's statements from ignorance like this that really undermine the argument that business owners are the backbone of the economy or that they would have any advantage managing public affairs

no the information you are describing is technical data about a stock 's market price and trading volume only there is nothing implied in that data about a company 's financial fundamentals earnings profitability outstanding shares market capitalization dividends balance sheet assets and liabilities etc all you can infer is positive or negative momentum in the trading of the stock if you want to understand if a company is performing well then you need fundamental data about the company such as you would get from a company 's annual and quarterly reports

that 's kind of the untold story of china everyone seems to think that all that they are about is cheap this and cheap that just a bit of a personal anecdote but i 'm a bit of a myself and on my first business trip to shanghai was able to have some tailored clothing made there   not only was the cut and finish as good or better than anything you 'd get in europe or n. america but the price was significantly less i quickly noticed that a lot of the chinese made garments selling locally were many times better than those imported ones bearing western brand labels even though they were also produced right there in china   so yes i am most definitely of the mind that the cheapness lack of quality of the products we have available to us in europe and n. america and made in china are a direct result of our own indigenous companies us so as to really up those margins suffice it to say they do in fact have quality control however if you want to pay them good money to make shit products they 'll surely oblige you

i think the $ 500 mm number was bullshit a common trick is that a private company will raise $ 50 mm for 10 of the company and say they 're worth $ 500 mm but then it turns out that the new investors get like they 're guaranteed to be paid back first if the company goes bankrupt or they 're guaranteed to get back the first $ 100 mm of an ipo since the company really sold 10 of itself plus other stuff they are worth less than $ 500 mm    therefore i find 's claim that reddit was worth $ 250 mm in 2015 credible it is also why i 'm suspicious about the $ number today

you can not have off campus employment in your first year but investments are considered passive income no matter how much time you put into that effort obviously you need to stay enrolled full time and get good enough grades to stay in good standing academically so you should be cautious about how much time you spend day trading if the foreign market is also active in a separate time zone that may help you not to miss class or otherwise divert your attention from your investment in your own education i have no idea about your wealth but it seems to me that completing your degree is more likely to build your wealth than your stock market trades otherwise you would have stayed home and continued trading instead of attending school in another country

while this seems overall a macroeconomics question and not really personal finance let me give it a shot the question of why corporations form in a free or efficient market is why ronald coase received the 1991 nobel prize in economics for his work developing the theory of the firm corporations organize when there are transaction costs in the free market corporations form when it is in fact more efficient for a corporation to exist than a number of small producers contracting with one another   to the extent that corporations add efficiency to a total market they are not zero sum at all the net production is increased over what would exist in a market of sole proprietors who would have costs such as researching the trust levels in counterparts regulatory compliance etc that they can not bear to engage in the same level of transactions

you 're circling around the answer   the only real difference between a loddar and a privately issued promissory note is that the loddar is issued by a recognized third party with better credit credibility the whole merchant priest farmer cartel thing    private entities absolutely can and do issue their own promises to pay and accept them and in turn rely on those promises to make other promises it 's what you do when you charge something to a credit card on the basis of your employer 's promise to pay you charge new tires the tire store promises to pay its employees based on your cc company 's promise to pay the tire store which is based on your promise to pay the credit card company which is based on your employer 's promise to pay you which is based on your employer 's contracts with its customers and so on   in fact often as not the whole chain never actually gets reconciled with printed cash the central bank never has to print or even know about these transactions it 's just checks and electronic transfers promises all the way down maybe with occasional cash withdrawals for popcorn at the movies or to tip the or something    that does n't mean it 's not real money it absolutely is those promises are buying groceries and tires and making mortgage payments and paying dentist bills and getting people to dig up stuff out of mines that will be fashioned into ipads and all kinds of stuff   where this hurts most people in the brain is that they kind of accept dollar bills as and intrinsically valuable so trying to explain in reverse how they are the same as promissory notes or credit certificates is like trying to convince them that a plane ticket is the same as an airplane which is obviously not true    that 's why i started with this imaginary world without money if you let go of any and stop trying to think through the analogies and do n't read it trying to look for the outcome conclusions if you just read it and follow the story through it is obvious that the only intrinsic difference in that imaginary world between apple certificates loddars and privately issued ious is the credibility of the   trying to understand this stuff via analogy will make your head spin taking it all the way back to the thread topic and the question at the top of the page what makes it so difficult is the tendency and mental impulse to money as a thing that is somewhere and therefore has to go somewhere    but that 's an intrinsically and substantially imperfect analogy which is what makes it hard to explain to a five year old and you ca n't make the reality fit that analogy and stay sane even if you refuse to accept all this abstraction and insist on only doing transactions with physical cash or gold pieces the value of those markers is still 100 contingent on everyone accepting that everyone else will continue to believe that everyone else will continue to accept that currency   money is essentially a promise that other people will keep instead of giving you food your employer gives you a universal gift certificate that you can redeem anywhere and everyone else will accept it because they can in turn redeem it anywhere else the only difference between using a bank draft or printed dollar bill versus writing a promise to make good yourself is the credibility of the issuer    that 's a really difficult premise for most people to accept because it 's invisible and abstract and seems to conflict with tangible interactions you 've been doing all your life so we have this sort of tendency to try and force the reality to fit preconceived conceptual analogies like someone who keeps rejecting explanations of how airplanes can fly because that still does n't explain how metal can be lighter than air it 's demanding that the reality must fit a hypothesis that does n't apply    hope that helps

i do this often and have never had a problem   my broker is td ameritrade and they sent several emails and even called and left a message the week of expiry to remind me i had in the money options that would be expiring soon their policy is to automatically exercise all options that are at least $ .01 in the money   one email was vaguely worded but it implied that they could liquidate other positions to raise money to exercise the options   i would have called to clarify but i had no intention of exercising and knew i would sell them before expiry in general though much like with margin calls you should avoid being in the position where the broker needs to or can do anything with your account as a quick aside   i ca n't think of a scenario where you would n't be able to sell your options but you probably are aware of the huge spreads that exist for many illiquid options   you 'll be able to sell them but if you 're desperate you may have to sell at the bid price which can be significantly 25 lower than the ask   i 've found this to be common for options of even very liquid underlyings   so personally i find myself adjusting my limit price quite often near expiry   if the quote is say 3.00 i 'll try to sell with a limit of and hope someone takes my offer   if the price is not moving up and nobody is biting move down to 3.20 etc in general you should definitely talk to your broker like others have suggested   you may be able to request that they sell the options and not attempt to exercise them at the expense of other positions you have

the thing is corporate taxes are n't paid on revenues or costs they 're paid on net income    meaning no matter what happens any investment the company makes that improves their net income automatically means more money for the company     so let 's say 12 vs 14 tax    a 2 increase in tax means a 2 lower net roi on the investment     but so long as the incremental improvement to your bottom line is there the investment is sound with or without taxes    even at a 50 corporate tax rate    you hire one more person at $ 60k yr and they make $ 120k yr in net income for you    you still keep $ 30k of the profits     it 's an incremental increase regardless   and if that person does n't make you money   say the incremental benefit is 0    well your net income just dropped $    and you just paid $ 30k less in taxes    meaning the true cost of that hire is $ 30k to your bottom line   where it hurts business is that your retained earnings do n't build up as fast    it makes the next investment harder to make is all    and as a corporation if you 're not paying dividends you need to keep reinvesting your retained

if you want to see a more academic version of this look up weighted average cost of capital wacc    it 's a formula that tells you how much it costs for a company to raise $ 1 of capital whether it be through issuing bonds or stocks    one thing you learn is that there are times that if you take on loans even if you do n't need it you can raise shareholder value and therefore the total company the thought process is as it states in the article above that a company can issue debt for cheaper than issue shares and it will have extra cash which it can use to get a better return than its net effective interest rate    i tried to give an example but i only ended up what it says in the article anyhow look up wacc and you 'll understand the fundamentals

you need to look at the numbers when you 're ready to transact   what your crossover is worth now what the truck will lease for then what financing deals may or may not be available will all change i 'm not sure why you 've already decided you will lease the truck perhaps you 're planning to take advantage of some kind of business write off   i would personally never put anything down on a lease though i have argued with people on here about that particular decision   the reality is you need to look at the numbers   some banks will adjust the interest you pay on your lease to account for your down payment some do n't    consider a $ 9,000 lease $ 250 per month for 36 months   consider you pay $ 1,000 up front as a down payment    example 1 $ 1,000 lowers the amount due on the lease to $ 8,000 lowering your monthly payment to $ from $ 250 the downpayment has accomplished nothing   over the 36 months you will have still paid the same $ 9,000    example 2 $ 1,000 up front changes the amount owed and other fees generally applicable to a lease gap insurance etc and your payment drops to $ your total over the lease is now $ $ 1,000 down and $ in payments    you need to look at the numbers   in general if you know you will be purchasing the truck at the end of the lease it 's more financially advantageous to just purchase it from the start

it depends a large part on your broker 's relationship with the issuing bank how early you can participate in the ipo round but the nature of the stock market means the hotter the stock and the closer to the market away from the issuing bank you have to buy the higher the price you 'll pay the stock market is a secondary market meaning the only things for sale are shares already owned by someone as a result for a hot stock the individual investor will have to wait for another investor not the issuing bank to trade sell the stock

capital is only a token restriction when a company is incorporated a maximum number of shares is specified in the legal documentation most companies will make this an extremely large number so they never face that limitation   see here you would n't necessarily expect the stock price to change the reason a company issues new stock is as a way to raise capital although new stock is issued the cash raised by the sale becomes an asset on the company 's balance sheet   there 's a good worked example in this wikipedia article following a rights issue the liabilities of the company will increase to account for the increase in owner 's equity but the assets will also increase by the same amount with the cash received whether the stock price changes will depend upon what price the stock is issued at and on the market 's opinions about the company 's growth potential now it has new capital to invest   if the new stock is issued at the same price as the current market price there 's no particular reason to expect the share price to change again wikipedia has more detail when new stock is issued it is usually offered to existing shareholders first in proportion to their current holding   if the shareholder decides to purchase the new stock in full then their position wo n't be diluted   if they opt not to buy the new stock they will now own a smaller percentage of the company as their stocks will make up a smaller part of the now larger number of shares

i like your enthusiasm and initiative however there are a few things you need to consider that you have n't yet thought about first it is important to remember that trading with fake money is not the same as trading with real money   in the fake world you have $ 100k   with this fake money you can do reckless things with it such as put it all on one stock   if you lose it costs you nothing so you do n't have an emotional attachment to it   with real money it will feel different and that is something you have n't experienced yet second you mentioned that you are good at making picks   with all due respect i suggest that you are n't old enough to make that determination   you have n't been trading for long enough to determine if you are doing well at it     that having been said i do n't want to completely discourage you from trying something new third you mentioned long term investing but you also said that you need to make your money back quick and mentioned trading daily   those things are n't really compatible   i would n't consider what you are doing as long term investing   with the type of investing you are doing picking individual stocks and hoping for the value to go up in a relatively short time frame it is similar to gambling   the risk of losing is very much there and you should n't be investing money this way that you are n't prepared to lose   if you need the money for something soon do n't put it in the stock market never forget this   what can happen is that you start with small amounts of money do well and then thinking that you are good at this put in larger amounts of money   you will eventually lose   if you put in money that you need for something else you have a problem if you are trying this out for education and entertainment purposes that is great   but when it starts to get serious make sure that you are aware of the risks   educate yourself and be smart here is what i would suggest if you want to try this short term day trading type investing and you understand that the money can easily be lost i would balance that with investing in a more traditional way set aside an amount each month to put in a low expense index mutual fund   doing this will have several benefits for you   as for your specific questions about stock trading with small amounts yes you can trade with small amounts however every time you trade you will be paying a commission   even with a discount broker if you are trading frequently the commissions you will be paying will be very significant at the dollar amounts you are talking about   the only way i can see around this would be to try the robinhood app which allows you to trade without paying sales commission   i have no experience with that app

in general insurance payouts you receive in compensation for damage to your vehicle are not taxable income see for instance this nolo page however i do n't see how that is related to your three bullet points about how your sister should buy her car   you can transfer the money to her in any way that 's convenient to both of you   whether the dealership will accept cash is something you 'll have to ask them about but my impression is most dealers are eager to accept cash as long as the car you are getting from her is not worth substantially more than the $ 8500 you 're giving her i do n't see that you 'll be in trouble income tax wise   as mentioned in the question you linked to you can give each other up to $ 14k per year tax free   so if you give her a $ 8500 and she gives you a car worth roughly the same amount no problem   if you actually do it as a sale even better since then the only amount that will count as a gift to either of you is whatever one party gets above and beyond the fair value of the car   that is if the car is worth $ 10000 but she sells it to you for $ 8500 she effectively gave you a gift of $ 1500 in car value   if it 's worth $ 7000 but she sells it to you for $ 8500 you gave her a gift of $ 1500 in cash as rocky pointed out in a comment if you do a sale it may be subject to sales tax depending on what state you 're in   in practice it is very common for people to not deal with sales tax in informal transactions like this between family members but you do owe it if your state 's laws require it and the state could theoretically come after you for it another edit i see from your comment you are in michigan   according to this page from the michigan secretary of state no tax is due if you purchase a vehicle from an immediate family member   so you would not owe sales tax if you do it as a sale

it is easier to get a loan on a rental than a flip which is a huge advantage to rental properties leverage allows you to increase your returns and make more money off appreciation and higher rents i use arms to finance my rental properties that are amortized over 30 years i have to put 20 percent down but my portfolio lender lets me get as many loans as i want because i put 20 percent down on my rental properties and they still have great cash flow i can buy three times as many properties as i could with cash purchases   buying more rental properties amplifies the other advantages like cash flow equity pay down and the tax advantages

while i 'm not an accountant this is how i do this for my personal    accounting note if you do n't want the expense to take effect right away meaning    it 'll affect your profits then the transaction date here needs to be    something in the future then when you hit that date and the bill is    still not paid you just the bill and repost again with a new    date so you end up with something like the following    4 now you post the invoice to liabilities accounts payable the cable company the invoice due date should reflect what you had in the invoice this is important as gnucash will warn you that your bill is due if you want to pay it every time it starts   when you 're ready to pay the bill just find the bill and click pay invoice if it 's already paid and you imported transactions from your bank find the transaction then right click and click assign as payment then choose your invoice note i 've being using this to also record cheques that are given to    people but not cashed yet i hope that helps

this is a bit unusual but not unheard of i have known more than one car whose owner was not its driver   besides the obvious risk that the legal owner of the car will repossess it this seems fairly safe   your insurance should cover any financial liability that you incur during an accident   even if the car is repossessed by the owner you are only out the registration fees i would suggest you avoid looking this gift horse in the grill   her father on the other hand might be in for some drama and financial mess if he has a falling out with his friend this arrangement reminds me of where one spouse owns the car but the other drives it and pays the loan   usually when the relationship goes south one spouse is forced to sell the car at a loss

yes you should invest and yes you should save for the house down payment these should be two separate pools of money and the goals and time frames for them are different with a 3 year time frame for the down payment on the house the risk you should accept should be essentially zero that means it is less of an investment and more plain vanilla savings account or maybe a higher interest account or a cd the worst thing to have happen would be to try and save for the house while the value of your investment keeps dropping   you have to decide how to allocate your income between retirement accounts and saving for the house while still meeting all your other obligations the exact balance depends on how much you need to save for retirement and things such as rules for the company match

first you 've learned a very good lesson that quite a few people miss out on notice how easy it is to get out of debt when you get a windfall of money   the trouble is that if a person does n't have the behavior to maintain their position they will end up in the same place   many lottery winners end up being poor in the long run because their behavior is the problem not their finances if you feel that you 're going to end up in debt again this means simply that somewhere in your finances your expenses exceed your income   simply put there 's only two fundamental things that can be done you can do one or the other or both   over budgeting i prefer automation automate your bills and spending by setting up a bill and spending account and when the money 's gone it 's gone you can tell yourself at that point i have to find another source of income before i spend more   this not only helps you show where your money is going now it also puts a constraint on your spending which sounds like most of the problem currently   many of my friends and i make our saved invested money very hard to access so that we ca n't get it immediately like putting it in an account that will require three or four days to get to the purpose of this is to shape your behavior into actions of either increasing your income decreasing your spending or both

it is a dangerous policy not to have a balance across the terms of assets short term reserves should remain in short term investments because they are most likely needed in the short term   the amount can be shaved according to the probability of their respective needs but long term asset variance usually exceed the probability of needing to use reserves for example replacing one month bonds paying essentially nothing with stocks that should be expected to return 9 will expose oneself to a possible sudden 50 loss   if cash is indeed so abundant that reserves can be doubled this policy can be expected to be stable however cash is normally scarce   it is a risky policy to place reserves that have a 20 chance of being 100 liquidated into investments that have a 20 chance of declining by approximately 50 just for a chance of an extra 9 annual return financial stability should always be of primary concern with rate of return secondary only after stability has been reasonably assured

depending on what your other deductions are and the amount you are wanting to donate you can save some money by deductions into every other year for example if you are single in 2015 the standard deduction is $ 6,300 this means the first $ 6,300 in deductions you have basically do n't matter because the standard deduction is larger you only count itemized deductions greater than $ 6,300 let 's imagine you are donating $ 10k in 2015 and 2016 and have no other itemized deductions if you donate in both years you basically get a net deduction of $ 10,000 $ 6,300 2 = $ over the standard deduction however if you donate $ 10k in 2015 and the next $ 10k on 2015 then you now have donated $ 20k in 2015 and $ in 2016 this affects your taxes because you now get $ 20,000 $ 6,300 = $ in bonus deductions you still get the full $ 6,300 standard deduction in 2016 as well this can be a significant impact on your taxes especially if you are married as the married deduction is double the single or have minimal other deductions

first of all think of anyone you know in your circle locally who may have gotten a mortgage recently   ask him her or them for a recommendation on what brokers they found helpful and most of all priced competitively second of all you may consider asking a real estate agent   note that this is generally discouraged because agents sometimes and sometimes justifiably get a bad reputation for doing anything to get themselves the highest commission possible and so folks want to keep the lender from knowing the agent   yet if you have a reputable trustworthy agent he or she can point you to a reputable trustworthy broker who has been quoting your agent 's other clients great rates third of all make sure to check out the rates at places you might not expect for example any credit unions you or your spouse might have access to   credit unions often offer very competitive rates and fees   after you have 2 3 brokers lined up visit them all within a short amount of time edit courtesy of the below comments which show that 2 weeks has been quoted but that it may be less   the reason to visit them close together is that in the pre approval process you will be getting your credit hard pulled which means that your score will be dinged a bit   visiting them all close together tells the bureaus to count all the hits as one new potential credit line instead of a couple or several and so your score gets dinged less ask about rates fees they are required by law to give you what is called a good faith estimate of their final fees if pre payment of the loan is allowed required to re finance or for paying off early alternative schedules such as bi weekly or what a 20 year mortgage rate might be the amortization schedule for your preferred loan and ask for references from past clients pick a broker not only who has the best rates but also who appears able to be responsive if you need something quickly in order to close on a great deal

during the hyperinflation of the republic corporate stocks and convertible bonds were thought second only to the species gold silver etc as the only secure currencies   as milton friedman proved inflation is caused solely by the monetary token supply increasing faster than productivity   in the past days of species of currency it was caused by governments the currency e.g. the same amount of silver in 50 coins to 100 coins sudden increases in the supply of precious metals can also trigger it the various gold rushes in 19th century and later improvements in extraction methods caused of inflation most famously the huge amounts of silver the spanish extracted from the new world mines devastated the european economy with high inflation governments use inflation as a form of stealth flat tax money functions as an abstract universal trade good and it all the rules of supply and demand if the supply of money goes up suddenly then its value drops in relation to real goods and service but that drop in value does n't occur instantly the increased quality of tokens has to through the market before the value changes   so the first institution to spend the debased currency can get the full current value from trade the second gets slightly less the third even less and so on in 2008 the federal reserve began printing money and loaning at 0 to insolvent backs who then used that money to buy t bill this had the effect of giving the banks an arbitrary a1 rated asset for their fractional reserve while the federal government got full pre inflation value of the money paid for the t bills as the government spent that money the number of tokens increased fast than the economy   in times of inflation the value of money per unit drops as its supply increases and increases the best hedges against inflation are real assets e.g. land equipment stocks ownership of real assets and convertible bonds which are convertible to stock   it 's important to remember that money is of itself worthless it 's just a technology that and trading which at the base is still a barter system during inflation the barter value of money plunges owing to increased supply but the direct barter value between any two real assets remain the same because their supplies have not changed   the value of stocks and convertible bonds is maintained by the economic activity of the company whose ownership they represent dividends stock prices and bond equity as measured in the inflated currency continue to rise in sync with inflation thus they preserve the original value of the money paid for them not sure why you expect more inflation the only institution that can create inflation in the us is the federal reserve which trump has no direct control off deregulation of banks wo n't cause inflation in and of itself as the private banks can not alter the money supply if banks fail owing to deregulation unlikely i think given the dismal nearly century long record of regulation to date then the federal reserve might fix the problem with another inflation tax but otherwise not

in your scenario i would do the following if in the short term something should happen you can always tap into a line of credit or even a cash advance on the credit card   but you should in no way be paying $ 70 a month in interest    assume you want to pay off the credit card over 12 payments you would need to pay about 450 a month which costs 400 in interest   at the end of the year you have $ 5000 in savings and $ 0 debt the alternative is to pay off the credit card right now and put that $ 450 into savings you would have $ 5400 in savings and $ 0 debt i 'm usually the last to recommend a $ 0 safety net but i make an exception in the case of credit card debt    in the worst case you are no worse off than you are now in the best case you 're up about $ 400 at the end of the year

can you easily stomach the risk of higher volatility that could come with smaller stocks how certain are you that the funds would n't have any asset bloat that could cause them to become large cap funds for holding to their winners if having your 401(k balance get chopped in half over a year does n't give you any pause or hesitation then you have greater risk tolerance than a lot of people but this is one of those things where living through it could be interesting while i would n't be against the advice i would consider caution on whether or not the next 40 years will be exactly like the averages of the past or not in response to the comments you did n't state the funds so i how i do know you meant index funds specifically look at fidelity low priced stock for a fund that has bloated up in a sense could this happen with small cap funds possibly but this is something to note if you are just starting to invest now it is easy to say i 'll stay the course and then when things get you may not be as strong as you thought this is just a warning as i 'm not sure you get my meaning here imagine that some women may think when having a child i do n't need any drugs and then the pain comes and an is demanded because of the different between the hypothetical and the real version while you may think i 'll just turn the cheek if you punch me if i actually just did it out of the blue how sure are you of not at me for doing it really stop and think about this for a moment rather than give an answer that may or may not what you 'd really do when the matter hits the oscillator could n't you just look at what stocks did the best in the last 10 years and just buy those companies think carefully about what strategy are you using and why or else you could get tossed around as more than a few things were supposed to be the sure thing that turned out to be incorrect like the dream team of long term capital management the banks that were too big to fail the japanese taking over in the late 1980s etc there are more than a few times where things started looking one way and ended up quite differently though i wonder if you are aware of this performance chasing that some will do

i do n't think there 's much you can do losses from the sale of personal use automobiles used for pleasure commuting etc are not deductible as capital losses   see irs tax topic end of the first paragraph   the expenses you incurred in owning and operating the car insurance fuel maintenance service plans etc are not deductible either if you used it partly for business then some of your expenses might be deductible see irs tax topic 510   this includes depreciation decline in value but only according to a standard schedule you do n't generally just get to deduct the difference between your buying and selling price   also you 'd need to have records to verify your business use   but anyway these deductions would apply or not regardless of whether you sell the car you do n't get your sales tax refunded when you resell the vehicle   that 's why it 's a sales tax not a value added tax   note however that if you do sell it the sales tax on this new transaction will be the buyer 's responsibility not yours you do have the option on your federal income tax return to deduct the state sales tax you paid when you bought the car in fact you can deduct all the sales taxes you paid in that year   if you have already filed your taxes for that year you can go back and amend them   however this takes the place of your state income tax deduction for the year you ca n't deduct both   see tax topic   so this is only useful if your sales taxes for that year exceeded the state income tax you paid in that year   also note that state taxes are not deductible on your state income tax return   again this deduction applies whether you sell the car or not

you might want to just keep it in cash for one step further you could do an even split of usd eur and silver usd hedges against loss of value in the euro precious metal hedges against a global financial problem silver over gold because of high gold silver ratio is high you could lose money this way there are some bad things that can happen that will make your portfolio fall but there are also many bad things that can happen that would result in no change or gain with careful trades in stocks and even more aggressive assets you could conceivably see large returns but since you 're novice you wo n't be able to make these trades and you 'll just lose your investment ordinarily can buy an s&p etf and enjoy decent return 7 8 annual on average at reasonable risk but that only works if you stay invested for many years in the short term s&p can crash pretty badly and stay low for a year or more if you can just wait it out great it has always recovered eventually but if some emergency forces you to take the money out you 'd have to do so at a big loss lately the index has shown signs of being overvalued if you buy it now you could luck out and be 10 15 up in a year but you could also end up 30 down not a very favorable risk reward rate which is why i would hold on to my cash until it does crash or failing that starts looking more robust again and then think about investing

has an article about short that states the higher the number of days to cover means the possibility for a short squeeze is greater and the potential size of the short squeeze is also greater logically this makes sense a short squeeze occurs when a lack of supply meets excess demand for a stock so the potential for a squeeze increases when supply and demand begin to get out of equilibrium think of two things that would cause the days to cover to increase and what effect they would have on supply and demand   the current short interest numerator increases this implies that if some event triggers short sellers to cover their position there are a higher number of short sellers who will need to do so this the chances that demand will exceed supply   the average daily volume denominator decreases this implies that fewer investors are trading the stock so if an event triggers short sellers to cover their positions there might not be enough traders in the market willing to sell their shares obviously if a short squeeze occurs volume may increase because traders who were unwilling to sell their shares become willing

you can not actually buy an index in the true sense of the word   an index is created and maintained by a company like standard and poor 's who licenses the use of the index to firms like vanguard   the s&p 500 is an example of an index   the s&p 500 index includes 500 leading companies many companies sell products which track to this index   the two most popular products which track to indexes are mutual funds as called index funds and index mutual funds and exchange traded funds as called etfs   each index mutual fund or etf has an index which it tracks against meaning they hold securities which make up a sample of the index some indexes like bond indexes are very hard to hold everything that makes them up looking at the vanguard s&p 500 index mutual fund ticker vfinx we see that it tracks against the s&p 500 index   looking at its holdings we see the stocks that it holds along with a small amount of bonds and cash to handle cash flow for people buying and sell shares   if we look at the vanguard s&p 500 etf ticker voo we see that it also tracks against the s&p 500 index   looking at its holdings we see they are very similar to the similar index mutual fund other companies like t. rowe price have similar offering   look at the t. rowe price equity index 500 fund ticker its holdings in stocks are the same as the similar vanguard fund and like the vanguard fund it also holds a small amount of bonds and cash to handle cash flow the only real difference between different products which track against the same index is in the expense ratio fees for managing the fund and in the small differences in the execution of the funds   for the most part execution of the funds do not really matter to most people it has a very small effect what matters is the expense the fees paid to own the fund   if we just compare the expense ratio of the vanguard and t. rowe price funds we see as of 27 feb 2016 vanguard has an expense ratio of 0.17 for it index mutual fund and 0.05 for its etf while t. rowe price has an expense ratio of 0.27   these are just the fees for the funds themselves there are also account maintenance fees which normally go down as the amount of money you have invested at a firm go up and in the case of etfs execution cost cost to trade the shares along with the difference between the bid and ask on the shares if you are just starting out i would say going with the index mutual fund would easier and most likely would cost less over all if you are buying a small amount of shares every month   when choosing a company look at the expense ratio on the funds and the account maintenance fees along with the account   vanguard is well known for having low fees and they in fact were the first to offer index mutual funds for more info on the s&p 500 index see also this investopedia entry on the s&p 500 index do not worry if this is all a bit confusing it is to most people myself included at first

it 's sad just how uninformed most of us are be default even a google search of most politicians will only bring up a summary and a bunch of opinion personally i just ca n't spend the time each election to figure out what the actual nature of the folks running might be stress from work needs or i 'll break down normal life stuff takes over most of the time and at the end of each day if i try and do any political research i 'll just fall asleep with it on my phone 's browser read half way through it 's impossible to look at every decision someone has made and figure out the reason without a of editorials so if their opponents want to wave a few flip around i 'd have no way of reliably working the truth from the lies not to mention that google et all filter my results so anything positive about people i do n't like and criticism of people i do like is buried beneath stuff that my bias   in the end it 's a mess that makes it impossible for me to do a damn thing if i wish to be a responsible voter so i just do n't vote this leaves the polls to those who vote with their hearts closed and wallets own

i do n't know what the op means when he says i want to invest in health insurance from now on so that i can use the policy after i retire generally a health insurance policy covers costs incurred during the current calendar year or specific period such as july 1 of one year through june 30 of the next year and does not cover future periods indeed many policies do not guarantee renewal when the current period ends with exceptions for employer provided coverage through cobra in case employment ends so investing in a health insurance policy meaning that you pay the premiums now and the insurance company provides the policy in the distant future is   something that is new to me besides what will the policy include if someone had bought such a policy many years ago say before cat scans and were developed would the policy cover such new developments or the policy would cover only those procedures tests and medications that are available when the policy is written and the insurance premiums start to be paid the long term health of the insurance company is also of some concern   when something is offered to me with a lifetime guarantee i ask my lifetime or the device 's life time or the company 's lifetime

once you declare the amount the cbp officials will ask you the source and purpose of funds you must be able to demonstrate that the source of funds is legitimate and not the proceeds of crime and it is not for the purposes of financing terrorism once they have determined that the source and purpose is legitimate they will take you to a private room where two officers will count and validate the amount as it is a large amount and then return the currency to you for nominal amounts they count it at the cbp officer 's inspection desk once they have done that you are free to go on your way the rule for the us is any currency or monetary instrument that is above the equivalent of 10,000 usd so this will also apply if you are carrying a combination of gbp eur and usd that totals to more than $ 10,000

first of all to answer the basic question is one method correct might it depend on local laws yes it does depend on local laws because ultimately the business will have to file forms with the county city   these forms are going to ask for the total sales based on the tax category tax free x% y% each transaction could have parts that fall into each category the local taxing authority decides what goes into each category the local taxing authority also determines how often the business needs to submit the taxes they can even decide to base the rates used by where the customer lives   a business is not required to charge directly for sales tax that is why frequently at sporting events the price on the menu notes that all sales taxes are included i suppose not directly charging a sales tax makes the monthly calculation harder but the state will still get their money rounding up at the end of the entire transaction is enough to make sure they collect enough taxes so they do n't have to dip into their profits

obviously the best way to consolidate the real estate loans is with a real estate loan mortgages being secured loans provide much better interest rates also interest can be deducted to some extent depending on how the proceeds are used but up to $ 100 k of the mortgage can have deductible interest just for using the primary residence as a collateral last but not least in many states mortgages on primary residence are non recourse again may depend on the money use that may prove useful if in the future your mother runs into troubles repaying it so yes your instincts are correct how to convince your mother that 's between you and her

starting and running a business in the us is actually a lot less complicated than most people think you mention incorporation but a corporation or even an s corp is n't generally the best entity to start a business with most likely you are going to want to form an llc instead this will provide you with liability protection while minimizing your paperwork and taxes the cost for maintaining an llc is relatively cheap $ a year depending on your state and you can file the paperwork to form it yourself or pay an attorney to do it for you generally i would avoid the snake oil salesman that pitch specific out of state llcs nevada delaware etc unless you have a specific reason or intend on doing business in the state   with the llc or a corporation you need to make sure you maintain separate finances if you use the llc funds to pay personal expenses you run the risk of loosing the liability protection afforded by the llc piercing the corporate veil with a single member llc you can file as a pass through entity and your llc income would pass through to your federal return and taxes are n't any more complicated than putting your business income on your personal return like you do now if you have employees things get more complex and it is really easiest to use a payroll service to process state and federal tax with holding   once your business picks up you will want to file quarterly tax payments in order to avoid an under payment penalty   generally most taxpayers will avoid the under payment penalty if they owe less than $ 1,000 in tax after subtracting their withholdings and credits or if they paid at least 90 of the tax for the current year or 100 of the tax shown on the return for the prior year whichever is smaller even if you get hit by the penalty it is only 10 of the amount of tax you did n't pay in time if you are selling a service such writing one off projects you should be able to avoid having to collect and remit sales tax but this is going to be very state specific if you are selling software you will have to deal with sales tax assuming your state has a sales tax one more thing to look at is some cities require a business license in order to operate a business within city limits so it would also be a good idea to check with your city to find out if you need a business license

tl dr i bonds do not fit well into most personal finance plans first the questions succinct reference i like your thought process weighing your liquidity and risk versus your return   this is very important   however i think you might be a bit by i bonds   i bonds are not generally good for personal investment as they are not marketable when necessary have redemption penalties and hold lower overall yields in general   finally they are significantly harder to trade as you can buy and hold a tips etf and get exposure to all maturities and get the current competitive rate all in one purchase inflation protection is in general an interesting problem   while inflation protected bonds sound like they are great for inflation protection after all it is in the name they may not be the best instruments for long medium term protection   it is really important to remember that inflation protected bonds have significantly lower returns and one form of inflation protection is to just have more money in the future   tips really protect against large inflation changes as normal bonds have the future expected inflation already baked in their higher rates also when you own a stock you own part of a company and inflation will increase the value of the company relative to the inflated currency   foreign stocks can give even more protection if you think inflation in your local currency is going to be higher then the foreign currency   stocks in the past have had significantly higher return overall than inflation protected bonds but have higher risk as well as a medium term low risk portfolio it is worth looking into some combination of tips normal bonds and a small to medium allocation of local foreign stocks all done through low fee mutual funds or index etfs

i do n't think so in your case unless the account generates so much interest income that it became reportable i do n't know the exact limit but i think it 's in the hundreds if not thousands of dollars you might get a 1099 form if it generates over $ 10 of interest income but you do n't have to file taxes if your overall income is too low anyways the us does not typically tax assets only income there are some states florida is the only one i can think of that has odd tax treatment of intangible assets but i doubt that would apply in your case if this were a large enough amount usually over $ 10,000 it might trigger some reporting requirements possibly by your home country

gt our corporations pay some of the lowest taxes in the world with some of the larger ones actually paying none   no they do n't the top marginal rate for income taxes is 38 meanwhile in the republic of ireland rates vary from 12.5 25 depending on the exact source of the income so no our corporations do not pay the lowest taxes in the world as far as them paying none that stems from one of two things one corporations that pay out all their money in salaries and therefore have no retained earnings hence all their money is taxed at the individual level and workers get at a full 35 and two corporations that create a price transfer agreement with a foreign corporation so that income is shifted to a low tax region where they end up paying nothing to uncle sam that money will still be taxed if they ever try to bring it home and distribute it but as long as it stays overseas then no one can touch it because technically it has n't been earned as income yet that 's how companies avoid greedy bastards trying to take their money because contrary to your opinion you 're not actually entitled to any of their money or anyone else 's money either it 's not your money or our money its their money and they have an effective method to make sure it stays that way   gt btw if wanting decent opportunity to take care of me and mine is greed then yes i 'm greedy    you can already do that it 's called getting a fucking job and living within your means you do n't deserve anything in life you have to earn it no one is obligated to just give you things just because you want them ultimately this whole lets sock it to the rich attitude does n't actually take any money out of their pockets the only people harmed are workers who ca n't take advantage of the methods they use to shift income overseas in short you 're not simply wrong you 're criminally ignorant

ca n't vouch for la but property typically is taxed at either the appraised value the most recent purchase price if it was n't worth that much you would n't have paid that much or some combination of the two usually highest of the two to prevent $ 1 and other goods and services from lowering the tax to zero you have now explicitly paid a total of $ 125k for the property the fact that you bought it in two stages should n't be relevant but should and law are only tangentially connected i 'd recommend asking a tax accountant who know your local practices unless someone here can give you an authoritative answer

the sale of shares on vesting matters in a way similar to how reinvested dividends are taxed but the newly purchased fund shares basis has to be increased you need to be sure to have the correct per share cost basis it 's easy to confuse the total rsu purchase with the correct numbers only what remained   the vesting stock is a taxable event ordinary income   you then own the stock at that cost basis a sale after that is long or short term and the profit is the to extent it exceeds that basis   the fact that you got these shares in 2013 means you should have paid the tax then and this is part two of the process of course the partial sale means a bit of math to calculate the basis of what remained

any way you look at it this is a terrible idea cars lose value   they are a disposable item that gets used up   the more expensive the car the more value they lose if you spend $ 100,000 on a new car in four years it will be worth less than $ 50,000   that is a lot of money to lose in four years in addition to the loss of value you will need to buy insurance which for a $ 100,000 car is incredible if your heart is set on this kind of car you should definitely save up the cash and wait to buy the car   do not get a loan   here is why your plan has you saving $ 1,300 a month $ 16,000 a year for 6.5 years before you will be able to buy this car   that is a lot of money for a long range goal   if you faithfully save this money that long and at the end of the 6.5 years you still want this car it is your money to spend as you want   you will have had a long time to reconsider your course of action but you will have sacrificed for a long time and you will have the money to lose   however you may find out a year into this process that you are spending too much money saving for this car and reconsider if instead you take out a loan for this car then by the time you decide the car was too much of a stretch financially it will be too late   you will be upside down on the loan and it will cost you thousands to sell the car so go ahead and start saving   if you have n't given up before you reach your goal you may find that in 6.5 years when it is time to write that check you will look back at the sacrifices you have made and decide that you do n't want to simply blow that money on a car consider a different goal   if you invest this $ 1300 a month and achieve 8 growth you will be a millionaire in 23 years you do n't need to take my word for it   look at the car you are interested in go to select the 2012 version of the car and look up the private sale value   you 'll most likely see a price that is about half of what a new one costs

it does make sense to combine debts and pay off the worst highest interest rate however if you ca n't get any loan you should focus on the worst debt and pay that off then take the same amount of money you were paying to the next worse debt and so on until you 're clean let 's look at an example debt a is at 5 debt b is at 10 and debt c is at 15 you are paying ab and c. on a monthly basis you save 100 € to pay off c. once c is payed off you keep on saving 100 € and add whatever you were paying to debt c to those savings this way you can pay off debt b at an increased rate when b is cleared you save 100 € + whatever you were paying to debt b and debt c to clear debt a. that 's the theory

the wikipedia page for repurchase agreement has two relevant pointers on this topic   the legal title for any securities used in a repo actually pass from seller to buyer during the term of the agreement in basic terms this means that if one sells a bond on repo with a promise to buy it back then the ownership actually transfers to the buyer for that period of time   if a coupon is paid during this time period it can either go to the buyer or the seller usually the coupon payment goes to the initial owner of the security pre repo our seller but sometimes the repurchase agreement will specify otherwise so again in basic terms usually the repo seller initial security owner receives any payments made during the term of the repurchase agreement both points are in the first paragraph of the section structure and terminology

yes not doing so would be like turning down a raise the best advice in almost every situation is to at least contribute up to the amount that the company will match so you get the full benefit one thing to clarify that you might not be understanding the vesting period is only for the money the company matches not your own investment even if you leave the company before the account is vested or fully vested you can transfer to a 401k at your new employer or roll over into an ira or take as taxable income and pay a penalty if it is an early withdrawal all your contributions together with any investment gains or losses that have occurred ditto whatever part of your employer match that has vested by the time you leave often the employer matching contributions are invested in the   same funds in the same proportions that you have chosen for your own contributions and thus will have incurred the same gains or losses as your own contributions but   what you are entitled to take with you is the part that has vested also you mention that it is unlikely that you will stay the entire 5 years however if you plan to at least stay a couple of years it makes sense to get the 20 40 etc of the match that you vest during your stay again it 's free money

definitely not with gift cards and to a lesser degree not even with debit cards   for most transactions they work the same but you 'll run into problems when dealing with situations where a hold is placed that 's higher than the transaction amount this is the norm with gas purchases at the time you run the card you do n't know how much gas you 're going to pump so they put through an authorization for some fixed amount say $ 75 or $ 100   if you do not have this much available it will fail and you ca n't use the card to purchase the gas   unless you 're living paycheck to paycheck the debit card should work in this case but the gift card very well might not i 've also seen this happen on a larger scale with a car rental   a co worker only had a debit card and the substantial hold the rental car place wanted to put on the card was unacceptable

i would advise against wasting this rare opportunity on mundane things like by paying off debts or buying toys you can always pay those from your wages plus you 'll inevitably accumulate new debts over time so debt repayment is an ongoing concern this large pile of cash allows you to do things you ca n't ordinarily do so use the opportunity to invest buy a house then rent it out rent an apartment for yourself the house rent will pay most maybe all of the mortgage plus the mortgage interest is tax deductible so you get a lower tax bill and houses appreciate over time so that 's an added bonus when you get married and start a family you 'll have a house ready for you partially paid off with other people 's money

as a legal contract a mortgage is a form of secured debt in the case of a mortgage the debt is secured using the property asset as collateral so no there is no such thing as a mortgage contract without a property to act as collateral is it a good idea   in the current low interest rate environment people with good income and credit can obtain a from their bank at a rate comparable to current mortgage rates   however if you wish to setup a credit line for an amount comparable to a mortgage then you will need to secure it with some form of collateral

the common opinion is an oversimplification at best the problem with buying a house using cash is that it may leave you cash poor forcing you to take out a home equity loan at some point which may be at a higher rate than the mortgage would have been on the other hand knowing that you have no obligation to a lender is quite nice and many folks prefer eliminating that source of stress if you can get a mortgage at a sufficiently low rate using it to leverage an investment is not a bad strategy average historical return on the stock market is around 8 so any mortgage rate lower than that is a relatively good bet and a rate much lower as now is that much better a bet there is of course some risk involved and the obligation to make mortgage payments and your actual return is reduced by what you 're paying on the mortage but it 's still a pretty good deal as far as investment vehicles the same answers apply as always you want a rate of return higher than what you 're paying on the mortgage preferably market rate of return or better cds wo n't do it as you 've found you 're going to have to increase the risk to increase the return that does mean picking and maintaining a diversified balance of investments and investment types working with index funds makes diversifying within a type easy but you 're probably going to want both stocks and bonds rebalancing between them when they drift too far from your desired mix   my own investments are a specific mix with one each of bond fund large cap fund small cap fund reit and international fund bonds are the biggest part of that since they 're lowest risk but the others play a greater part in producing returns on the investments the exact mix that would be optimal for you depends on your risk tolerance i 'm classified as a moderately aggressive investor the time horizon you 're looking at before you may be forced to pull money back out of the investments and some matters of personal taste i 've been averaging about 10 but i had the luxury of being able to ride out the depression and indeed invest during it against that my mortgage is under 4 interest rate and is for less than 80 of the purchase price so i did n't need to pay the surcharge for mortgage insurance in fact i borrowed only half the cost of the house and paid the rest in cash specifically because leveraging does involve some risk and this was the level of risk i was comfortable with i also set the duration of the loan so it will be paid off at about the same time i expect to retire again that 's very much a personal judgement if you need specific advice it 's worth finding a financial counselor and having them help you run the numbers do not go with someone associated with an investment house they 're going to be biased toward whatever produces the most income for them select someone who is strictly an advisor they may cost you a bit more but they 're more likely to give you useful advice do n't take my word for any of this i know enough to know how little i know but hopefully i 've given you some insight into what the issues are and what questions you need to ask and answer before making your decisions

it may have been the standard practice for a long time and indeed it still is the common practice for my credit union to apply all excess payment directly to the principal at the risk of sounding a little cynical i will suggest that there is a profit motive in the move to not applying excess payments to principal unless directly instructed to do so interest accrued is n't reduced until the principal is reduced so it benefits the creditor to both have the money in advance and to not apply it to the principal you should probably move forward with the expectation that all of your creditors are even if only in a passive aggressive manner

it means that supply of labor is greater than demand therefore wages are suppressed as people compete over the few jobs available   the unemployment rate is misleading because people drop off the statistic even though in a functional sense they 're still looking for work   many of the open positions available are n't in immediate need of filling a lot of job ads have laundry lists of nice to have qualities and skills that most experienced people do n't have    from the employer 's perspective they 'd rather hold out for the dream candidate and make existing employees work more unpaid overtime than take a risk hiring someone who does n't meet their dreams

interesting read i 'm not trying to get political with this post but it 's something that i found genuinely interesting while reading this article    my dad is an accountant for a large corporation and described tax law as 15 white 15 black and 70 gray i 'm sure that cat is n't the only company that is trying to avoid paying us corporate tax rates regardless of where it falls on the legality or white gray black spectrum this case may be somewhat of an outlier in that it 's pretty clear there was some shady tax avoidance and the tax sum is large $ yet i could n't help but feel that the amount of government intervention lawyer court fees whistle blower payout not to mention company productivity loss from the avoidance cleanup etc puts a on the expected value of this case for the general american citizen or tax payer   which leads me to my point there was some talk recently about the corporate tax rate being dropped down to 15 i 'm someone who generally leans left on issues but are there legitimate benefits to this it seems that large corporations simply employ huge teams of accountants to game the tax code and never end up paying anything close to the 30 would reducing the rate eliminate a lot of this tax avoidance behavior and result in more system efficiency while the government returns roughly equal sums of tax revenue from corporations it would obviously be beneficial to smaller businesses that ca n't afford the legal means necessary to pay lower rates as well    from a progressive standpoint my worry with dropping the rate is that companies would still find ways to simply squeeze more and more profit for the bottom line it 'd be interesting to find a way to leverage reducing the tax rate on large corporations by somehow tying it to increased pay and benefits to workers i 'm not sure of the proper implementation but letting corporations keep more of their money without the hassle of setting up 70 shell companies and incentivizing them to re invest in workers r&amp;d etc makes more sense than companies never paying 30 and even when caught for illegal acts being tied up in court for 10 years    i 'll end here because i 'm beginning to ramble a bit but the article was interesting for viewing corporate taxation on a system wide level

i agree with all the people against working for free but i 'll also have a go at answering the question when do i see money related to that 5 is it only when they get    bought or is there some sort of quarterly payout of profits it 's up to the shareholders of the company whether and when it pays dividends a new startup will typically have a small number of people perhaps 1 3 who between them control any shareholder vote the and an investor if they 're offering you 5 chances are they 've made sure your vote will not matter but some companies an equity partnership springs to mind might be structured such that control is genuinely distributed you would want to check what the particular situation is in this company assuming the founders main investors have control those people or that person will decide whether to pay dividends so you can ask them their plans to realise money from the company it is very rare for startups to pay any dividends this is firstly because they 're rarely profitable but even when they are profitable the whole point of a startup is to grow so there are plenty of things to spend cash on other than payouts to shareholders paying anything out to shareholders is the opposite of receiving investment so unless you 're in the very unusual position of a startup that will quickly make so much money that it does n't need investment and is planning to pay out to shareholders rather than spend on growth then no it will not pay out one way for a shareholder to exit is to be bought out by other shareholders for example if they want to get rid of you then they might make you an offer for your 5 this can be any amount they think you 'll take given the situation at the time if you do n't take it there may be things they can do in future to reduce its value to you see below if you do take it then your 5 would pay you once when you leave if the company succeeds commonly it will be wholly or partly sold either privately or by ipo at this point if it 's wholly sold then the soon to be ex shareholders at the time will receive the proceeds of the sale if it 's partly sold then as with an investment round it 's up for negotiation what happens for example i believe the cash from an ipo of x% of the company could be taken into the company leaving the shareholders with no immediate direct payout but of shares in their names that they 're more or less free to sell or retain and receive future dividends alternatively if the company settles down as a small private business that 's no longer in startup mode it might start paying out without a sale if the company fails as most startups do it will never pay anything it 's very important to remember that it 's the shareholders at the time who receive money in proportion to their holding or as defined by the company articles if there are different classes of share just because you have 5 now does n't mean you 'll have 5 by that time because any new investment into the company in the mean time will dilute your shareholding it works like this note that i 've assumed for simplicity that the new investment comes in at equal value to the old investment this is n't necessarily the case it can be more or less according to the terms of the new investment voted for by the shareholders so the first line really is nominal value not necessarily the actual cash the founders put in therefore you should not think of your 5 as 5 of what you imagine a company like yours might eventually exit for at best think of it as 5 of what a company like yours might exit for if it receives no further investment whatsoever ah but wo n't the founders also have their holdings diluted and lose control of the company so they would n't do that well not necessarily look carefully at whether you 're being offered the same class of shares as the founders if not consider whether they can dilute your shares without diluting their own look also at whether a new investor could use the founders executive positions to give them new equity in the same way they gave you old equity without giving you any new equity look at whether the founders will themselves participate in future investment rounds using of cash that they own from other ventures when you ca n't afford to keep up look at whether new investors will receive a priority class of share that 's guaranteed at exit to pay out a certain multiple of the money invested before the older inferior classes of shares receive anything vcs like to do this at least in the uk look at any other tricks they can legally pull even if the founders are n't inclined to be tricky they may eventually be forced to consider pulling them by a future new investor and when i say look i mean get your lawyer to look if your shareholding survives until exit then it will pay out at exit but repeated and investors with priority classes of shares could mean that your holding does n't survive to exit even if the company does your 5 could turn into a nominal holding that has n't really survived that entitles you to 0.5 of any sale value over $ 100 million then if the company sells for $ 50 million you get $ 0 while other investors are getting a good return all of this is why you should not work for equity unless you can afford to work for free and even then you need to lawyer up now and during any future investment so your lawyer can explain to you what your investment actually is which almost certainly is different from what it looks like at a casual uninformed glance

the concept of emergency fund is a matter of opinion i can tell you the consensus is that one should have 6 9 months worth of expenses kept as liquid cash this is meant to cover literally all bills that you might encounter during that time   that 's a lot of money there are levels of savings that are shy of this but still responsible not enough to cover too much in case of job loss but enough to cover the busted transmission the broken water heater etc this is still more than many people have saved up but it 's a worthy goal   the doctor visit is probably the lowest level even without insurance the clinic visit should be under $ 200 and this should n't cause you to have to carry that amount beyond the time the bill comes in   the point that should n't be ignored is that if you owe money at 18 on a credit card the emergency fund is costing you money and is a bit misguided i 'd send every cent i could to the highest rate card and not have more than a few hundred $ $ liquid until the cards were at zero   last $ 5 k $ 10 k in the emergency account is great unless you are foregoing matched 401(k dollars to do it all just my opinion others here whom i respect might disagree with parts of my answer and they 'd be right    edit regarding the consensus 6 9 months i suggest   from investopedia using the conservative recommendation to sock away eight    worth of living expenses the article strongly support my range for the fact that it both cites consensus yet disagrees with it   from money under 30 the more difficult you rank your ability to find a new job the more    we suggest you save up to a year ’s worth of expenses if you think    your income would be very difficult to replace from bank of america    i have no issue with those comfortable with less a dual income couple who is saving 30 of their income may very well survive one person losing a job with no need to tap savings and any emergency expense can come from next month 's income that couple may just need this month 's bills in their checking account

a roth ira is simply a tax sheltered account that you deposit funds into and then invest however you choose within the limits of the firm you deposit the funds with for example you could open a roth ira account with vanguard   you could then invest the $ 3000 by purchasing shares of voo which tracks the s&p 500 index and has a very low expense ratio 0.04 as of last time i checked   fidelity has a similar option or schwab or whatever brokerage firm you prefer iras are basically just normal investment accounts except they do n't owe taxes until you withdraw them and roth do n't even owe them then though you paid taxes on the funds you deposit   they have some limitations regarding options trading and such but if you 're a novice investor just looking to do basic investments you 'll not notice    then your ira would go up or down in value as the market went up or down in value you do have some restrictions on when you can withdraw the funds roth ira has fewer than a normal ira as you can withdraw the capital the amount you deposited without penalty but the profits can not be withdrawn until you 're retirement age i wo n't put an actual year as i suspect that actual year will change by the time you 're that old but think 60s the reason not to invest in an ira is if you plan on using the money in the near future even as an emergency fund   you should have some money that is not invested aggressively that is in something very safe and very accessible for your emergency fund and if you plan to buy a house or whatever with the funds do n't start an ira   but if this is truly money you want to save for retirement that 's the best place to start note this is not investment advice and you should do your own homework prior to making any investment   you can lose some or all of the value of your account while investing

there is no typical return for an ira understand that an ira is not an investment type it is just an account that gets special tax treatment by the federal government the money in the ira could be invested in almost anything including gold stocks bonds cash cds etc so the question as phrased is n't exactly meaningful it is kind of like asking what is the typical price of things if i use $ 10 bills as for a annualized return on your portfolio that 's not a bad return at that rate you will double your investment with compounding every 7.2 years again however some context is needed you can really only evaluate investment returns with your risk profile in mind if you are invested in super safe investments like cds that is an absolutely incredible return you compare it to several indexes which is a good way to do it if you are investing in the types of investments tracked by those indexes

with 150 k € to invest to become a landlord you have several options pay for 100 of one property and you then will make a significant percentage of the monthly rent as profit each month that profit can be used to invest in other things or to save to buy additional properties at the end of the 21 years in your example you can sell the flat for return of principal minus selling expenses or even better make a profit because the property went up in value pay 20 down on 5 flats and then make a much a smaller profit per flat each month due to the mortgage payment for each one at the end of the 21 years sell the flats assuming that a significant portion of the mortgage is paid off each flat will sell for more than the mortgage balance thus you will have 5 nice large profits when you sell something in between 1 and 5 flats each has different risks and expenses with 5 rental properties you are more likely to use a management company which will add to your monthly cost

you should call your plan administrator and ask few plans allow people to take a hardship withdraw after leaving because their is no way to pay the funds back since you are no longer working there the repayment process is done via payroll deduction usually also you will most likely be required to withhold 20 for taxes from the 401k there is no way to defer the taxation unless you take it   next calendar year you may want to consider doing a rollover into an ira and taking the w d and you can do a 60 day rollover you only get 1 per rolling 12 months now rather than account do to a change in the rule ira 's not 401k do give you flexible withholding so you do n't have to pay taxes today though they would still be in the tax year based on the calendar date taken out so if you take it out in 2015 your going to be paying them at the end of this year when you file in april of 2016 your question seems to be mixing characteristics of both 401k and ira and while they are similar they do operate very differently

consider the mechanic which actually drives the price of a stock in simplest terms the price of a stock is the price at which the most recent trade occurred ie if the price of ibm is $ 100/share that means the last time someone bought ibm stock they paid $ 100 above and below the spot price are dozens hundreds thousands of buyers and sellers who have placed orders that no one is yet willing to match ie if ibm 's spot price is at $ 100 there could still be 10,000 people willing to sell for $ 101 called the ask price for the lowest price someone is currently willing to sell at and 15,000 willing to buy for $ 99 called the bid price for the highest price someone is currently willing to buy for   until someone is willing to buy for $ 101 then no one will be able to sell at $ 101 until someone is willing to sell for $ 99 no one will be able to buy for $ 99 typically orders are placed in the market at a particular limit meaning that those orders to buy at $ at $ 101 are already in the system and will be matched immediately as soon as someone is willing to meet the price on the other side now consider general market economics high demand drives up price and high supply drives down price if the details above for ibm were yesterday and today some news came out that ibm was laying off employees imagine that another 10,000 people who held shares wanted to sell now there would be 20,000 sellers and only 15,000 buyers if those new sellers were aggressive about wanting to sell they would have to drop their price to $ 99 to match the highest buyers in the market put together this means that as more sellers enter the market supply of shares increases driving down price conversely as more buyers enter the market demand for shares increases driving up share price as a result of the above you can say that all else being equal if price for a stock goes up there were more buyers that day and if price goes down there were more sellers that day on the face of it that is not necessarily true because you could have the same number of buyers and sellers one side could have simply decreased increased their acceptable price to match the other side

i 'm assuming that you 're in the us   in that case the answer is that it depends on how your company set up its reimbursement plan   the irs recognizes accountable and plans   accountable plans have to meet certain requirements   anything else is   if you are reimbursed according to an accountable plan this is not income and should not be reported to the irs at all   if you are reimbursed under a plan then this is income but you might be able to get a deduction on your tax return if you itemize most established companies have accountable plans for normal business expenses more detail from irs

this sounds like a rental fee as described in the instructions for the 1099-misc    enter amounts of $ 600 or more for all types of rents such as     any of the following non employee compensation does not seem appropriate because you did not perform a service you mention that your tax preparer brought this up   i think you will need to consult with a cpa to receive a more reliable opinion   make sure to bring the contract that describes the situation with you   from there you may need to consult a tax attorney but the cpa should be able to help you figure out what your next step is

i will expand on bacon 's comment when you are married and you acquire any kind of property you automatically get a legal agreement   in most states that property is owned jointly and while there are exceptions that is the case most of the time    when you are unmarried there is no such assumption of joint acquisition   while words might be said differently between the two parties if there is nothing written down and signed then courts will almost always assume that only one party owns the property   now unmarried people go into business all the time but they do so by creating legally binding agreements that cover contingencies   if you two do proceed with this plan it is necessary to create those documents with the help of a lawyer   although expensive paying for this protection is a small price in relation to what will probably be one of the largest purchases in your lives however i do not recommend this   if clayton can and wants to buy a home he should   emma can rent from clayton   that rent could any amount the two agree on including zero   if the two do get married well then emma will end up owning any equity after that date   if they stay together until death it is likely that she or her heirs will own half of it anyway   also if this house is sold the equity pass into larger house they buy after marriage then that will be owned jointly if they do break up the break up is clean and neat   presumably she would have paid rent anyway so nothing is lost   many people run into trouble having to sell at a bad time in a relationship that coincides with a weak housing market   in that case both parties lose    so much like bacon 's advice i would not buy jointly   there is no upside and you avoid a lot of downside do n't play house by buying a home jointly when you are unmarried

retail purchases are purchases made at retail i.e. as a consumer individual customer that would include any standard individual expenditure but may exclude wholesale sales or purchases from merchants who identify themselves as service providers to businesses specifics of these limitations really depend on your card issuer and you should inquire with the customer service at what are their specific eligibility requirements as an example here in the us many cards give high cash back for gasoline purchases but only at retail locations that excludes wholesale club sellers like costco for example

hence new employer pays a part of the salary as per diem compensation    along with regular salary and says that per diem compensation is    non taxable per diem is not taxable but that is not what you 're describing it appears that either you or the prospective employer misunderstood what per diem is as per us law is it legally allowed non taxable per diem compensation    to employees yes what are the pros and cons of having per diem compensation per diem is not compensation it is not part of your salary it is not part of your employment contract if i have to report my salary to any one like banks insurance    companies do i need to include per diem compensation or not no because it is not compensation back to the first item per diem is paid to you during business trips when you 're away from your tax home it is not part of your compensation and is only allowed for business trips contract work on site for any prolonged period of time 1 year or more as a definitive rule but can be less is not a business trip for that period of time your tax home becomes that location so you 're not away you 're home you should discuss it with a licensed tax adviser ea cpa licensed in your state but it seems to me that either you misunderstood something or your prospective employer is trying to evade taxes both yours and his by part of your compensation as per diem it is very likely that when you get caught the employer will just issue you 1099 on the amounts and leave you hanging

i have been following some of these threads some of them are really old i have read used recording to equity accounts to resolve the imbalance usd issue the thing i noticed is that all my imbalances occur when paying bills i took all the bills and set them up as vendor accounts entered the bills in the new bills and used the process payment when paying bills the imbalance issue stopped it makes sense the system is a double entry that 's it will credit and debit assets accounts are increased with a debit and decreased with a credit equity accounts are increased with a credit and decreased with a debit ie say you have an monthly insurance bill for $ 100 you enter it into the new vendor bill this credits accounts payable when paying the bill it credits checking debits account payable credits vendor account debits the expense insurance in short for each credit there has to be a debit for the books to balance when there is no account for it to record to it will record in imbalance usd to balance the books

if you could find a breakdown i suspect that it would show not just that they are self employed but own their own company there are many people that are self employed many of them make a good living at it but are not millionaires   my neighbour the plumber is a perfect example of this sort of self employed and comfortable but not rich person the key to wealth growth is to own a significant part of a company   it one way to leverage a smaller amount of money to something much larger   your profits back in to the company to grow it pay yourself reasonably for some time as the company grows   after it is some size you can afford to pay yourself more of the profits if not sell it as a going concern to someone else one last thought i am assuming that your book is claiming that they made their money through self employment instead of choosing to become self employed   after striking rich somewhere   if i were to win the lottery i might then become a self employed something but in that case it was not my self employment that got me there

they are using several banks hedge funds or other financial institutions in order to diversify the risk inherent to the fact that the firm holding a fraction of their cash can be insolvent which would makes them incur a really big loss also the most available form of cash is very often reinvested everyday in and any other highly liquid products so that it can be available quickly if needed since they are aware that they are not likely to need all of their cash in one day they also use longer terms or less liquid investments bonds stocks etc

there may be differences in different contexts but here 's my general understanding rate of return or return on investment is the total gain or loss of an investment divided by the initial investment amount   e.g. if you buy stock for $ 100 and later sell it for $ 120 you have a 20 rate of return   you would have a 20 ror regardless of if you sell it tomorrow or in a year internal rate of return is effectively annualized   it is the annual rate at which each of a series of cashflows is discounted that would give you a net present value of 0   meaning if you spent $ 100 today and in exactly one year you received $ 120 back you would have an irr of 20   if you received the $ 120 back in 6 months your irr would be roughly 40 an irr calculation can include multiple cashflows at various times while ror is in my mind the total net gain or loss relative to the investment irrespective of the time of the cash flows irr is more effective when comparing investments that have different time horizons   spending $ 100 to get $ 120 tomorrow is much better from an irr perspective than getting $ 120 two years from now since you could take that $ 20 gain and invest it for the rest of the two years

using fundamental and technical analysis together is actually a good idea for longer term trading of up to 6 months or longer   the whole idea behind trading with technical analysis is to increase the probabilities of a trade going in the desired direction by using uncorrelated indicators that produce the same signal to buy or sell at the same time for example you might use a moving average ma as a buy signal when the price falls for a few days hits the ma and then reverses and starts moving back up if however you also include a stochastic oscillator so to indicate when the stock is oversold under 20 and if the price rebounds from the ma average at the same time as the stochastic is crossing over in the oversold position then this may be a higher probability trade if you also only trade stocks that are fundamentally healthy as fundamentally good stocks are more likely to go up than fundamentally bad stocks then this might increase the probabilities again then if you only buy when the market as a whole is moving up then this will increase your chances again a few weeks ago at a seminar the the men in the room to be 76 and the women in the room to be 8 he then asked what will most likely be the next person to walk in the room a man or a woman the statistics are on the side of a wan walking in next this is what we try to do with technical analysis increase our chances when we take a trade of course a woman could be the next person to walk in the room just like any trade can go against you and this is why we use money management and risk management and take a small loss when a trade does go against you lets look at an example where you could incorporate fa with ta to increase your chances of profits   above is a candlestick chart of select harvest the green line above the price is the perceived value the pink line is the 40 day ma the blue line is the eps and the white lines is the stochastic oscillator above 80 being overbought and below 20 is oversold from feb 2015 to start of aug 2015 the stock was uptrending since then the price reversed and started to downtrend the stock was determined to be fundamentally good early in 2015 with the perceived value gradually increasing and greater than the share price and the eps starting to increase regularly from mid april thus as the stock is seen as fundamentally healthy any price reversal in the vicinity of the ma could be seen as a buy opportunity in fact there where 2 such opportunities on 31st march and 11th june where price had reversed and rebounded off the ma the so crossed over in or near the oversold area the price did reverse and then rebounded off the ma again on 9th july however the so was not in or near the oversold area on this occasion so not as high in probability terms the price still rebounded and went up again however another momentum indicator not shown here shows some bearish divergence in this case so another reason to possibly keep away at this point in time a good signal to get out of the trade that is your stop loss has not already taken you out is when the price breaks and closes below the ma line this occurred on 7th august so if we had bought on the first signal on 31st march for $ and sold when the priced broke through the ma on 7th august for $ we would have made a profit of approx 59 in just over 4 months if bought on the second signal on 11th june for $ 9.98 and again sold on 7th august for $ we would have made about 18 in under 2 months so the fundamentals the price in relation to ma and the so where all lining up to provide two high probability trades of course you would need to incorporate you risk management including stops in case the price did not continue upwards after you bought if the market is also moving up on the day of the signal this will further increase your chances   unless you day trade which i would avoid a good way to enter your trades after a signal is to enter a stop buy order after market close to buy if the price moves above the high of the signal day that way if the market and the stock open and move lower during the day after the signal you avoid entering the trade altogether this can be incorporated as part of your risk management and trading rules after the price broke down through the ma we can see that a downtrend which is still current today in fact i just took a short trade on this stock yesterday we can also see that the perceived value whilst still above the price has reached a peak and is currently moving downwards and the eps after being flat for a few months has just moved down for the first time in 10 months so maybe the fundamentals are starting to a bit on this stock it may be a good stock to continue shorting into the future so basically you can continue using fundamental analysis to select which stocks to buy place them in a watch list and then use technical analysis to determine when these stocks are starting to uptrend and use a combination of uncorrelated indicators to produce higher probability signals for when to enter your trades

the short answer is that you would want to use the net inflow or net outflow aka profit or loss    in my experience you 've got a couple different uses for irr and that may be driving the confusion   pretty much the same formula but just coming at it from different angles    thinking about a stock or mutual fund investment you could project a scenario with an up front investment net outflow in the first period and then positive returns dividends then final sale proceeds each a net inflow in subsequent periods   this is a model that more closely follows some of the logic you laid out thinking about a business project or investment you tend to see more complicated and less smooth cashflows   for example you may have a large up front capital expenditure in the first period then have net profit revenue less ongoing maintenance expense then another large capital outlay and so on    in both cases you would want to base your analysis on the net inflow or net outflow in each period   it just depends on the complexity of the cashflows trend as to whether you see a straightforward example initial payment then ongoing net inflows or a less straightforward example with both inflows and outflows    one other thing to note you would only want to include those costs that are applicable to the project   so you would not want to include the cost of overhead that would exist even if you did not undertake the project

as others have noted us law says that if you have over half the bill it 's worth the full value under half is worth nothing i presume if it is very close to half if even careful measurements show that you have you 'll have difficulty cashing it in precisely because the government and the banking system are n't going to allow themselves to be easily fooled by someone cutting bills in half and then trying to redeem both halves i 've seen several comments on here about how you 'd explain to the bank how so many bills were cut in half what if you just told them the truth not the part about killing someone of course but tell them that you made a deal neither of you wanted to bother with complex contracts and having to go to court if the other side did n't pay up so your buddy cut all the bills in half etc as you now have both halves and they clearly have the same serial number this no real evidence of fraud okay this is technically illegal 18 us code section whoever cuts or or or together or does any other thing to any bank bill draft note or other evidence of debt issued by any national banking association or federal reserve bank or the federal reserve system with intent to render such bank bill draft note or other evidence of debt unfit to be shall be fined under this title or not more than six months or both but you did n't do it the other guy did i presume the point of this law is to say that you ca n't get a hold of currency belonging to someone else and it so as to make it worthless as he 's now given you both halves i doubt anyone would bother to track him down and prosecute him just btw while checking up on the details of the law i stumbled across 18 usc 336 which says that it 's illegal to write a check for less than $ 1 with penalties of 6 months in prison i just got a check from at&t for 15 cents for one of those class action suits where the lawyers get $ 100 million and the victims get 15 cents each apparently that was illegal

the purpose is to go public but also to generate more wealth the real money comes when market values you at a price more than your cash flow if a company brings in $ 1000 of cash flow then that is what the employees and owners have to distribute among themselves but if they are likely to increase to $ 2000 next and $ 4000 next year and they go public then the stock will do well in this case the promoters and employees with options rsus will benefit as well the increased visibility is also very useful look at google or fb they did n't need the ipo proceed when they went public they had enough cash from their business but then they would only have $ 1 10 billion a year but due to the ipo their investors and employees have a huge net worth   basically with just a small of shares in the public you can value the company at a high price valuing in the future cash flows with a discount rate etc so instead of realizing the profit over the next 15 years you get to enjoy it right away

in layman 's terms oil on the commodities market has a spot price and a future price the spot price is what the last guy paid to buy a barrel of oil right now and thus a pretty good indicator of what you 'll have to pay the futures price is what the last guy paid for a futures contract where they agreed to buy a barrel of oil for $ x at some point in the future futures contracts are a form of hedging a futures contract is usually sold at a price somewhere between the current spot price and the true expected future spot price the buyer saves money versus paying the spot price while the seller still makes a profit but the buyer of a futures contract is basically betting that the spot price as of delivery will be higher while the seller is betting it will be lower futures contracts are available for a wide variety of acceptable future dates and form a curve when plotted on a graph that will trend in one direction or the other now as chad said oil companies basically get their cut no matter what oil stocks are generally a good long term bet as far as the best short term time to buy in to an oil stock look for very short windows when the spot and near future price of gasoline is trending downward but oil is still on the uptick during those times the oil companies are paying their existing high contracts for oil but when the spot price is low it affects futures prices which will affect the oil companies margins day traders will see that the sky is falling and sell off driving the price down temporarily that 's when you buy in pretty much the only other time an oil stock is a guaranteed win is when the entire market takes a swan dive and then bottoms out oil has such a built in demand for the foreseeable future that regardless of how bad it gets you will make money on an oil stock so when the entire market 's in a panic and everyone 's heading for gold t debt etc buy the major oil stocks across the spectrum even if one stock tanks chances are really good that another company will see that and offer a buyout jacking the bought company 's stock which you then sell and reinvest the cash into the buying company which will have taken a hit on the news due to the huge drop in working capital of course the one thing to watch for in the headlines is any news that renewables have become much more attractive than oil you wait in the next few decades some enterprising individual will invent a super efficient solar cell that provides all the power a real practical car will ever need and that is simultaneously integrated into wind farms making oil gas plants when that happens oil will be a thing of the past

i think   the cleanest way to do this is to rent the house from your father for 2 years possibly adding an option to buy at a set price to the lease agreement   that takes care of any gift issues and avoids complications like you living in a house that you could n't afford to own otherwise   if when you are able to afford a mortgage get a mortgage on the house and buy it from your father    will a bank be willing to take out a mortgage on a house that i technically own for the full amount i would not take out a mortgage for anything more than 80 of the house 's market value   anything more than that and you need to pay mortgage insurance which will increase your monthly payment for no benefit to you    my biggest concern is that you wo n't be able to afford an 80 mortgage after 2 years   if your father really wants to keep the house in the family then he should either keep the house and rent it to you or give you the down payment as a gift keeping under the maximum gift to avoid taxes if neither you or your father can not afford the house you may have no choice but to sell it   i would not advise you make a bad financial decision purely for sentimental reasons

this is probably a very opinion based but anyway my solution to such questions is to have multiple layers of emergency funds i have one amount in a bank account that i do not like to tap but can and do when i need money this is most close to your infrequent but not completely surprising moments of cash need i have a second layer in the form of stocks as i understand that selling stocks should not be done when you need money but when the stock price is good this provides a fairly high barrier to selling it on a whim before i do so especially if the stock price is n't at a local max it would have to be an emergency my third layer is even more fixed investment which i ca n't access with online brokerage the physical aspect makes sure that it has to be a real serious emergency before i turn that into cash if you have such a layered approach the question is not black and white anymore and easier to answer

gift tax is owed by the giver not the recipient so my first guess is that you can make the transfer in your home country and as the givers will not be subject to us tax it wo n't apply at all you can then transfer the money into the us freely in any case there 's a lifetime exemption of 1mn usd so unless non us persons do n't get the exemption i ca n't see the tax being a problem anyway unless there are going to be several more such transfers

i think it may be best to take everything you 're asking line by line once you buy stocks on x day of the month the chances of stocks never actually going above and beyond your point of value on the chart are close to none this is not true companies can go out of business or take a major hit and never recover   take volkswagen for example in 2015 due to a scandal they were involved in their stocks went downhill now their stocks are starting to rise again the investors goal is not to wait as long as necessary to make a profit on every stock purchase but to make the largest profit possible in the shortest time possible sometimes this means selling a stock before it recovers if it ever does i think the problem with most buyers is that they desire the most gain they can possibly have however that is very risky this can be true every investor needs to gauge the risk they 're willing to take and high gain investments are riskier   therefore it 's better to be winning small medium amounts of money of the time than any amount of money < ~25 safer investments do tend to yield more consistent returns but this does n't mean that every investor should aim for low yield investments again this is driven by the investor 's risk tolerance to conclude profitable companies stock tends to increase over time and less aggressive investments are safer but it is possible to lose from any stock investment

this is a poor example really it 's not necessary to measure inequality from the position of a janitor it 's more illustrative to measure it from the educated middle class who have also fallen sharply in household wealth relative to the 1 this trend is more surprising and disturbing as it runs counter to the great 20th century trend of a rising middle class   if you want to understand inequality just look at the rate of investment and the relative rate of return achieved by the 1   not only is the wealth of the 1 increasing it is increasing at a faster rate    needless to say that difference compounds over time   until we have an extended period of the wealthy losing money at a faster rate than the less wealthy inequality will rise and also needless to say that scenario is forever and always unacceptable to the 1   it 's easy to talk about solutions to inequality right up until someone asks how are we going to make the wealthy less wealthy in a relative sense   at which point you realize there are no serious efforts being made against inequality

usually there are annual or semi annual reports for a mutual fund that may give an idea for when a fund will have distributions which can cause the nav to fall as this is when the fund passes the taxable liabilities to shareholders in the form of a dividend alternatively the prospectus of the fund may also have the data on the recent distribution history that is likely what you want if you do n't understand why a fund would have a distribution i highly suggest researching the legal structure of an open end mutual fund where there more than a few rules about how taxes are handled for this case

i would normally take a cautious it depends approach to answering a question like this but instead i 'm going to give you a blunt opinionated answer based solely on what i would do even the crap get rid of them and get into the boring low fee mutual funds   i was in a similar situation a few years ago almost my retirement accounts were already in funds but my brokerage account was all individual stocks   i decided i did n't really know what i was doing despite being up by i recognize that it was mostly due to the market itself being up i was lucky basically the way i cashed out was not to sell all at once i just set up trailing stops on all of them and waited until they hit the stops the basic idea was that if the market kept going up the point at which they got sold also went up it was like a 10 trail i think and once things started to turn for that stock they would sell automatically   sure i sold some at very temporary dips so i missed out on some gains but that 's always a risk with a trailing stop and i really did n't care at that point   if i had to do it again i might forget all that and just sell all at once   but i feel a lot better not being in individual stocks

you can not claim back vat what happens is that if you sell goods with vat and charge customers vat you would have to send that vat straight to hmrc but if your business itself paid vat then you already paid vat so you have to send less   as an example if you send an invoice for £ 10,000 plus £ 2,000 vat and you paid yourself £ 500 vat on business related expenses then you need to send £ 2,000 £ 500 = £ 1,500 to hmrc   but if you do n't send invoices including vat then you owe hmrc £ 0 any vat you paid on business related expenses is lost hmrc wo n't pay you money   btw only vat on business related expenses can be deducted so if you want to be smart register for vat and get the vat on your weekly shopping bill refunded forget it

time value of money the simple calculation for this is fv = pv which reads the future value is equal to the present value times 1 plus the interest rate multiplied by itself by the number of periods that will pass a simple way to look at this is that if interest rates were a dollar would be worth where n is the number of years passing   the concept of compound interest can not be separated from the above compounding is accounting for the interest on the interest that has accrued in prior periods if i lend you a dollar at 6 simple interest for 30 years you would pay me back $ 1 + $ or $ 2.80 but 1.06 ^ 30 = so that dollar compounded at 6 annually for 30 years is $ quite a difference   often the time value of money is discussed in light of inflation a dollar today is not the same dollar as 30 years ago or 30 years hence in fact inflation has eroded the value of the dollar by a factor of 3 over the past 30 years an average item costing $ 100 would now cost $ 300 so when one invests at the very least they try to stay ahead of inflation and seek additional return for their risk   one of compounding is the rule of 72 this rule states that if you divide the interest rate into the number 72 the result is the number of years to double so 10 per year will take about 7.2 years to double 8 9 years etc it 's not 100 precise but a good back of napkin calculation   when people talk about the total payments over the thirty year life of a mortgage they often ignore the time value of money that payment even ten years from now has far less value than the same payment today

the united nations is already working on stripping us of our world reserve currency status so are the brics people think we need to maintain the status quo and give a specific country the world reserve currency there are serious discussions to create a neutral global currency so no country has an edge   i found a lot of posts on the topic but am linking to a really interesting post from a well known publication   gt;the us dollar is getting close to losing its status as the world ’s reserve currency should it cross the line the 2008 financial crisis could look like a summer storm yes worries about insolvency in europe dominate the headlines last week standard amp poor ’s cut spain ’s bond rating to a clear sign that europe ’s financial crisis is far from over but america ’s escalating debt problem is far more likely to a truly global crisis because the dollar has for decades played such a central role in the world economy how bad is the us problem former treasury official lawrence recently pointed out that investors are us bonds and notes the lack of other buyers forced the federal reserve to buy a stunning 61 percent of the total net issuance of us government debt last year like many others he warns that ballooning debt puts the us economy at risk for a sharp correction   reuters the greenback ’s losing to the yuan   but the even larger risk is the potential loss of the dollar ’s reserve currency status a key support of the world economy for the last four decades it started with the 1973 saudi commitment to accept only us dollars as payment for oil followed by opec ’s 1975 agreement to trade only in dollars trading of other commodities came to be priced in dollars reinforcing the dollar ’s reserve status as a result central banks worldwide have held onto large reserves of dollars to facilitate trade that in turn has enabled the us to print much larger amounts of its currency with seemingly little inflationary consequences it ’s also made it easier for americans to import more than they export to consume more than they produce and to spend more than they earn but all that is changing rapidly a number of countries are abandoning the dollar for the chinese yuan last december japan and china agreed to trade in yen and yuan in january the 10 nations of the association of southeast asian nations finalized a non dollar credit agreement equivalent to $ 240 billion strengthening their links with china japan and south korea that same month chinese premier signed a currency swap agreement with the united arab which holds 7 percent of the world ’s oil reserves iran has agreed to accept rubles and yuan in trade with russia and china and now is trading oil with india in rupees and gold in late march the china development bank agreed with its counterparts in brazil russia india and south africa to eschew dollar lending and extend credit to each other in their own respective currencies with global demand for dollars falling central banks around the world will inevitably reduce their dollar reserves that selloff further weakens the dollar against other currencies and in turn drives up inflation all this comes as us federal debt is soaring adding to concerns about the future value of that debt and of the dollar it ’s suddenly much easier to imagine a dollar collapse which would be a highly unexpected occurrence known as a black swan event this would unprecedented disruption because the dollar remains the world ’s most important currency let ’s hope we can avert a global crisis triggered by reckless us government spending what ’s needed is new leadership in washington with the courage to get our fiscal house in order and to defend the dollar against attack in a competitive global market   here is another opinion on the topic   edit let me add if we are constantly adding stimulus from the central banks we are going to be seriously the faith the rest of the world has in us as well the fed was the buyer of what like 10 of our bonds before the crisis now they are buying 60 we have using quantitative easing and stimulus for three years to fix the economy if we were suddenly having a recovery that would be fine because people would know we would be ready to start paying down our debts however we have spent trillions and our gdp growth is about two thirds the average since that 's a sign that there is something wrong with our economy right now clearly not an argument to end stimulus because without it we would be in a major depression the problem is that once people realize that they will question how stable our economy really is   your argument that we are the most stable economy in the world and deserve the reserve currency status is circular logic we have had the reserve currency status since 1944 that has helped us maintain the stability the rest of the world has n't enjoyed for a very long time without it we may never have become anything near the country we are today it gave us access to tremendous capital which we were able to use to expand our nation incredibly we have built an empire on our ability to take on massive amounts of debt i am sure we would have been a superpower without it but no one can say how much or how harder other recessions would have been if we had never been granted that privilege

these government mandates of minimum wage will cause more problems than they will solve i do n't know how many of you own a small business but i can give you a real world example here in the city of chicago on july 1st 2017 the minimum wage will increase to $ while at the same time they 're introducing a .01 per oz sugar tax   the amount of additional work needed to keep track of sugar consumption will be burdensome for small businesses who will have to raise prices to accommodate the new labor costs and tax customers are price sensitive so they will usually go for the cheaper option which can be provided only by corporate big business who have the ability to automate certain positions in the labor supply chain which is currently happening i would n't be surprised if the timeline for kiosks self service robot implementation is on par with the $ 15.00 minimum wage deadline in 2019 to sum up big business wins and labor loses but i guess results do n't matter when your intentions are good

wow you guys get really cheap finance here a mortage is 5.5 9 and car loans about 15 20 anyway back to the question the rule is reduce the largest interest rate first the most expensive money for 0 loans you should try to never pay it off it 's literally free money so just pay only the absolute minimum on 0 loans   pass it to your estate and try to get your kids to do the same   in fact if you have 11,000 and a $ 20,000 0 loan and you have the option you 're better to put the 11,000 into a safe investment system that returns > 0 and just use the interest to pay off the $ 20k the method of paying off the numerically smallest debt first called snowballing is generally aimed at the general public and for when you ca n't make much progress to week   thus it is best to get the lowest hanging fruit that shows progress than to try and have years worth of hard discipline just to make a tiny progress   it 's called snowballing because after paying off that first debt you keep your lifestyle the same and put the freed up money on as extra payments to the next target   generally this is only worth while if 1 you have poor discipline 2 the interest gap is n't too disparate eg 5 and 25 it is far better to pay off the 25 3 you do n't go out and immediately renew the lower debt   also as mentioned snowballing is aimed at small regular payments   you can do it with a lump sum but honestly for a lump sum you can get better return taking it off the most expensive interest rate first as the discipline issue does n't apply another consideration is put it off the most renewable finance   paying off your car so your car 's paid off   if you have an emergency on that asset means a new loan   but if you put it off the house conditional on interest rates not being to dissimilar it means you can often redraw some or all of the money if you have an emergency   this can often be better than paying down the car and then having to pay application fees to get a new unsecured loan    many modern banks actually use mortgage offsetting which allows them to do this you can keep your lump sum in a standard or even fixed term and the value of it is deducted as if you 'd paid it off your mortgage   so you get the benefit without the commitment   the bank is contracted for the length of the mortgage to a third party financier so they really do n't want you to change your end of the arrangement   and there is the hope you might spend it to giving them a few more dollars   but this can be very helpful especially if you 're financing stuff because it keeps the mortgage costs down but makes you look liquid for your investment borrowing

not illegal with respect to littleadv response the printing of a check is n't illegal i can order checks from cheap check printers and they have no relationship to any bank so long as they have my routing number and checking account number they print   years ago 25 + i wrote my account details on a shirt in protest to owing the irs money and my bank cashed it they charged a penalty of some nominal amount $ 20 or so for non standard check format or something like that but in fact stupid young person rants aside you may write a check out by hand on a piece of paper and it should clear the missing factor is the magnetic ink but i often see a regular check with a strip to the bottom when the mag strip fails proving that bad ink will not prevent a check from clearing   so long as the person trying to send you the funds is n't going to dispute the transaction and the check is made out to you so i suppose they could n't even do that this process should be simple i see little to no risk so long as the image is n't intercepted along the way

there are other good answers to the general point that the essence of what you 're describing exists already but i 'd like to point out a separate flaw in your logic why add more complications so that should i call this principal or interest actually makes a difference why 's the point incentive for this the incentive is that using excess payments to credit payments due in the future rather than applying it to outstanding principal is more lucrative for the lender since it 's more lucrative and there 's no law against it most all lenders use it as the default setting

the current fed 's spend is to encourage spends by putting in more liquidity some of this funds directly or indirectly reach emerging markets and get invested in stocks so without these forex inflows the balance of payments would be under pressure so these forex are artificially keeping the exchange rate down for example the usd vs inr rate was in the range of 1 usd to around inr 50 for nearly 4 5 years in the period the inflation in india was around 10 15 so ideally the rate should have slowly moved towards inr 60 however it took a news of fed cut back to more the rates in the range of inr 65 before stabilizing to rs 60

options reflect expectations about the underlying asset and options are commonly priced using the black scholes model   and are probability functions s is the spot current price of the asset k is the strike price r is the risk free rate and t t represents time to maturity   without getting into the mathematics it to say that higher volatility or expectation of volatility increases the perceived riskiness of the asset so call options are priced lower   and put options are priced higher think about it intuitively if the stock is more likely to go downwards then there 's an increased chance that the call option expires worthless so call options must be priced lower to accommodate the relative change in expected value of the option   puts are priced similarly but they move inversely with respect to call option prices due to put call parity so if call option prices are falling then put option prices are rising note however that call prices falling does not cause put prices to rise the inverse relationship exists because of changes in the underlying factors and how pricing works so the option action signifies that the market believes the stock is headed lower in the given time frame that does not mean it will go lower and option traders assume risk whenever they take a particular position bottom line got ta do your own homework best of luck

your statement not practical   presumes that the primary goal of having the store is to allow the store to thrive but if you subscribe to the idea that stores and other companies are just organizations of people that presumption is false   we humans form social structures that benefit people who live within the social structures towns cities teams companies political parties    the success of the store   or the company or the team or the city is not the primary goal the success of the people ought to be the primary goal    example hospitals were n't originally conceived to make money and grow they were conceived to aid people who were sick these days hospitals make a lot of money despite being classified as nonprofit institutions in the usa as a result we have bad medical practice over prescription of opioids over use of surgeries over use of diagnostic tests etc all of which benefits the hospital but not the patients    it 's not always a clear line look at the real jobs vs environment issues in mining or fracking    but the balance we have struck now gives great profits to the companies profits are at record highs while income inequality is also at record highs how is that sensible or sustainable or moral    my key point here is that your statement that it 's not practical for the store is misguided the store 's well being can not be the primary goal of commerce we need to place a higher priority on benefiting people broadly framed not just owners of the store

that 's because the one guy in portland who knows thai food has gone down the rabbit hole and knows what thai food is on a very deep level he 's friends with biggest thai on the planet he knows far more about thai fold than the average thai person in thailand   i have n't eaten at his restaurants but i assume they 're good i also assume he has problems still due to ingredients and the of his customers    everywhere else in america including the rest of portland the people have trouble securing good ingredients or have forgotten what thai food even tastes like thai town i took thai friends to multiple places in thai town all the best reviewed ones by americans and they were basically disgusted    thai food is one of those types of food that can taste pretty good even when it 's the lowest quality most formed dish on the market in america families tend to form restaurants where they serve a million different types of dishes which becomes a logistical nightmare when there are n't good markets that have what you need    in thailand many of the best places specialize in very few dishes on an expert level in thailand for every one place that specializes in something like beef noodles that is utterly amazing there are ten beef noodles places that taste okay and a tourist is likely to assume whatever beef noodles they have is as good as it gets unless they 're lucky enough to upon the mind blowing beef noodles    in america most of the thai restaurants serve a million different types of dishes they all remind me of the restaurants you see in the more tourist heavy parts of where there are a million pictures on the wall with the advertised prices and a ton of different dishes none of which are exceptional   in thailand if a place is serving a lot of different dishes most of those restaurants will be marginal or they 'll have a lot of different dishes from a specific region e san for example or serving a particular style of food which they are experts in duck restaurants in thailand often have a lot of other chinese dishes that accompany the duck that 's hard to do for every one of those in thailand all will taste decent 1/10 will be mind blowing    in the us you do n't even have beef places or duck rice places you have thai restaurants made by people who left thailand long ago only to return to eat at the same restaurants tourists walk into

in 2014 the irs announced that it published guidance in notice 2014 21 in that notice the answer to the first question describes the general tax treatment of virtual currency for federal tax purposes virtual currency is treated as property general tax principles applicable to property transactions apply to transactions using virtual currency as it 's property like any other capital gains if and when you sell are taxed as with any capital gains you 're taxed on the profit you made that is the proceeds how much you got when you sold minus your basis how much you paid to get the property that you sold until you sell it 's just an asset like a house or a share of stock or a rare collectible card that does n't require any reporting if your initial cryptocurrency acquisition was through mining then this section of that notice applies does a taxpayer who mines virtual currency for example uses computer resources to validate bitcoin transactions and maintain the public bitcoin transaction ledger realize gross income upon receipt of the virtual currency resulting from those activities yes when a taxpayer successfully mines virtual currency the fair market value of the virtual currency as of the date of receipt is includible in gross income see publication 525 taxable and nontaxable income for more information on taxable income that is to say when it was mined the market value of the amount generated should have been included in income probably on either line 21 other income or on schedule c if it 's from your own business at that point the market value would also qualify as your basis though i doubt there 'd be a whole lot of enforcement action for not amending your 2011 return to include $ 0.75 technically if you find a dollar bill on the street it should be included in income but usually the government cares about bigger fish than that it sounds like your basis is close enough to zero that it 's not worth trying to calculate a more accurate value since your basis could n't be less than zero there 's no way that using zero as your basis would cause you to pay less tax than you ought so the government wo n't have any objections to it   one thing to be careful of is to document that your holdings qualify for long term capital gains treatment held longer than a year if applicable also as you 're trading in multiple cryptocurrencies each transaction may count as a sale of one kind followed by a purchase of the other kind much like if you traded your apple stock for google stock it 's possible that 1031 like kind exchange rules apply and in june 2016 the american institute of cpas sent a letter asking about it among other things but as far as i know there 's been no official irs guidance on the matter there are also some related questions here see do altcoin trades count as like kind exchanges and assuming 1031 does n't apply to cryptocurrency trading but if in fact those exchange rules do not apply and it is just considered a sale followed by a purchase then you would need to report each exchange as a sale with that asset 's basis probably $ 0 for the initial one and proceeds of the fair market value at the time and then that same value would be the basis of the new asset you 're purchasing using a $ 0 basis is how i treat my bitcoin sales though i have n't dealt with other cryptocurrencies as long as all the usd income is being reported when you get usd i find it unlikely you 'll run into a lot of trouble even if you technically were supposed to report the individual transactions when they happened though i 'm not in charge of irs enforcement and i 'm not aware of any high profile cases so it 's hard to know anything for sure obviously if there 's a lot of money involved you may want to involve a professional rather than random strangers on the internet you could also try contacting the irs directly as believe it or not their job is in fact helping you to comply with the tax laws correctly also there are phone numbers at the end of notice 2014 21 of people which might be able to provide further guidance including this statement the principal author of this notice is keith a. of the office of associate chief counsel income tax accounting for further information about income tax issues addressed in this notice please contact mr. at 202

the short answer zero 's answer gives some good reasons why   you will basically never be able to achieve diversification with individual stocks that is anywhere close to what you can get with mutual funds   owning individual stocks exposes you to much greater risk in that random one off events that happen to affect one of the companies you own can have a disproportionate effect on your assets   for instance some sort of scandal involving a particular company can cause its stock to tank there are only two reasons i can see to invest in individual stocks a. you have some unique opportunity to acquire stock that other people might not be able to get or get at that price   this can be the case if you work for a privately held company that allows you to buy stock or options or allows you to participate in its ipo   even then you should not go too crazy since having too much stock in the company you work for can double your pain if the company falls on hard times you may lose your job and your investment b. for fun   if you like tracking stocks and trying to beat the market you may want to test your skills at this by using a small proportion of your investable cash no more than 10   in this case you 're not so much hoping to increase your returns as to just enjoy investing more   this can also have a psychological benefit in that it allows you to blow off steam and indulge your desire to make decisions while allowing your passive investments index funds to shoulder the load of actually gaining value

yes of course there have been studies on this   this is no more than a question about whether the options are properly priced if properly priced then your strategy will not make money on average before transaction costs and will lose once transaction costs are included   if you could make money using your strategy on average then the market should and generally will make an adjustment in the option price to compensate the most famous studies on this were conducted by black and scholes and then by merton this work won the nobel prize in 1995 although the black scholes or black scholes merton equation is so well known now that people may forget it they did n't just sit down one day and write and equation that they thought was cool they actually derived the equation based on market factors beyond this work you 've got at least two branches of study   academics have continued to study option pricing including but not limited to revisions to the original black scholes model and hedge funds large trading house have quants looking at this stuff all of the time   the former you could look up if you want the latter will never see the light of day because it 's proprietary if you want specific references i think that any textbook for a quantitative finance class would be a fine place to start   i would n't be surprised if you actually find your strategy as part of a homework problem this is not to say by the way that i do n't think you can make money with this type of trade but your strategy will need to include more information than you 've outlined here   choosing which information and getting your hands on it in a timely manner will be the key

mortgage rates generally consist of two factors the risk premium is relatively constant for a particular individual house combination so most of the changes in your mortgage rate will be associated with changes in the price of money in the world economy at large interest rates in the overall economy are usually tied to an interest rate called the federal funds rate the federal reserve the federal funds rate by buying and/or selling bonds until the rate is something they like so you can usually expect your interest rate to rise or fall depending on the policies of the federal reserve you can predict this in a couple of ways the way they have described their plans recently indicates that will keep interest rates low for an extended period of time probably through 2014 or so and they hope to keep inflation around 2 unless inflation is significantly more than 2 between now and then they are extremely unlikely to change that plan as such you should probably not expect mortgage interest rates in general to change more than small amounts until worry more about your credit score

's answer is fundamentally correct and deserves the but i 'd like to give an economic explanation for how this economically functions the key point from 's answer 's that the interest rate is for one company while this may be much higher than the equilibrium rate the true market interest rate it is not completely unreasonable because of the risk for credit to be continually produced default risk must be compensated because this is a cost to the lender   most are not in business to lose money so making loans to borrowers that default 40 of the time would make this interest rate reasonable for uk citizens this would not be such a problem because the lender can usually pursue the borrower for the balance but if the borrower can the loan and leave the legal reach of the uk creditors the collection rate is 0 the guarantee by the foreign persons not present in the uk is incidental and probably more of a regulatory requirement since the inability to collect from them is just as unlikely one should always look for the lowest price with at least minimum quality when shopping for anything but you are right to be apprehensive legally   read every line and be sure that you yourself understand every clause before signing if alternative cheaper financing is available it is probably superior

hey currently in treasury it 's good in some ways and bad in others every role has it 's pluses and minuses   some basic thoughts are that you get to see a lot of the company you get a cursory view of what everyone is doing all the time but you do n't really ever get in depth views of any one area it 's a role that makes it easy to jump around industries because every large company has a treasury department but it limits the size of the company you can join because a lot of small companies wo n't have one or will just have a cash person and not an actual department you get to look at bond and commercial paper markets if that 's interesting to you you get a lot of interaction with higher ups because cash is hugely important you 're the first to know if the company is gon na go bankrupt it 's a good place to learn the business if you end up wanting to move but it 's a pretty specific skill set and carries a decent amount of responsibility it 's one of the only corporate finance roles that 's closer to front office than mid or back office   if you are just joining corporate treasury you 'll probably start out doing cash management and forecasting maybe doing short term liquidity and investment activity after that you would move into bond stuff management corporate finance stuff as opposed to the cash desk after that you 'd probably get to be involved in stuff like long term planning and m&amp;a activity which is the real cool shit    that 's what came off the top of my head do you have any specific questions

saudi is n't going to listen to china albeit china is an important trading partner for saudi it does n't have anywhere near the leverage america has actually japan has a better relationship with saudi arabia than the latter does with china   saudi is pegged to the dollar and so it remains as strong as it possibly can the usd is simply the most stable currency the is an exaggerated reason as to why it is us imports are almost the same as the china in terms of percentage but the us sells lots of weapons to saudi arabia china does n't have the amount of investment into saudi arabia like us companies do   china and the yuan are not substitutes to the us and usd

you should not open bank accounts just to get additional credit cards you should be careful about carrying too many credit cards and incurring too much debt as you could find yourself in a situation whereby you may not be able to pay off your monthly interest much less the principal balance credit cards are not insurance with many years of experience under my belt i can tell you that the best approach is to live within or below your means and avoid carrying a balance on credit cards i carry only one credit card really a charge card and i pay off the balance every month treat a credit card as a 30 day interest free loan and pay your balance off in full every month as you progress through life you will save yourself a lot of and money if you take this approach
