i used to be a trader at a desk that sold delta one derivatives on listed indices think swaps etfs there is a lot to do    sell stocks according to redemptions or new orders manage the currency exposure indices rebalance their composition everyday based on stock corporate actions dividends and index reviews you need to be aware of each and everyone and rebalance your portfolio to account for it manage your inventory to get the best repo rates possible trade single stock swaps with foreign counterparties to get access to better tax rates on dividends when you have a big order where certain stock orders may not get filled you have to create a strategy for managing that risk sometimes you hedge your positions using futures that expire every three months in which case you need to figure out the best times to roll your expiring futures i could go on and on   basically since the profit margins are so low the market so competitive for such vanilla products and the volumes so high you have to really make your processes super efficient and error proof trust me there is a lot to be done

you 've laid out a strategy for deciding that the top of the market has passed and then realizing some gains before the market drops too far   regardless of whether this strategy is good at accomplishing its goal it can not by itself maximize your long term profits unless you have a similar strategy for deciding that the bottom of the market has passed   even if you sell at the perfect time at the top of the market you can still lose lots of money by buying at the wrong time at the bottom people have been trying to time the market like this for centuries and on average it does n't work out all that much better than just some money into the market each week and letting it sit there for 40 years so the real question is what is your investment time horizon   if you need your money a year from now well then you should n't be in the stock market in the first place   but if you have to have it in the market then your plan sounds like a good one to protect yourself from losses if you do n't need your money until 20 years from now though then every time you get in and out of the market you 're risking sacrificing all your previous smart gains with one trade   sure just leaving your money in the market can be psychologically taxing cf 2008 2009 but i guarantee that a you 'll eventually make it all back cf 2010 2014 and b you wo n't miss the top or miss the bottom since you 're not doing any trading

starting and running a business in the us is actually a lot less complicated than most people think you mention incorporation but a corporation or even an s corp is n't generally the best entity to start a business with most likely you are going to want to form an llc instead this will provide you with liability protection while minimizing your paperwork and taxes the cost for maintaining an llc is relatively cheap $ a year depending on your state and you can file the paperwork to form it yourself or pay an attorney to do it for you generally i would avoid the snake oil salesman that pitch specific out of state llcs nevada delaware etc unless you have a specific reason or intend on doing business in the state   with the llc or a corporation you need to make sure you maintain separate finances if you use the llc funds to pay personal expenses you run the risk of loosing the liability protection afforded by the llc piercing the corporate veil with a single member llc you can file as a pass through entity and your llc income would pass through to your federal return and taxes are n't any more complicated than putting your business income on your personal return like you do now if you have employees things get more complex and it is really easiest to use a payroll service to process state and federal tax with holding   once your business picks up you will want to file quarterly tax payments in order to avoid an under payment penalty   generally most taxpayers will avoid the under payment penalty if they owe less than $ 1,000 in tax after subtracting their withholdings and credits or if they paid at least 90 of the tax for the current year or 100 of the tax shown on the return for the prior year whichever is smaller even if you get hit by the penalty it is only 10 of the amount of tax you did n't pay in time if you are selling a service such writing one off projects you should be able to avoid having to collect and remit sales tax but this is going to be very state specific if you are selling software you will have to deal with sales tax assuming your state has a sales tax one more thing to look at is some cities require a business license in order to operate a business within city limits so it would also be a good idea to check with your city to find out if you need a business license

my basic rule of thumb is that if the the bill come from a government office of taxation and that if you fail to pay the amount they can put a tax lien on the property it is a tax for you the complication is in assessments for local benefits     you can not deduct amounts you pay for local benefits that tend to increase the value of your property    local benefits include the construction of streets sidewalks or    water and sewer systems you must add these amounts to the basis of    your property   you can however deduct assessments or taxes for    local benefits if they are for maintenance repair or interest    charges related to those benefits an example is a charge to repair an    existing sidewalk and any interest included in that charge   if only a    part of the assessment is for maintenance repair or interest    charges you must be able to show the amount of that part to claim the    deduction if you can not show what part of the assessment is for    maintenance repair or interest charges you can not deduct any of it an assessment for a local benefit may be listed as an item in your    real estate tax bill if so use the rules in this section to find how    much of it if any you can deduct i have never seen a tax bill that said this amount is for new streets and the rest i for things the irs says you can deduct the issue is that if the center city tax bill is a separate line or a separate bill then does it count i would go back to the first line of the quote from pub you can not deduct amounts you pay for local benefits that tend to    increase the value of your property then i would look at the quote from the ccd web site the center city district ccd is a business improvement district our    mission is to keep philadelphia 's downtown called center city clean    safe beautiful and fun we provide security cleaning and promotional    services that supplement but do not replace basic services provided    by the city of philadelphia and the fundamental responsibilities of    property owners ccd also makes physical improvements to the downtown installing and maintaining lighting > signs banners trees and landscape elements   and later on the same page ccd directly bills and collects mandatory payments from properties in    the district ccd also receives voluntary contributions from the    owners of tax exempt properties that benefit from our services the issues is that it is a business improvement district bid and you are n't a business i did find this document from the city of philadelphia explain how to establish a bid if the nature of the bid is such that organizers wish to include    residential properties within the district and make these properties    subject to the assessment it may make sense to assess these    properties at a lower level than a commercial property both because    bid services and benefits are business focused and because    owner occupants often can not treat assessments as tax deductible    business expenses like commercial owners do care must be taken to    ensure that the difference in commercial and residential assessment    rates is equitable and complies with the requirements of the from the same document funds for bid programs and services are generated from a special    assessment paid by the benefited property owners directly to the    organization that manages the bid ’s activities note many leases    have a clause that allows property owners to pass the bid assessment    on to their tenants because they are authorized by the city of    philadelphia the assessment levied by the bid becomes a legal    obligation of the property owner and failure to pay can result in the    filing of a lien i have seen discussion that some bids can accept tax deductible donations this means if a person they can deduct the donation i would then feel comfortable deducting the tax because if you ca n't deduct it that would mean the only people who ca n't deduct it are home owners   so deduct it keep in mind i am not a tax professional

these kinds of credit card offers are incredibly common more often you will get a certain reward if you spend $ x within y days of getting the card in many cases you can take advantage of them with very little downside however are you responsible enough to have a credit card and be able to pay off the balance every month if not the interest charges could quickly wipe out the $ 50 bonus you get and hard inquiries and new accounts could potentially affect your credit score particularly if you do n't have a well established credit history there 's also the chance you get denied in which case you add a hard inquiry to your credit report for no gain

debit cards can be riskier than credit cards that 's why i personally avoid debit cards unless i have a very good reason to go that direction e.g. hsa accounts   to explain the risk consider what happens if someone steals the card or number and starts using it credit card you get a big bill which you dispute and eventually get dismissed    debit card your bank account balance drops   you do n't have access to cash and your checks start bouncing and you rack up bounced check charges with your bank and stores where you write checks eventually you convince the bank it was fraud and they refund the money to your account the big difference is that while it is going on you are out the money with a debit card and with a credit card the bank is out the money the above scenario happened to my brother and it was n't pretty he was having to borrow money to pay his rent and groceries while the bank sorted it out

there is no one solution to every project finance problem two models might make sense in this situation however in this case you would count all the money that you give to your friend as a loan which he will pay back with interest the interest rate and loan amounts will have to be agreed on by both of you one one hand the interest should be high enough to reward you in a successful outcome for the amount of risk that you take on if things do n't work out on the other the interest rate needs to be low enough where his earnings after loan repayment justify your friend 's effort in addition to being competitive to rate your friend could secure from a bank the downside to this plan is you do n't directly benefit from the franchise 's profits in this model you will record the cash that each of you invests since your friend is also adding sweat equity by setting up and operating the franchise you will need to quantify the work that your friend and you invest into the franchise then you can determine how much each of you has invested in terms of dollars and split any franchise profits based on those proportions the downside of this plan is that it is difficult to estimate how much time each of you invests and how much that time is worth

trusts are a way of holding assets with a specific goal in mind at its simplest a trust can be used to avoid probate a sometimes lengthy process in which a will is made public along with the assets a trust allows for fast transfer and no public disclosure depending on the current estate tax laws the death tax a trust can help preserve an estate exemption e.g. say the law reverts back to a $ 1 m exemption note this is $ 1 m per deceased person not per beneficiary my wife and i happened to have assets of exactly $ 2 m and i die tomorrow now she has $ 2 m and when she passes the estate has that $ 2 m and estate taxes are based on this total $ 1 m fully taxed but if we set up trusts that first million can be put into trust on my death the interest and some principal going to the surviving spouse each year but staying out of the survivor 's estate second spouse dies little or no tax due   this is known as a bypass trust another example is a trust say hypothetically my sister in law ca n't save a nickel to save her life spends every dime and then some so the best thing my mother in law can do to provide for her is to leave her estate in trust with specific instructions on how to distribute some percent each year this is not a tax dodge of any kind it 's strictly to protect the daughter from her own irresponsibility   a medical needs trust is a variant of the above it can provide income to a disabled person without impacting their government benefits adversely   this scratches the surface illustrating how trusts can be used there are more variation on this but i believe it covers the basics with the interest in this topic i 'm adding another issue where the trust can be useful in my article on my death please take a breath i described how an inherited ira was destroyed by ignorance the beneficiary fearing the stock market withdrew it all and was nailed by taxes he was on social security and no other income so by taking small withdrawals each year would have had nearly no tax due and could have avoided market risk by selling within the ira and buying treasuries or cds   he did n't need a trust of course just education the deceased his sister might have used a trust to manage the ira and enforce limited withdrawals mixing iras and trust is complex but the choice between a $ 2000 expense to create a trust or the $ 40 k tax bill he got is pretty clear to me he took pride in having sold out as the market soon tanked but he could have avoided the tax loss as well he was confusing the account in this case an ira but it could have been a 401(k or other retirement account with the investments it contained one can and should keep the ira in tact and simply adjust the allocation according to one 's comfort level   note inheritance tax laws change frequently and my answer above was an attempt to be generic the current 2014 code allows $ m to be left by one decedent with no estate tax

first thing ask your real estate agent who should have been involved in writing the contract and can explain your options regarding the contingency that being said the inspection report is the decision point for every issue problem mentioned you have decide ignore have the seller fix have the seller give you money to fix have the seller drop the price or walk away minor things you can have the seller fix they need to be done but they can be done by the seller   expensive things that are difficult to estimate the price in advance should also be done by the seller the estimating the cost to repair will make it risky for you to negotiate a price break   getting a credit of $ 1,000 when it ends up costing you $ 20,000 is something you want to avoid for items that you want to do the fix yourself you want money at closing to do them or ask for a price break items in this category include replacing an appliance you can take the money and get exactly the one you want or let the seller of the house buy one that has the least options and wo n't match the color buyers also take this option when they were going to renovate soon anyway walking away this happens when there is a large expensive issue that is hard to fix or a very large list of mid size problems issues in this category can include foundation cracks major electrical problems extensive leaks mold it can also include beautifully constructed additions that are n't up to code and were done without permits and inspections    which category is your radon in you need to ask your agent and read the inspection report the agent can explain your options and how likely the seller will be to agree they can also tell you how likely you are to not lose the deposit if you do walk away

when you exercise a put you get paid the strike price immediately so you can invest that money and earn some interest compared to only exercising at expiry so the benefit to exercising early is that extra interest the cost is the remaining time value of the option along with any dividend payments you miss as @joetaxpayer points out there might be tax considerations that make it better to exercise at one time rather than another but those would likely be personal to you so if the option would intrinsically have more value unexercised in many cases you could sell it on rather than exercise it the exception might be if it was n't very liquid and the transaction costs of doing that outweighed the theoretical value

i live in one of the highest cost of living areas in my country   for the cost of less than half the down payment my spouse and i have saved up for a house we could easily buy a home in most of the lower cost of living areas and several homes in say detroit as for the rest of your question though we 've chosen not to live that way   because like all high cost of living areas ours is near a city there are more free and inexpensive things to do than you would think at first   while others in our area think a great time is pre gaming drinks at a nice bar an expensive restaurant then some more drinks we 've taught ourselves how to make great meals from scratch using sale and inexpensive ingredients from the grocery store and often do that on weekends topped off by a movie from the that we promptly return the next day   we have chosen friends who will hang out with us over dinners and board games instead of out on the town   on weekend days we visit free do hikes wander around downtown strips or play at the local parks   our groceries as i mentioned are sale items or use coupons and we go for less expensive meats and produce   we visit our local farmer 's market for fun not to buy the expensive produce   we might find ourselves wandering through the mall to window shop but when it comes time to actually buy clothing or goods for the apartment we shop around for up to months to find a good deal plenty of our friends have money enough to spend and the most debt they are usually in is a big car payment no consumer debt   at the same time i have trouble imagining some of them buying a house any time soon because they simply ca n't be saving all that much since i know their incomes   they may eventually be able to afford a condo and ride rising housing prices to a and then a house it 's what lots of people do around here loosing buckets money in realtor fees and closing costs along the way   even with these choices it 's hard to view my friends as selfish knowing that most of them give around 10 of their income to charity there are probably plenty of people around here swimming in debt somebody recently asked in a q&a with the local paper editors how she could stop going to the city 's most expensive restaurants and start living within her means when she only liked expensive places but lots of folks can stretch themselves and afford to get by while wasting a lot of money   it 's not what my spouse and i have chosen to do because we want to be able to live very responsibly and plan for a rainy day but the longer you live with and around the money that tends to high cost of living areas the more it will seem normal to you also if it 's really $ 1000/mo for a 2 br apartment your cost of living is still lower than mine is if i were you i would n't try to myself to the habits of your surroundings   instead i 'd find friends who are frugal and work on maintaining your good financial habits   if you ever want one of those $ 4 $ 5 or $ 6 k plus houses you 're going to need them

middle class taxes are about as low as they have ever been they are much lower than most of the industrialized world   gt;so proportionally the middle classes end up paying the most tax and gets the least for it   no the rich pay the largest percentage of the tax dollars and they pay more per dollar earned than the middle class you can check this easily from irs tax statistics a person paying a million in taxes a year does n't use the roads 50 times as much as someone paying 20,000 a year either and most other services scale similarly so i 'd say the middle class actually gets more use out of their tax dollars than the rich

in theory investing is not gambling because the expected outcome is not random people are expecting positive returns on average with some relationship to risk undertaken and economic reality more risk = more returns historically this is true on average that assets have positive returns and riskier assets have higher returns also it 's true that stock market gains roughly track economic growth valuation current price level relative to fundamentals matters reversion to the mean does exist over a long enough time given a 7 10 year horizon a lot of the variance in ending price level can be explained by valuation at the start of the period on average over time business profits have to vary around a curve that 's related to the overall economy and equity prices should reflect business profits the shorter the horizon the more random noise even 1 year is pretty short in this respect bubbles do exist as do irrational panics and forms of each investing is not like a coin flip because the current total number of heads and tails current valuation does affect the probability of future outcomes that said it 's pretty hard to predict the timing or the specific stocks that will do well etc rebalancing gives you an objective automated way to take advantage of all the noise around the long term trend rather than trying to use judgment to identify when to get in and out with rebalancing and dollar cost averaging you guarantee getting in a bit more when things are lower and getting out a bit more when things are higher you can make money from prices bouncing around even if they end up going nowhere and even if you ca n't predict the bouncing here are a couple old posts from my blog that talk about this a little more

it depends on the terms of the mortgage generally speaking residential mortgages specifically prohibit letting out a property without the bank 's express permission but as you say that tends to assume that the whole property is being let not just a part of it conversely buy to let mortgages generally prohibit living in the property yourself the final as to what is allowed under a mortgage is the mortgage provider so the safest option is to speak to one or more banks and see what they say note that if you 're changing the use of part of a property from business to residential you may need to apply for permission check with your local council

the cpa 's mention of $ 2,500 is probably referring to the recently increased de minimis safe harbor under the final tangible property regulations used to be $ 500 without an applicable financial statement the irs will not challenge your choice of expense or capitalization on amounts on or below $ 2500 if you elect the de minimis safe harbor election on your return however you must follow whatever you 're doing for your books so if you are capitalizing your laptops for book purposes you would also need to capitalize for tax purposes section 179 allows you to expense property that you would have otherwise have had to capitalize and depreciate section 179 can be annoying especially if your llc is treated as a passthrough because there are recapture provisions when you dispose of the asset too early for the tax return preparer it makes the return preparation much more simple if there are no fixed assets to account for in the first place which is quite possible if you are expensive all items invoices less than $ 2,500

what is a stock a share of stock represents ownership of a portion of a corporation in olden times you would get a physical stock certificate looking something like this with your name and the number of shares on it that certificate was the document demonstrating your ownership today physical stock certificates are quite uncommon to the point that a number of companies do n't issue them anymore while a one share certificate can be a neat certificates are a pain for investors as they have to be stored safely and you 'd have to go through a whole annoying process to redeem them when you wanted to sell your investment   now you 'll usually hold stock through a brokerage account and your holdings will just be records in a database somewhere you 'll pick a broker more on that in the next question instruct them to buy something and they 'll keep track of it in your account   where do i get a stock you 'll generally choose a broker and open an account you can read reviews to compare different brokerages in your country as they 'll have different fees and pricing you can also make sure the brokerage firm you choose is in good standing with the financial regulators in your country though one from a major national bank wo n't be unsafe   you will be required to provide personal information as you are opening a financial account the information should be similar to that required to open a bank account you 'll also need to get your money in and out of the account so you 'll likely set up a bank transfer it may be possible to request a paper stock certificate but do n't be surprised if you 're told this is unavailable if you do get a paper certificate you 'll have to deal with considerably more hassle and delay if you want to sell later   brokers charge a commission which is a fee per trade let 's say the commission is $ if you buy 5 shares of google at $ you 'd pay $ 5 + $ 10 = $ and wind up with $ worth of stock in your account you 'd pay the same commission when you sell the stock   can anyone buy own use a stock pretty much a brokerage is going to require that you be a legal adult to maintain an account with them there are generally ways in which a parent can open an account on behalf of an child though there can be different types of restrictions when it comes to investing in companies that are not publicly held but that 's not something you need to worry about stocks available on the public stock market are available to well the public how are stocks taxed taxes differ from country to country but as a general rule you do have to provide the tax authorities with sufficient information to determine what you owe this means figuring out how much you purchased the stock for and comparing that with how much you sold it for to determine your gain or loss in the us and i suspect in many other countries your brokerage will produce an annual report with at least some of this information and send it to the tax authorities and you you or someone you hire to do your taxes will use that report to compute the amount of tax owed your brokerage will generally keep track of your cost basis how much you bought it for for you though it 's a good idea to keep records if you refuse to tell the government your cost basis they can always assume it 's $ 0 and then you 'll pay more tax than you owe   finding the cost basis for old investments can be difficult many years later if the records are lost if you can determine when the stock was purchased even approximately it 's possible to look back at historical price data to determine the cost   if your stock pays a dividend a certain amount of money per share that a company may pay out of its profits to its investors you 'll generally need to pay tax on that income in the us the tax rate on dividends may be the same or less than the tax rate on normal wage income depending on how long you 've held the investment and other rules

for most banks this is not the case   transfers within the bank are usually instantaneous it is not uncommon for banks to draw out the length of transactions because while the money is transferring or settling it is actually sitting on the bank 's balance sheet being lent out but not earning any interest   a good deal for them when you aggregate over the millions of customers they have   your bank may be trying to squeeze a few pennies of interest out of you delays in transactions also allow their fraud team the flexibility to investigate transactions if they want to normally they probably do n't but if the bank delays all transactions then those being investigated will not be aware of it

index funds may invest either in index components directly or in other instruments like etfs index options futures etc which are highly correlated with the index the specific fund prospectus or description on any decent financial site should contain these details   index funds are not actively managed but that does not mean they are n't managed at all if index changes and the fund includes specific stock they would adjust the fund content of course the downside of it is that selling off large amounts of certain stock on its low point since it 's being excluded presumably because of its decline and buying large amount of different stock on its raising point may have certain costs which would cause the fund lag behind the index usually the difference is not overly large but it exists   investing in the index contents directly involves more transactions which the fund distributes between members so it does n't usually buy individually for each member but manages the portfolio in big chunks which saves costs of course the downside is that it can lag behind the index if it 's volatile also in order to buy specific shares you will have to shell out for a number of whole share prices which for a big index may be a substantial sum and wo n't allow you much flexibility like i want to withdraw half of my investment in s&p 500 since you ca n't usually own 1/10 of a share with index funds the entry price is usually quite low and increments in which you can add or withdraw funds are low too

you owe taxes to the state where you earned the income and also to the state where you physically live most maybe all states have laws that let you claim credits for taxes paid to other states so that you 're not paying double taxes by living in one state while working in another most states have deals with all their neighboring states so that you only have to file taxes in one for example i live in michigan and michigan borders ohio lots of people who live near the border live in one state but work in the other so the two have a deal that anyone who lives in michigan but works in ohio just has to file a michigan tax return and pay michigan taxes and anyone who lives in ohio and works in michigan just has to pay ohio taxes oh i should note that these adjacent state deals apply only to employment income not business income if you own a business in another state you 'll still have to file taxes in that state you still should get tax credits in your residence state in general the fact that you use a server in another state does n't make you liable for taxes in that state i understand that new york says that if you work from home and the company headquarters is in new york you have to pay new york taxes maybe there are a few other states who do this but just because a server is in their state i 've never heard of this if i order business supplies that are shipped from a warehouse in arizona that does n't make me liable for arizona income taxes etc   you are legally a resident of the state where you actually live if you have a home and live in it most of the time then you are a resident of the state where that home is a home does n't have to be a house it could be an apartment an rv that you live in in a trailer park a tent etc if you do n't own any sort of fixed home and you travel around a lot this could be tricky you mentioned oklahoma oklahoma defines resident as follows   an oklahoma resident is a person domiciled in this state for the entire tax year domicile is the place established as a person ’s true fixed and permanent home it is the place you intend to return whenever you are away as on     vacation abroad business assignment educational leave or military assignment a domicile once established remains until a new one is adopted i 'm not sure that that clears things up for you you ca n't just pick a state with low taxes and claim that as your residence no way is the state where you actually live going to accept that if you are in an ambiguous situation like you spend 6 months per year in state a and 6 months in state b and you have no fixed home in either maybe you stay at or live in your minivan you might get away with picking the state with the most favorable tax laws as your residence but if you spend 7 months in state a and 5 months in state b state a will almost surely claim you are a resident and owe them taxes if you regularly wander the country never spend more than a few days in any one place and rarely come back to the same place twice then you have a complicated situation and you probably need to talk to a tax lawyer

i think the basic question you 're asking is whether you 'd be better off putting the $ 20 k into an ira or similar investment or if your best bet is to pay down your mortgage   the answer is that depends what you did n't share is what your mortgage balance is so that we can understand how using that money to pay down the mortgage would affect you   the lower your remaining balance on the mortgage the more impact paying it down will affect your long term finances   for example if your remaining principal balance is more than $ 200k paying down $ 20k in principal will not have as significant an effect as if you only have $ 100k principal balance and were paying down $ 20k of that to me one option is to put the $ 20k toward mortgage principal then perhaps do a refinance on your remaining mortgage with the goal of getting a better interest rate   this would double the benefit to you   first your mortgage payment would be lower by virtue of a lower principal balance assuming you keep the same term period in your refinanced mortgage as you have now   in other words if you have a 15-year now your new mortgage should be 15 years also to see the best effect on your payment   further if you can obtain a lower interest rate on the new loan now you have the dual benefit of a lower principal balance to pay down plus the reduced interest cost on that principal balance   this would put money into your pocket immediately which i think is part of your goal although the question does hinge on what you 'd pay in points and fees for a refinance you can invest but with that comes risk and right now may not be the ideal time to enter the markets given all of the uncertainties with the brexit issue   by paying down your mortgage principal even if you do nothing else you can save yourself considerable interest in the long term which might be more beneficial than the return you 'd get from the markets or an ira at this point i hope this helps good luck

your analogy seems relevant to me but it is not just speculation in the long run investing in stocks is like investing in the economy in the long run the economy is expected to grow hence stock prices are expected to go up now in theory the price of any financial instrument is equal to the net present value today of all the future cash flows from the instrument so if company 's earnings improve shareholders hope that the earnings will trickle down to them either in form of dividends or in form of capital gain so they buy the stock creating demand for it i can try to explain more if this did not make any sense

the short answer is banks are less concerned about the interest earned on any single mortgage than they are for the interest earned over time from a collection of mortgages let 's look at a repayment schedule for a 30-year mortgage at 4 for $ 100,000 source any mortgage calculator should produce a similar schedule however a few things to note the interest due in the last 6 years is less than the interest due in the first year alone banks are getting a disproportionate amount of the expected interest up front banks can make multiple loans the money collected from existing borrowers can be aggregated to make new loans before the old ones are paid off and those new loans start of course at the interest heavy end of the repayment schedule suppose the bank lends out $ 1,000,000 to 10 borrowers in the first two years they will collect a total of $ from the 10 borrowers in principal and interest that 's enough to make an additional loan to an 11th borrower while keeping $ as profit the new borrower is making payments at the year one rate a bank may lose a little interest on a single loan that gets repaid early but that is generally made up by the fact that a new loan can be issued that much sooner as a result

two main points to answer this in my opinion first most people do n't start with say half a million dollar to buy all the stocks they need in one shot but rather they accumulate this money gradually so they must make many buys in their lifetime similarly most people do n't need to withdraw all their investment in one day and should n't do this anyway as it cuts the time of investment so there will be many sells performing a single buy or sell per year is not efficient since it means you have lots of cash sitting doing nothing so in this sense low cost indexing lets you quickly invest your money and withdraw it when needed after say you retire without worrying about commission costs each time the second and most important point to me to answer this is that we should make a very clear distinction between strategy and outcome today 's stock prices and all the ups and downs of the market are just one possible outcome that materialized from a virtually number of possible outcomes it 's not too hard to imagine that tomorrow we hear all iphones explode and apple stock comes crashing down or that in a parallel universe amazon never takes off and somehow sears is the king of online commerce another item in the outcome category is your decisions as a human being of when to buy and sell if that exploding iphone event does occur would you hold on to your stocks would you sell and cut your losses does the average person make the same decision if they had $ 1000 invested in apple alone vs $ 1 m   index investing offers a low cost strategy that mitigates these uncertainties for the average person again here the key is the word average picking a handful of the stocks as you mention might give you better returns in 30 years but it could just as easily give you worse and the current data suggest the latter is more likely come and go who were they 30 years ago and just like how the other 450 companies may seem right now as dragging down the portfolio just as easily a handful of them can emerge as the new guaranteed no possible yes   jack bogle is simply saying low cost indexing is one of the better strategies for the average person given the data but nowhere is it guaranteed that in this lifetime e.g. next 30 years will provide the best outcome berkshire on the other hand are in the business of chasing maximum outcomes mid or short term returns it 's two different concepts that should n't be mixed together in my opinion

you have to be the owner of record before the ex dividend date which is not the same day as the date the dividend is paid this also implies that if you sell on or after the ex dividend date you 'll still get the dividend even if you no longer own the stock   keep in mind also that the quoted price of the stock and on any open orders that are not specifically marked as do not reduce on its ex dividend date is dropped by the amount of the dividend first thing in the morning before trading starts if you happen to be the first order of the day before market forces cause the price to move you 'll end up with zero gain since the dividend is built into the price and you got the same value out of it the dividend in cash and the remaining value in stock as pointed out in the comments thanks you 'll still get a market price for your trade but the price reduction will have had some impact on the first trade of the day source nyse rule also remember that the dividend yield is expressed in annualized terms so a 3 yield can only be fully realized by receiving all of the dividend payments made by the company for the year you can of course forget about individual companies and just look for dividends to create your own effective yield over time but see the final point finally if you keep buying and selling just to play games with the dividends you 're going to pay far more in transaction fees than you will earn in dividends and depending on your individual circumstances you may end up paying more in capital gains taxes

well the thing to understand about hft is that the volume levels heavily affect not just the earnings but also the ecosystem hft is almost always liquidity constrained so the volume and volatility is going to affect the overall profitability of the strategy since less of these things means fewer and smaller trading opportunities   since 2008 volume and volatility have been heavily negatively correlated with risk on risk off during risk off periods investors seem to panic and trading hits a pace this describes late 2008 and more recently august 2011 even in 2012 the highest volume volatility period was in may when the euro deals were in danger risk on environments tend to be marked be calm orderly buying   second the dark pool issue is bringing liquidity out of the lit markets where hft normally makes its money the primary reason for this trend is that dark pools are allowed to offer sub penny quotes whereas lit exchanges are not because of this arbitrary regulatory constraint most of the time dark pools are going to offer better prices especially on thick book securities   but beyond that the level of volume effects some hft players more heavily then others imagine all the hft firms as a pride of lions when volume is high and liquidity is flowing it 's like the pride has brought in a giant water buffalo the biggest cats eat first but there 's still food left for the after they 're finished feeding   but if the pride only brings in say a baby the alpha cats will eat everything and the will go hungry that basically describes what 's happening now a firm like or will make less money in a low volume environment but still do fine marginal firms like will lose the ability to make any money   since the marginal firms need the press and the dominant firms tend to be more secretive than the nsa you 'll tend to read more about the former than the latter

changes in implied volatility are caused by many things of course and it is tough to isolate the effect you are describing but let 's try to generalize for a moment implied volatility is generally a measure of how much expect uncertainty there is about the future price of the stock   uncertainty generally is higher in periods including earnings announcements because it is significant new information about the company 's fortunes can make for significant changes in the price however you could easily have the case where the earnings are good and for some reason the market is very certain that the earnings will be good and near a certain level   in that case the price would rise but the implied volatility could well be lower because the market believes that there will be no significant new information in the earnings announcement

of course the situation for each student will vary widely so you 'll have to dig deep on your own to know what is the best choice for your situation now that the disclaimer is out of the way the best choice would be to use the unsubsidized stafford loan to finance graduate school if you need to resort to loans the major benefits to the unsubsidized stafford are the following you 'll be forced to consider other loan types due to the unsubsidized stafford loan 's established limits on how much you can borrow per year and in aggregate the borrowing limits are also adjustable down by your institution the plus loan is a fallback loan program designed to be your last resort the program was created as a way for parents to borrow money for their college attending children when all other forms of financing have been exhausted as a result you have the following major disadvantages to using the plus loan you do have the bonus of being able to borrow up to 100 of your educational costs without any limits per year or in aggregate the major benefit of keeping your loans in the direct loan program is predictability many private student loans are variable interest rate loans which can result in higher payments during the course of the loan private loans are also not eligible for government loan forgiveness programs such as for working in a non profit for 10 years

allen welcome to money se you 've stumbled into the issue of debt snowball which is the low balance method of paying off debt the other being high interest i absolutely agree that when one has a pile of cards say a dozen there is a psychological benefit to paying off the low balances and knocking off card after card i am not dismissive of that motivation personal finance has that first word personal and one size rarely fits all for those who are numbers oriented it 's worth doing the math a simple spreadsheet showing the cost of the ds vs paying by rate   if that cost is even a couple hundred dollars i 'll still concede that one less payment envelope stamp etc favors the ds method on the other hand there 's the debt so large that the best payoff is 2 or 3 years away during that time $ 10000 paid toward the 24 card is saving you $ vs the $ 500 if paid toward 5 debt hard core do n't even want to discuss the numbers strangely enough   in your case you do n't have a pile of anything the mortgage is n't even up for discussion you have just 2 car loans send the $ 11,000 to the $ 19 k loan carrying the 2.5 this will save you $ 500 over the next 2 years vs paying the zero loan down once you 've done that the remaining $ 8000 will become your lowest balance and you should flip to the debt snowball method which will keep you paying that debt off   ds is a tool that should be pulled out for the masses the radio audience that the david dave ramsey radio show host appeals to they may comprise the majority of those with high credit card debt and have greatest success using this method but you exhibit none of their symptoms and are best served by the math by bringing up the topic here you 've found yourself in the same situation as the guy who happens to order a white wine at a wedding and finds his cousin offering to take him to an aa meeting the next day   in past articles on this decision i 've referenced a spreadsheet one can download it offers an easy way to see your choice without writing your own excel doc for the situation described here the low balance total interest is $ vs $ for the higher interest not quite the $ 500 difference i estimated the $ 350 difference is low due to the small rate difference and relatively short payoffs in my opinion knowledge is power and you can decide either way what 's important is that if you pay off the zero interest first you can say i knew it was a $ 350 difference but i 'd rather have just one outstanding loan for the remain time my issue with ds is when it 's like a religion and followers are told to not even run the numbers i wrote an article thinking about dave ramsey a number of years back but the topic never gets old

here 's another rational reason discount this typically works only in smaller stores where you 're talking directly to the owners but it is sometimes possible to negotiate a few percent off the price when paying by check since otherwise they 'd have to give a few percent to the credit card company occasionally the sales reps at larger stores have the authority to cut this deal but it 's far less common not worth worrying about on small items but if you 're making a large purchase a bedroom suite for example it can pay for lunch and sometimes the store 's willing to give you more discount than that simply because with checks they do n't have to worry about chargebacks or some of the other that can occur in credit card processing another reason nobody 's very likely to steal you check number and try to write themselves a second check or otherwise use it without authorization it 's just too easy to steal credit card info these days to make printing checks worth the effort but in the end the real answer is that there 's no rational reason not to use checks so it takes you a few seconds more to complete the transaction what were you going to do with those seconds that makes them valuable especially if they 're seconds that the store is spending your purchase so there 's no lost time and the effort really is n't all that different from signing the credit card authorization quoting dean there are two kinds of fool one says this is old and therefore good the other says this is new and therefore better

no there is no special given to first time tax payers in general this should n't be an issue the irs collects your taxes out of every one of your paychecks throughout the entire year in what is called a withholding tax the amount that the irs withholds is calculated on your w-4 form that you file with your employer whenever you take a new job the form helps you calculate the right number of allowances to claim usually this is the number of personal exemptions but depending upon if you work a second job are married and your spouse works or if you itemize the number of allowances can be increased withholding tax withholding tax also known as payroll withholding is essentially income tax that is withheld from your wages and sent directly to the irs by your employer in other words it ’s like a credit against the income taxes that you must pay for the year by subtracting this money from each paycheck that you receive the irs is basically withholding your anticipated tax payment as you earn it in general most people overestimate their tax liability this is bad for them because they have essentially given the irs an interest free loan and were n't able to use the money to earn interest themselves i have n't heard of any program targeted at first time tax payers to tell them to file a return but considering that most tax payers overpay they should or they are giving the government a free grant

what are the risks pertaining to timing on long term index    investments the risks are countless for any investment strategy   if you invest in us stocks and prices revert to the long term adjusted average you will lose a lot of money   if you invest in cash inflation may outpace interest rates and you will lose money   if you invest in gold the price might go down and you will lose money   it 's best to study history and make a reasonable decision i.e. invest in stocks here are long term returns by asset class computed by jeremy siegel   $ 1 invested in equities in equals $ today if was not invested and $ million if it was invested in stocks   this is the magic of compound interest and cash bonds have not been nearly as magical as stocks historically 2 how large are these risks the following chart shows the largest drawdowns decreases in the value of an asset since 1970 source   asset prices decrease in value frequently   financial assets are volatile but historically they have increased over time enabling investors to earn compounded returns exponential growth of money is how to get rich   i personally view drawdowns as an excellent time to buy it 's like going on a shopping spree when everything in the store is discounted 3 in case i feel not prepared to take these risks how can i avoid    them the optimal asset allocation depends on the ability to take risk and your tolerance for risk   you are young and have a long investment horizon so if stocks go down you will have plenty of time to wait for them to go back up if you 're smart you 'll buy more stocks when they go down because they 're cheap so your ability to bear risk is high   from your description it seems like you have a low risk tolerance despite a high ability to be exposed to risk   here 's the return of various asset classes and how the average investor has fared over the last 20 years source   get educated read common sense on mutual funds a random walk down wall street etc and do n't be average closing words investing in a globally diversified portfolio with a dollar cost averaging strategy is the best strategy for most investors   for investors that are unable to stay rational when markets are volatile i.e. the investor sells their stocks when stocks decrease 20 a more conservative asset allocation is recommended   due to the nature of compounded interest a conservative portfolio is likely to have a much lower future value

you have made a good start because you are looking at your options because you know that if you do nothing you will have a big tax bill in april 2017 you want to make sure that you avoid the underpayment penalty one way to avoid it is to make estimated payments but even if you do that you could still make a mistake and overpay or underpay i think the easiest way to handle it is to reach the safe harbor if your withholding from your regular jobs and any estimated taxes you pay in 2016 equal or exceed your total taxes for 2015 then even if you owe a lot in april 2017 you can avoid the underpayment penalty if you agi is over 150 k you have to make sure your withholding is 110 of your 2015 taxes then set aside what you think you will owe in your bank account until you have to pay your taxes in april 2017 you only have to adjust your withholding to make the safe harbor you can make sure easily enough once your file this years taxes you only have to make sure that you reach the 100 or 110 threshold from irs pub 17 who must pay estimated tax if you owe additional tax for 2015 you may have to pay estimated tax    for 2016 you can use the following general rule as a guide during the year to    see if you will have enough withholding or if you should increase    your withholding or make estimated tax payments   general rule     in    most cases you must pay estimated tax for 2016 if both of the    following apply you expect to owe at least $ 1,000 in tax for 2016 after subtracting your withholding and refundable credits you expect your withholding plus your refundable credits to be less than the smaller of a. 90 of the tax to be shown on your 2016 tax return or b. 100 of the tax shown on your 2015 tax return but see special rules for farmers fishermen and higher income taxpayers later    your 2015 tax return must cover all 12 months reminders estimated tax safe harbor for higher income taxpayers if your 2015    adjusted gross income was more than $ 150,000 $ 75,000 if you are    married filing a separate return you must pay the smaller of 90 of    your expected tax for 2016 or 110 of the tax shown on your 2015    return to avoid an estimated tax penalty

you are smart to read books to better inform yourself of the investment process   i recommend reading some of the passive investment classics before focusing on active investment books if you still feel like you can generate after tax after expenses alpha returns in excess of the market returns take a shot at some active investing   if you actively invest i recommend the core satellite approach invest most of your money in a well diversified basket of stocks via index funds and actively manage a small portion of your account   carefully track the expenses and returns of the active portion of your account and see if you are one of the lucky few that can generate excess returns to truly understand a text like the intelligent investor you need to understand finance and accounting   for example the price to earnings ratio is the equity value of an enterprise total shares outstanding times price per share divided by the earnings of the business   at a high level earnings are just revenue less cogs less operating expenses less taxes and interest   earnings depend on a company 's revenue recognition inventory accounting methods fifo lifo purchase price allocations from acquisitions etc   if you do n't have a business degree business background i do n't think books are going to provide you with the requisite knowledge unless you have the discipline to read textbooks   i learned these concepts by completing the chartered financial analyst program

you need to clarify with bob what your agreement is if you and bob are working together on these jobs as partners you should get a written partnership agreement done by a lawyer who works with software industry entity formation you can legally be considered a partnership if you are operating a business together even if there is nothing in writing the partnership will have its own tax return and you each will be allocated 50 of the profits losses if that 's what you agree to this amount will be reported on your own individual 1040 as self employment income since you have now lost all the expense deductions you would have taken on your schedule c and any home office deduction it 's a good idea to put language in the partnership agreement stating that the partnership will reimburse partners for their out of pocket expenses if bob is just hiring you as a contractor you give him your ssn and he issues you a 1099 like any other client this should be a situation where you invoice him for the amount you are charging same thing with joe figure out if you 're hiring him as an independent contractor or if you have a partnership either way you will owe income and self employment tax on your profits in the case of a partnership the amount will be on the k-1 from the partnership return for an independent contractor who 's operating as a sole proprietor you report the income you invoiced for and received and deduct your expenses including independent contractors that you hired on your schedule c. talk to your tax guy about quarterly estimated payments if you do n't have a tax guy go get one find somebody people in your city working in your industry recommend a good tax person will save you more money than they cost irs circular 230 notice please note that any tax advice contained in this communication is not intended to be used and can not be used by anyone to avoid penalties that may be imposed under federal tax law

in the us the best way to solve the problem imho would be via a trust talk to a properly licensed trust estate attorney and a tax adviser ea cpa licensed in your state using intermediary who 's not a organization may pose income tax issues to that intermediary as providing support to the needy is not a valid business expense it may also pose gift tax issues since the aggregate amounts may exceed the statutory exemption limits using a non trust you can avoid these issues but others may come up such as what to do with the trust income or moneys talk to the advisers about how to avoid them

how can they reduce the number of shares i hold they may have purchased them   you do n't say what stock it is so we can only speculate   let 's say that the stock is called penny   so they may have taken your 1600 penny shares and renamed them to 1600 shares   then they created a new $ 5 penny share and gave you shares of that in exchange for your 1600 shares   this suggests that your old shares were worth $ or less than a tenth of a cent each    as an example mylan did this in 2015 as part of their tax inversion moved official headquarters from the us to europe   they did not change the number of shares at that time but mylan is not a penny stock    this is the kind of thing that might happen in a bankruptcy    a reverse split where they give you one share in exchange for more than one share is also possible although you received an odd amount for a reverse split   usually those produce numbers   a number like sounds more like a market price as those can be bizarre

my original answer contained a fundamental error it turns out that it is not true that any exchange can create its own product to track any underlying index   if the underlying index is copyrighted such as the s&p indices russell indices dow jones indices etc then the exchange must enter into a licensing agreement usually exclusive with the copyright holder in order to use the index 's formula and name   without such a license the exchange would only be able to approximate the underlying index and i do n't think that happens very much because how would you market such a product the cme offers several futures and other derivatives whose face value is equivalent to some multiple of the s&p500 's value on the date when the product expires   when such a product is actively traded it may serve as a reasonable indicator of the market 's expectation of the s&p500 's future value so you could pay attention to the front month of the cme 's s&p 500 mini future which trades from chicago time sunday night through friday afternoon   but remember that the prices quoted there are as another example if you care about the russell 2000 index until 2017 the ice exchange happened to hold the license for its derivatives   they traded from new york time sunday night through friday afternoon   but in cme bought that license as well so now you 'll want to track it here moral there 's almost always some after hours product out there tracking whatever index you care about but you may have to do some digging to find it and it might not be all that useful for your specific purpose

let 's clarify some things companies allow for the public to purchase their shares through initial public offering ipo first time and seasoned public offering all other times they choose however many shares they want to issue depending on the amount of capital they want to raise what this means is that the current owners give up some ownership in exchange for cash usually in the course of ipos and it can happen that the public will not buy all shares if there is very little interest but i would assume that the more probable scenario if very little interest is present is that the shares value would take a big drop on their issuance date from the proposed ipo price after those shares are bought by the public they are traded on exchanges which are a secondary and mostly do not affect the underlying company the shares are exchanged from john doe to jane doe as john doe believes the market value for those shares will take a direction that jane doe believes in the opposite generally speaking markets will find an equilibrium price where you can reasonably easily buy sell securities as the price is not too far from what most participants in the market believe it should be in cases where all participants agree on the direction most often in case of a crash it can be hard to find a party to make a trade with say a company just announced negative news with long lasting effects on the business there will be a surge in sell orders with very few buyers if you are willing to buy you will likely very easily find a trading partner but if you are trying to sell instead then you will have to compete for the lowest price against all other sellers all that to say that in such cases while shares are technically the end result can be that no shares are

it depends solely on the risk your willing to take for example few years back one of the leading banks in my country was offering 25 interest rate for 5 year fixed deposits and the lending rate in the market was around 12 so people borrowed money from other banks and invested in the high return fixed deposits after 6 months the bank filed for bankruptcy and people lost their money later investigations revealed that abnormal high return was offered because the bank had a major liquidity problem so all depends on the risk associated with return on your investment higher the risk higher the return

there is a problem with grouping them all as dismantling as many are and are wasteful   the epa itself can not get out of it 's own way     i worked on one project recently 2 years ago where we were designing a cooling tower huge ac for power plant for goose creek sc where we were going to add another tower so that they could eventually switch to a close loop system keeps all water in system no dumping in river   the city of goose creek went to court because the epa made a rule that by a certain date a company could no longer use an open system on a cooling tower if it dumped into a   the city got their wish and they won and the epa backed off and the town of goose creek gets to keep the dirty warm water that was is being dumped into the river so that the fishermen would have better catches no shit this is how it was and they wanted to keep it they did n't want to chance losing the warm waters that drew more fish   well jokes on the town as we are now building a tower in that location that will have an open system to dump into the river   here 's the catch before it was to be a tower where the water must be better quality as the media in the tower could foul and impact the thermal rating of the tower now they are going with a type tower and the media on those can accept the worst fucking water you can think of and still perform properly   so now the fishermen will get some nasty water that will be just below the allowable amount set by the epa so that some lazy people can catch fish easier   that is what i consider a wasteful government program   but that is just my opinion based on an interaction i had with a project where the epa stuck there big head where they did nt even know what they were doing

when you compare the costs of paying your current mortgage with the rental income from the flat you 're not really comparing like with like firstly the mortgage payments are covering both interest and capital repayments so some of the 8k is money that is adding to your net worth secondly the value of the flat 130k is much more than the outstanding mortgage 80k so if you did sell the flat and pay off the mortgage you 'd have 50k left in cash that could be invested to provide an income the right way to compare the two options is to look at the different costs in each scenario let 's assume the bigger house will cost as it makes the figures work out nicely if you buy the bigger house with a bigger mortgage you will need to borrow 50k more so will end up with a mortgage of 130k and you will still have the 8k year from the flat depending on your other income you might have to pay tax on the 8k year e.g. at 40 if you 're a higher rate taxpayer leaving you with year if you sell the flat you 'll have no mortgage repayments to make and no income from the flat you 'll be able to exactly buy the new house outright with the 50k left over after you repay the mortgage on top of your old house you 'd also have to pay some costs to sell the flat that you would n't have to with the bigger mortgage but you 'd save on the costs of getting a new mortgage they probably are n't the same but let 's simplify and assume they are if anything the costs of selling the flat are likely to be higher than the mortgage costs viewed like that you should look at the actual costs to you of having a 130k mortgage and how much of that would be interest given that you 'll be remortgaging at current mortgage rates i 'd expect interest would only be 2 3 i.e around 4k so significantly less than the income from the flat even after tax the total payment would be more because of capital repayment but you could easily afford the cashflow difference you can vary the term of the mortgage to control how much the capital repayment is and you should easily be able to get a 130k mortgage on a house with a very good deal so if your figure of 8k rent is accurate considering void periods costs of upkeep etc then i think it easily makes sense to get the bigger house with the bigger mortgage given the tax impact which was pointed out in a comment a third strategy may be even better keep the flat but take out a mortgage on it in exchange for a reduced mortgage on your main house the reason for doing it that way is that you get some tax relief on the mortgage costs on an investment property as long as the income from that property is higher than the costs whereas you do n't on your primary residence the tax relief used to just be at the same tax rate you were paying on the rental income i.e. you could subtract the mortgage costs from the rental income when calculating tax it 's gradually being reduced so it 's just basic rate tax relief 20 even if you pay higher rate tax but it still could save you some money you 'd need to look at the different mortgage costs carefully as buy to let mortgages often have higher interest rates

living in one unit of a multi family while renting out the others although not without its risks can be a viable if gradual way to build wealth it 's been recently as house hacking but the underlying mechanics have been around for many years many cities in the northeast in particular remain full of neighborhoods of homes built and used for exactly that purpose for decades though now frequently sub divided into condos   it 's true you 'd need to borrow money but there are a number of reasons why it 's certainly at least worth exploring which is what you seem to be asking should you bother doing the homework tl;dr yes and yes you would be relying on tenants to meet your monthly expenses including a mortgage bill that will arrive whether the other units are vacant or not but in most markets rental prices are far less volatile than home prices from the san francisco federal reserve the main result from this is that the behavior of the    price rent ratio for housing mirrors that of the price dividend ratio    for stocks the majority of the movement of the price rent ratio comes    from future returns not rental growth rates emphasis added it 's also important to remember that rental income must do more than just cover your mortgage there 's lots of other expenses associated with a rental property including insurance taxes maintenance vacancy an allowance for the periods when the property will be empty in between tenants reserves for capital improvements and more as with any investment it 's all about whether the numbers work you mentioned not being interested in the upkeep work so that 's another 8 10 off the top to pay for a property manager if you can find a property at an attractive price secure financing on attractive terms and can be reasonably confident that it will rent in the ballpark of 1.5 2 of the purchase price then it might be a fine choice for you assuming you are willing and able to handle the work of being a landlord something worth at least as much of your research time as the investment itself   it sounds like you 're still a ways away from having enough for even an fha down payment which gives you a great opportunity to find and talk with some local folks who already manage rental properties in your area for example you might look for a local chapter of the national real estate investment association to get a sense of what 's really involved

it depends on what stocks you invest in or whether you invest in an index as all stocks are not created equally if you prefer to invest directly into individual stocks and you choose ones that are financially health and trending upwards you should be able to easily outperform any indexes and get your 30 return much quicker but you always need to make sure that you have a stop loss placed on all of your stocks because even the best performing companies can go through bad patches the stop loss prevents you from losing all your capital if the share price suddenly starts going south and turns into a downtrend

congratulations on deciding to save money and choosing to invest it one thing to know about mutual funds including index funds is that they typically require a minimum investment of a few thousand dollars $ 3000 being a typical amount unless the investment is in an ira in which case $ 1000 might be a minimum in some cases automated monthly investments of $ 50 or $ 100 might need to be set up if you are beginning with a small balance there is nothing wrong with your approach you now should go and look at the various requirements for specific index funds the fidelity and vanguard families are good choices and both offer very low cost index funds to choose from but different funds can have different requirements regarding minimum investments etc you also have a choice of which index you want to follow the s&p 500 index midcap indexes small cap indexes total stock market indexes etc but your choice might be limited   until you have more money to invest because of minimum investment rules etc    most important after you have made your choice i urge you to not look every day or even every month to see how your investment is doing you will save yourself a lot of anxiety and will save yourself from making wrong decisions   far too many investors ignore the buy low sell high and pull money out of what should be long term investments at the first of a downturn and end up buying high and selling low finally the time is approaching when most stock funds will be declaring dividends and capital gains distributions if you invest now you may end up with a paper profit on which you will have to pay taxes in   non tax advantaged accounts on your 2012 tax return this is called buying a dividend and so you might want to spend some time investigating now but actually make the investment in late december after your chosen fund has made its distributions the date for this will be on the fund 's web site or in early 2013

from accounting perspective an unpaid bill for internet services according to the accruals concept is recorded as a liability under current liabilities section of the balance sheet also as an expense on the income statement   so to answer your question it is both a debt and an expense however this is only the case at the end of the period if you manage to pay it before the financial period ends this is simply an expense that is financed by cash or other liquid asset on the balance sheet such as prepayment for example for private persons you are generally given some time to pay the bill so it is technically a debt internet provider would list you as a debtor on their accounts but this is not something to worry about unless you are not considering to pay this bill in which case your account may be sold as part of a factoring and you will then have a debt affecting your credit rating

the price at which a stock was purchased is a sunk cost that is you can not go back in time and reverse the decision you made to purchase that stock   another example of a sunk cost would be purchasing a non refundable non transferable movie ticket   sunk costs have the tendency to create a cognitive bias in which we feel that the amount we paid at some point in the past should have some sort of bearing on the decision we make now the purchaser of the ticket feels he must go see the movie even if he no longer wishes too lest the ticket go to waste the investor to a stock for that tiny chance that just maybe some day it will return to its former glory   this is referred to as the sunk cost fallacy and is considered to be irrational behavior by economists keeping this in mind your hopes and dreams for the stock at the time you purchased it should have no bearing on the decision you make now   similarly whether the stock has risen or fallen in price since your purchase date should have no bearing   instead you must consider what you expect the stock to do from this very moment on into the future that is you must act at the margin you 've indicated that you are faced with two choices sell the stock now incur the loss but benefit from the tax break option a   this benefit is quite easily quantifiable it is your marginal tax rate multiplied by the additive inverse of the loss assuming you have will have other gains to offset   let 's just assume that you incurred a $ 1000 loss at a marginal tax rate of 20 which means your tax benefit for the loss is $ 200 the second choice to hold the stock in hopes of it rising in price option a bit harder to quantify   you must assume that today is day zero and that every cent in price the stock rises is a gain to you and every cent in price the stock looses is a loss to you   if you believe that the stock will rise to a price that will net your more than your tax benefit from option a then holding the stock is more favorable than selling it at a loss today   conversely if you believe this stock will fall even further in the future or not rise enough to net you $ 200 per the example then option a is preferable granted there are some additional complications that play into your decision   by selling the stock today you not only get a tax benefit from the loss but you 've also freed up the funds previously used to purchase that stock to be invested elsewhere in hopefully a better performing asset   if you choose to stick with your current stock then the gains you may have netted elsewhere must be considered as an opportunity cost associated with option b.   finally the tax benefit is essentially guaranteed so in our example a $ 200 risk free return while sticking with the stock in option b still comes with some risk

yes this should probably be a comment not an answer but it 's a bit long i do n't know what the laws are specifically about this but my grandfather used to be on the board of a company that he helped to found and back in the 1980s there was a period when the stock price suddenly one of the officers in the company knowing that the stock was over valued sold around a third of his shares and he got investigated for insider trading   i do n't recall if he was ever charged with anything but there were some false rumors spreading about the company at the time one was that they had something that you could on meat to reduce the cholesterol   i do n't know where the rumors came from but i 've always assumed it was some sort of pump and dump stock manipulation as this was decades before they were on the s&p 500 small cap after that the company had a policy where officers had to announce they were selling stock and that it would n't execute for some time 1 2 weeks something like that   i do n't know if that was the sec 's doing or something that the company came up with on their own

i went to a local college for 8k yr while living at home since i did n't have to take any loans i 'm a lot better off than those people who went to 40k yr schools and are up the river with loans i think most local cheap school systems are good enough for majors that do n't require the prestige of a major school system it really makes 0 sense to spend 40k yr if you 're going to become a teacher and i think more and more people will start to realize this stay in state do n't live on campus = save moneys

i say before investing your real capital into the stock market play around on the virtual stock exchange game it let 's you invest with virtual capital and you can gain experience with the stock market i would n't start investing in stock until i 'm sure i can cover losses though if you do intend to invest stocks so early in your career then you should learn how to read sec filings not necessary but helpful in understanding how investors think such as documents so you can predict profitability and growth of companies you invest in once you become a veteran of the stock market game you probably wo n't need to read the sec filings into too much detail especially if you have a diverse portfolio good luck the one takeaway from this message would probably be stop and play around on virtual stocks before yourself in the real thing

gbp is widely traded currency and it is definitely possible to send gbp internationally with out any conversion of late banks are trying to maximize the fx and if they see a euro country the sending bank assumes the beneficiary account is in euro and converts to get fx spread than letting the beneficiary bank decide keep complaining to your bank and then the sending bank will put your account in exception and not convert next payments

you still owe the money because there is a high probability that some other organization the account and assets of the failed creditor   that means they will have bought your debt   i have to assume there is language in your note that explains that they might sell your debt but what should one do if they do n't know who bought the entity   you ca n't pay a non existent entity but if you do n't have an address how can you pay the new owner of the debt first step is to assume there will be a new owner   a government a company an individual somebody will buy that debt   read the news and see if you ca n't figure out what other entity owns your note   you might have to contact them to enquire about where to send payment   keep records of any such contact if you put in an honest effort but just can not figure out who owns your note i 'd suggest continuing to make regular on time payments   but put your payments into a new bank account that you open just for this purpose   so when the new owner of the debt does come calling you 'll have reasonable proof you were attempting to pay   you simply settle up from the special account   any reasonable company will just take the money and if anybody gets unreasonable and you have to appear in court you have a paper trail indicating your attempts to honour the debt you 'd have to consult a lawyer if nobody comes asking for the money   there are probably statutes of limitation but i would n't count on that ever happening

you most definitely can invest such an amount profitably but it makes it even more important to avoid fees um at all costs because fees tend to have a fixed component that will be much worse for you than for someone investing € 200k so   edit the above assumes that you actually want to invest in the long run for modest but relatively certain gains maybe 5 above inflation while accepting temporary downswings of up to 30 if those € 2000 are funny money that you do n't mind losing but would be really excited about maybe getting 100 return in less than 5 years well feel free to put them into an individual stock of an obscure small company but be aware that you 'd be gambling not investing and you can probably get better quotes playing roulette

the prices quoted are for currency pairs traded on the foreign exchange market for currencies traded on these exchanges the exchange rates of a given currency pair are determined by the market so supply and demand investor confidence etc all play a role and reuters are the two primary trading platforms in the foreign exchange market and much of the data on exchange rates comes from them websites will usually get their data either from these sources directly or from a data provider that in turn gets it from reuters or another data source like bloomberg or analytics these data sources are n't free however   in the us many contracts transactions etc that involve exchange rates use the exchange rate data published by the federal reserve you might see this in contracts that specify to use the exchange rate published by the federal reserve at 12 pm noon on date you can also look at the federal reserve economic data which maintains data series of historical daily weekly and monthly exchange rates for major currency pairs these data are free although they are n't realtime data for each business day is mostly updated the next business day

yes of course   my point is there are lots of different ways this could be funded   for instance one of the doctors complained that insurance only paid him $ 100 for a one hour exam but it costs him $ to operate his office so he quit taking insurance   he said single payer is the way to go   but what if single payer also only pays him $ 100 for the exam   then it 's probably not so great    if single payer pays him $ 300 but it requires a 20 payroll tax to fund the system would that be great     i am not questioning a single payer system   i am only questioning the lack of information in endorsing a single payer

the time value of money is very important in understanding this issue   money today is worth more than money next year two years from now etc it 's a well understood economics concept and well worth reading about if you have some well time not only is money literally worth more now than later due to inflation but there is the simple fact that assuming you have money for the purpose of doing something being able to do that thing today is better than doing that same thing tomorrow   a bird in the hand is worth two in the bush gets to this rather directly having it now is better than probably having it later   would you rather have a nice meal tonight or eat beans and rice tonight and then have the same nice meal next year that 's why interest exists in part you 're offered some money now for more money later or in the case of buying a bond you 're offered more money later for some money now   the fact that people have different discount rates for money later is why the loan market can exist people with more money than they can use now have a lower discount for future money than people who really need money right now to buy a house to pay their rent whatever    so when choosing to buy a bond you look at the money you 're going to get both over the short term the coupon rate and the long term the face value and you consider whether $ 80 now is worth $ 100 in 20 years plus $ 2 per year   for some people it is for some people it is n't and that 's why the price is as it is $ 80   odds are if you have a few thousand usd you 're probably not going to be interested in this or if you have a very long term outlook there are better ways to make money over that long term   but if you 're a bank needing a secure investment that wo n't lose value or a trust that needs high stability you might be willing to take that deal

as others have noted your definition of market price is a bit loose   really whatever price you get becomes the current market price   what you usually get quoted are the current best bid and ask with the last transaction price   for stocks that do n't trade much the last transaction price may not be representative of the current market value your question included regulation standards bureau and i do n't think the current answers are addressing that   in the us the securities and exchange commission sec provides some regulation regarding execution price   it goes by the designation regulation and very roughly it says that each transaction has to take the best available price at the time that it is executed   there are some but that 's the gist of it no regulation ensures that there will be a counterparty to any transaction that you want to make   it could happen for example that you have shares of some company that you 're never able to sell because no one wants them bitcoin is the same in this regard   there is a currently a market for bitcoin but there 's no regulation that ensures there will be a market for it tomorrow outside of the us i do n't know what regulation if any exists

healthcare for the employee is more valuable to the employer than is providing healthcare for the rest of the family members   depending on the family situation you 're going to see significant differences in price between out of pocket costs for insurance of just the employee vs cost for insuring the entire family   this is because in the first instance the insurance is more subsidized by the company as a percentage of the total cost    the costs to the company for insuring just the individual mid career are in the neighborhood of $ 5000 per year   if this is all that 's being negotiated single person coverage then i would use that amount as a baseline

the crazy thing about this is that $ 30 million in annual salary and compensation really is n't the end of the story for rich guys   i worked for a reit a few years back and the guy that founded that reit made a few million in salary a year   i thought the number seemed a bit low for his lifestyle   he had many properties in the us for his own personal use around 6 8 big homes   he also had a garage that was insane   he had over 25 very expensive cars   my co workers would say nick is out his garage when he drove one to work every day for a month without driving the same vehicle twice in one month   it turns out he owned 30 million shares of stock that paid him $ 1.00 per share per year   so while his annual compensation was only a few million per year his dividend income was many many times that   think about that next time you see a ceo 's annual income and you think that it really is n't as much as you expect

for a while i tried shopping multiple grocery stores checking fliers each week from three different stores and then making the trip to all three stores to save ten cents on each item after a couple months i decided it just was n't worth it   so i picked my favorite store   i shop once a week after reviewing the flier and making a list   i clip coupons and try to only buy what 's on my list   i confess that coupons sometimes get me to buy a brand or item i would n't have otherwise it 's my weakness the biggest place that we save money though is by paying attention to meat prices   i know that chicken and pork go on sale for $ every 4 to 6 weeks at my grocery store   when it does i buy a enough to last until the next sale and freeze it in single meal portions   steak and fish are special treats but on the rare occasion that they 're less than $ i 'll buy those   we also try to limit our meat consumption to every other day it 's not worth it for me to obsess over the price of ketchup that i buy twice a year but on expensive items like meat and items we use daily i become familiar with their regular prices and sale prices and buy extra when it 's on sale   if like me you do n't have room in your brain to keep track of the prices of everything stick with the things you spend the most on either because they 're expensive or you buy a lot

is it worth it you state the average yield on a stock as 2 3 but seem to have come up with this by looking at the yield of an s&p500 index   not every stock in that index is paying a dividend and many of them that are paying have such a low yield that a dividend investor would not even consider them   unless you plan to buy the index itself you are distorting the possible income by averaging in all these you are also assuming your income is directly proportional to the amount of yield you could buy right now   but that 's a false measure because you are talking about building up your investment by contributing $ month   no matter what asset you choose to invest in it 's going to take some time to build up to producing $ 20k year income at that rate   investments today will have time in market to grow in multiple ways given you have some time immediate yield is not what you should be measuring dividends or other investments on in my opinion   income investors usually focus on yield on cost a measure of income to be received this year based on the purchase price of the asset producing that income   if you do go with dividend investing and your investments grow the dividends themselves on a regular basis it 's not unheard of for to be north of 6 in 10 years   the same can be true of rental property given that rents can rise achieving that with dividends has alot to do with picking the right companies but you 've said you are not opposed to working hard to invest correctly so i assume researching and teaching yourself how to lower the risk of picking the wrong companies is n't something you 'd be opposed to i know more about dividend growth investing than i do property investing so i can only provide an example of a dividend growth entry strategy many dividend growth investors have goals of not entering a new position unless the current yield is over 3 and only then when the company has a long consistent track record of growing eps and dividends at a good rate a low debt cashflow ratio to reduce risk of dividend cuts and a good moat to preserve competitiveness of the company relative to its peers   amongst many other possible measures   they then buy only on dips or where the price causes a higher yield and lower than normal p e at the same time that they have faith that they 've valued the company correctly for a 3 + year or longer hold time there are those who self report that they 've managed to build up a $ dividend payment portfolio in less than 10 years   check out dividend growth investor 's blog for an example   there 's a whole world of dividend growth investing strategies and writings out there and the commenters on his blog will lead to links for many of them i want to point out that income is not just for those who are old   some people planned and have achieved the ability to retire young purely because they 've built up an income portfolio that covers their expenses    assuming you want that the question is whether stock assets that pay dividends is the type of investment process that with you or if something else fits you better   i believe the op says they 'd prefer long hold times with few activities once the investment decisions are made and is n't by significant work to identify his investments   both real estate and stocks fit the latter but the of dividend growth stocks and hands off property investing which i assume means paying for a property manager are a better fit for the former   in my opinion the biggest additional factor differentiating these two is liquidity concerns   post tax stock accounts are going to be much easier to turn into emergency cash than a real estate portfolio   whether that 's an important factor depends on personal situation though

well you have three main options in my opinion for cash or any assets you can convert to cash you could purchase bonds with a maturity date close to what you are looking to lock your funds up for while you could sell these on a secondary market admittedly however you have a justification you can provide to yourself as to why you can not sell them fixed term deposits often have poor interest rates but if you ask to withdraw your money early you often forfeit all of the interest you would have gained while your money would not be locked up it keeps it further out of your reach just like bonds every step further away from your bank account the funds get the less likely you are to surrender to giving away money that is rightfully yours it comes with the added advantage of typically high returns trust funds can be set up with anyone as the beneficiary and provide legal barriers so long as the beneficiary is n't also the executor while it can be expensive to do so you could hire a lawyer who specialises in estate law to set up a trust fund you are the beneficiary of which has stipulations as to how and when assets can be released i did n't include this as one of the main three because it does n't allow you to specify exactly when funds are released to you but in many countries including the us you have special tax advantaged retirement accounts where funds are locked away until you retire however it is unfortunate you even need to think about this another thing to consider is that if people start pressuring you for money you should cut them out of your life

you just need to average out the weekly hours and income over the year so if his yearly income is $ 100,000 p.a then this would average out to $ 2000 per week of which 15 would be $ 300 per week it does not have to be exactly 15 per week as long as over the long run your saving your target 15 if he gets a pay rise you can include this in the saving plan say he gets a 5 increase in pay you would increase the $ 300 per week by 5 to $ per week

i ca n't help you with consolidation but i 'd suggest automating as much of the payments as possible if not you might take a look at any of the numerous online banks that have online bill pay and open an account with them e.g. ing direct ally etc you can set up the online account to pull from your current checking savings account and then make payments from that online account to your loans when you have that set up if there is some extra payment you want to make you can set up an automatic additional periodic payment to get rid of one lender at a time until everything is paid off

we had this happen to us 2 months ago   there is basically a criminal organization called united telecom they are partnered with united telecoms business model is switching your long distance without your permission   we get a bill and each phone line has all these extra charges that add up to about $ 100   i call to find out what is happening and i find out we have been slammed long distance switched without our permission   apparently they call and ask if this is business x and if you say yes they are recording it and use that as evidence that you agreed to have your long distance switched   i spent close to six hours on the phone getting our account back in order   one of the people i spoke with at centurylink said they got a lot of calls about united telecom   it sounded like switching long distance services was a standard business practice for them    when i spoke with united telecom it was way to easy   the person that answered the phone removed our charged without any questions i thought that was strangely easy   if this is actually how they make money why would they back it off so easily   so i called centurylink back because i figured there had to be something else they left out when i spoke with them earlier   after some digging bundled up in an other charges section was about $ 5 for switching our long distance service   it took me almost a whole day to get this straightened out i spoke with 16 different people at centurylink   it became hilarious   i had them on speaker phone and we would just start laughing   one minute sir i will connect you to business services   here is the direct phone number in case you get disconnected 20 minutes of being on hold then i am sorry sir this is residential i will have to transfer you to business   same freaking thing over and over and over   i assume most people just give up or do n't have the time to sort this stuff out   tl;dr it seems like centurylink continues to allow united telecom to switch long distance services for their clients because it generates significant revenue for them   edit if you do n't want this to happen to you put a lock on your services   it takes two part authentication to change anything after that

the reason is n't because of the gold standard the real reason is because we have seen a sharp increase in fruit imports over the past 5 decades   huh agriculture is down to single digits as part of the gdp what does that have to do with a gold standard and monetary policy   is up rather dramatically as compared to 40 years ago maybe you mean manufacturing   productivity is up since say the turn of the century but this is to be expected since we incorporated electricity oil automobiles and eventually computers    but as soon as the usa left the gold exchange standard total factor productivity began to dramatically stagnate    that means the growth in productivity    you can see this best here   think of productivity like gdp it used to be 5 and was on its way to 6 but right as we went off the gold standard productivity increases stagnated and by 2007 we 're only at 5.5 instead of the expected 6 this uses a logarithmic function wherein 6 is 10x more than 5 so while productivity has not fallen in an absolute sense growth in productivity which is more important than absolute gdp growth has fallen and is infact related to a decrease in productivity growth   gt;the reason you 're seeing the gains over the past several years shifting towards the rich is due to a combination of tax policy and a rise in cronyism caused by our campaign financing problems big businesses often have a lot of lobbying power to get laws passed that ultimately are felt by the rest of the economy    the reason it has shifted to the rich is because as the currency has debased the gains have gone towards the biggest companies wealthiest individuals assisted by government which works like an auction house to those with connections which is why lobbying roi is huge   currency is a good thing for countries like the united states we can safely finance and pay our debts for a few more years while up debt without fear of hyperinflation    because our massive debt is doing so well for us in the beginning it looks nice because there is very little pain and is practically but as we see current events playing out in the us and to a greater extent europe which is nt as tightly economically as the us fiat currency has huge problems hyperinflation of commodities and deflation of assets are before our eyes house values are plummeting medical education consumer goods are inflating not quite to the hyper part but inflation is increasing and only when commodities such as oil see a deflation in demand as we see right now does inflation look under control shadow inflation is very much alive   if you have dollars in savings the rates do not even outpace inflation you are forced into riskier and investments to make a return   gt;now there may be a lot to gripe about how the united states is currently spending its money but it 's established practical fact that government investment can spur growth level out recessions help people etc   established over what the last 40 years that s hardly enough time to call practical fact when the gold standard existed for hundreds and thousands of years infact no fiat currency that has ever existed has survived that is the real fact and the dollar and euro themselves are currently going through the end stages of this cancer    the gold standard sucks it has a lot of problems fiat currency rocks for the usa because usa fuck yeah we are in a particular advantage where the real risks of fiat currency do n't really apply to the usa   55 million on food stamps with 20 30 million more on other forms of government assistance such as unemployment and welfare unemployment increasing gdp growth decreasing median income decreasing total employment stagnant same number of full time wage earners exist today as in 2000 despite 30 + million more american citizens decreased consumer confidence average age of cars on the road went from 5 years in the 1960s to 12 years today people do nt buy new cars as frequently meaning less disposable income decreased home ownership increased retirement age decreased young american employment   i am not sure why you think that the usa is in such a great position the american dream is if you 're just starting out in life just ask any number of recent college grads who are increasingly living with parents not getting married and ca n't find jobs

depends on how the money is invested within the 401k but in general prices move both up and down with a long bias toward up   think of it this way with fund shares priced lower now you are getting shares cheaper than when you entered the plan so this dip is actually working in your favor as long as you are comfortable trusting that long term view and trusting the funds your 401k money is going into believe me it 's even when you 're nearer your target retirement date and a 10 dip may be six figures but it 's all theoretical until you actually start drawing the money back out and you have to learn to accept some volatility as part of the trade off   for getting returns better than bonds

first off i 'm very sorry for your loss   depending on when the money comes in i would park it and give it some time   after that one of the best investments is paying off debt   right now your net worth is less than 30 k and that is really not even accessible until retirement   if the money is there to pay off the house i would do that   if there is n't enough to pay off the house then i would pay off the automobile and put all or a sizable portion of the remainder into the house   now you have very little risk in your life and most likely much more monthly income to invest in 401 k iras college funds or any other investment life insurance is mostly to replace your income if there are people counting on that income spouse kids etc   normally this would be invested to hopefully replace that income with the growth of the money   in your case it does n't sound like you were relying on your father 's income so this can go to clean up current debt finally depending on your relationship what kind of person your father was and how he was with financials what do you think he would want you to do with it

purchase loans tend to be more challenging to get the best possible rate because you have to balance closing the loan and getting the contract so there is n't as much time to shop around as when you do a refinance   i disagree with the sentiment to go with your local bank nothing wrong with asking at your local bank and using their numbers as a baseline but chances are they wo n't be competitive there are many reputable online mortgage originators that will show accurate fees and rates upfront assuming you provide accurate information   in the past there were a lot of issue with good faith estimates being pretty much worthless there were a fair number of horror stories about people showing up to closing and finding out fee or rates had increased dramatically there was a law passed after the housing debacle that severely limits the shenanigans that lenders can do at closing and so there is less risk when going with a lesser known lender in fact i would say the only real risk with a lender now days is choosing one that happens to be overloaded and or just has poor customer service in general personally i have found the most competitive rates from zillow 's mortgage service and the now defunct google mortgage the lenders tend to be smaller but highly efficient they are very much dependent on their online reputations i have heard good things about a number of larger online lenders but i do n't have personal experience so i will leave them off i personally would n't worry much about whether the loan is sold or not outside of refinancing i do n't think i have ever talked to the bank servicing my mortgage about my mortgage there just is n't much need to talk to them

i agree with the first the first step is to measure your spending and put it down into raw numbers once you have the raw numbers you will feel a natural inclination to improve on those numbers set yourself a daily target for cash incidental expenses it does nt have to be a crazy target just something you can achieve easily mark a tick mark next to every day on the calendar that you meet that target or spend less than the target gradually the momentum from the past few ticks will automatically compel you to want to tick off the next day   at the end of each week lower the target a little you 'll find that when you start measuring your expenditure you become more aware of how you might be wasting money all too often we just go out and buy stuff we do n't need without really thinking about it

you should be able to pay back whenever what 's the point of an arbitrary timeline cash flow is the life blood of any business   when banks loan money they are expecting a steady cash flow back if you just pay back whenever the bank has no idea what they 'll be getting back month to month   when they can set the terms of the loan length rate payment amount they know how much cash flow they expect to get   what does the term of the loan even mean and what difference in the world does it make in addition to the predictable cash flow needs above setting a term for the loan determines how long their money will be tied up in the loan the longer a bank has money tied up in a loan the more risk there is that the borrower will default so the bank will require a greater return interest rate for that extra risk what you have described is effectively a revolving line of credit   the bank let you borrow money arbitrarily charges you a certain rate of interest and you can pay them back at your schedule   if you pay all of the interest for that month everything else goes to principal if you do n't pay all of the interest that interest is added to the balance and gets interest compounded on top of it   both are perfectly viable business models and bank employ them both but they different needs for the bank   fixed term loans help stabilize cash flow and lines of credit provide convenience for customers

the details of how you can convert your 5 equity share to cash or stocks will be detailed in writing in the legal agreement you have already signed if you do not have any signed written agreement there is no 5 since 0 of anything is zero you can expect to get $ 0 some time within the next few years lastly if the person running the business tells you that there is 5 equity for you even though it is not in writing that is extremely unlikely to be the case this is because the seller of the equity has no obligation whatsoever to pay you in fact they are obligated by their other agreements with actual shareholders not to dilute their equity without good cause so odds are if your agreement is not in writing not only will it not be honored but it probably ca n't be honored

i got a ba in econ from a mid tier public school in ca and i graduated near the trough of the great recession so my experience may not represent what current and future graduates can expect it took a couple of years of shit jobs but i eventually got into banking a matter of who you know and after almost 5 years i could n't stand it anymore so i am starting my ms in econ at an also mid tier public ca school i ca n't compare to cs and my advice will differ from 's   1 never assume that jobs will we thrown at you especially a job that you actually want like and will make a career the job market is strong and you ought to be able to get an entry level analyst position if you can show you have strong econometrics many schools require you to do a research paper for your senior seminar instead of a graduation exam i recommend to choose a topic with good data available   2 all the government jobs i 've looked at required at least a master 's that said the roi on a phd is rarely worth it if you have to take on debt to do it you might be able to get your foot in the door with a bachelor 's but you wo n't be able to progress up the job ladder i suggest being a little more open minded about potential employers there are way more options when you consider consulting or business development for larger corporations   3 economics majors make the most out of the social scientists by far last i checked it was 60 80k depending on local market but i imagine that trails cs majors significantly you should be able to afford a decent standard of living in either field so certainly consider more on the basis of what kind of work you get the most satisfaction from   4 with an undergrad degree you will start in local government you may then be able to jump to state and then federal levels after 5 10 years experience but still may find it difficult if you forgo the master 's i have not personally worked as an economist but i do know you will spend a lot of time searching for collecting data writing or using statistical analysis programs to process it and writing up your reports   5 go search analyst on and you 'll find myriad positions in everything from finance to marketing to supply chain etc which ask for degrees in business finance or other related field economics   in my opinion the prestige of the university from which you graduate is secondary to the work you do   assuming you do a research paper if it is kick ass it wo n't matter much if you went to harvard or not check your city county jobs site for internship opportunities since no matter what even getting an entry level job can be difficult if you 've never had any job experience in the field or related field   labor economics is big since there 's a lot of good data and it is a hot topic personally i 'm focusing on urban economics real estate planning and transportation the beauty of econ is that it is so broad you can almost do whatever you want but the drawback is that it is so broad it can be tough to show employers that you possess the specific skills and knowledge that make you desirable   hope this helps

an economy produces goods and services and people use money to pay for those goods and services   money has value because people believe that they can buy and sell goods and services with it in that economy how much the value of money is is determined by how much money there is in comparison to goods and services supply and demand in most economies it is the job of the federal national reserve bank to ensure that prices stay stable ie the relationship of goods and services to how much money there is is stable as this is necessary for a well running economy   the federal reserve bank does so by making more printing decreasing interest rates or less increasing interest rates available to the economy to determine how much money needs to be in the economy to keep prices stable is incredibly hard as many factors have an impact if the reserve bank gets it wrong and there is more money compared to goods and services than previous prices will rise to compensate this is inflation if it 's the other way round is deflation since it is commonly regarded that deflation is much more destabilizing to an economy than inflation the reserve banks tend to err on the side of inflation

what 's funny to me is that the sales tax is n't what gives amazon better prices   it 's that stores have to include their costs on the price that 's shown on the shelf   amazon gets to tell you later that there 's a shipping fee amazon is n't paying a store staff and rental on store front property   in short amazon can show the customer a price that is making a decent profit and still be lower than a retail outlet

give him a second chance to fix it   some computer problems are hard to nail down   this   so you 're a tech   it 's common to work a problem do procedure a and b    that should 've fixed it test repeatedly to make sure it 's fixed and    hand it back to the customer and then the customer under his    operating conditions has it fail again   if it comes back to you you have the that a and b    did n't work   and you immediately try c and get it fixed    this    knowledge does not magically transfer to other shops    so the user goes into yelp mode and storms off angry to another shop they    blindly try a and b again burn in send him home it fails again    user 's even   this is how computers don't get fixed 5 discount for cash is reasonable if you want to know why that 's normal sign up for square   credit cards and checks have a significant overhead including the risk of bounces and chargebacks and that adds up to about 5   only a few businesses actively solicit it but many family owned businesses would accept it if you offered   so does the shop give you a creep factor other than your feelings about him not fixing it the first time   if so cut your losses and bolt you will definitely need to pay cash to have this fixed properly   otherwise take it back to him and give him a chance to fix it properly having dealt with a lot of customers what you say sounds an awful lot like problem so minor i was able to use it for 9 months before bothering to get it fixed which i 'm only doing because the warranty is ending and therefore i am about having to give it up for an extended period of time to have it fixed because the problem just is n't that important   if that 's true you 're in a values conflict and you might just be better off recognizing that   cheap pcs are cheap   but the vast majority of pc problems are not in fact hardware problems they are just ms windows being ms windows

it sounds cold but the law has to hold people to their agreements there are exceptions for unconscionable terms but i do n't think this gets close to that level this is certainly but not quite shocking to the conscience maybe there 's an argument to be made regarding whether a reasonably prudent person in the party 's position would have known what they were agreeing to under the circumstances depending upon how the provision was presented but without a lot more information we ca n't say whether that angle has a snowball 's chance in hell   you should read the terms governing every important agreement you enter into it sounds like a huge burden but for any major undertaking you really do need to grit your teeth and through the whole thing if you do n't like what you find ask for a second look from a lawyer to confirm your suspicions or just walk away    bank service agreements loan mortgage applications major venue reservations and employment contracts especially employment contracts all deserve that much time typically the terms you might not like are address circumstances that as a practical matter do n't really concern you but you might be surprised at how often you find deal breakers like this around in the woodwork

safe deposit boxes are rented out to customers and their content is not bank 's property money deposits are not being taken by the creditors if a bank goes bankrupt for the same reason its not bank 's money it belongs to the depositors however frequently banks go bankrupt because they do not have enough cash at hand to pay back the depositors in this case unless insured up to $ 250 k in the us k in eu some or all of the deposits may not be immediately or even at all available depositors become creditors of the bank in the bankruptcy proceedings safe deposit box however is rented to the customer and the content is not removed by the bank to be used elsewhere as happens with monetary deposits so even if the bank is bankrupt and does n't have enough money to cover the monetary deposits the content of the safe deposit boxes does n't magically disappear and the owner can get it back the access to the deposit box itself may be limited due to the bankruptcy but the content will remain there waiting for its owners in the united states when a bank goes bankrupt fdic takes over it and its assets safe deposit box rental contract is an asset it is taken over by the fdic and will be sold to a buyer usually as a part of the whole branch where the box is located who will continue operating servicing it

it seems from the bernanke and pundits in general that there 's an ideal inflation rate and it 's not zero when you reference that recessions bring prices down i think i understand you but recession does not mean deflation in fact deflation is a rarity not a common occurrence   when you look at what compounding does you see that a 3 inflation rate will double the cost of an item in 24 years from 1975 to 2010 inflation was 4x as it ran well above 3 for a time i chose that date as i was 13 at the time and was n't too aware of specific prices before that so i 've seen a pizza go from $ 3 to $ 12 during my life i hope to live long enough to see it double again   i think that it 's hyperinflation that 's an ongoing concern but the controlled inflation as i just described is not detrimental in fact it 's preferable in some sense for example when i look at my 5 mortgage it 's 3.6 after tax but with a 3 inflation rate my cost is really .6 as the remaining debt devalues over time and the house in theory goes up with inflation on the other extreme higher inflation say 8 starts to be detrimental distorting spending behavior and bad for the system

friend there is a difference between following the letter of the law vs the spirit of the law   because something is legal does n't make it the ethical choice   if i 'm walking behind someone and they happen to drop a $ 100 bill without noticing i can certainly pick it up and put it in my pocket legally but its hardly the moral thing to do     taken to the extreme if it was legal to buy and sell slaves i still would n't do it even if it provided a monetary benefit   or if i drove by a person dying and bleeding on the street it would be legal for me to drive home and do nothing i think not so sure as i write it   while i agree with you that tax laws are at fault its reprehensible to me that corporations making huge profits using the infrastructure of the region choose tax avoidance as opposed to doing what is not only right but better in the long run for all parties   keep in mind that these favorable tax laws were lobbied by corporations with the intent to avoid taxes in mind   i fully respect your perspective and you 're entitled to make choices based on whether they are legal or not but i choose to live life differently   best of luck

avoiding fees would not be the primary reason to buy bonds yourself no the reason to buy bonds yourself in a retirement account is that you can hold them to maturity bond funds can and do lose value if interest rates rise and gain it if interest rates fall of course the same happens with the bond that you hold but you can hang on to it until maturity and get the face value out of it   that said it would take some effort to put together a decent bond portfolio especially if you were going to buy anything rated lower than the absolute best i think it 'd be fun to do but i 'm weird that way

there is really much simpler explanation for the interest rate differences in different countries it is the interest rate arbitrage it is a very well explored economic concept so you can look it up on the internet in case you want to know more 1 interest rates for the same currency in different countries basically as one smart person here pointed out there is only one price of money in free market economy it happens because investors can move their money anywhere in the world to capitalize on the local interest rates advantage for instance if i can take a loan in the usa at 3 4 annual interest and receive 5 6 annual income on my dollar deposit in russia i would take a loan in the us and open a deposit in russia to enjoy a risk free interest rate differential income of 2 5 6 3 4 ~ 2 so would any reasonable person however in real world very few banks in russia or anywhere would pay you an an interest rate higher than it can borrow money at it 'd probably lose money if it 'd do so anyways the difference between the risk free rate and interest rate on the dollar deposit can be attributed to the risk premium of this particular bank the higher expected return the greater risk premium if there is a positive difference in the interest rates on the dollar deposits in different countries it will almost entirely accounted for the risk premium it is generally much riskier to keep money in say russian bank than american that 's why investors want greater return on their dollar deposits in russian banks than in american of course if you 'd want to park your usd in russian bank you 'd also have to consider transaction costs so as you may have already guessed there is no free lunch 2 interest rates in different currencies for different countries if we are talking about the interest rates in different sovereign currencies it is a somewhat similar concept only there is more risk if you keep money in local currency risk premium is much higher probably the biggest component of this risk is inflation that is only attributed to the prices in local currency for that reason current interest rates on deposits in russian rubles are at 10 12 but only 1 3 in the us dollars an economic concept that discusses this phenomenon in great detail is interest rate parity   hope this was helpful p.s. it does n't look quite realistic that you can get an 8 annual income for usd deposit in russia with the interest rates in the u.s. being at 1 2 at present moment a 30-year mortgage annual interest rate in the us is at ~2 3 and an annual interest rates for dollar deposits in one of the safest russian banks = very little risk premium is at 1 3 so arbitrage is impossible

your approach sounds solid to me   alternatively if as appears to be the case then you might want to consider your tax advantaged accounts to tax inefficient investments such as reits and high yield bond funds   that way your investments that generate non capital gain i.e. tax expensive income are safe from the irs until retirement or forever   and your investments that generate only capital gains income are safe until you sell them and then they 're tax cheap anyway of course since there are n't really that many tax expensive investment vehicles especially not for a young person you may still have room in your retirement accounts after allocating all the money you feel comfortable putting into reits and junk bonds   in that case the article i linked above ranks investment types by tax efficiency so you can figure out the next best thing to put into your ira then the next etc

in my mind its not the same    if growth is stock value then this is incorrect because of compound interest in stock price $ 100 stock price after one year would be $ 105 and a dividend would be $ 2 next year the stock would be   $ compound interest and would the dividend really go up in lock step with the stock price well probably not but if it did then maybe you could call it the same even if the dollars are the same the growth rate is more variable than the dividends so its valuable to segregate the two i am open to criticism my answer is based on my personal experience and would love to hear contrary positions on this

emergency fund first period the interest you pay on the heloc until you have the emergency savings fund is like buying insurance it 's an expense you incur until you can afford to bear the risk yourself here the risk is of a personal liquidity crisis when you have enough in your emergency fund to be comfortable start using whatever amount you were putting into savings to pay down the heloc alex b is right that paying off the heloc is a guaranteed return but your emergency fund is not an investment it 's your safety net

people 's value of money is not always linear   consider an individual with $ 1000 in the bank   i 'm going to look at amounts of debt by orders of magnitude now its pretty easy to see a order of magnitude increase in impact from $ 100 to $ 1000 and it becomes slightly worse for the $ 10,000 case due to debt   however one more order of magnitude going to $ 100,000 and suddenly it becomes hard to argue that there 's a mere order of magnitude more hurt than the $ 10,000 case   from the cases i 've read those sorts of situations can be far far worse than the monetary cost could convey insurance companies are in a good position to absorb $ 100,000 of debt if something happens far better position than the individual   they rely on the central limit theorem in general they do n't have to pay out all at once the insurance companies have their limits too   when hurricane came through the insurance companies had a tremendously difficult time dealing with so many claims all at once   just like the individuals they found a sudden change in how much value they had to put on their monetary debts

you should check the details of those balance transfers they typically have a 3 to 5 one time fee which means you pay nearly a year 's interest right away and then every time you transfer the total on again also this fee gets added to the credit card total and it is possibly considered paid last after you paid off the completed transferred balance so it cost interest for the whole time and that interest is different maybe 19.99 or worse it is probably a better idea to refinance for 5 years at < 3 and they pay off as fast as possible

the statement can be true but is n't a general rule crashes and recessions are two different things a crash is when the market rapidly something when prices are out of equilibrium whether it be stocks a commodity or even a service   when the internet was new nobody knew how to design webpages so web page designers were in huge demand and insane price premiums i literally had college classmates billing real companies $ for marginal web skills eventually the market up and that industry collapsed overnight another example of a crash from the supply point of view was the discovery of silver in the western us during the 19th century these discoveries increased the supply of the commodity to the point that silver coin eroded in value and devastated small family farms who mostly dealt in silver currency recessions are often linked to crashes but you do n't need a crash to have a recession basically during a recession trade and industrial activity drop the economy operates in cycles and the euphoria and over optimistic projections of a growing or booming economy lead to periods of reduced growth where the economy essentially itself capital is a if not the key element of the economic cycle it 's a catalyst that makes things happen debt is one form of capital it 's not good not bad generally cheap capital ie low interest rates bring economic growth why if i can borrow at 4 i can then perform some sort of economic activity bake bread make computers assemble cars etc that will earn myself 6 8 or 10 on the dollar when interest rates go up economic activity slows because the higher cost of credit increases the risk of losing money on an investment the downside of cheap capital is that risk taking gets too easy and you can run into situations like the $ 2 m ranch houses in california the downside of expensive tight capital is that it gets harder for businesses to operate and economic activity slows down the effects of either extreme cascade and snowball

in my experience working at a currency exchange money service business in the us flat fees are the because we can fee on average these can be waived on certain dollar values at some banks or and sometimes can even be   if you google eurusd as an example you also get something like $ 1.19 at 4 pm if you look at the actual conversion that you got you may find your bank hit you with $ 1.30 or something close to convert from usd to euro in other words you payed 10 more usd per euro and if you sell your euro directly back you might find you only make $ 1.07 this spread is the real fee and covers a number of things including risk or liquidity you 'll see that currencies with more volatility or less liquidity have a much wider spread some businesses even go as far as to artificially widen the spread for speculators see inr etc typically if you see a 3 surcharge on international atm or pos transactions that 's the carrier such as visa or mastercard taking their cut for processing interestingly enough you also typically get the carrier set exchange rate overseas when using your card in other words your bank has a cash eurusd of $ 1.30 but the conversion you get at the atm is visa 's rate hence the visa fee but it 's typically a nicer spread or it 's sometimes the international spot rate depending on the circumstances due to the overhead of electronic transactions you also have to consider the atm charging you a separate fee for it 's own operation in essence the fees exist to pad every player involved except you some cards do you a solid by advertising $ 0 foreign exchange fees unfortunately these cards only insulate you from the processing flat fees and you may still fall prey to the fee hidden in the spread in the scheme of things currency exchange is a retail operation they try to make money on every step that requires them to expend a resource if you pay 10 on a money transaction this differs actually very little from the mark up you pay on your groceries which varies from 3 5 on dry food to 20 on alcohol such as wine

leverage is when you borrow in order to invest mind you most people are n't going to just give you money to gamble on the stock market completely unsecured rather you deposit say $ 10,000 and buy a stock and then you have $ 10k in assets which you can borrow against so you can buy another $ 10,000 of that stock now if the stock goes up you 'll make twice the gain 2x leverage however if it goes down you 'll lose twice as much as well if the value of your stock falls your line of credit will be reduced as well in this case since you used all your credit and are now over your limit your broker will issue a margin call they will demand a deposit of additional funds or they will sell some of your stock at their discretion this protects you from owing more than you invested but it 's still sometimes possible for instance if a company goes bankrupt and becomes worthless and your stock becomes worthless there are also things like leveraged index funds and commodity funds which aim to return some multiple of the market 's earnings these are designed for intraday trading though and usually end up underperforming significantly over the long term edit people who accept borrowed funds should generally accept real cash as well however if you 're trying to short sell i.e. borrow shares and sell them in the hopes you can get them back cheaper later after the stock falls you will need a margin line of credit to do so as well edit 2 clarified margin calls

having been in exactly this position not in a debt hole built a budget to get a better view of what spending is i can say what the greatest gift it brings is it 's a decision tool when you are spending out of only one account you often make decisions based on the total money in the account should we go out for dinner can i make this impulse purchase this is terrible because many if not all of those dollars are already intended for certain future expenses like groceries bills etc you ca n't see how many of those dollars are discretionary a budget is like having many accounts instead of looking at your real account(s to make spending decisions you look at your budget lines you to want impulse buy a gadget do you have money remaining in a relevant budget line if yes the decision is yours if no the budget is telling you that you do n't have dollars for that similarly for more purchases you want to splurge on some non staple groceries to make a fancy dinner or try out a new recipe and the budget line for groceries will tell you if you can do that instead of looking at e.g. $ 6000 in a chequing account you 're looking at $ 600 assigned $ spend = $ available in a monthly groceries budget line just like you can now see where your money has been going by maintaining and using your budget lines and having every single dollar you spend go through the budget to show your totally assigned total spent and total remaining you can continue to see where your money is going in near real time you 're no longer looking at bills and statements to figure out what 's going on and plan you 're looking at money flows and future intentions as you should be this approach to budgeting has completely changed our finances so that 's what a budget is for real time spending decision making control over your money which for us has translated into a lovely mix of painless austerity in spending categories where austerity is smart and guilt free spending in more categories because we have already determined exactly how much we can afford and wish to spend a budget line with insufficient funds does n't actually take the decision entirely away from you though if a budget line does n't have funds to spare for a given purchase you can still make the purchase but now you 're also making the decision to go and revise your budget taking dollars away from other budget lines to adjust the line you 've overspent to keep the budget accurate

a bullish or long call spread is actually two separate option trades   the a b notation is respectively the strike price of each trade the first leg of the strategy corresponding to b is the sale of a call option at a strike price of b in this case $ 165   the proceeds from this sale after transaction costs are generally used to offset the cost of the second leg the second leg of the strategy corresponding to a is the purchase of a call option at a strike price of a in this case $ 145 now the important part the payoff   you can visualize it as so this is where it gets a teeny bit math y   below p is the profit of the strategy k1 is the strike price of the long call is the strike price of the short call t1 is the premium paid for the long call option at the time of purchase t2 is the premium received for the short call at the time of sale and s is the current price of the stock   for simplicity 's sake we will assume that your position quantity is a single option contract and transaction costs are zero which they are not p = t2 s + s k1 t1 concretely let 's plug in the strikes of the strategy nathan proposes and current prices which i pulled from the screen   you have p = 165 145 = if the stock goes to $ 150 the payoff is which is n't quite break even but it may have been at the time he was speaking on tv if the stock goes to $ 165 the payoff is $ please do not neglect the cost of the trades   trading options can be pretty expensive depending on the broker   had i done this trade quantity 1 at many popular brokers i still would've been net negative pnl even if nflx went to > = $ 165

credit card fees on a credit card used for personal expenses are not tax deductible credit card fees on a business credit card are deductible on schedule c or whatever form you 're using to report business income and expenses if you are using the same card for both business and personal well for starters this is a very bad idea because it creates exactly the question you 're asking if that 's what you 're doing stop and get separate business and personal cards if you have separate business and personal cards and use the business card only for legitimate business expenses then the answer is easy you can claim a schedule c deduction for any service charges on the business card and you can not claim any deduction for any charges on the personal card in general though if you have an expense that is partly business and partly personal you are supposed to figure out what percentage is business and that is deductible in an admittedly brief search i could n't find anything specifically about credit cards but i did find this similar idea on the irs web site generally you can not deduct personal living or family expenses however if you have an expense for something that is used partly for business and partly for personal purposes divide the total cost between the business and personal parts you can deduct the business part for example if you borrow money and use 70 of it for business and the other 30 for a family vacation you can deduct 70 of the interest as a business expense the remaining 30 is personal interest and is not deductible refer to chapter 4 of publication 535 business expenses for information on deducting interest and the allocation rules so probably you could add up all the charges you made on the card figure out how much was for business and how much for personal calculate the business percentage and then deduct this percentage of the service fees if the amount involved is not trivial you might want to talk to an accountant or a lawyer

i do n't think this should be very surprising if you make more than someone over a long period of time the gap between your total income or wealth is going to increase say a person makes $ while another makes $ day 1 $ 100 v $ 50 day 2 $ 200 v. $ 100 day 3 $ 300 v. $ 50 and so on and so forth now make those numbers $ 1500 v. $ 100 and you can see why the wealth difference is so wide they may have to choose between lowering the person making more or increase the pay of the person making less

point being the problem has n't been fixed the deficit went from enormous in 2009 to simply large today   it 's never going to be paid back   the main issue to consider is that today the united states is the third largest oil producer in the world and the largest natural gas producer thanks to hydraulic fracturing most of this surge happened during the obama administration spurred on by relatively high energy prices   without the fracking boom the us economy would still be considered in a commentary oil and gas boom gdp   the $ 300-$400 billion yearly increase in output from oil and gas production economy growth would still be negative manhattan institute senior fellow mark mills shows the extent these industries have contributed to u.s. growth in his new report where the jobs are small businesses unleash energy employment boom   the us manufacturing sector also benefits from this indirectly as low energy costs thanks to suddenly abundant natural gas keeps domestic production affordable without the fracking boom the us economy would be in a european type situation in fact european companies move their manufacturing capacity to the us citing low american gas natural gas boom attracting manufacturing us overseas take advantage cheaper   the problem with all of this is that we know that fracking is not sustainable it depends on very high oil prices which consumers simply ca n't afford to continue paying without oil prices rising the industry is forced to enter further and further into debt part of the reason oil prices are so high in the first place right now is because of speculative traders who expect oil prices to rise higher in the future which is unlikely to happen   when obama claimed that there is 100 years worth of natural gas in the us he was wrong if he really believes that story himself it 's going to lead him to take bad decisions by basing an economy on hypothetical cheap energy that wo n't be there in the future the gdp contribution by the fracking industry is going to evaporate at which point you 're left with a massive debt you ca n't pay back

the economic effect of a cfd from your point of view is very close to the effect of owning the stock if the stock goes up you make money if it goes down you lose money if it pays a dividend you get that dividend you 'll typically pay commission for buying and selling the cfds in a similar way to the commission on stock purchases though one of the advertised advantages of cfds is that the commission will be lower they also often have tax advantages for example in the uk you do n't have to pay stamp duty on cfds in theory you are exposed to credit risk on the cfd issuer which you are n't with the real stocks if the issuer goes bankrupt you may lose any money you have invested regardless of how well the stock has performed it 's certainly similar to a bet but not much more so than investing directly in the stock in practice the issuer of the cfds is likely to hedge its own exposure by actually buying the underlying stocks directly but they can aggregate across lots of contracts and they would tolerate some unhedged exposure to the stock so they can cut down on the transaction fees you also wo n't get the same voting rights as the underlying stock would grant you

similar to what adam f says above except instead of just transfering the amount you spend on the credit card into the high interest account why not keep the majority of your funds apart from a small amount say a couple of hundred for emergencies in the high interest account until the credit card needs to be paid off even better if you have a mortgage with an 100 offset account keep all your funds in this and pay off your credit card in full from it on or before the due date being a 100 offset to your mortgage interest rate you will be saving at a higher rate than a high interest rate savings account and you will be able to do all your normal banking from it unlike a high interest account which you usually have to link to an additional account to deposit and withdrawl money to and from if you are to use a credit card keep these simple rules in mind hope this has helped regards victor

for starters the risk free rate has nothing to do with stocks   it would be independent of anything   it pays out the same return in all states of nature   the definition of a risk free asset is that regardless of how the universe turns out including a striking the earth killing everyone but the recipient then the payout would happen exactly as planned   one could imagine a computer still being on connected to a power supply and printing a check   most people use the 90-day t bill as the risk free rate   a beta greater than one implies it is more volatile than the market not that it moves more perfectly the capm should not be used for this   cryptocurrencies should not be used with this model because they have valuation dynamics related to the new issue of coins   in other words they have non market price movements as well as market price movements in general you should not use the capm because it does n't work empirically   it is famous but it is also wrong   a scientific hypothesis that is not supported by the data is a bad idea   my strong recommendation is that you read the intelligent investor by benjamin graham   it was last published in 1972 and it is still being printed   i believe warren buffett wrote the current forward for it   always go where the data supports you and never anywhere else no matter how elegant finally unless you are doing this like a trip to vegas for fun and willing to take the losses i would avoid cryptocurrencies because you do n't know what you are doing yet   it is obvious from the posting   i have multiple decades working in every type of financial institution and at every level bottom to top   i also have a and i am an incredible researcher   i am professionally qualified in three different disciplines if you want to learn how to do this start with the intelligent investor   get a basic book on accounting and learn basic accounting   pick up economics textbooks at least through intermediate for both microeconomics and macroeconomics   get william 's book introduction to bayesian statistics   you will need them for reasons that go very far beyond this post   trust me you want to master that book   find a statistician and ask them to teach it to you as a special topics course   it will help you as both either a marine officer or a naval officer   then after that pick up a copy of security analysis   either the 1943 copy yes it is in print by benjamin graham if you feel good about accounting or the 1987 copy by under the graham dodd   then if you are still interested in cryptocurrencies and they will be by then then pick up an economics textbook on money   if i were you i would learn about money commodity money and prison money first then you might understand why a cryptocurrency may not be an investment for you

the banks see small apartments as a higher risk because usually very small apartments are harder to sell especially during a falling market when there is an oversupply of these apartments the price of small apartments will also fall a lot quicker in a falling market regarding yield vs capital growth the emphasis here is on high yielding properties in small country towns with small populations how many properties can you buy with cash properties with good growth will enable you to build equity quicker and enable you to build a larger portfolio in my opinion you need a combination of good yield and reasonable growth because without yield you can not replace your earned income with passive income but without growth you ca n't expand your portfolio so a combination of good yield with reasonable growth will give the best outcome

if you are calculating simple roi the answer is straightforward math   see this answer for some examples but yes with more leverage you will always see better roi on a property if you can maintain a positive cash flow   the most complete answer is to factor in your total risk that high roi of a leveraged property is far more volatile and sensitive to any unexpected expenses additionally a loss of equity in the property or an upside down mortgage will further impact your long term position to put this more simply as noted in the comments below your losses will be amplified you can not say a leveraged property will always give you a better roi because you can not predict your losses

your relatively young age and the current very low bond interest rates make annuities a very poor buy and most of the other suggestions you have mentioned have very low diversification which exposes you to imprudent risks buying shares for dividend income can solve the diversification problem by averaging out your totals as different shares change by different amounts there is no really good solution to the problem of share price volatility except to ignore it take your dividends and pretty much ignore the bouncing around of the share price they usually recover in a year or three owning shares of companies that reliably increase their dividend payouts is the only investment type that gives you both diversification and regularly increasing income to counteract inflation over the years read some investment books and consider consulting with a financial advisor who charges a fee for the advice i.e. you do n't want free advice

if you can afford it there are very few reasons not to save for retirement the biggest reason i can think of is that simply you are saving in general the tax advantages of 401k and ira accounts help increase your wealth but the most important thing is to start saving at an early age in your career as you are doing and making sure to continue contributing throughout your life compound interest serves you well if you are really concerned that saving for retirement in your situation would equate to putting money away for no good reason you can do a couple of things save in a roth ira account which does not require minimum distributions when you get past a certain age additionally your contributions only that is not your interest earnings to a roth can be withdrawn tax and penalty free at any time while you are under the age of 59.5 and once you are older than that you can take distributions as however you need save by investing in a balanced portfolio of stocks and bonds you wo n't get the tax advantages of a retirement account but you will still benefit from the time value of money the bonus here is that you can withdraw your money whenever you want without penalty both ira accounts and mutual fund brokerage accounts will give you a choice of many securities that you can invest in in comparison 401k plans below often have limited choices for you most people choose to use their company 's 401k plan for retirement savings in general you do not want to be in a position where you have to borrow from your 401k as such it 's not a great option for savings that you think you 'd need before you retire additionally 401k plans have minimum distributions so you will have to periodically take some money from the account when you are in retirement the biggest advantage of 401k plans is that often employers will match contributions to a certain extent which is basically free money for you in the end these are just some suggestions probably best to consult with a financial planner to hammer out all the details

huge news in the grocery delivery space   groceries are one of the few large markets that require some proximity to customers due to costs and spoilage each grocery store is a type of mini distribution center for grocery products   and instacart have succeeded to date because they use existing distribution channels and set up marketplaces for the last mile of delivery this is in contrast to webvan in the early 2000 's who tried to do grocery delivery by building their own distribution and failed spectacularly   amazon has become an expert in distribution and logistics but it is clear that using their current model does n't generally work with groceries rip webvan 1998 2001 bananas need to be treated much differently than books   so what does amazon do but whole foods a moderate sized grocery store with a significant national footprint and lots of higher income customers   now they instantly have a pre built distribution channel that is already optimized for the grocery business which again is much different than non perishable consumer goods etc   things definitely just got interesting in this space i still believe that instacart and can succeed but they need to maintain a laser focus on making their shoppers and customers happy and grow as fast as possible while amazon whole foods

a lot of people do this for example in my area nice townhouses go for about $ 400 k so if you have $ 80,000 you can buy one and rent it here are the typical numbers so you would make $ 350 per month or $ per year on $ 80,000 in capital or about 5 profit what can go wrong 1 the property does not rent and sits vacant you must come up with $ 2100 in mortgage payments taxes and insurance every month without fail or default 2 unexpected expenses a new furnaces costs over $ 5,000 a new roof costs $ 7,000 a new appliance costs $ 600 to $ 2000 depending on how upscale your property is i just had a toilet fixed for a leaky it cost me $ 200 as you can see maintenance expenses can quickly get a lot higher than the $ 50 shown above and not only that if you fix things as cheaply as possible as most landlords do not only does that decrease the of the property but it causes stuff to break sooner 3 deadbeats some people will rent your property and then not pay you now you have a property with no income you are spending $ 2100 per month to pay for it and you are facing steep attorney fees to get the deadbeats evicted they can fight you in court for months 4 damage wear and tear whenever a tenant turns over there is always a lot of broken or worn stuff that has to be fixed holes in the wall need to be busted locks broken windows non working toilets stains on the carpet stuck doors ripped screens leaky showers broken tiles painting exterior trim painting walls painting fences etc you can spend thousands every time a tenant changes other caveats banks are much more strict about loaning to non home owners you usually have to have reserve income so if you have little or no income or you are stretched already it will be difficult to get commercial loans for example lets say your take home pay is $ 7,000 and you have no mortgage at all you rent then it is fine the bank will loan you the money but lets say you only have $ 5,000 in take home pay and you have an $ 1,800 mortgage on your own home in that case it is very unlikely a bank will allow you to assume a 2nd mortgage on a rental property the more you try to borrow the more reserve income the bank will require this tends to set a limit on how much you can leverage

another way to look at this is if we separate the owner 's account from the business 's account   at the start of the year the owner puts $ 9 into the business account to get the business started at the end of the first day the business account has $ 10 and at the end of the second day the business account has $ 11   the owner does n't need to add any more of his own money into the business account at the end of the day the business will have $ which is $ 365 profit + $ 9 investment   assuming the business has no other expenses the business will calculate profit for the year like this the author is making a strange point the two numbers he is talking about are two different quantities the business owner 's return on investment is $ 365 $ 9 =   but the business 's profit margin is $ 365 $ = 10   both are useful numbers when running the business i disagree with the author 's that a business is doing something tricky when calculating profit margin remember that in addition to the business owner 's monetary investment he worked every day for a year to earn that $ 365

the short answer is no there a 2 ways to get cash from a life insurance policy   if the policy has cash value greater than the surrender value then the difference can be borrowed but will generally increase premiums in the future    the other method available on many term policies allows the owner to receive part of the death benefit if the insured has a physician willing to certify that he she will probably pass away within a 12 month period   several carriers also offer cash benefits for critical care

i think that history shows that it 's rarely necessary for violence to lead to social reform there 's always been a of war between the upper class and the middle lower classes the term working class was a way to unify middle and lower classes against the wealthy idle class unfortunately the wealthy were able to convince many white collar middle class people that they were upper middle class and that the upper middle class shares values and goals with the elite if you look at the numbers this could n't be more wrong   by any standard i am a very fortunate person i have a six figure income and some assets however the truly elite in the us enjoy household wealth and income that dwarf what i make i pay a much higher percentage of my income to taxes than a person with inherited wealth does why is the system this way it 's effectively a barrier no matter how hard we work or how well we do we ca n't break through to the upper class instead of a meritocracy we have an aristocracy this is the great lie at the center of american politics today   the have the many of the best and brightest convinced that we 're part of the club when we 're really not and never can be they 've turned us against the blue collar workers and the poor when we should all be together they 've convinced many that people like the current administration trying to create more upward mobility are anti american when it 's really the aristocracy that violates democratic values of equality and   however we can vote for leaders who might do better we can peacefully assemble think ows we can go on reddit and share our political and economic opinions because of these freedoms we can safely say violence is a remote last resort   nothing is inevitable economic growth is really just people finding ways to interact and deliver value to one another and fortune favors the bold i 'll stay optimistic and keep making money as well as trying to help my community i 'll bet dollars to donuts change can and will happen   just because enough people will get sick of the of the world all the wealth and we 'll find a political solution   tl;dr martin king we 'll work it out like with our words

situation 1 i keep playing and eventually earn 1000 i withdraw    this will i get taxed if so by how much this is probably considered an award so whatever your country taxes for lottery gambling winnings would be applicable if there 's no specific taxation on this kinds of income then it is ordinary income situation 2 i deposit $ 5000 play the game lose some money and    withdraw equal to $ 4000 will i get taxed if so by how much since it is a game it is unlikely that deducting losses from your income would be allowed   however the $ 4000 would probably not be taxed as income since you are getting your own money back situation 3 i deposit $ 5000 and use this to buy in game items i    later sell these items for massive profits this can happen    over the course of 2 years for sure i withdraw $ 10000 will i get    taxed if so by how much either the same as 1 i.e. ordinary income or as capital gains although tax authority may argue that this was not a for profit investment and capital gains treatment should n't be applicable will i get taxed on withdrawals from real cash economy games and do    the taxes apply to the full withdrawal or only on the profits or    only on the profits above a certain amount generally income taxes only apply on income so if you paid $ 10000 and got back $ 12000 only the $ 2000 is considered income however some countries may tax full amounts under certain conditions such taxes are called franchise taxes for a proper tax advice consult with the locally licensed tax adviser

graphs are nothing but a representation of data every time a trade is made a point is plotted on the graph after points are plotted they are joined in order to represent the data in a graphical format   think about it this way   1 walmart shuts at 12 am is selling almonds at $ 10 a pound   3 walmart says that the price is going to reduce to $ 9 effective tomorrow 4 you are inside the store buying almonds at pm   5 till you make your way up to the counter it is already am so the store is technically shut 6 however they allow you to purchase the almonds since you were already in there   7 you purchase the almonds at $ 9 since the day has changed 8 so you have made a trade and it will reflect as a point on the graph 9 when those points are joined the curves on the graph will be created 10 the data source is walmart 's system as it reflects the sale to you in your case the nyse exchange records this trade made buying a stock is just like buying almonds there has to be a buyer there has to be a seller there has to be a price to which both agree as soon as all these conditions are met and the trade is made it is reflected on the graph the only difference between the graphs from 9 pm and 4 am is the time the trade has happened regardless and any other stock exchange has recorded it the graph is just made from that data cheers

here are three key factors that you do not explicitly state so while i can not say exactly why the tax law is the way it is i can infer that it encourages long term investments rather than short term which would seem to be a good thing for society overall   the fast that capital gains are taxed at all somewhat discourages cashing out investments although i suspect it 's more of a nuisance factor the cash received is likely more on an incentive that the tax is a disincentive

less demand for absurdly priced homes which means prices will drop to affordable levels   rent and home prices are obviously variable but in my area home prices are pretty aligned with rents   assuming both home prices and rent goes up with inflation and accounting for insurance taxes tax advantages maintenance and a list of other issues the prices are comparable   if you have the capital for a down payment and plan to stay in one house or for 5 years you are probably better off buying   to say home prices are absurd you need to be comparing it to what you consider it 's true worth but how are you determining that   edit perhaps both rent and home prices will go down as more people live with their parents and room mates but i have n't seen that trend start yet and vacancy rates are n't that high as far as i know so i do n't see it starting soon   if that trend did start i imagine new construction would be the first ones to go but housing developments are going strong around me

government subsidies could be provided if we could all agree what activities are of higher social worth this is not an insurmountable obstacle   for example in hong kong and singapore civil servants are paid vastly more than in the us the reasons are that society wants to attract some of its best people to serve in these positions and they want to insulate them from the temptation of corruption in effect these positions are considered to be of high social worth and society rewards them accordingly    also note that hk and singapore have even freer capitalist market societies than the us speaking of economic freedom here

imagine that a company never distributes any of its profits to its shareholders the company might invest these profits in the business to grow future profits or it might just keep the money in the bank either way the company is growing in value but how does that help you as a small investor if the share price never went up then the market value would become tiny compared to the actual value of the company at some point another company would see this and put a bid in for the whole company the shareholders would n't sell their shares if the bid did n't reflect the true value of the company this would mean that your shares would suddenly become much more valuable so the reason why the share price goes up over time is to represent the perceived value of the company as this could be realised either by the distribution of dividends or a return of capital to shareholders or by a bidder buying the whole company the shares are actually worth something to someone in the market so the share price will tend to track the value of the company even if dividends are never paid in the short term a share price reflects sentiment but over the long term it will tend to track the value of the company as measured by its profitability

assuming the question is will they close it for inactivity alone the answer is nope unequivocally update < my answer is geared to credit cards issues by companies that deal in credit not merchandise i.e. store cards retailer cards etc   retailers like amazon etc want to sell goods and are in the credit card business to generate sales   banks and credit companies about whom i am referring make their money primarily on interest and secondarily on service charges either point of use charged to the vendor that accepts payment or fees charged to the user > the only major issuer i will say that it might be possible is discover because i never kept a discover card   i also do n't keep department store cards which might possibly do this but i do doubt it in either of those cases too my answer is based on having 2 amex cards and blue and multiple other visa mc 's that i never use and most of these i have not for over 10 + years since i am also presuming that you are also not talking about an account that charges a yearly or other maintenance fee   why would they keep the account open with the overhead statements and other mailings etc because you might use it   you might not be able to pay it off each month   because you might end up paying thousands in interest over many years   the pennies they pay for maintaining your account and sending you new cards with chip technology etc are all worth the gamble of getting recouped from you   this is why sales people waste their time with lots of people who will not buy their product even though it costs them time and money to prospect because they might buy naturally there are a multitude of reasons for canceling a card but inactivity is not one   i have no less than 10 + inactive cards one that has a balance and two i use infrequently   i really would not mind if they closed all those accounts but they wo n't so enjoy your amex knowing that your visa will be there when you need want it the bank that issues your visa is banking on it presuming you do n't foul up financially cheers

this is how i 've understood this concept fibonacci nos levels is based on concept of sequential increment you may find lot of info about fibonacci on net in stock market this concept is used to predict psychological level while a trend is form usually price tend to accumulate consolidate at these level how the ratio make impact is   check any long trend now draw a retracement from immediate previous high and connect it 's low you will see new levels of intermediate trend in broader term you will find after reversal a leg trend is formed then body and then head which is smaller then price reverses the first leg that forms if it refuses to break or 38.2 then the previous trend may continue 50 is normal usually this level is indecision phase even is seen as indecision but it is crucial level as it is breakout level towards 100 now if the stock 100 then it is sign a new big trend is forming now for day trader and 50 level are very crucial from trading purpose this concept is so realistic that every level is considered and respected suppose if a candle or bar starts at level and crosses 38.2 and directly hits 50 then the next bar or candle will revert and first hit 38.2 and then continue with the trend it means price comes back forms it area at this level and then continue whichever direction the force it you never trade alone you need help of or other tools to confirm it

as i recall from the documentation presented to me any gain over the strike price from an iso stock option counts as a long term capital gain for tax purposes if it 's held from 2 years from the date of grant and 1 year from the date of exercise if you 're planning to take advantage of that tax treatment exercising your options now will start that 1-year clock now as well and grant you a little more flexibility with regards to when you can sell in the future of course no one 's renewed the bush tax cuts yet so the long term capital gains rate is going up and eventually it seems they 'll want to charge you medicare on those gains as well because they can soo the benefit of this tax treatment is being reduced lovely time to be investing

your gut feeling is absolutely spot on you should n't be worrying about pension now not at the age of 25 assuming that you 're not a in the middle of the most productive part of your career and already have a fat wad of crunchy banknotes under your pillow that you 're looking to set aside for a rainy day when you wo n't be able to play at your prime any longer that does n't mean you should n't invest nor that means that you must n't save there are several factors at play here   first of all as a young person you are likely to have a high tolerance for risk there is still plenty of time to recover should expected returns not even a pension fund with the most aggressive risk return strategy might just not quite do it for you you could invest into education instead improve health obtain a profitable skill create social capital by building connections pay for experience buy a house start a family or even a business next as a young professional you 're unlikely to have reached your full earning potential yet and due to the law of diminishing marginal utility a hundred pounds per month now have greater utility i.e. positive impact on your lifestyle than a seven hundred pounds will in 7 10 years time once your earnings that is to say it 's easier to save £ 700 month from £ 3000 and maintain a reasonable level of personal comfort than carve £ 100 from £ 1300 monthly income and last but not the least lets face it from a human point of view forty years is a very long investment horizon and many things might and will change one of the downsides of uk pensions is that you have very little control over the money until you reach a certain age i suggest saving up to build a cushion consisting of cash or near cash assets the size of the stash should be such that it is enough to cover all of your expenses from a minimum of 2 months to a maximum of a year the exact size will depend on your personal comfort level whatever social net you have parents wife partner and how hard it will be to find a new source of income should the current cease to produce cash on a strategic level you can start looking into investing any surplus cash into the foundation of what will bring joy and happiness into the next 40 years of your life your or your partners training and education is one of the most sensible choices whilst you 're young starting a family is another one both might help you reach you full earning potential much quicker finding what you love to do and learning how to do it really well cash can accelerate this process bringing you quicker there you want to be if you were a start up business in front of a huge market would you rather use cash to pay dividends or finance growth

if you read all that paperwork they made you fill out at the emergency room there is probably something in there explicitly stating that you owe any bills you rack up regardless of what happens with the insurance company they generally have a disclaimer that filing for you with your insurance company is a courtesy service they offer but they are not obliged to do it   ultimately you are responsible for your bills even if the provider slow billed you   sorry

my wife and i have done a good job teaching our daughter now 15 that one does the right thing simply because it 's the right thing to do this may not work for every child but it did for us her motivation was never punishment we explained that if she did the wrong thing it 's awful to have to live with that   on one hand 's answer is correct the stick the irs is the audit and fines i suppose from a legal standpoint we comply with laws to avoid punishment i find this to be unfortunate to get back on topic i started with an answer more appropriate to parenting because i have a very child for whom i addressed this question a decade ago the latter portion of my response helps to give tangible benefits which have value even if less than the tax you might be paying

hypothetical question w/ no actual ability to implement so pick a hypothetical answer    i 'm guessing you feel they 're milking tragedy for ratings    assuming a non cynical perspective for a moment psychology 101 talking through stressful thoughts helps reduce stress    it 's not a new phenomenon since radio of the 30 's talk show hosts have historically played the voice of the public who talked through stressful times amp even helped people come to terms with major such as war or other disasters   talk shows have always a sense of community yes it 's somewhat contrived but in truth certain shows have certain defined viewpoints that speak to aligned social groups   people feel better even if nothing tangible has changed and that can be a good thing

a $ 500 k mortgage at 4.5 is $ right near the $ 2500 in your example interest the first year would be less than $ 22 k and your tax benefit taking littleadv 's answer into account of course would be $ 5500 max   the tax benefit is the least of the reasons to get a mortgage on your hypothetical $ 100 k income and too high mortgage a $ 5500 benefit is nothing if one needs this tax benefit to make the numbers work they are budgeted too tightly   if you are considering trading a $ 1000 rent for a $ 500 k mortgage with a $ 2500 payment i 'd look very carefully at the numbers search this board for the associated expenses of homeownership

some loans have a variable interest rate which can protect the lender from inflation and the borrower from deflation how much protection it offers depends on how closely the interest rate follows the inflation deflation rate most variable rate loans have limits on how much and how frequently they can adjust in your deflation scenario the lender comes out ahead with a fixed rate loan already since those future dollars are worth more than current dollars   the borrower does n't owe more dollars but the value of the dollars they owe is higher

what is the best way that i can invest money so that i can always get    returns if you want something that does n't require any work on your end consider having a fee only financial planner make a plan so that your investments can be automated to generate a cash flow for you or get an annuity as the other classic choices here as most other choices will require some time commitment in one form or other note that for stock investments there could be rare instances like what happened for a week in september in 2001 where the markets were closed for 5 days straight that can be the hiccup in having stocks bonds can carry a risk of default where there have been municipalities that defaulted on debt as well as federal governments like russia in the 1990s real estate may be subject to natural disasters or other market forces that may prevent there always being a monthly payment coming as if you own a rental property then what happens if there are n't tenants because there was an evacuation of the area there may be some insurance products to cover some of these cases though what if there are exceptionally high claims all at once that may have an insurance company go under would it be to set up an fd in a bank to buy land to buy a rental    house to buy a field or maybe to purchase gold   what investment of your own time do you plan on making here both in terms of understanding what your long term strategy is and then the maintenance of the plan if you put the money in the bank are you expecting that the interest rate will always be high enough to give you sufficient cash to live as well as having no financial crisis with the bank or currency you are using are there any better investments you may want to reconsider what assumptions you want to make and what risks you want to accept as there is n't likely to be a single solution here that would be perfect

you are asking about a common simple practice of holding the mortgage when selling a house you own outright typically called seller financing   say i am 70 and wish to downsize the money i sell my house for will likely be in the bank at today 's awful rates now a buyer likes my house and has 20 down but due to some medical bills for his deceased wife he and his new wife are struggling to get financing i offer to let them pay me as if i were the bank we agree on the rate i have a lien on the house just as a bank would and my mortgage with them requires the usual fire theft insurance when i die my heirs will get the income or the buyer can pay in full after i 'm gone   in response to comment how do you do that what 's the paperwork fellow member @littleadv has often posted you need to hire a professional not because the top members here ca n't offer great accurate advice but because a small mistake on the part of the diy attempt can be far more costly than the relative cost of a pro in real estate where i am an agent you can skip the agent to hook up buyer seller but always use the pro for legal work in this case a real estate attorney i 'd personally avoid the general family lawyer going with the specialist here

there are a few questions that need qualification and a bit on the understanding of what is being purchased there are two axioms that require re death and taxes now the first is eventually inevitable as most people will eventually die it depends what is happening now that determines what will happen tomorrow and the concept of certainty the second is a pay as you go plan if you are contemplating what will tomorrow you have to look at what types of insurance are available and why they were invented in the first place the high seas can be a rough travelling ground and not every shipment of goods and passengers arrived on time and one piece this was the origin of insurance when speculators would gamble on the safe arrival of a ship laden with goods at the destination and for this they received a cut on the value of the goods shipped thus the concept of underwriting and the value associated with the cargo and the method of transport based on an example of good repair and a well seasoned captain and crew a lower rate of insurance was deemed needed prior to shipment than some other rating agency or underwriter now i bring this up because it depends on the underwriter that you choose as to the payout and the associated guarantee of funds that you will receive if you happen to need to collect on the insurance contract in the case of death benefit insurance you will never see the benefit at the end however while the policy is in force the term it is an asset that would be considered in any estate planning exercise first you have to consider your occupation and the incidence of death due to occupational hazards generally this is considered in your employment negotiations and is either reflected in the salary or if it is a state sponsored employer funded it is determined by your occupational risk and assessed to the employer and forms part of the cost of doing business in that this component or occupational insurance is covered by that program the problem is disability and what is deemed the same by the experience of the particular underwriter in your location for death benefits where there is an accident for motor vehicle accidents and 50,000 people in the us die annually these are covered by motor vehicle policy contracts and vary from state to state check the registrar of state insurance co 's for your state to see who are the market leaders and the claim ratios compared to insurance in force   depending on the particular there may be significant differences and different results in premium depending on your employer warren buffet did not invest in geico because of his to those who purchase insurance policies with geico the original poster mentions some such as age smoking and other risk factors but does not mention the soft factors that are not mentioned   they are risk factors such as incidence of murder in the region you live the zip code you live at and the that you enjoy when you are not in your occupation from the time you get up in the morning till the time you fall asleep and then some you are at risk not from a event standpoint but from a risk standpoint this is the reason that all of the insurance contracts stipulate exclusions and limits on when they will pay out this is what is meant by the soft risk factors and need to be if you are in an occupation that has a limited exposure to getting killed on the job then you will be paying a lower premium than someone who has a high risk occupation   it used to be that iron workers had a high incidence of injury and death but over the last 50 years this has changed the us bureau of labor statistics lists these 10 jobs as the highest for death per 100,000 workers the scales tilt the other way for these occupations in canada the cheapest rate for occupational insurance is lawyer and politician so for the rest in sales management etc the national average is 3 to 3.5 depending on the region of deaths per 100,000 employed in that occupation so for a 30 year old bank worker the premium is more like a forced savings plan in the sense that you are paying towards something in the future the risk of payout in less than 6 months is slim for a logging worker or the risk is very high that they might not return from that for fish and seafood if you partake in extreme sports or similar risk factors then consider getting whole life where the premium is spread out over your working lifetime and once you hit retirement 55 or 65 then the occupational risk is less and the plan will payout at the age of 65 if you make it that far and you get a partial benefit if you have a pension plan then that also needs to be factored in and be part of a thinking on where you want to be 5 years from today

there is only a catch if you swallow the hook   the hook is that the bank hopes you will use the increased credit limit to buy more stuff and not pay what you owe before the interest free period expires   this will allow them to charge their high interest rate on the outstanding balance   now if you do n't increase your spending and keep paying your balance in full nothing happens

generally if you need to tap into your retirement for the house you probably should n't buy the house but that 's your call there are several things you could do sue your cpa friend for malpractice especially if there 's any actual proof of that stupid suggestion check with your 401k administrator about home purchase loan from the 401k you 'll be borrowing your own money and repaying yourself back with interest but it will be tax free and with no penalties keep in mind if you can not repay the loan or you leave your employer without repaying it in full the remaining balance will be considered withdrawal and you 'll pay income taxes + 10 penalty on it if you have an ira you can withdraw up to 10 k without penalty if this is your first house i.e. you did n't own a house in the last 3 years and is going to be your primary residence you 'll still pay taxes on the 10k. but this is not available for 401k plans you can request equal payments distribution calculated based on your life expectancy this is the infamous distribution even though many of the exceptions are in the irc this in particular is here 's the full list of exceptions note that even if you 're willing to pay the 10 penalty many 401k plans do not allow distributions as long as you 're still employed with the sponsoring employer if you take a hardship distribution from your 401k if it even allows it you 'll be prohibited from contributing for 6 months and your employer will be prohibited from contributing on your behalf as well i.e. not only you take out your savings you 'll be barred from saving back also in the same faq it tells you that the hardship distribution can only include the amounts up to the original contributions less whatever distributions already made and not earnings or match i.e. it may actually be much less than the 40 k you 're counting on

split transactions are to anybody interested in accurately tracking their spending if i go to the big box pharmacy down the road to pick up a prescription and then also grab a loaf of bread and a of milk while there then i 'd want to enter the transaction into my software as i desire entering precise data into the software so that i can rely on the reports it produces often i do n't need an exact amount and estimated category totals would have been fine e.g. to inform budgeting or compare to a prior period however in other cases the expenses i 'm tracking must be tracked accurately because i 'd be using the total to claim an income tax deduction or credit   consider how internet access might be commingled on the same bill with the home 's cable tv service   one is a reasonable business expense and deduction for the work at home web developer whereas the other is a personal non deductible expense were split transaction capability not available the somewhat unattractive alternatives are ignore the category difference and say categorize the entire transaction as the larger or more important category   but this deliberately introduces error in the tracked data rendering it useless for cases where the category totals need to be accurate or split the transaction manually this does n't introduce error into the tracked data but suffers another problem it makes a lot of work first one would need to manually enter two or more top level transactions instead of the single one with sub amounts   perhaps not that much more work than if a split were entered worse is when it comes time to reconcile   now there are two or more transactions in the register but the credit card statement has only one   reconciling would require manually adding up those transactions from the register just to confirm the amount on the statement is correct   major pain i 'd place split transaction capability near the top of the list of must have features for any finance management software

broadly there 's a bunch of stuff you need to be accounting for that 's not reflected in the above which will impact the a d profile of an acquisition   consideration paid all cash on substantially the same terms is going to be more accretive than an all stock transaction because in the latter your denominator is much bigger   shares outstanding including repurchases in kind dividends and option exercise   financing interest expense   upside base downside case for all of your assumptions best to have a based on a choose function that will allow the user to easily between these   i 'm not sure what ebitda is getting you eps accretion dilution typically looks at earnings but you could also look at cash eps a d which measures shares outstanding   the point is this really depends on how back of the envelope you want the a d computation to be at a minimum you need an earnings schedule projected over the next 2 3 years and you need a schedule reflecting outstanding shares over the same time period   your earnings can have varying degrees of granularity you can project cost synergies over the forecast period which most obviously is going to affect your earnings but you can also drill down further financing transaction fees etc your and from your b s combination may result in certain deferred tax items that will affect your bottom line over the forecast period   your share schedule can also have varying degrees of complexity one way to do it is to just presume that the company will not issue any more shares and will not repurchase any shares and that there will be no options exercised over the forecast period this is a bad series of assumptions it is likely that as options vest if in the money they will be exercised resulting in dilution for existing shareholders it is also likely that certain preferred shareholders and are going to experience adjustments to the conversion prices based on provisions in their securities these may be but are not always disclosed in the 10k.   last point models are tools what are you trying to build an accretion dilution model for this will affect and determine the degree of granularity you 'll want to go into
