the 8 rate offered by russian banks on us dollar accounts reflects the financial problems they have they would prefer to lend us dollars on the international financial markets at the same rate as us banks but loans to russian banks are considered to be more risky in fact the estimated default risk is ~6   your ruble deposits at russian banks are most likely backed by state guarantees which reduces the risk and therefore the effective interest rate

there is really much simpler explanation for the interest rate differences in different countries it is the interest rate arbitrage it is a very well explored economic concept so you can look it up on the internet in case you want to know more 1 interest rates for the same currency in different countries basically as one smart person here pointed out there is only one price of money in free market economy it happens because investors can move their money anywhere in the world to capitalize on the local interest rates advantage for instance if i can take a loan in the usa at 3 4 annual interest and receive 5 6 annual income on my dollar deposit in russia i would take a loan in the us and open a deposit in russia to enjoy a risk free interest rate differential income of 2 5 6 3 4 ~ 2 so would any reasonable person however in real world very few banks in russia or anywhere would pay you an an interest rate higher than it can borrow money at it 'd probably lose money if it 'd do so anyways the difference between the risk free rate and interest rate on the dollar deposit can be attributed to the risk premium of this particular bank the higher expected return the greater risk premium if there is a positive difference in the interest rates on the dollar deposits in different countries it will almost entirely accounted for the risk premium it is generally much riskier to keep money in say russian bank than american that 's why investors want greater return on their dollar deposits in russian banks than in american of course if you 'd want to park your usd in russian bank you 'd also have to consider transaction costs so as you may have already guessed there is no free lunch 2 interest rates in different currencies for different countries if we are talking about the interest rates in different sovereign currencies it is a somewhat similar concept only there is more risk if you keep money in local currency risk premium is much higher probably the biggest component of this risk is inflation that is only attributed to the prices in local currency for that reason current interest rates on deposits in russian rubles are at 10 12 but only 1 3 in the us dollars an economic concept that discusses this phenomenon in great detail is interest rate parity   hope this was helpful p.s. it does n't look quite realistic that you can get an 8 annual income for usd deposit in russia with the interest rates in the u.s. being at 1 2 at present moment a 30-year mortgage annual interest rate in the us is at ~2 3 and an annual interest rates for dollar deposits in one of the safest russian banks = very little risk premium is at 1 3 so arbitrage is impossible

typically developing economics are marked by moderate to high inflation as they are growing at a faster pace higher in savings rate and higher lending rates if you reduce the lending rate more business start up will borrow at cheaper rate this in turn means lowers savings rate and leads to higher inflation to combat this central banks make borrowing expensive which lowers inflation and increases the saving rate essentially all these 3 are tied up as to why these countries offer higher interest on usd is because most of the developing countries have trade current account deficit they need to bring in more usd in the country one of the ways is to encourage non resident citizens to park their foreign earning back home ensuring more funds usd inflow   the rate differential also acts as a guide as to how the currency would be valued against usd for example if you get 8 on usd less than 12 had you converted same to rouble at the end of say 3 years the exchange rate between usd and rouble would factor that 4 ie rouble will go down developed countries on the other hand are marked by low inflation they have already achieved everything as there is no in growth it more they are also characterized by low savings and lending rates

the united states federal reserve has decided that interest rates should be low they think it may help the economy the details matter little here though it will enforce this low rate by buying treasury bonds at this very low interest rate bonds are future money so this means they pay a lot of money up front for very little interest in the future the fed will pay more than anyone who offers less money up front so they can set the price as long as they 're willing to buy at the end of the day treasury bonds pay nearly no interest    since there 's little money to be made with treasuries people who want better than zero returns will bid up the current price of any other bonds or similar loan like instruments to get what whatever rate of return that they can there 's really no more than one price for money you can think of the price of those bonds as basically treasury rate + some based on the risk percent   i realize thinking about bond prices is weird and different than other prices you 're measuring future money using present money and it 's easy to be confused and assure you it ultimately makes sense anyway your savings account money has to compete with everyone else willing to lend money to banks everyone else lends money for peanuts so you get peanuts on your savings account too your banking is probably worth more to your bank on account of your check card payment processing fees collected from the merchant than from the money they make lending out your savings notice how many places have promotional rates if you make your direct deposits or use your check card to make a purchase n times a month   in europe it 's similar except you 've got a different central bank if europe 's bank operated radically differently for an extended period of time you 'd expect to see a difference in the exchange rates which would ultimately make the returns from investing in those currencies pretty similar as well such a change may show up domestically as inflation in the country with the loose money policy and internationally as weakness against other currencies there 's really only one price for money around the entire world any difference boils down to a   difference in perceived risk

the short answer is that banking is complicated but the bank really does n't need your money because it can get it from the fed almost free it can only use 90 of the money you give the bank it can only make money on that 90 from very low risk and thus low return investments and as it has to show a profit to its shareholders it will take whatever cut it needs to off the top of the returns all of these things combine to make savings account interest roughly .05 in the us right now the longer answer all fdic insured banks which the us requires all depositor banks to be are subject to regulation by the federal reserve the very first rule that all banks must comply with is that depositor money can not be invested in things the fed terms risky this limits banks from investing your money in things that have high returns like stocks commodities and hedges because along with the high possible returns come high risk banks typically can only invest your savings in t debt and in certain fed approved aaa bonds which have very low risk and so very little return the investment of bank assets into risky market funds was a major contributor to the financial crisis with the repeal of the glass steagall act banks had been allowed to integrate their fdic insured depositor business with their investment banking business not fdic insured while still not allowed to bet on risky investments with deposits banks were using their own money retained profits corporate equity bond money to bet heavily in the markets and were investing depositor funds in faulty aaa rated investment objects like cdos when the housing market crashed banks had to pull out of the investment market and cash in hedges like credit default swaps to cover the depositor losses which sent a wave through the rest of the market banks really ca n't even loan your money out to people who walk in like you 'd think they would and which they traditionally used to do that 's how the savings and loan crisis happened when speculators took out huge loans to invest lost the cash declared bankruptcy and left the s&ls and ultimately the fdic on the hook for depositors money   so the upshot of all this is that the bank simply wo n't give you more on your money than it is allowed to make on it   in addition there are several tools that the fed has to regulate economic activity and three big ones play a part first is the federal funds rate this is the interest rate that the fed charges on loans made to other banks which is a primary source of day to day liquidity for these banks money paid as interest to the fed is effectively removed from the economy and is a way to reduce the money supply right now the ffr is .25 that 's one quarter of one percent which is effectively zero borrow a billion dollars $ from the fed for one month and you 'll pay them a $ banks lend to other banks at a rate based on the ffr called the interbank rate usually adding some fraction of a percent so the lending bank makes money on the loan this means that the banks can get money from the fed and from other banks very cheaply which means they do n't have to offer high interest rates on savings to entice individual depositors to save their money with the bank second is quantitative easing which just means the fed buys government bonds and pays for them with new money this happens all the time remember those interest charges on bank loans to keep the money supply stable the fed must buy t debt at least in the amount of the interest being charged otherwise the money leaves the economy and is not available to circulate the fed usually buys a little more than it collects in order to gradually increase the money supply which allows the economy to grow while controlling inflation having too much money and so making money worth less than what it can buy   what 's new is that the fed is increasing the money supply by a very large amount by buying bonds far in excess of the low rates it 's charging and at fixed prices determined by the yield the fed wants to induce in the markets in the first place with the fed buying so many there are fewer for institutions and other investors to buy this increases the demand driving down yields as investors besides the fed are willing to pay a similar price and remember that t debt is one of the main things banks are allowed to invest your deposits in inflation is n't a concern right now despite the large amount of new money being injected because the current economy is so lackluster right now that the new cash is just being sat upon by corporations and being used by consumers to pay down debt instead of what the fed and government want us to do hire update equipment buy houses and american cars etc in addition the spot market price for a t bond or any investment security is generally what the last guy paid by buying treasury debt gradually at a fixed price the fed can smooth out in the spot price that speculators may try to induce by making low buy offers on t debt to increase yields lastly the fed can tell banks that they must keep a certain amount of their deposits in reserve basically by keeping them in a combination of cash in the vault and in accounts with the fed itself this has a dual purpose higher reserve rates allow a bank to weather a run more people than usual wanting their money and thus reduces risk of failure an increased reserves amount also reduces the amount of money circulating in the economy because obviously if the banks have to keep a percentage of assets in cash they ca n't invest that cash banks are currently required to keep 10 of deposited assets the sum of all checking and savings accounts but not cds in cash this compounds the other problems with banks investing not only are they not getting a great return on your savings they can only use 90 of your savings to get it

banks in general will keep saving rates as low as possible especially if there is a surplus of funds or alternative access for funding as in the case of the fed in the usa generally speaking why would bank pay you a high interest rate when they can not generate any income from your money usually we will expect to see a drop in the loan interest rate when their is a surplus of funds so as to encourage investment but if the market is volatile then no banks will allow easy access to money through loans the old traditional policy of lending money without proper security and no control from the central bank has created serious problems for savings account holders when some of these banks went into bankruptcy it is for this reason most countries has modified their financial act to offer more protection to account holders at the moment banks must follow rigid guidelines before a loan can be approved to a customer in my country we have seen the collapse of a few banks which sent a shock wave across the county for those that have savings held at those bank we have also seen unsecured loans having to be written off thus putting serious pressure of those banks so government stepped in a few years ago and amended the act to make it mandatory to have commercial banks follow certain strict guidelines before approving a loan

it would seem that the best method of bank robbery involves an inside man or woman someone in the bank who can provide information about where the largest amount of cash is and when to hit the bank $ 20,000 does not seem to be worth the risk of jail time i 'd say anything south of $ 100,000 per bank robber probably would n't be worth it and getting that amount of cash would require more than a simple walk in pull a gun empty a register robbery    the trick would either be proving an iron clad for the inside person or the group of robbers collectively contributing to the cost of that person disappearing at the very least that individual should get the largest share of the score    escape is undoubtedly the biggest issue one would need immediate transportation from the scene of the crime which could leave the area then be dumped fully for prints dna etc then the group would all go their separate ways    regardless i do n't think it 's worth the risk or the effort first off when you rob a bank the greedy bankers does n't lose the money it 's paid by the fdic which is founded by taxpayers so what you 're doing is taking money that might otherwise be spent on social services for people who need them moreover it 's expensive and time consuming to launder large amounts of money if you manage to get $ 120,000 out of a robbery which is hugely optimistic that number would take years and a significant fraction of the take just to clean for personal use and the risk of not only prison but possibly death seems rather extreme when compared to the admittedly more dull alternative of finding and holding down career    i think there are probably more efficient criminal methods of obtaining large quantities of money wealth too illegal narcotics for example are a $ 300 billion a year industry while it 's not the easiest business to get into one the potential for someone who is n't just some moron off the street to climb the cartel ladder could be significant and could lead to a high income there are significant risks of course and there 's a serious moral question as to whether selling illegal drugs is acceptable or not but if you 're morally flexible or have the opinion that illegal narcotics are not something that should be prohibited it could work    and there 's always money in the banana stand

it seems like you are asking two different questions one is how do i know if i can afford a house the other is how do i know what type of mortage to get the first question is fairly simple to answer there 's plenty of calculators out there that will tell you what you can afford but rule of thumb is 30 of income can goto housing now what type of mortgage to get can be much more confusing because the mortgage industry makes money off of these confusing products the best thing to do in my in situations like this is to keep it simple you need to be careful buying a house so much money is changing hands and there are so many parasites involved in the transaction i would be extremely wary of anybody who is going to tell you what mortgage to get i 've never heard of a fee only independent mortgage broker and if i found one that claimed to be i would n't believe him i would just ignore all the exotic non conforming products and just answer one simple question are you the type of person that buys an insurance policy or that likes to self insure if you like insurance get a 30 year fixed mortgage if you like to self insure get a 7 year arm the average someone owns a house is 7 years plus in 7 years time it might not adjust up and even if it does you can just accelerate your payments and pay it off quickly this is the self insurance part of it if you 're like me i 'm willing to pay an extra .5 for the 30 year so that my payment never changes and i 'm never forced to move which is extremely unlikely but i like the safety i do n't like 15 year term loans because rates are so low you can get way better returns in the stock market right now so why pay off sooner then you need to heck if i had a paid off house right now i 'd refi into a 30 year and invest the money in summary pick 30 year or arm then just shop around to find the lowest rate which is extremely easy

let 's look at the two options   it sounds like at this time the company has enough cash to pay you a salary or pay your loan off but not both at the same time ideally in the future there will be enough cash flow to be able to do both at the same time   if you start your salary now when the cash flow increases to the point where the company can pay off your loan you will continue to receive your salary while the loan is being repaid so it is probably most advantageous to you to start the salary now and wait with the loan payments if you think that the company is not going to make it and there is a danger of not ever getting the loan repaid this could change however you are probably optimistic about the company or you would n't have made the loan and agreed to work for free in the first place with the other option the company gets out of debt quicker and cheaper i can totally understand your brother wanting to eliminate this debt asap   it looks like you and your brother had different expectations about what was going to happen that 's why it is so critical to put these kinds of agreements in writing if you had had a payment schedule in your written loan agreement this would n't be an issue of course the issue of how long you would continue to work for free would still be there but this could also have been decided ahead of time as is you have two different things going on that were left up in the air with no formal agreement   as to what is fair that is something only you and he can work out perhaps you can propose a payment schedule for your loan that the company can afford now while paying your salary that way you will start getting paid for working and the company will start moving toward eliminating the debt   i hope that you will be able to agree to a solution without ruining the relationship you have with your brother besides the fact that family relationships are important a rift between the two of you would certainly be disastrous for the company and as a result your and his finances

as others have pointed out the value of apple 's stock and the nasdaq are most likely highly correlated for a number of reasons not least among them the fact that apple is part of the nasdaq however because numerous factors affect the entire market or at least a significant subset of it it makes sense to develop a strategy to remove all of these factors without resorting to use of an index using an index to remove the effect of these factors might be a good idea but you run the risk of potentially introducing other factors that affect the index but not apple i do n't know what those would be but it 's a valid theoretical concern   in your question you said you wanted to subtract them from each other and only see an apple curve moving around a horizontal line the basic strategy i plan to use is similar but even simpler instead of apple 's stock price we can plot the difference between its stock price on business day t and business day which gives us this graph which is essentially what you 're looking for   while this is only the it should give you a basic idea of one procedure that 's used extensively to do just what you 're asking i do n't know of a website that will automatically give you such a metric but you could download the price data and use excel stata etc to analyze this   the reasoning behind this methodology builds heavily on time series econometrics which for the sake of simplicity i wo n't go into in great detail but i 'll provide a brief explanation to satisfy the curious in simple econometrics most time series are by a mathematical process comprised of several components in the simplest case the equations for a time series containing one or more of the above components are of the form that taking the first difference the procedure i used above will leave only the random component however if you want to pursue this rigorously you would first perform a set of tests to determine if these components exist and if is the best procedure to remove those that are present once you 've reduced the series to its random component you can use that component to examine how the process underlying the stock price has changed over the years in my example i highlighted steve jobs death on the chart because it 's one factor that may have led to the increased standard deviation volatility of apple 's stock price although charts are somewhat subjective it appears that the volatility was already increasing before his death which could reflect other factors or the increasing expectation that he would n't be running the company in the near future for whatever reason my discussion of time series and the definitions of various components relies heavily on walter 's text applied econometric time series if you 're interested simple mathematical representations and a few relevant graphs are found on pages 1 3 another related procedure would be to take the logarithm of the of the current day 's price and the previous day 's price in apple 's case doing so yields this graph   this reduces the overall magnitude of the values and allows you to see potential outliers more clearly this produces a similar effect to the difference taken above because the log of a is the same as the difference of the logs the significant drop depicted during the year 2000 occurred between september 28th and september 29th where the stock price dropped from to apart from the general environment of the dot com bubble bursting i 'm not sure why this occurred another excellent resource for time series econometrics is james hamilton 's book time series analysis it 's considered a classic in the field of econometrics although similar to book it 's fairly advanced for most investors   i used stata to generate the graphs above with data from yahoo finance there are a couple of nuances in this code related to how i defined the time series and the presence of weekends but they do n't affect the overall concept for a robust analysis i would make a few quick tweaks that would make the graphs less appealing without more work but would allow for more accurate econometrics

the scenario you mention regarding capital gains is pretty much the core of the issue here 's a run down from that explains it a bit it 's important to focus on it being the tax rate not the tax amount which i think you get but i want to reinforce that for other readers   basically most of buffett 's income comes from capital gains and    dividends income from investments he makes with the money he already    has income earned by buying and selling stocks or from stock    dividends is generally taxed at 15 percent the rate for long term    capital gains and qualified dividends buffett also mentioned that some of the mega rich are hedge fund    managers who earn billions from our daily labors but are allowed to    classify our income as carried interest thereby getting a bargain    15 percent tax rate we do n't know the taxes paid by buffett 's secretary who was mentioned    by obama but not by buffett buffet 's secretary would have to make a    high salary or else typical deductions such as the child tax credit    would offset taxes owed let 's say the secretary is a particularly    well compensated executive assistant making adjusted income more than    $ in income yes that sounds like a lot to us too but    remember we 're talking about the secretary to one of the richest    people in the world in that case marginal tax rates of 28 percent    would apply then there would be payroll taxes of 6.25 percent on the    first $ money that goes to social security and another 1.45    percent on all income which goes to medicare the secretary ’s overall    tax rate would be lower than 28 percent since not all the income    would be taxed at that rate only the income above $ buffett meanwhile would pay very little if anything in payroll    taxes in the new york times op ed buffett said he paid percent    in taxes thinking of the secretary it gets a little complicated    given how the tax brackets work but basically people who make    between $ 100,000 and $ 200,000 are paying around 20 percent in federal    taxes including payroll and income taxes according to an analysis    from the nonpartisan tax policy center so in this case the secretary 's rate is higher because so much of    buffett 's income comes from investments and is taxed at the lower    capital gains rate here 's buffet 's original op ed in the nyt for those of you that are n't familiar

the of the deduction is based on what the borrowed money is used to purchase and not what asset is used as collateral   so at the beginning of your mortgage 10 of the interest is deductible because the entire loan was used to purchase the condo   but when you withdraw money from the account the additional interest is usually not deductible   it can get confusing with all the withdrawals and payments that will be coming in and out of the account if you happen to use it a lot like a chequing account an easy example would be if you only paid the interest on the loan   say you had a $ 100 000 loan at 5 apy for simplicity 's sake   after one year you would have paid $ 5000 interest   $ 500 of the would be deductible given that your office is 10 of the condo   then you buy a $ 1000 couch and continue to only pay interest for the next year   you would have paid $ interest   $ 5000 on money borrowed to buy the condo and $ 100 on money borrowed to buy the couch   so you can still only deduct $ 500 what happens when you pay back $ 500 against the line of credit   could you designate that 100 of the money should be applied to the non deductible interest   or does it have to applied proportionally   i do n't know i think it 'd would be wise to separate the loans somehow   may even have some tools to facilitate that   however i would n't recommend the one product   i looked into when i was buying my house two years ago and at that time it was too expensive   the rate was the same that other banks were charging for a home equity line of credit which was prime at the time   you can replicate the one in a cheaper way using a traditional mortgage and a home equity line of credit   the majority of the loan will be the traditional mortgage at hopefully a cheap rate   then you can use your line of credit as the chequing account

first of all the company will pay the money for the insurance do not be afraid they have to pay if 1 the insurance premium was paid every month and 2 there was not a false declaration of health when the contract was signed 5 or 10 years ago it normally takes between 1 month and 4 months to settle an insurance contract your case might take a little longer second the insurance company admit that you are the beneficiary so the money will eventually come to you what they say is that you need someone in charge a trustee or a to handle the money in your name why because you have a mental health team in charge of you be patient and third start by talking to someone in charge in your mental health team or the people you see what you need is someone acting as a trustee for you you need to go and seek free legal aid depending on your country or state of residence   i can not help you more than that you will have the money eventually in a few months but you need to find a trustee a guardian as soon as possible someone in your family could easily do it for you

after reading op mark 's question and the various answers carefully and also looking over some old pay stubs of mine i am beginning to wonder if he is mis reading his pay stub or slip of paper attached to the reimbursement check for the he purchases   pay stubs whether paper documents attached to checks or things received in one 's company mailbox or available for downloading from a company web site while the money is deposited electronically into the employee 's checking account vary from company to company but a reasonably well designed stub would likely have categories such as taxable gross income for the pay period this is the amount from which payroll taxes federal and state income tax social security and medicare tax are deducted as well as other post tax deductions such as money going to purchase of us savings bonds contributions to united way via payroll   deduction contribution to roth 401k etc employer paid group life   insurance premiums are taxable income too for any portion of the policy   that exceeds $ 50k. in some cases these appear as a lump sum on the last pay stub for the year nontaxable gross income for the pay period this would be sum total of the amounts contributed to 401k plans employee 's share of group health care insurance premiums for employee   and/or employee 's family money deposited into fsa accounts etc net pay this is the amount of the attached check or money sent via ach to the employee 's bank account year to date amounts these just tell the employee what has been earned paid withheld to date in the various categories now op mark said my company does not tax the reimbursement but they do add it to my running gross earnings total for the year so the question is whether the amount of the reimbursement is included in the year to date amount of taxable income if ytd taxable income does not include the reimbursement amount   then the the op 's question and the answers and comments are moot unless the company has really messed up pat pending payroll software that does weird things the amount   on the w2 form will be whatever is shown as ytd taxable income   on the last pay stub of the year and as noted it is what will appear on the w2 form that really matters in summary it is good that op mark is taking the time to investigate the matter of the reimbursements appearing in total gross income but if the amounts are not appearing in the ytd taxable income his payroll office may just him that they have good software and that what the ytd taxable income says on the last pay stub is what will be appearing on his w2 form   i am fairly confident that this is what will be the resolution of the matter because if the amount of the reimbursement was included in taxable income during that pay period and no tax was withheld then the employer has a problem with   social security and medicare tax and nonpayment of this tax plus the employer 's share to the us treasury in timely fashion the irs takes an extremely view of such shenanigans and most employers are unlikely to take the risk

first it sounds like you are already making wise choices with your cash surplus you 've looked for ways to keep that growing ahead of inflation and you have made use of tax shelters so for the rest of this answer i am going to assume you have between 3 6 months expenses already saved up as a rainy day fund and you 're ready for more sophisticated approaches to growing your funds to answer this part are there any other ways that i can invest that i am not currently doing yes you could look at for example 1 peer to peer these services let you lend to a basket of borrowers and receive a return on your money that is typically higher than what 's offered in cash savings accounts examples of peer to peer networks are zopa and this involves taking some risks with your money zopa 's lending section explains the risks 2 structured deposits these are a type of cash deposit product where in return for locking your money away for a time typically 5 years you get the opportunity for higher returns e.g. 5 + year your deposit is usually guaranteed under the fscs financial services compensation scheme however the returns are dependent on the performance of a stock market index such as the ftse 100 being higher in x years from now also structured deposits usually require a minimum £ 3,000 investment 3 index funds you mention watching the stock prices of a few companies i agree with your conclusion i would n't suggest trying to choose individual stocks at this stage price history is a poor predictor of future performance and markets can be volatile to decide if a stock is worth buying you need to understand the fundamentals be able to assess the current stock price and future outlook and be comfortable accepting a range of different risks including currency and geographic risk if you buy shares in a small number of companies you are concentrating your risk especially if they have things in common with each other index funds while they do carry risks let you pool your money with other investors to buy shares in a basket of stocks to replicate the movement of an index such as the ftse all share the basket of stocks approach at least gives you some built in diversification against the risks of individual stocks i suggest index funds as opposed to actively managed funds where you pay a management fee to have your investments chosen by a professional who tries to beat the market because they are low cost and easier to understand an example of a very low cost index fund is this ftse all share tracker from on the hargreaves lansdown platform general principle on investing in stock market based index funds you should always invest with a 5 + year time horizon this is because prices can move up and down for reasons beyond your anticipation or control volatility time can smooth out volatility generally the longer the time period the greater your likelihood of achieving a positive return i hope this answer so far helps takes into account the excess funds so to answer the second part of your question   or would it be best to start using any excess funds to pay off my student loan quicker your student loan is currently costing you 0.9 interest per annum at this rate it 's lower than the last 10 years average inflation one argument if you repay your student loan this is effectively a 0.9 guaranteed return on every pound repaid this is the equivalent of on a cash savings account if you 're paying basic rate tax on the interest an opposing argument 0.9 is lower than the last 10 years average inflation in the uk there are so many advantages to making a start with growing your money for the long term due to the effects of compound returns that you might choose to defer your loan repayments for a while and focus on building up some investments that stand a chance to beat inflation in the long term

theoretically there is limited demand for risky investments so higher risk asset classes should outperform lower risk asset classes over sufficiently long time periods in practice i believe this is true but it could be several decades before a risky portfolio starts to outperform a more conservative one stocks are considered more risky than most assets small cap stocks and emerging market stocks are particularly high risk i would consider low fee etfs in these areas like vb or if you want to seek out the absolute riskiest investments you could pick individual stocks of companies in dire financial situations as bank of america was a couple years ago most importantly if you do n't expect to need the money soon i would maximize your contribution to tax advantaged accounts since they will grow exponentially faster than taxable accounts over 50 years a 401(k or ira will generally grow at least 50 more than a taxable account maybe more depending on the tax efficiency of your investments try to contribute the maximum $ 17,500 for most people in 2014 if you can if you can save more than that i 'd suggest contributing a roth 401k rather than a traditional 401(k since roth contributions are post tax the effective contribution limit is higher also contribute to a roth ira up to $ 5,500 in 2014 using a backdoor roth if necessary

your calculations are correct if you use the same mortgage rate for both the 15 and 30 year mortgages   however generally when you apply for a 15 year mortgage the interest rate is significantly less than the 30 year rate   the rate is lower for a number of reasons but mainly there is less risk for the bank on a 15 year payoff plan

a friend tweeted a similar question regarding student loans and i responded with student loans and your first mortgage   the punchline is that you need to be aware of the 28/36 ratios in a bank qualifying you for your mortgage even though you have a house you may not be aware of this   simply put 28 of gross monthly income can be used to qualify for your house burden loan taxes etc 36 for total debt so the student loan may fit in that 8 gap and paying it all off reduces the cash you have without helping you borrow more money   3 5 years is short term and to that part of the question this money should not be invested in anything at risk a 3 year treasury or cd would be it in my opinion

this depends on a combination of factors what are you charged call it margin interest to hold the position how does this reduce your buying power and what are the opportunity costs what are the transaction costs alternative ways to close the position what are your risks exposure while out for alternative ways to close finally where is the asset closing relative to the strike generally if asset price is below the put strike then the call expires worthless and you need to exercise the put if asset is above the call strike then put expires worthless and you 'll likely get assigned   given this framework   if margin interest is eating up your profit faster than you 're earning theta a convenient way to represent the time value then you have some urgency and you need to exit that position before expiry i would not exit the stock until the call is covered keep minimal risk at all times if you are limited by the position 's impact on your buying power and probable value of available opportunities is greater than the time decay you 're earning then once again you have some urgency about closing instead of unwinding at expiry same as above cover that call before you ditch your hedge in the long stock playing the tradeoff game of expiration exercise cost against open market transactions is tough you need sub penny commissions on stock and i would say a lot of leverage and most importantly you need options charges much lower than ib to make that kind of trading work ib is the cheapest in the retail brokerage game but those commissions are n't even close to what the traders are getting who are more than likely on the other side of your options trades

there are two parts to the hack you describe   one is moving to a high cost high pay country to work and the other is moving to a low cost low pay country to retire as dilip mentioned in a comment the first part is not so easy in many cases   you ca n't just take a plane to the usa and start making big bucks immediately   in the first place it 's illegal to work without special visa permissions   even if you manage to secure that permission or take the risk of trying to work illegally there 's no guarantee you 'll get a job let alone a high paying one   the same is true in most other high paying countries as for the second part that takes considerable willpower as well   after spending x years getting used to a country investing time and money you must then have the resolve to your life a second time and move to another country   for the most part countries are expensive for a reason   even if you in principle reject the cost benefit tradeoffs of a particular country it can be difficult to give up some of those benefits when the time comes e.g. trains running on time reliable electricity shops or whatever   you might get soft or become co opted by the rich country rat race and find it difficult to yourself all of these problems are compounded if as in many cases you happened to start a family while in the expensive country   at the least moving would require not just you but your family   also quality of education is often one of the main reasons people permanently to expensive countries   even a person who personally would prefer to retire to a cheaper country may be unwilling to transplant their children into that country 's education system   of course they could wait until the children are self supporting but that makes the wait longer and may result in them living far away from their children which they may not want as joetaxpayer notes the same reasons may work on smaller levels even within a country   in theory it 's perfectly possible to power through a brief lucrative career in silicon valley and then retire to idaho but it does n't seem to happen as often as the plain numbers might suggest   a simple way to put it might be that the kind of person who would be happy living in a cheap environment often can not or will not endure a lengthy tour of duty in an expensive environment   either you like the expensive environment and stay or you leave not as a planned but because you realize you do n't like it

neither of those links disagree with me to be honest and the first one seems conservative relative to other reporting   gt i mean yes you ’re all there together but if you and i are doing ostensibly the same and possibly dangerous work you ’re getting rich and i ’m not   i was once in their place too presuming we are talking about military they know that any anger i have seen from military people is from either senior enlisted who are mad that they did n't get out and make a better life for themselves and senior enlisted are lower on the totem pole than security contractors so no one gives a fuck about their gripes and some officers the best part about being on the top of the security contractor food chain is that you worked for the state department so you could be openly shitty to military people who an attitude of any sort   also that taxpayers do n’t care more about this although not the amount of bullshit is just too overwhelming   i 'm not sure there 's a lot to care about if you asked a random person if they would be willing to go through 4 8 years of military to have a potential shot at getting a job that pays like that one did but it 's in the most violent city on earth i imagine they would answer with a no   gt;sounds like you could tell lets of stories about the women though i ’m not sure i want to hear them after a good lunch and i ’m pretty sure you do n’t want to remember   good choice

historically most economists considered a sustained negative interest rate impossible for just the reason you describe an investor could outperform a bond with a negative interest rate by simply hoarding cash for background see wikipedia by central banks in the wake of the 2007 financial crisis however demonstrates that slightly negative interest rates are possible first of all note that the zero lower bound on interest rates has everything to do with the existence of cash as an alternative it 's a lower bound on the nominal interest rate rather than the real interest rate that is on the rate before adjusting for inflation in most situations the real interest rate is more economically meaningful as it 's the real interest rate that measures the market 's preference for stuff now as opposed to stuff later there 's nothing in principle or in practice to stop a negative real interest rate there are always some people who want stuff now and some people who want stuff later a negative real interest rate just means that people who want stuff later are more dominant in the market as i stated earlier what creates the zero lower bound is the existence of cash as an alternative to bonds even though that lower bound applies it 's not strict hoarding cash in large quantities can be difficult and expensive especially when central banks are doing their best to prevent you from doing it consequently investors who strongly prefer stuff later to stuff now are willing to pay a slightly negative nominal interest rate on bonds in order to avoid those costs if it were significantly negative however you 're right that no sane investor would buy such a bond

welcome to money se please forgive what might sound like a cliche how well do you sleep at night i mean specific to the mortgage there are those who are in a group who consider debt at any rate to be inherently bad and would not take on a 2 mortgage even if a different bank were offering 4 cds you just need to understand the risk   your mortgage cost after taxes may be if you are in the 25 bracket therefore your break even is for long term investments the recent lost decade had a return of for the full 10 year period this is just about the worst decade in modern history the average 10 year return is a cumulative 183 gain with a standard deviation of if a perfect bell curve this means that 1 10 year in 6 will give you a return under 45 in fact of the last 100 10 year periods 15 had returns less than 45 and just 8 were less than 30 right in line with the bell curve stats we always need to say past performance is no guarantee of future results yet when it comes to the market i use the s&p for my numbers by the way we do have history to give us an idea of the kind of volatility we might see over the years in my opinion your approach is sound and your returns very skewed to the positive the median 10 year return being vs your cost of money of 40 or so for a decade   it 's pretty easy to pull s&p data into a spreadsheet and analyze as you wish

generally if you are using fifo first in first out accounting you will need to match the transactions based on the number of shares in your example at the beginning of day 6 you had two lots of shares 100 50 and 10 52   on that day you sold 50 shares and using fifo you sold 50 shares of the first lot   this leaves you with 50 50 and 10 52 and a taxable capital gain on the 50 shares you sold note that commissions incurred buying the shares increase your basis and commissions incurred selling the shares decrease your proceeds   so if you spent $ 10 per trade your basis on the 100 50 lot was $ and the proceeds on your 50 60 sale were $   in this example you sold half of the lot so your basis for the sale was half of $ or $ so your capital gain is $ = $ the sales you describe are also wash sales in that you sold stock and bought back an equivalent stock within 30 days   generally this is only relevant if one of the sales was at a loss but you will need to account for this in your code   you can look up the definition of wash sale it starts to get complex if you are writing code to handle this in any generic situation you will also have to handle stock splits spin offs mergers etc which change the number of shares you own and their cost basis   i have implemented this myself and i have written about 25 30 custom routines one for each kind of transaction that i 've encountered   the structure of these deals is limited only by the imagination of investment bankers so i think it is impossible to write a single generic algorithm that handles them all instead i have a framework that i update each quarter as new transactions occur

there are really two answers depending on your goal you 're either trying to preserve wealth or increase wealth in the case of preserving wealth undervalued blue chip stocks are always a great move bonus points if they have a history of increasing dividend payments the best example i have is bank stocks the continuously change their dividend payouts usually to the benefit of investors and at the same time many have been undervalued or over during the downturn   alternatively you can let things sit and buy high quality corporate bonds i 'm seeing daily offers from my brokerage 's new issues list for high quality bonds paying while you have to lock in your money for the period the rate of return tends to offset lock in worries and you can still usually sell the shares in a secondary market or through your broker

it is perfectly legitimate to adjust your 1099-b income by broker 's fees   publication 17 p 116 specifically instructs taxpayers to adjust their schedule d reporting by broker 's fees form 1099-b transactions    if you sold property such as stocks bonds or certain commodities through a broker you should receive form 1099-b or substitute statement from the broker use the form 1099-b or the substitute statement to complete form 8949 if you sold a covered security in 2013 your broker should send you a form 1099-b or substitute statement that shows your basis this will help you complete form 8949 generally a covered security is a security you acquired after 2010 report the gross proceeds shown in box 2a of form 1099-b as the sales price in column d of either part i or part ii of form 8949 whichever applies however if the broker advises you in box 2a of form 1099-b that gross proceeds sales price less commissions and option premiums were reported to the irs enter that net sales price in column d of either part i or part ii of form 8949 whichever applies include in column g any expense of sale such as broker 's fees commissions state and local transfer taxes and option premiums unless you reported the net sales price in column d if you include an expense of sale in column g enter e in column f you can rely on your own records and judgment if you feel comfortable doing so   brokers often make incomplete tax reporting   this may have been simpler from their perspective if the broker fees were variable or integrated or unknown for a number of clients party to a transaction   if a taxpayer has documentation of the expenses that justify an adjustment then it 's perfectly appropriate to include that in the calculations it is not necessary to report the discrepancy and it may increase scrutiny to include a written addendum   the schedule d form 8949 and form 1099-b will probably together adequately explain the source of the deduction

when a delisting happens the primary process involves the firm or the entity trying to buy everyone out so that they can take the firm private by delisting from the stock exchanges as the firm wants to buy everyone out the current owners of the equity have the upper hand they would n't want to sell if they believe the firm has a brighter future so to compensate the existing holders the buyer needs to compensate the current holders of any future loss so they pay a premium to buy them out hence the prices offered will be more than the current existing price and in anticipation of a premium the stocks price rises on this speculation the other scenario is if the current decide no to sell their holdings and are small in number dependent on exchange regulations and the buyer manages to de list the stock the holders might loose out i.e. they have to find another buyer who wants to buy which becomes difficult as the liquidity for the stock is very minimal if any stock is de listed and then we can not trade on it   in india if the promoters capital is more than 90 he can get the stock de listed there is a process he has to make an open offer at specified price to minority shareholders the minority shareholder can refuse to sell once the stock is de listed it means it can not be traded on a given exchange however you can still sell buy by directly finding a buyer seller and it 's difficult compared to a listed stock

if i buy property when the market is in a downtrend the property loses    value but i would lose money on rent anyway so as long i 'm viewing    the property as housing expense i would be ok this is a bit too rough an analysis   it all depends on the numbers you plug in   let 's say you live in the boston area and you buy a house during a downtrend at $   two years later you need to sell it and the best you can get is $   you are down $ 70k and you are also out two years of property taxes maintenance insurance mortgage interest maybe etc   say that 's another $ 10k a year so you are down $ 70k + $ 20k = $ 90k   it 's probably more than that but let 's go with it in those same two years you could have been living in a fairly nice apartment for $   in that scenario you are out $ 2k 24 months = $ 48k and that 's it   it 's a difference of $ 90k $ 48k = $ 42k in two years   that 's sizable if i wanted to sell and upgrade to a larger property the larger    property would also be cheaper in the downtrend yes the general rule is   if you have to spend your money on a purchase it 's best to buy when things are low so you maximize your value    however if the market is in an uptrend selling the property would    gain me more than what i paid but larger houses would also have    increased in price but it may not scale   when you jump to a much larger more expensive house you can think of it as buying 1.5 houses   that extra 0.5 of a house is a new purchase and if you buy when prices are high relative to other economic indicators like salaries and rents you are not doing as well as when you buy when they are low    do both of these scenarios negate the pro cons of buying in either    market i do n't think so   i think in general buying more house either going from an apartment to a house or from a small house to a bigger house when housing is cheaper is favorable   houses are goods like anything else and when supply is high after overproduction of them and demand is low during bad economic times deals can be found relative to other times when the opposite applies or during housing bubbles    the other point is as with any trend you only know the future of the trend after it passes   you do n't know if you are buying at anything close to the bottom of a trend though you can certainly see it is lower than it once was    in terms of practical matters if you are going to buy when it 's up you hope you sell when it 's up too this graph of historical inflation adjusted housing prices is helpful to that point   let me just say that if i bought in the latest boom i sure hope i sold during that boom too

from my understanding by paying your bills more than 5 days late will not lead you into bankruptcy or stop you from getting a new loan in the future however it may mean that lenders offer you credit at a higher interest rate this of course would not help you as you are already struggling with your finances however no matter how bad you think things might be for you financially there are always things you can do to improve your situation set a budget the first thing you must do is to set a budget list down all sources of income you receive each month including any allowances then list all your sources of expenses and spending list all your bills such as rent telephone electricity car maintenance credit card and other loans keep a diary for a month for all your discretionary spending including coffees lunches and other odd bits and ends you can also talk with your existing lenders and come to some agreement on reducing you interest rates on your debts and the repayments but remember any reduction in repayments may increase your repayment period and the total interest you have to pay in the long term if you need help setting up your budget here are some links to resources you can download to help you get started once you set up your budget you want your total income to be more than your total expenses if it is n't you will be getting further and further behind each month some things you can do are to increase your income get a job second job sell some unwanted items or start a small home business some things you can do to reduce your expenses make coffees and lunches at home before going out and buying these pay off higher interest debts first consolidate all your debts into a lower interest rate loan reduce discretionary spending to an absolute minimum cancel all unnecessary services etc debt consolidation in regards to a debt consolidation for your existing personal loans and credit cards into a single lower interest rate loan can be a good idea but there are some pitfalls you should consider if you are taking out a loan with a lower interest rate but a longer term to pay it off you may end up paying less in monthly repayments but will end up paying more interest in the long run if you do take this course of action try to keep your term to no longer than your current debt 's terms and try to keep your repayments as high as possible to pay the debt off as soon as possible and reduce any interest you have to pay again be wary of the fine print and read the of any products you are thinking of getting refer to money smart website for more valuable information you should consider before taking out any debt consolidation assistance improving your skills and getting a higher paid job if you are finding it hard to get a job especially one that pays a bit more look into your options of doing a course and improving your skills there is plenty of assistance available for those wanting to improve their skills in order to improve their chances of getting a better job check out centrelink 's website for more information on payments for students and other action you can take if you are finding that the repayments are really getting out of hand and no one will help you with any debt consolidation or reducing your interest rates on your debts as a last resort you can apply for a part 9 debt agreement but be very careful as this is an alternative to bankruptcy and like bankruptcy a debt agreement will appear on your credit file for seven years and your name will be listed on the national personal insolvency index forever further assistance and help if you have trouble reading any or want further information or help regarding any issues i have raised or any other part of your financial situation you can contact centrelink 's financial information service they provide a free and confidential service that provides education and information on financial and lifestyle issues to all australians learn how to manage your money so you can get out of your debt and can lead a much more comfortable and less stressful life into the future

i appreciate the detailed responses truthfully however i feel like at least half of your points are either just for its sake alone display a deep lack of understanding of unions collective bargaining and the histories of both or ignore and cling to an and ultimately self defeating ideology   gt collective bargaining is an ambiguous term that could refer to many concepts there is voluntarily agreed to collective bargaining which has nothing wrong with it and then there are laws that force the employer to collectively bargain with a union if a union requests it which is a mandate and violates the employer 's contract liberty   the law forces the two parties to sit at a table the law forces the two parties to discuss a few core things like wages the law does n't force anyone to agree to anything and very often they do n't i do n't see how this is a violation of anyone 's contract liberty a term i 've actually never heard before the idea is since these worker employer disputes exist naturally making them at least sit at a table together and talking is helpful in avoiding ego and fueled disruptions where no one benefits if this you see this as a violation of one 's liberty i really do n't know what to say to that    gt the prevalence of child labor was decreasing long before any law was created prohibiting it child labor is necessary in poor countries because people are far less productive per hour worked    i 'm not saying i do n't believe you but citation needed   gt as productivity increases parents can afford to send their children off to school instead of working since their own work is enough to support the family   would n't educating children first lead to an increase in productivity also what if the owners of the means of production only a few in an given area have incomes 100x greater than the workers they seem to be producing enough wealth to support themselves only they 're not the beneficiaries what 's the solution here   i understand that in a poor country child labor is seen as a necessity however i think there is a moral issue when someone from a developed nation opens a factory in a third world country with conditions that they would not want someone in their own family subjected to maybe these conditions are standard in the third world country but just because they 're standard that does n't mean the people there are happy with them   gt in other words no government mandate created due to union pressure can possibly lead to beneficial change since laws that limit people 's economic rights under the assumption that 51 knows what 's better for the minority than they themselves do generally do much more harm than good      this is quite a leap problem is you always assume that a company is always paying workers as much as it can instead of having a net income that can absorb an uptick in overhead    gt as history over the last century has shown it 's no hyperbole labor unions backed regulations soft socialism has succeeded in spite of the resistance of employers   and you owe this to violence or the threat of violence citation needed   gt because unions have destroyed nearly every major industry where they had a natural tendency to form large scale capital intensive manufacturing operations where large numbers of workers were concentrated in one place   this is typical anti union propaganda and it 's funny you pull it out since it ignores your own ideology what interest would a union have in destroying the very industry it needs to exist answer none this is just a way for a business to deflect criticism when they want to outsource killing us jobs just to increase their net income unions make concessions when they have to   gt the force of government prevents companies from refusing to collectively bargain with a labor union threat of violence violent strikes this is a straw man if i 've ever seen one who is threatening violence here this existed before government laws were created that made legal threats on behalf of employees that want to keep unionized employees employed and force companies to collectively bargain with a union now of course the themselves are not directly threatening violence since they are backed by the force of government   this is just showing a tremendous amount of ignorance regarding the way   things actually happen   gt collectively bargaining does n't benefit workers in general it benefits in the short term those workers who are employed and unionized at the expense of long term wage growth and employment opportunities for the unemployed and non unionized employees   i have no idea how one could come to this conclusion i can only assume it   stems from the same old idea that employers are always paying out the most that they can afford    i happen to have first hand knowledge that it 's false however when my workplace unionized recently one of around a dozen locations nationally and the only one to organize the company responded by increasing wages and benefits to all locations have any locations closed no has anyone been laid off no is the company still mad profitable yes

or we could allow market forces to work    my suggestion be to outlaw price charging different people different rates force providers to disclose prices publicly and discourage patients from paying everything through a middle man type and purchase more services upfront we then institute a national catastrophic insurance to trigger in life death situations and we could then reimburse lower income people later with a government program but the amount of reimbursement needs to be hidden from the service provider because if they know how much the patient gets reimbursed they will just charge more

if you can make enough roi from the capital you retain by not paying off your mortgage then why not i do i could pay off a significant chunk of mortgage if i wanted but whilst interest rates are low there 's little incentive as for another crash well there 's no reason to expect a crash would result in high interest rates more the opposite but you should consider what you would or could do if interest rates did jump to 15 for whatever reason as long as your investments are n't too risky or difficult to liquidate etc you could always consider paying off a big chunk then when it makes sense

is she entitled to more of the equity because she made more no   equity should be determined by how much each paid   but she is entitled to more of the equity if she paid more   and that may be what she is saying   that she contributed more to the household 's finances than you did    if you always paid the mortgage out of the joint account you could presumably go back and look at the account to find out how much each of you contributed to it   that would give you a reasonable split for the remainder of the equity after your initial investment   if you both put your entire paychecks into the joint account every time then it will be the same as the ratio of what you each made   that would also make sense for splitting up whatever remains in that account    while you 're doing that you may want to ask for more for your original $ 65,000   by my calculation if your mortgage was 3.5 that $ 65,000 saved the household more than $ 12,000 in interest that became equity instead   so you could reasonably bump your return on the initial investment up to $ while making the concession on the rest of the equity    this is just a suggestion for a framework for splitting the equity   if you can agree on a split it will almost certainly be easier than going to a mediator or court

the first thing you should do and should have been doing all this time if you were n't is to take the money you would've paid in the payment plan and set it aside in a separate savings account   if your plan was 2 years $ 65 a month then set that aside now that will allow you to be in a better negotiating position when this is finally resolved   it 's also possible this takes two years to be resolved in which case you 'll be in position to pay the debt off in full at that point   it 's also possible at some point in the future you 'll be offered to settle for half or something like that at which point if you 've saved several months of payments that might be more practical to do as far as what to do about the charges being removed unless you have a specific reason for believing they 're invalid that 's probably impossible   you could go to the public service commission outlined in this article about making complaints about from coned it seems like it 's probably too late for that honestly but who knows   if you 'd made more of an effort at the time it 's possible you could 've disputed them back then with    and as far as what to do with requiring written payment plans absolutely 100   i would try to find out why you 're not getting the plans   do they have the wrong address perhaps   or is your mail sometimes poorly delivered   ask them to send it via certified mail you may be charged a few dollars for this or ask them to e mail you a copy while you 're on the phone with them my preferred option bill collectors like getting their money so they ought to help you out with this

i do n't think you 're missing anything many modern trading systems actually warn you when trying to enter a market order asking if you are sure that you would n't prefer to set a limit i fully agree with you that it is usually just better to define a limit even 20 higher than just doing a market trade let me give you some examples when you still might prefer to use a market order instead of a limit but even in those two examples a wide limit order might just be the safer thing to do   so what it really comes down to is speed a market order has no other to be defined is thus entered faster and saves you a few seconds that might be crucial

you left out the part where i said cities use it as a source of revenue meaning there are two factors at play the city limiting the number of medallions drives up their auction price because there 's high demand and the cab companies trying to extract enough profit from the medallion to be worth it the city decides how many medallions to release just like in nyc they auction off permits for hot dog vendors which are ironically similarly priced imagine for a moment they gave vendor licenses to everyone who wanted to open a stand in central park you would n't even be able to see the park   i would n't really say it 's fair to call it a stranglehold more of wringing the last drop out of because you 're dying of thirst   personally i think the medallion model is bullshit in that sense i 'm all for a regulated free market where supply and demand find an equilibrium within the rules in reality you only find the medallion model in large markets which is n't really representative of the taxi industry as a whole

the real answer is to talk to the bank in the case of the last car loan i got the answer is no when i asked them about rates they gave me a printed sheet that listed the loan rates they offered based on how old the car was period i forget the exact numbers but it was like new car 4 1 year old 4.5 2 3 years old 5 etc   i suspect that at most banks these days it 's not up to the loan officer to come up with what he considers reasonable terms for a loan based on whatever factors you may bring up and he agrees are relevant the bank is going to have a set policy under these conditions this is the rate and that 's what you get so if the bank includes the size of the down payment in their calculations then yes it will be relevant if they do n't than it wo n't the thing to do would be to ask your bank if you 're only borrowing $ 2000 and you 've managed to save up $ 11,000 i 'd guess you can pay off the $ 2,000 pretty quickly so as keshlam says the interest rate probably is n't all that important if you can pay it off in a year then the difference between 5 and 1 is only $ 80 if you 're buying a $ 13,000 car i ca n't imagine you 're going to over $ 80 btw i 've bought two cars in the last few years with about half the cost in cash and putting the rest on my credit card one for me and one for my daughter then i paid off the credit card in a couple of months sure the interest rate on a credit card is much higher than a car loan but as it was only for a few months it made very little real difference and it took zero effort to arrange the loan and gave me total flexibility in the repayment schedule credit card companies often offer convenience checks where you pay like 3 or so transaction fee and then 0 interest for a year or more so it would just cost the 3 up front fee

when you want to invest in an asset denominated by a foreign currency your investment is going to have some currency risk to it you need to worry not just about what happens to your own currency but also the foreign currency lets say you want to invest $ 10000 in us stocks as a canadian today that will cost you $ since just hit you now have two ways you can make money one is if goes up two is if the stocks go up the former may not be obvious but remember you are holding us denominated assets currently with the intention of one day converting those assets back into cad essentially you are long long usd short cad since you are short cad if cad goes up it hurts you it may seem odd to think about this as a currency trade but it opens up a possibility if you want a foreign investment to be currency neutral you just make the opposite currency trade in addition to your original investment so in this case you would buy $ 10,000 in us stocks and then short ie long cad short usd $ 10,000 this is kind of savvy and may not be something you would do but its worth mentioning and there are also some currency hedged etfs out there that do this for you however most are hedged relative to usd and are meant to hedge the target countries currency not your own

as of april 2017 they had an estimated 80 million subscribers at $ 99 a year that puts it at just under $ 8 billion now there are different deals that will bring the cost down from $ 99 for college students etc you can also pay $ 10 a month which would make it $ 120 a year so it gets a little more complicated than the simple equation above but on average i 'm sure it 's right around $ 8 billion plus or minus a couple hundred millions of dollars

there is a process called a backdoor ira    you now have effectively made a roth ira contribution in a year where technically you are n't eligible   you do not have to pay taxes on earnings with a roth ira   you are limited to the normal annual contribution to the ira roth or traditional    if you do n't convert your traditional ira contribution to a roth ira then you are right   that gains nothing except enhanced protection in bankruptcy   only do this if you are taking advantage of the roth rollover    i 'm ignoring rolling over a 401k into an ira as that does n't increase the amount you can contribute   this does   you can contribute the full $ 18,000 to the 401k and still make a full contribution to the backdoor ira    this is the tax advantaged form of an ira   this avoids double taxation   let 's assume that your investment can go into something with a 5 annual return and you pay a 25 tax rate does n't matter as it drops out   you are going to invest for thirty years and then withdraw   you initially have $ 1000 before taxes    with a regular investment    you now have $    with a pre tax ira    you now have $ it is not an accident that this is almost the same as the amount before the capital gains tax in the example without an ira    you avoided the $ capital gains tax   even though you paid a lot more tax you paid it out of the gains from investing the original $ 250 that you would have paid in tax    this helps you even more if the capital gains tax goes up in the future   or if your tax bracket changes   if you currently are in the 25 bracket but retire in the 15 bracket these numbers will get even better in your favor    if you currently are in the 15 bracket and worry that you might retire in the 25 bracket consider a roth instead   it also avoids double taxation but its single taxation is at your current rate rather than your future rate

i 'm another programmer i guess we all just like complicated things or got here via obligatory tedious but accurate point investing is not personal finance in fact it 's maybe one of the less important parts of it see this answer where to start with personal finance   obligatory warning for software developer type minds getting into investing because it 's complicated and therefore fun is a really awful idea from a financial perspective   or see behavioral finance research on how analytical professional creative type people are often terrible at investing while even tempered practical people are better the thing with investing is that inaction is better than action tried and true is better than creative and simple is better than complicated so if you 're like me and many programmers and like creative complicated action not good for the wallet you 've been warned that said stuff i read in general i hate reading too much financial information because i think it makes me take ill advised actions the actions i most need to take have to do with my career and my spending patterns so i try to focus on reading about software development for example or i answer questions on this site which at least might help someone out and i enjoy writing for basic financial news and research i prefer especially if you get the premium version the writing has more depth it 's often from qualified financial analysts and with the paid version you get data and analysis on thousands of funds and stocks instead of a small number as with motley fool newsletters i do n't follow morningstar regularly anymore instead i use it for research when i need to pick funds in a 401k or whatever another caveat on morningstar is that the star ratings on funds are dumb look at the analyst picks and the analyst instead i just flipped through my rss reader and i have 20 30 finance related blogs in there collecting posts it looks like the only one i regularly read is which is sort of random but i find david very thoughtful and interesting he 's also a conservative without being a partisan hack and posts frequently i read the weekly market comment at as well most weeks it says the market is overvalued so that 's predictable but the interesting part is the rationale and the other ideas he talks about i read a lot of software related blogs and there 's some bleed into finance especially from the vc world blogs like or or whatever anyway i spend most of my reading time on career related stuff and i think this is also the correct decision from a financial perspective if you were a doctor you 'd be better off reading about too i read finance related books fairly often i guess there are other threads listing ideas on that front i prefer books about principles rather than a of daily financial news and questionable ideas other than that i keep up with headlines just reading the paper every day including business related topics is good enough if there 's some big event in the financial markets it 'll show up in the regular paper take a class i initially learned about finance by reading a pile of books and alongside that taking the cfp course and the first cfa course both are probably equivalent to about a college semester worth of work but you can plow through them in a couple months each if you focus you can just do the class and take the exam if you like without having to go on and actually get the work experience and the certifications i did n't go on to do that this sounds like a crazy thing to do and it kind of is but i think it 's also sort of crazy to expect to be competent on a topic without taking some courses or otherwise getting pretty deep into the material if you 're a normal person and do n't have time to take finance courses you 're likely better off either keeping it super simple or else outsourcing if you can find the right advisor what exactly can a financial advisor do for me and is it worth the money   when it 's inevitably complex e.g. as you approach retirement then an advisor is best my mom is retiring soon and i found her a professional for example i like having a lot of knowledge myself because it 's just the only way i could feel comfortable so for sure i understand other people wanting to have it too but what i 'd share from the other side is that once you have it the conclusion is that you do n't have enough knowledge or time to do anything fancy anyway and that the simple answers are fine check out investing for fun is n't investing for profit many people recommend motley fool i see two on this question already the site is n't evil but the problem in my opinion is that it promotes an attitude toward and a style of investing that is n't objectively justifiable for practical reasons essentially i do n't think optimizing for making money and optimizing for having fun very well if investing is your chosen hobby rather than fishing or then motley fool can be fun with their tone and discussion forums but other people in forums are just going to make you go wrong money wise see behavioral finance research again talking to others is n't compatible with ice in your decision making also motley fool tends to make it sound like active investing is easier than it is there 's a reason the chartered financial analyst curriculum is a few reams of paper plus 4 years of work experience rather than reading blogs practical investing just buy the target date fund can be super easy but once you go beyond that it 's not i do n't really agree with the anyone can do it and it 's not work premise any more than i think that about or or computer programming after 15 years i 'm a programming expert after some courses and a lot of reading i 'm not someone who could professionally run an actively managed portfolio i think most of us need to have the fun part separate from the serious cash part maybe literally distinct accounts that you keep at separate brokerages or just do something else for fun besides investing morningstar has this problem too and and bloomberg i mean they are all interested in making you think about investing a lot more than you ought to they all have an incentive to convince you that the latest headlines make a difference when they do n't bottom line i do n't think personal finance changes very quickly the details of specific mutual funds change and there 's always some new twist in the tax code but the big picture is pretty stable i think going in depth say read the chartered financial analyst curriculum materials would teach you a lot more than reading blogs frequently the most important things to work on are income career and spending to maximize income minus spending that 's where time investment will pay off i know it 's annoying to argue the premise of the question rather than answering but i did try to mention a couple things to read somewhere in there

i think the part that you are n't seeing is that many people earning minimum wage are n't at the start of their careers where they do n't have a lot of financial commitments and are able to move fairly easily    if someone is earning that sort of wage but has rent to pay kids in school elders to take care of that minimum wage job can often be 1 of their two jobs they need to stay afloat taking time off one of the jobs to go study is simply not part of the equation    i do n't think what you were saying is false just a very thin subset in a range of possibilities potentially you ca n't peer outside that range to se that there are thousands of stories that do n't fit the bill

not a financial adviser but i think there is some amount of debt that 's ok   so i would n't suggest someone should go $ 200k into debt for a ba in english but if you went somewhat into debt say $ 30k for a major with good job prospects and a high salary it will probably be a good decision   which is exactly what i did and it worked out very well for me   i would advise students to apply to lots of schools with different entry requirements and tuition rates just to see what their financial aid packages are like   very often if a $ 50k a year school really wants you they 'll give you some scholarships to make it more affordable   if they do n't give you enough then you may just need to go to a cheaper school    edit also if your family is n't wealthy like mine you 'll often qualify for federal loans   my loans from 2012 are at 3.5 interest and my financial adviser is telling me to make the minimum payments so i can put more money in stocks

there 's a huge difference between can an person make a profit on the stock market and can an average person get rich off the stock market it is certainly possible for an average person to profit but of course you are unlikely to profit as much as the big wall street guys   an s&p 500 index fund for instance would be a pretty good way to profit   people with high powered tools may make a lot of money picking individual stocks and may even make some choices that help them when the market is down but it 's difficult to see how they could consistently make money over the long term without the s&p 500 also going up   the same applies to varying to various other index funds etfs and mutual funds i agree with littleadv that there is no single right thing for everyone to do   my personal take is that index funds are a good bet and i 've seen a lot of people take that view on personal finance blogs etc for whatever that 's worth   one advantage of index funds that track major indexes like the s&p 500 is that because they are and are perceived as macro indicators of the overall economic situation at least you 're in the same boat as many other people   on one level that means that if you lose money a lot of other investors are also losing money and when large numbers of people start losing money that makes governments take action etc to turn things around   on another level the s&p 500 is a lot of big companies if it goes down some of those big companies are losing value and they will use their big company resources to gain value and if they succeed the index goes up again and you benefit in other words index funds and large mutual funds etfs etc make investing less about what day trading focus on which is trying to make a hot choice for a large gain   they make it more about your wagon to an extremely large star that is powered by all the resources of extremely large companies so that when those companies increase their value you gain   the bigger the pool of people whose fortunes rise and fall with your own the more you become part of an investment portfolio that is i ca n't resist saying it too big to fail   that is n't to say that the s&p 500 ca n't lose value from time to time but rather that if it does go down big and hard and stay there you probably have bigger problems than losing money in the stock market e.g. the us economy is collapsing and you should begin stockpiling bullets and canned food

unfortunately the tax system in the u.s. is probably more complicated than it looks to you right now first you need to understand that there will be taxes withheld from your paycheck but the amount that they withhold is simply a guess   you might pay too much or too little tax during the year   after the year is over you 'll send in a tax return form that calculates the correct tax amount   if you have paid too little over the year you 'll have to send in the rest but if you 've paid too much you 'll get a refund   there are complicated formulas on how much tax the employer withholds from your paycheck but in general if you do n't have extra income elsewhere that you need to pay tax on you 'll probably be close to breaking even at tax time when you get your paycheck the first thing that will be taken off is fica also called social security medicare or the payroll tax   this is a fixed 7.65 that is taken off the gross salary   it is not refundable and is not affected by any allowances or deductions and does not come in to play at all on your tax return form there are optional employee benefits that you might need to pay a portion of if you are going to take advantage of them such as health insurance or retirement savings   some of these deductions are paid with before tax money and some are paid with after tax money the employer will calculate how much money they are supposed to withhold for federal and state taxes yes california has an income tax and the rest is yours at tax time the employer will give you a form w-2 which shows you the amount of your gross income after all the before tax deductions are taken out which is what you use to calculate your tax   the form also shows you how much tax you have paid during the year form 1040 is the tax return that you use to calculate your correct tax for the year   you start with the gross income amount from the w-2 and the first thing you do is add in any income that you did n't get a w-2 for such as interest or investment income and subtract any deductions that you might have that are not taxable but were not paid through your paycheck such as moving expenses student loan interest tuition etc   the result is called your adjusted gross income next you take off the deductions not covered in the above section property tax home mortgage interest charitable giving etc   you can either take the standard deduction $ 6,300 if you are single or if you have more deductions in this category than that you can itemize your deductions and declare the correct amount after that you subtract more for exemptions   you can claim yourself as an exemption unless you are considered a dependent of someone else and they are claiming you as a dependent   if you claim yourself you take off another $ 4,000 from your income what you are left with is your taxable income for the year   this is the amount you would use to calculate your tax based on the bracket table you found california has an income tax and just like the federal tax some state taxes will be deducted from your paycheck and you 'll need to fill out a state tax return form after the year is over to calculate the correct state tax and either request a refund or pay the remainder of the tax   i do n't have any experience with the california income tax but there are details on the rates on this page from the state of california

you are expecting that if you pay off a 30 mortgage after 16 years you should be charged the same amount of interest as someone who had a 16 year mortgage for the same amount and with the same interest rate this is n't correct and here 's why the person with the 16 year mortgage paid it off faster than you they paid more each month and the size of their loan shrunk faster than yours after 15 years they had paid off a lot more than you you paid a lump sum after 16 years but at this point the extra money which they had paid had been in the banks hands for a long time you caught up with them then but you had been behind them for all of the previous years on the other hand you owed the same amount in each of those years as the person who took out a 30 year mortgage and did n't prepay therefore you paid the same amount of interest as this person not the first person if you could arrange in advance a loan where you made the same payment as you did for 16 years then paid the balance in a lump sum then you would have paid exactly what you did

there is a very simple calculation that will answer the question is the expected roi of the 401 k including the match greater than the interest rate of your credit card some assumptions that do n't affect the calculation but do help illustrate the points you have 30 years until you can pull out the 401k. your credit card interest rate is 20 compounded annually   the minimum payoffs are being disregarded because that would legally just force a certain percentage to credit card you only have $ 1000   you can either pay off your credit card or invest but not both   for most people this is n't the case   ideally you would simply forego $ 1000 worth of spending and do both   worked example pay $ 1000 in credit card debt at 20 interest    after 1 year if you pay off that debt you no longer owe $ 1200   roi = 20 duh after 30 years you no longer owe and this is pretty amazing $   roi = in all cases the roi is guaranteed invest $ 1000 in matching 401k with expected roi of 5 2a for illustration purposes let 's assume no match after 1 year you have $ 1050 $ 1000 principal $ 0 match 5 interest but you ca n't take it out roi = 5 after 30 years you have $ roi of assuming away all risk 2b then we 'll assume a 50 match after 1 year you have $ $ 1000 principle $ 500 match 5 interest but you ca n't take it out roi = 57 but you are   stuck for a bit after 30 years you have $ roi of assuming away all risk 2c finally a full match after 1 year you have $ 2100 $ 1000 principle $ 1000 match 5 interest but you ca n't take it out roi = 110 but again you are stuck after 30 years you have $ roi of assuming away all risk here 's the summary the interest rate is really all that matters   paying off a credit card is a guaranteed investment    the only reason not to pay off a 20 credit card interest rate is if after taxes time etc you could earn more than 20 somewhere else    note that at 1 year the matching funds of a 401k in all cases where the match exceeded 20 beat the credit card if you could take that money before you could have paid off the credit card it would have been a good deal the problem with the 401k is that you ca n't realize that gain until you retire credit card debt on the other hand keeps growing until you pay it off as such paying off your credit card debt assuming its interest rate is greater than the stock market which trust me it almost always is is the better deal indeed with the exception of tax advantaged mortgages there is almost no debt that has an interest rate than is better than the market

a system comparing students to themselves a year ago is what i think would work best therefore you are graded based off the students you have not the grade you are in   this would mean if i was in 2nd grade and read at a 1st grade level then went to 3rd grade and read at a 4th grade level then the teacher would receive higher marks this would of course be averaged out throughout the class with outliers left off because some students always get a 's and some not so much    its not a perfect system but its better than saying that the only performance indicators are not touching children and keeping your job long enough to get tenure

technically the answer is no you ca n't put more money in to that isa in that tax year once you 've transferred it unless you 've transferred it to a stocks and shares isa faqs 7 and 8 from cover these cases q. i have transferred current year payments to my cash isa to a stocks    and shares isa can i make any further payments to a cash isa in this    tax year a. yes provided you have n't already used up your annual isa    investment allowance £ in the tax year 2013 14 when you transfer current year payments to your cash isa to a stocks    and shares isa it is as if that cash isa had never existed any money    you saved up to the date of transfer will be treated as if you had    invested that money directly in the stocks and shares isa for example if you had put £ 2,000 in a cash isa and then transferred    it to a stocks and shares isa you would be able to make further    payments totalling £ in that tax year you could either put all    of the £ in the stocks and shares isa or you could put up to    £ in a cash isa with the same or a different isa manager and    the remainder of the £ in the stocks and shares isa   q. how many isas can i have a. there are limits on the number of isa accounts you can subscribe to    each tax year you can only put money into one cash isa and one stocks    and shares isa but in different years you could choose to save with different    managers there are no limits on the number of different isas you can    hold over time however in practice if you transfer mid year from provider a to provider b provider b has no way of telling whether you have already put money in to the isa with provider a that year or not so you will be able to put more money in   i believe that isa providers do report their subscriptions back to hmrc so they can check for multiple subscriptions over the limit in one tax year but in the past i have done exactly what you describe and it has never been picked up in any way or caused any problem at all as long as you stick to total subscriptions within the limit i 'd guess you 're unlikely to encounter a problem of course i am not a financial advisor so you should take what i say with the same pinch of salt as you would take any other random advice from the internet

many countries have employers report their employees salaries and withhold some money for income tax purposes it 's called pay as you earn withholding taxes or taxing at the source often the system is designed in such a way that most people actually pay too much and can get money back at the end of the year in that case the salary you receive can certainly be considered a net salary depending on the tax system individuals might need to file a separate tax returns to report any other income investments rents whatever or benefit from tax incentives but it can also be optional if you live in such a country and your situation is simple enough that there are no applicable deductibles you might simply choose to forgo it and let your employer take care of everything

yes i have done this and did not feel a change in cash flow but i did n't do it a the age of 23   i did it at a time when it was comfortable to do so   i should have done it sooner and i strongly encourage you to do so    another consideration   is your companies program a good one   if it is not among the best at providing good funds with low fees then you should consider only putting 6 into your employer account to get the match   above that dollar amount start your own roth ira at the brokerage of your choice and invest the rest there   the fee difference can be considerable amounting to theoretically much higher returns over a long time period if you choose to do the max you would not want to max out before the end of the year   calculate your deferral very carefully to make sure you at least put in 6 deferral on every paycheck to the end of the year   otherwise you may miss out on your company match   it is wise to consider a roth but it is extremely tough to know if it will be good for you or not   it all depends on what kind of taxes payroll vat etc you pay now and what you will pay in the future   on the other hand the potential for tax free capital accumulation is very nice so it seems you should trend toward roth

can is fine and other answered that i 'd suggest that you consider the should does your employer offer a matched retirement account typically a 401(k are you depositing up to the match   do you have any higher interest short term debt credit cards car loan student loan etc   do you have 6 months worth of living expenses in liquid funds   one point i like to beat a dead horse over is this for most normal mortgages the extra you pay goes to principal but regardless of how much extra you pay the next payment is still due next month so it 's possible that you are feeling pretty good that for 5 years you pay so much that you have just 10 left on the 30 year loan but if you lose your job you still risk losing the house to foreclosure it 's not like you can ask the bank for that money back   if you are as disciplined as you sound put the extra money aside and only when you have well over the recommended 6 months then make those prepayments if you choose   to pull my comment to into my answer i avoided this aspect of the discussion but here i 'll suggest that a 4 mortgage costs 3 after tax in 25 bracket and i 'd bet cap gain rates will stay 15 for so with the break even return of 3.5 to return 3 after tax and dvy yielding 3.33 the questions becomes do you think the dvy top will be flat over the next 15 years any return over is profit that said the truly risk averse should heed the advise in original answer then pre pay update when asked in april 2012 the dvy i suggested as an example of an investment that beats the mortgage cost traded at $ 56 it 's now $ 83 and still yields to put numbers to this a lump sum $ 100 k would be worth $ k this does n't include dividends and giving off $ in dividends for an after tax $ we happened to have a good 4 years overall the time horizon 15 years makes the strategy low risk if one sticks to it

sometimes a business must keep track of overhead expenses that can be used to determine the rates they will bill their customers especially the government when determining the rates they are allowed to charge the government they have to include direct costs and indirect costs these indirect costs include allowable overhead and they can also include profit but the government limits the maximum profit any expenses have to come out of profit   expenses include costs of amusement diversions social activities and any directly associated costs such as tickets to shows or sports events meals lodging rentals transportation and are when they talk about meals and lodging being they are referring to those not needed to support the contract if the contract expects the contractor to travel they will generally provide a travel budget that is separate from the amounts used to determine the hourly rate the term slush fund has the connotation of being illegal or hidden slush funds are used to bribe officials or are leftover funds that were supposed to be spent and are now being hidden so that they can be misused at a later date

1 the risks are that you investing in financial markets and therefore should be prepared for volatility in the value of your holdings 2 you should only ever invest in financial markets with capital that you can reasonably afford to put aside and not touch for 5 10 years as an investor not a trader even then you should be prepared to write this capital off completely no one can offer you a guarantee of what will happen in the future only speculation from what has happened in the past 3 do n't invest it is simple keep your money in cash however this is not without its risks interest rates rarely keep up with inflation so the spending power of cash investments quickly diminishes in real terms over time so what to do extended your time horizon as you have mentioned to say 30 years reinvest all dividends as these have been proven to make up the bulk of long term returns and drip feed your money into these markets over time this will benefit you from what is known in as   dollar cost averaging and will negate the need for you to time the market

the most likely explanation is as you say that the letter was automatically generated a day or two before you met with your advisor assuming that your advisor is competent they will probably execute the instructions you gave them at the meeting the letter said you had ten days to change the investment and your advisor should be able to do it in that time to be on the safe side since people have been known to forget things i would call your advisor and tell them you got the letter and check they are going to do what you decided i would then follow it with a polite email just saying that you both decided at your meeting on such and such a date to go with the three month plan if that does n't happen you can point to the email as evidence do n't panic about this even though the bank says you are locked in to the decision if an advisor makes a mistakes these decisions are in fact reversible with the advisor paying any penalty

they said the expected returns from the stock market are around 7   emphasis added the key word in your quote is expected   on average the market gains in the 7 9 range more if you reinvest dividends but there 's a great deal of risk too meaning that in any given year the market could be down 20 or be   up 30 your student loan on the other hand is risk free   you are guaranteed to pay lose 4 a year in interest   you ca n't directly compare the expected return of a risk free asset with the expected return of a risky asset   you can compare the risks of two assets with equal expected returns and the expected returns of assets with equal risks but you ca n't directly compare returns of assets with different risks   so in two years you might be better off if you had invested the money versus paying the loan or you might be much worse off   in ten years your chances of coming out ahead are better but still not guaranteed what 's confusing is i 've heard that if you 're investing you should be investing in both stocks and bonds since i 'm young i would n't want to put much in bonds though so how would that factor in   bonds have lower risk uncertainty than stocks but lower expected returns   if you invest in both your overall risk is lower since sometimes not always the gain in stocks are offset by losses in bonds   so there is value in diversifying since you can get better expected returns from a diversified portfolio than from a single asset with a comparable amount of risk   however there it no risk free asset that will have a better return than what you 're paying in student loan interest

not sure if this is possible it is possible it is called a balance transfer card and most of the major credit card companies offer them it is possible to save a significant amount on interest during the grace period however is this a viable option not really any card will charge you an upfront fee of 3 to 5 of the balance you are transferring this really only buys you some time in case you are about to fall behind on payments for many people it 's just a way to shuffle around debt digging themselves a little deeper into consumer debt with each transfer

p e alone would not work very well see for example and in short p e is affected too much by cyclical changes in profit margins or you might say booms inflate the e beyond sustainable levels thus making the p e look more favorable than it is here 's a random blog post that points to schiller 's normalized earnings measure i think even price to sales is supposed to work better than p e for predicting 10-year returns on a broad index because it effectively normalizes the margins normalized valuation explains the variance in 10-year returns better than the variance in 1-year returns i think i 've read you ca n't rely on things reverting to mean in only 1 year another issue with p e is that e is more subject to weird accounting effects than for example revenues for example whether stock compensation is expensed or one time write offs are included or whatever can mean you end up with an economically strange earnings number btw a simple way to do what you describe here would be to put a chunk of money into funds that vary equity exposure for example john hussman 's fund has an elaborate model that he uses to decide when to hedge say you invest 40 bonds 40 stocks and 20 in hussman strategic growth when hussman fully hedges his fund you would effectively have 40 in stocks and when he fully it you would have 60 in stocks this is n't quite the whole story he also tries to pick up some gains through stock picking so when fully hedged the fund is n't quite equivalent to cash more like a market neutral fund for hussman funds in particular he 's considered stocks to be overvalued for most of the last 15 years and the fund is almost always fully hedged so you 'd want to be comfortable with that there are other funds out there doing similar stuff there are certainly funds that vary equity exposure though most not as dramatically as the hussman fund some possibilities might be pimco all asset all authority pimco multi asset perhaps or just some value oriented funds with willingness to deviate from benchmarks definitely read the prospectus on all these and research other options i just thought it would be helpful to mention a couple of specific examples if you wanted to stick to managing etfs yourself morningstar 's premium service has an interesting feature where they take the by hand bottom up analysis of all the stocks in an etf and use that to calculate an or under valuation ratio for the etf i do n't know if the morningstar bottom up stuff necessarily works i 'm sure they make the pro case on their site on the con side in the financial crisis bubble bursting they cut their valuation on many companies and they had a high valuation on a lot of the financials that blew up while i have n't run any stats and do n't have the data in several specific cases it looked like their bottom up analysis ended up assuming too high profit margins would continue broad brush normalized valuation measures avoided that mistake by ignoring the details of all the individual companies and assuming the whole index had to revert to mean if you 're rich i think you can hire gmo to do a varied equity exposure strategy for you   you could also look at the fundamental indexing etfs that weight by dividends or p e or other measures of value rather than by market cap the bottom line is there are lots of ways to do tactical asset allocation it seems complex enough that i 'm not sure it 's something you 'd want to manage yourself there are also a lot of managers doing this that i personally am not comfortable with because they do n't seem to have a discipline or method that they explain well enough or they do n't seem to do enough backtesting and math or they rely on macroeconomic forecasts that probably are n't reliable or whatever all of these tactical allocation strategies are flavors of active management i 'm most comfortable with active management when it has a fairly objective and logical discipline to it such as style value investing hussman 's statistical methods or whatever it is   many people will argue that all active management is bad and there 's no way to distinguish among any of it i am not in that camp but i do think a lot of active managers are bad and that it 's pretty hard to distinguish among them and i think active management is more likely to help with risk control than it is to help with beating the market still you should know and probably already do know but i 'll note for other readers that there 's a strong argument smart people make that you 're best off avoiding this whole line of tactical allocation thinking and just sticking to the pure cap based index funds

now to buy in full and essentially have zero savings buy in part £ 10000 deposit followed by a loan of £ 4000 or hp more of the value so you are assessing if the car is worth having with either none or only 4,000 in savings this is the most critical information you have provided    my outright opinion is to always buy a mildly used car as i hate the idea of loans and interest with the amount of money that you currently possess i believe the buy in part option is best as it reduces your interest liability but i do n't believe you should do it currently 4,000 is a rather small cash fund for if something were to go boom in the night    as for your question of interest this is completely dependent on the amount you are able to pay per period and the total interest you are willing to spend rows four and seven respectively this is your money and no one can tell you what 's best to do with it than yourself keep looking for good leasing deals or if you think you can survive financial strife with 4,000 then follow your heart depreciation fluctuates to the buyer so never assume what the car may lose in the next 2 3 years hope it all goes well my friend

consolidation makes sense if your friend has his act together and is n't going to run up more debt finding a lender will be tough i 'd suggest trying local credit unions making sure first that there has been no late or missed payments for 6 9 months you need to talk to a human at a local lender who will give you informal guidance about what you need to approve so you do n't end up getting lots of if its more than $ 10k it will be hard to get a loan like this from anyone in that case you need to focus on the smallest debts first because your friend 's cash flow is going to be by making payments to multiple creditors it 's critical to pay all creditors on time for at least the minimum amount due   the problem is once you start paying things down the creditors will start down credit limits when that happens you 're at greater risk for getting with fees and higher minimum payments which may be considered a universal default by other lenders   there is n't alot of detail here but depending on income and the amount of debt your friend should be prepared to file for chapter 13 bankruptcy

i 'm going to subtly and change the obvious advice there are three ways to deal with negative cashflow not two you 're currently studying for a degree you do n't say what country you 're in or how your studies are funded but most people in the us uk and a fair number of other countries run up debts while studying for a degree they do this because a degree is valuable to them they ca n't avoid it because the tuition alone costs more than most students can generate in income never mind their living expenses so by all means look for savings 1 clearly strangers on the internet ca n't just think up ways for you to spend less money without knowing anything about what you do spend money on but you can at least list your expenditures for yourself and see what 's necessary consider also how much fun you want your studies to be 4 years in a cold house to avoid paying for heating and never going out with friends to avoid spending on unnecessary stuff is all very well but with hindsight you 'll regret yourself if you 're ever well off enough to pay back whatever you would have borrowed to use for heating and fun only do 2 if it does n't affect your studies or if the money you 're paid justifies delaying the valuable asset you seek to acquire a degree leading perhaps to a better job but at least to the capacity to do a full time job rather than fitting work around your studies there are some jobs that are really good fits for students reasonably low hours that do n't clash with classes and some jobs that are terrible if these fail resort to 3 i do n't mean dishonest book keeping i mean accept that you are going to borrow money in order to pay for something of value that you can account as an asset work out now what you 'll need to borrow and how you think you can pay it back make sure the sum is worth it budget for that stick to your budget you 'll still have negative cashflow nothing changes there but your capital account looks fine personally i would n't actually put a monetary value on the degree i 'm not that bothered about the accounts and it 's really difficult to be accurate about it you can just consider it more than i expect to borrow and be done with it studying costs money once you 've graduated you probably are n't going to be back here saying i want to buy a house but i have no capital and i do n't want to go into debt are you although if you are the answer happens to be islamic mortgage i do n't know whether islamic banks have an equivalent answer for student debt since they ca n't own a share of your degree like they can a share of your home unless you 're a muslim presumably the ways that islamic finance avoids interest payments would not in any case satisfy your desire to be not in debt

unfortunately i missed most of segment and i did n't get to understand the why to begin with cramer is an and his business is pushing stocks if you put money into mutual funds which most 401k plans limit your investments to then you are not purchasing his product also many 401k plans have limited selections of funds and many of those funds are not good performers while his stock picking track record is much better than mine his is n't that great   he does point out that there are a lot of fees mostly hidden in 401k accounts if you read your company 's 5500 filing schedule a you can determine just how much your plan administrators are paying themselves if paying excessive fees is your concern then you should be rolling over your 401k into your ira when you quit or the employer match vests which ever is later   finally cramer thinks that most of his audience will max out their ira contributions and have only a little bit left for their 401k i 'm most definately not most people as i 'm maxing out both my 401k and ira contributions

real estate ownership does n't work the same way in china as it does in the west some significant difference i see    china does n't have property tax so empty apartments are treated as assets by individuals no tax liability   a lot of people buy home and not rent them out their purpose feels more like buying preferred stock ownership with expectation of neighborhood would prosper but no direct contribution to the neighborhood voting in the company local governments raise funds by developing landing into real estate   local government would old real estate for usually at some reasonable rate tho less equitable in some corrupt areas ownership is not permanent it is on paper 50 70 years depending on the place    not saying there are n't problems with this system just that signals that would cause us real estate to collapse might not do the same for china i do want to see someone run some social behavioral model about how those differences would play out    source my family owns 2 apartments in a 2nd tier chinese city

if i was an upside down homeowner and i went to my bank to refinance the mortgage at a lower rate and they declined i 'd give them the middle finger by not paying the mortgage and declaring bankruptcy     a homeowner has no incentive to continue paying a mortgage for a home that is no longer the value of the mortgage and if the bank is unwilling to work with the upside down homeowner to get the home owner a lower interest rate that is the least the bank could do then make the home the bank 's problem and let them eat their cake    this home owner is not asking the bank to forgive part of the mortgage or write it off but asking for his mortgage to be refinanced at the lower rate that is pretty straight forward and simple we as taxpayers bailed the banks out in 2008 the least they could do is help upside down homeowners the banks reluctance to help upside down homeowners is why we have a stagnant housing market    the bank by not working with this home owner to refinance his mortgage at a lower interest rate is a bank that indicates they do n't care about having a paying customer

it definitely depends on your risk appetite as joe taxpayer pointed out in his answer covered calls are a good choice for someone who already own 's the stock because the premium collected reduces the cost basis for the position the downside is that if the calls are exercised there is a good chance that you are missing out on additional upside in the stock price because the strike is obviously below the market value for the stocks   another good option trade is the spread option this would allow you to capture the difference between the two strikes of the options in the spread this is also one of the less risky choices because your initial cost an potential profit loss are known in advance of entering the position

the shareholders have a claim on the profits but they may prefer that claim to be exercised in ways other than dividend payments for example they may want the company to invest all of its profits in growth or they may want it to buy back shares to increase the value of the remaining shares especially since dividends are generally taxed as income while an increase in the share price is generally taxed as a capital gain and capital gains are often taxed at a lower rate than income

this effect has much empirical evidence as googling dividend price effect evidence will show as the financial economic schools of thought run the so do the theories   one school goes as far to call it a market inefficiency since the earning power thus the value of an equity that 's affected is no different or at least not riskier by the percentage of market capitalization paid most papers offer that by the efficient market hypothesis and arbitrage theory the value of an equity is known by the market at any point in time given by its price so if an equity pays a dividend the adjusted price would be efficient since the holder receives no excess of the price instantly before payment as after including the dividend since that dividend information was already discounted so would otherwise produce an arbitrage

not always you always consider economic factors in conjunction with each other rather than in isolation which leads to weird assumptions people spending is n't what you should look at always when inflation is high means government is spending government is spending on public projects creating employment increasing salaries out loans so you are putting money into the economy and into people 's hands everybody will be spending so it will also drive pull inflation but there are differences among economists regarding cost push inflation which is a dangerous phenomena at the same time the interest rates which are a monetary tool for central banks to the money flow in the economy are low under low interest rate conditions businesses take loans to invest in projects because interest rates are low people find it logical to spend now than spend later as interest rates are low there is an expectation that they can not earn more in savings than investing in products which will generate benefits in the near term these all goes on in cycles and after a period of inflation you will see government taking action to rein in inflation it will increase interest rates to suck money out of the economy this is when people will curb spending because they know they will earn a higher return while saving rather than investing

the way i 've implemented essentially value averaging is to keep a constant ratio between different investment types in my portfolio lets say in a simple example 25 cash 25 reit real estate 25 us stock 25 foreign stock lets say i deposit a set $ 1000 per month into this account if the stock portion goes up it will look like i need more cash reit so all of that $ 1000 goes into cash the reit portion to get them towards their 25 i may spend months investing only in cash the reit while the stock goes up of course if the stock goes down that $ 1000 per month goes into the stock accounts now you can also balance your account if you 'd like regularly selling stock or the reit and making the account balanced so if the stock goes down you 'd use the cash reit to purchase more stock if the stock went up you 'd sell the stock and buy reit leave more in cash

a stop loss order becomes a market order when a trade has occurred at or below the trigger price you set when creating the order this means that you could possibly end up selling some or all of your position at a price lower than your trigger price for relatively illiquid securities your order may be split into transactions with several buyers at different prices and you could see a significant drop in price between the first part of the order and the last few shares to mitigate this brokers also offer a stop limit order where you set not only a trigger price but also a minimum price that you are will to accept for your shares this reduces the risk of selling at rock bottom prices especially if you are selling a very large position however in the case of a flash crash where other sellers are driving the price below your limit that part of your order may never execute and you could end up being stuck with a whole lot of shares that are worth less than both your stop loss trigger and limit price for securities that are liquid and not very volatile either option is a pretty safe way to cut your losses for securities that are illiquid and/or very volatile a stop limit order will prevent you from cashing out at bottom dollar and giving away a bargain to lurkers hanging out at the bottom of the market but you may end up stuck with shares you do n't want for longer than originally planned it 's up to you to decide which kind of risk you prefer

yes there is a lot they are leaving out and i would be extremely skeptical of them because of the reasons they give for being able to charge $ 0 commissions their reasons are that they do n't have physical locations and high overhead costs the reality is that they are burning venture capital on exchange fees until they actually start charging everyone they suckered into opening accounts they also get paid by exchanges when users provide liquidity these are called trade rebates in the maker taker model they will start offering margin accounts and charging interest they are likely selling trade data to high frequency trading firms that then fill your stock trades at worse prices robinhood users are notorious for complaining about the fills they may well be able to keep commissions low as that has been a race to the bottom for a long time but if they were doing their users any actual favors then they would be also paying users the rebates that exchanges pay them for liquidity robinhood is n't doing anything unique as all brokers do what i mentioned along with charging commissions and it is actually amazing their sales pitch $ 0 commissions because we are just a mobile app lol was enough for their customers they are just being disingenuous

there is not a special rate for short term capital gains   only long term gains have a special rate   short term gains are taxed at your ordinary income rate see here   hence if you 're in the 25 bracket your short term gain would be taxed at 25   the ira withdrawal as you already mentioned would be taxed at 25 plus a 10 penalty for 35 total   thus the bite on the ira withdrawal is larger than that on a non ira withdrawal as for the estimated tax issue i do n't think there will be a significant difference there   the reason is that traditional ira withdrawals count as ordinary taxable income see here   this means that when you withdraw the funds from your ira you will increase your income   if that increase pushes you too far beyond what your withholding is accounting for then you owe estimated tax   in other words whether you get the money by selling stocks in a taxable account or by withdrawing them from an ira you still increase your taxable income and thus potentially expose yourself to the estimated tax obligation in fact there may be a difference   as you note you will pay tax at the capital gains rate on gains from selling in a taxable account   but if you sell the stocks inside the ira and withdraw that is ordinary income   however since ordinary income is taxed at a higher rate than long term capital gains you will potentially pay more tax on the ira withdrawal since it will be taxed at the higher rate if your gains are long term rather than short term   this is doubly true if you withdraw early incurring the extra 10 penalty   see this question for some more discussion of this issue in addition i think you may be somewhat misunderstanding the nature of estimated tax   the irs will not ask you for a quarterly estimated tax when you sell stock   the irs does not monitor your activity and send you a bill each quarter   they may indeed check whether your reported income with info they received from your bank etc but they 'll still do that regardless of whether you got that income by selling in a taxable account or withdrawing money from an ira because both of those increase your taxable income quarterly estimated tax is not an extra tax it is just you paying your normal income tax over the course of the year instead of all at once   if your withholdings will not cover enough of your tax liability you must figure that out yourself and pay the estimated tax see here if you do n't do so you may be assessed a penalty   it does n't matter how you got the money if your taxable income is too high relative to your withheld tax then you have to pay the estimated tax   typically tax will be withheld from your ira distribution but if it 's not withheld you 'll still owe it as estimated tax

that 's true about but that 's not the problem with tv advertising the problem is   if you 've ever listened to talk radio sometimes the host gets really quiet and almost and then he lights up and begins yelling and shouting   yet during this time you do n't need to adjust your radio 's volume the sound from the radio studio has been very heavily compressed so that the quiet and loud parts are all the same volume   if you the crap out of your commercial 's sound and then normalize it to 95 of the peak of the tv show 's sound which is typically not nearly as compressed then your commercial is going to be perceived as vastly louder than the tv show even though it never exceeds 95 of the tv show 's peak volume   thus a law referencing the average volume is thought to be more effective than one that simply requires   it still seems easy to work around though just have 29 seconds of silence and 1 second of horrendously loud house waking marketing slime   what they need to do is require that neither the average nor the peak db level of the commercial may exceed the average db level of the show   there might be cute little tricks that can get around that too but at some point the ad agency has to actually talk and sell their product rather than performing mathematical on the audio just to wake everyone up

the short answer is with limited credit your best bet might be an fha loan for first time buyers   they only require 3.5 down if i recall the number right and you can qualify for their loan programs with a credit score as low as 580 the problem is that even if you were to add new credit lines such as signing up for new credit cards etc they still take time to have a positive effect on your credit   first your score takes a bit of a hit with each new hard inquiry by a prospective creditor then your score will dip slightly when a new credit account is first added while your credit score will improve somewhat within a few months of adding new credit and you begin to show payment history on those accounts your average age of accounts needs to be two years or older for the best effect assuming you 're making all of the payments on time a good happy medium is to have between 7 and 10 credit lines on your credit history and to make sure it 's a mix of account types such as store cards installment loans and credit cards to show that you can handle various types of credit be careful not to add too much credit because it affects your debt to income ratio and that will have a negative effect on your ability to obtain mortgage financing i really suggest that you look at some of the sites which offer free credit scores because some of them provide great advice and tips on how to achieve what you 're trying to do   they also offer credit score which can help you understand how your score might change if for instance you add new credit cards pay off existing cards or take on installment loans   it 's well worth checking out i hope this helps   good luck

volume is really only valuable when compared to some other volume either from a historical value or from some other stock   the article you linked to does n't provide specific numbers for you to evaluate whether volume is high or low many people simply look at the charts and use a gut feel for whether a day 's volume is high or low in their estimation typically if a day 's volume is not significantly taller than the usual volume you would n't call it high the same goes for low volume if you want a more quantitative approach a simple approach would be to use the normal distribution statistics calculate the mean volume and the standard deviation anything outside of 1.5 to 2.0 standard deviations either high or low could be significant in your analysis you 'll need to pick your own numbers 1.5 or 2.0 are just numbers i pulled out of thin air it 's hard to read anything specific into volume since for every seller there 's a buyer and each has their reasons for doing so the article you link to has some good examples of using volume as a basis for strengthening conclusions drawn using other factors

no there is no incentive for the card issuer to permanently loan you money for free even though they make a small amount of money with every transaction yes there are many credit cards that offer introductory 0 apr often lasting for a year some even two years in theory you could keep applying for new cards with these terms and continually transfer the balance to the new card though you would probably incur a fee for doing so

remember that risk should correlate with returns in an investment this means that the more risk you take on the more return you should be receiving in an efficient marketplace that 's why putting your money in a savings account might earn you < 1 interest right now but putting money in the stock market averages returns over time you should be very careful not to use the word interest when you mean returns in your post you are calling capital gains the increase in value of owned property interest this may be in your head the level of risk associated with property ownership in the case of the bank they are not in the business of home construction rather than take that risk themselves they would rather finance many projects being done by construction companies that know the business the bank has a high degree of certainty of getting its money back because its mortgages are protected by the value of the property   part of the benefit of an efficient marketplace is that risk gets bought by individuals who want it this means that people with a low risk tolerance such as banks people on fixed incomes seniors etc can avoid risk and people with a high risk tolerance stock investors young people with high income etc can take on that risk for higher average returns the bank 's reasoning should remind you of the risk associated with property ownership increases in value are not a sure thing if you do not understand the risk of your investment you can not be certain that you are being well compensated for that risk note also that most countries place regulations on their banks that limit the amount of their funds that can be placed in higher risk asset classes typically this something along the lines of if someone places a deposit with your bank you can only invest that deposit in a low risk debt based asset ie you can take money deposited by customer a and use it to finance a mortgage for customer b this is done in an attempt to prevent collapse of the financial sector if risky investments start failing

there are good reasons to not go the cash route here see jay 's answer if one insists however at 30 k€ anti money laundering regulations have to be considered and are not mentioned by the existing answers so far depositing amounts larger than 10 k€ will trigger questions about the source of the money to fight tax evasion and organized crime splitting the amount may still trigger the process so prepare good proof concerning the origin of that money and a paper trail that shows it is legal money and that it has been taxed already   i.e. the latest anti money laundering directive is supposed to be implemented by national laws thus including spain the european union fourth anti money laundering directive is the most sweeping aml legislation in europe in several years on 25 june 2015 the eu fourth directive was enacted which replaces the previous third directive with a two year window for implementation all eu member states must be compliant with the new mandates by 26 june 2017 source

perhaps you can track your vat amounts in a liability account   using a tax liability account is a common thing in accounting to do this when you receive money split the transaction such that your actual revenue which you will keep after vat remittance goes into an asset account and the amount you will eventually have to pay back to the state goes into a liability account   later when you pay the vat back to the state your transaction will effectively pay back the liability with one end of your double entry decreasing the funds in your checking account and the other end decreasing the funds in your tax liability account having said that i 've found that there are many shortcomings in the cash flow report and i 'm not sure that using a tax liability account which i think is the right thing to do will necessarily solve this problem for you

there are two solutions one is financially better the other is psychologically better   financially better you should pay off loans in the order of interest rate so the 9 first then the six percent then the 3 4 if you pay back $ 1000 the first one saves you $ 90 a year in interest the second saves you $ 60 the third $ a year every year until everything is paid back   psychologically better some people have psychological problems paying back debt and it is better for them to pay back small loans first if you feel better having two loans instead of three and feeling better makes you able to save money and pay back the other loans while having three loans would make you depressed and unable to make savings pay back the smaller loan   if you do n't have that kind of problem use the financially better method

trying to time the market is usually a bad idea people who do this every day for a living have a hard time doing that and i 'm guessing you do n't have that kind of time and knowledge   so that leaves you with your first and third options commonly called lump sum and dollar cost averaging respectively    which one to use depends on where your preferences lie on the risk reward dollar cost averaging dca has lower risk and lower reward than lump sum investing in my opinion i do n't like it dca only works better than lump sum investing if the price drops but if you think the price is going to drop why are you buying the stock in the first place example your uncle wins the lottery and gives you $ 50,000 do you buy $ 50,000 worth of apple now or do you buy $ 10,000 now and $ 10,000 a quarter for the next four quarters if the stock goes up you will make more with lump than you will with dca if the stock goes down you will lose more with ls than you will with dca if the stock goes up then down you will lose more with dca than you will with ls if the stock goes down then up you will make more with dca than you will with ls so it 's a trade off but like i said the whole point of you buying the stock is that you think it 's going to go up which is especially true with an index fund so why pick the strategy that performs worse in that scenario

other answers here cover some of the basics but this is also a great time to start establishing a credit history and developing good financial habits to carry throughout your life in addition to opening a free checking account with the local credit union establish an overdraft line of credit on that account never close this account or this line of credit as it will work to increase the average age of your accounts when you apply for credit later in life if you are disciplined with your use of credit cards you may also want to apply for a low limit credit card through the same credit union for the same purpose as above never carry a balance on this card but make minor purchases with it each month never more than 20 of the balance maybe just buy gas with it start tracking all of your spending and make a monthly budget there are a lot of online tools that make this very easy establishing the habit now will help you make informed financial decisions in the future open a roth ira and put at least 10 of your money away for retirement in the future your income may increase enough to put you in the 25 tax bracket if that ever happens open a regular ira and put the money there instead also when you have employers that offer 401k matching do the same thing with a roth 401k account keep your money invested in a low cost index fund

millionaires    no offense but you 're talking out of your ass     my mother lives in a house that my parents bought in the 1980s   she 's definitely not a millionaire   nowhere close   but she owns the house free amp clear and can afford the taxes   i bought my house from a retired lady for about 5x what she paid for it in the   maybe more   i do n't recall but she was the original owner   definitely not a millionaire   just a retired widow   most of the folks who own these 1950s to 1980s homes in good areas are beneficiaries of good locations and lack of development     the reason those homes are so valuable is because we 're not building new housing in anything resembling the scale needed   we need something like 40,000 new units built annually in los angeles and orange counties to catch up to the population growth and lack of new construction happening now   it ai n't gon na happen but that 's what we need     in 20 years i 'll benefit from prop 13   it flows   and it benefits property owners   it encourages property ownership     if you wanted to argue that property taxes on commercial properties should be different from residential properties i 'd be up for the debate   it 's an interesting topic and i do n't know the answer but it would result in wholesale reduction in commercial property values in the state because of the reduced cash flow from higher taxes   huge and a massive transfer of wealth from commercial property owners to the taxpayers

when you buy a bond you 're giving a loan to the issuer the interest rate on the bond is the interest rate on the loan usually and this is also the case with the treasury bonds the rate is fixed for the term of the loan thus if the market rate for similar loans a year later is higher the rate for the loan you gave remains the same

there are five main drivers to real estate returns income cash flow from rental payments depreciation as an expense that can be used to reduce taxes equity the gradual paydown of the mortgage the increases underlying equity in the property appreciation any increase in the overall value of the property leverage the impact of debt financing on the deal increasing the effective cash on cash return asset has a detailed walk through of the components and a useful comparison to stocks so interest rates are certainly a component as they increase the expenses but they are just one factor depending on a particular market 's conditions appreciation or rent increases could offset or exceed any increase in the interest expense my own experience is mostly with non listed reits including reg a+ investments like the ones from and commercial and for right now in both cases there 's plenty of capital chasing yield to go around and in fact competition among new funding sources like reg d and reg a+ platforms seems to be driving down borrowing rates as platforms compete both for borrowers and for investors personally i pay more attention to where each local market and the broader national market is along the real estate cycle spoiler the last trough was 2008 dividend capital puts out a quarterly report that 's super useful

i do n't know if all these facts can be attributed to nafta but it is hard to escape the feeling that trade agreements hurt us workers   i have no doubt that a companies bottom line benefits from free trade and that consumers get access to cheaper but the well being of the nation as a whole is not necessarily the same as the financial well being of corporations or lower prices for junk   free trade agreements without a doubt have hurt average workers   whenever economics is discussed it is important to keep in mind that the most economists are valuing these kinds of deals in ways that do n't make sense to the average person   no one for instance can place a value on the person who lost their or how that impacts their family and community   i understand those kinds of social costs can not be measured

that is a loaded question but i 'll give it a shot   first things first you need to determine if you are ready to invest in stocks   if you have a lot of high interest debt you would be much better served paying that off before investing in stocks   stocks return around in the long run so you 'd be better off paying off any debt you have that is higher than most people get their start investing in stocks through mutual funds in their 401k or a roth ira   if you want to invest in individual stocks instead of mutual funds then you will need to do a lot of reading and learning you will need a brokerage account or if you have a stock in mind they might have a dividend reinvestment plan drip that you could invest in directly with the company you will have to compare the different brokerage firms to determine which is best for you   since you seem to be internet savvy i suggest you use a discount brokerage that let 's you buy stocks online with cheaper commissions   a good rule of thumb is to keep commissions below 1 of the amount invested once you have your online brokerage account open with money in there the process of actually buying the stock is fairly straightforward   just place an order for the amount of shares you want   that order can be a market order which means the purchase will occur at the current market price   or you can use a limit order where you control at what price your purchase will occur there are lots of good books out there for beginners   personally i learned from the motley fool and last but not least is to have fun with it   learn as much as you can and welcome to the club

i worked in the service industry for over 10 years and this came up every now and again   mostly in hypothetical situations    i 'm not a tax expert but my general understanding is that it is viewed as income by the irs if you performed a service of any kind in exchange for the money   in other words if you waited on the table and they left you a gift for doing so it is taxable    you 'll probably also find that if you pool tips with other employees or have to tip out the bartenders cooks or dishwashers they 'll generally agree with the irs that you clearly received a tip and want their fair share while the concept of gifting money to others in a situation like this is intriguing especially in the service industry it really does n't meet the definition of a gift in the eyes of the irs for it to truly be a gift the person would have had to intend to gift you the money even if they had n't come into your restaurant at all that night   that clearly is not the case here

what are you talking about the rules are regulations are setup as needed if you give a concrete e.g. maybe if you give a concrete example of where the govt is in the way i can understand rules and regulations are not examples of govt in the way in itself it would be if say you need to do something but you need to petition the govt first for something and there 's tons of bureaucracy or or something else govt just set the rules such as stop at red light etc   govt is not in the way here    the rest of your comments are on same line so this one bullet is enough again you 're just accusing generally with no specifics and i 'm not naive this is real and my opinion govt sets new rules as needed as a response to something not because people in the govt who change every few years feel so you 're talking about changing people in govt all adhering to the same laws because it makes sense to keep it and if not it gets repealed govt is not one same set of people always present from your birth to death govt keeps changing govt does care about fairness and hft 's existing is proof that govt lets free market and private business start things as it pleases till such time as it stops being fair for all    govt is not really an inhibitor to free market govt actually has no to free market because it allows a fair and balanced free market unlike what you 're referring to which is a free market with no rules like the wild wild west we had that free market before and over time people went from unregulated markets to more regulated markets because it is for our own good govt is just people who agreed with it joined the govt and made it so and others agreed if we do n't agree in future it can be changed    there is a term as regulated free market unregulated free market will lead to salesmen and generally a backwards movement to the wild west again   i do n't think you really want to talk you just want to spew your ignorant libertarian viewpoints because you 've heard them somewhere without thinking much about it you just blindly believe the govt is always wrong with no logic or justification just like religious people    just think on a few points and you will see that you are wrong sometimes is the govt perfect heck no is it always right nope but it is some times and it does do the right things many times it does the wrong things at times as well    but i do n't believe like you do at all because i think for myself and reason if you reason on a few points you 'll see the other viewpoint and stop reading or ron paul because they 're not right about govt being always wrong either    i wo n't bother replying to you anymore because you 're just a troll or arrogant smug guy who thinks he knows it all because your friends all think like you and blindly agree with you so you 've never been taken to reason or logic like others have to you on this board look at the other replies to your posts almost all contradict you just think why are they all wrong or perhaps you are

i actually just did that with my chase freedom card they rotate categories every 3 months and from april june it was 5 back at grocery stores   so i bought a ton of gas cards and got my 5 back   next i figured out i would be clever and buy a ton of store gift cards grocery gift cards right at the end of the quarter then use those in the future to purchase gas cards   well i just tried that a couple days ago and discovered the store refuses to sell a gift card if you 're paying with a gift card   so now i 'm stuck with $ 1,000 in grocery cards until i use them in actual grocery purchases haha one of the things about this grocery store is they partner with a gas station on their rewards program   they offer 10 cents off a gallon with every $ 100 spent in store and they double it to 20 cents off a gallon if you buy $ 100 in gift cards   then on the back of the receipt is a coupon for 10 cents off per gallon which they double on   unfortunately i think i 'm one of the only people that takes this much advantage of the program   side note i actually just changed the billing cycle of my chase freedom card to end on the 24th of the month   that way i can charge a bunch of rewards in the final 6 7 days of the quarter   and if i have a $ 0 balance on the 24th my bill is n't due for 7 weeks interest free   and chase freedom has never cared if you purchase gift cards with their quarterly rewards program   i also gave them a courtesy email giving the specific store and $ $ $ amount that was going to be charged and of course they still called me with a fraud alert

you quote a rate 2.75 and then quote a margin 1.75   the margin is usually an addition to some base rate   how is the margin expressed in the figures you have   is it included in the rate or in addition to it as for the other stuff it looks like the rate can go up at most 1 per year up to a maximum of 5 increase   the first adjustment cap is also 1   that just says that your first rate increase is capped the same as subsequent increases if the margin is already included and the increases are based on your initial rate then this puts you at a maximum of 7.75 you must verify this   i do n't have your loan documents and again why would you want to risk an increase at all   you have a decent fixed rate mortgage already   that still does n't make sense to me   going from 2.75 to 7.75 as above can increase your monthly payment by over 40

do n't know how it is in the us but here in montreal something like 95 of customers pay by cards where the tip amount is extremely traceable so you end up declaring everything you make    waiters want to keep working for tips because that 's how they make good money and it 's a direct correlation of effort and reward you make your money on volume more than individual tip amounts you 're better off taking 2 tables and receiving a regular tip than taking a single one providing amazing service and get a great tip    so when it 's quiet you do n't make much but you did n't work too hard    if you 're getting destroyed from 5 pm to 1 am short staffed you work like a fucking slave but you know you 're making bank    tips is nothing else than a sales commission that is disclosed to the customer and which they can choose to adjust based on their experience

your question is a bit odd in that you are mixing long term fundamental analysis signals which are generally meant to work on longer time frames with medium term trading where these fundamental signals are mostly irrelevant   generally you would buy and hold on a fundamental signal and ride the short term fluctuations if you believe you have done good analysis if you would like to trade on the 2 6 month time scale you would need a signal that works on that sort of time scale   some people believe that technical analysis can give you those kind of signals but there are many many many different technical signals and how you would trade using them is highly dependent on which one you believe works some people do mix fundamental and technical signals but that can be very complicated   learning a good amount about technical analysis could get you started   i will note though that studies of non professionals continuously show that the more frequently people trade the more on they underperform on average in the long term when compared with people that buy and hold an aside on technical analysis michael 's comment is generally correct though not well explained   say bob found a technical signal that works and he believes that a stock that costs $ 10 dollars should be $ 11   he buys it and makes money two months later when the rest of the market figures out the right price is $ 11 and he sells at that price   this works a bunch of times and he now publishes how the signal works on stack exchange to show everyone how awesome he is   next time bob 's signal finds a different stock at $ 10 that should be $ 11 but anna just wrote a computer program that checks that signal bob published faster than he ever could   the computer program buys as much as it can in milliseconds until the price is $ 11   bob goes to buy but now it is too late the price is already $ 11 and he ca n't make any money eventually people learn to anticipate adjust for this signal and even anna 's algorithms do n't even work anymore and the hunt for new signals starts again

usually the most significant risk scenarios here are third parties can abuse your routing account numbers to initiate debits but this is a type of fraud that is easily traced it can happen but it is more likely that it would be a scenario where you were specifically targeted vs. the victim of some random fraud defending against someone who is specifically going after you is very difficult especially if you do n't know about it your ssn is nt used for the bank transfer you are providing it so that the entity making the payments can report on payments to you for tax purposes if you are truly worried about this type of scenario i suggest setting up a dedicated savings account for the purpose of receiving these payments and then sweeping either manually or automatically the funds into another account most stock brokers will allow you to automate this and most banks will let you do this manually

if you owned a bank how would you invest the bank 's money   typically banks are involved in loaning out money to businesses people and government at a higher interest rate then what they are paying to depositors   this is the spread and how they make money if the bank determines that the yields on government bonds is more attractive then loaning the money out to businesses and people then the bank will purchase government bonds   it can also decide the other way   in this manner the mortgage and bond markets are always competing for capital and tend to offer very similar yields certain banks have the unique privilege of being able to borrow money from the fed at the federal funds rate and use this money to purchase government debt or loan it out to other banks or purchase other debt products in this manner you see a high correlation between the fed funds rate mortgage rates and treasury yields     other political factors include legislation that encourages mortgage lending see community reinvestment act where banks may not have made the loans without said legislation in short keep your eye on the fed and ask yourself does the fed want rates to rise and can the us government afford rising rates   the answer to these two questions is no   however the fed may be pressured to stop the presses if inflation becomes unwieldy and the fed actually starts to care about food and energy prices   so far this has n't been the case

thanks for the advice i will look into index funds    the only reason i was interested in this stock in particular is that i used to work for the company and always kept an eye on the stock price i saw that their stock prices recently went down by quite a bit but i feel like i 've seen this happen to them a few times over the past few years and i think they have a strong catalogue of products coming out soon that will cause their stock to rise over the next few years    after not being able to really understand the steps needed to purchase it though i think i 've learned that i really do n't know enough about the stock system in general to make any kind of informed decisions about it and should probably stick to something lower risk or at least do some research before making any ill informed decisions

over time you 'll have more loans maybe a few store cards mortgage car loan etc   i 'm a fan of maximizing one 's wealth and the small rebate reward adds up over time so i 'm not against the store cards so long as you always pay the bill in full   as far as fico is concerned what they like to see may not necessarily be optimum for you i 'd suggest you go about your business and over time use the few cards that combine to give to the best benefit combination that works for you

the general rule is to spend as little as possible on transportation as it is an expense many people can get by without a car at all but you say you can not so what you need is the cheapest car that is sufficiently reliable for your needs i suggest you do not need three cars you do n't need to loan cars to your children if they need a car they can get a job and buy one or borrow your reliable vehicle if but only if you are not using it i would suggest then selling two of your vehicles and holding on to one for your daily commute pick the car you judge to be the most reliable however not all decisions are made purely rationally my vehicle is a 2012 subaru forester awd is very nice in my climate but i could have picked up a second hand vehicle for a lot less money similarly you may choose to hold on to a second or even a third vehicle because you judge it a reasonable use of your money it 's an unnecessary expense but so is coffee and you can have my coffee when you it from my cold dead fingers more generally there 's a rule of 28/36 roughly speaking that says that a household should spend a maximum of 28 of its gross income on housing expenses mortage heating etc etc and no more than 36 on total debt the aforementioned housing plus also car loans credit cards and other loan repayments if you are spending significantly more than that it 's time to seriously consider selling one or two of your cars plus cutting back elsewhere if you are significantly below that the fact that you may be underwater on your home may be a far less pressing matter

i 'm a woman in her early 30s who has a bachelors degree and a job   i rent an apartment own my car and spend within my means because that 's what i was taught   when my sister and now ex bro in law decided to buy a house in the middle of the bubble despite having no saved money and a child on the way i shook my head at them   they responded with real estate only goes up it 's an i laughed and told them they were fucking stupid to pay $ 350,000 for an older 2 bedroom house in phoenix az that was severely overpriced but they said well it 's 0 down and the interest rate is like nothing   cut to now the same house is worth maybe $ 110,000 but ya know that great interest rate they got at the beginning was n't so great when they had to refi so they did n't want to pay their payments for a $ 110,000 house with a $ 350,000 loan so they stopped paying their mortgage   nothing really happened except some letters were sent and was told that the only way to get a better interest rate was to have to miss a certain number of payments maybe 6 months in order to qualify for the loan the obama admin had created   at some point that year she decided to get a job tuck and and her and her husband felt the need to purchase all kinds of new things   she eventually did qualify for that government help and was totally forgiven for the 6 8 months of payments they missed so clearly purposely missing payments would have been considered very smart by those same analysts who called what american airlines did as very smart     so i sit here with my morals in tact and they sit there like a million other people in this country having their cake and eating it too so i have to wonder what the fuck was i the stupid one for not following the rest of the asshole idiot sheep and screwing all the people with what i would have thought were basic morals   it appears so

paying for a good home inspection from a person you choose   mine was $ 500 and the guy gave me a nice print out with a bunch of little problems that i knew had to be fixed   it was easy to determine my fix up cost which was separate from my i want to change this cost   he was working for me not the agents or the seller so i felt more trusting of his advice if you end up shopping hard and looking seriously at several houses you might end up paying this more than once a bad report would be a good contingency for cancelling your offer

you do n't necessarily change your calculated profit margins and posted prices but you advertise and offer price matching   two out of three consumers may still pay the posted best buy price while the knowledgeable third consumer that did their research will receive the matched price   their profit on that third customer will be lower than it was for the other two but currently they do n't get anything from that third customer at all since they just order online   meanwhile now that they 're in the store they may buy a few movies or a power strip

another thing that insurance companies try to do with these types of vehicles is to promote the cash value of the policy the longer you participate in the policy the more your cash value goes up assuming the investments perform reasonably well the selling point is that at any time you can take out part of that cash value without impacting your insurance policy a lot of people see that benefit as being the same as either putting the money in the bank or investing it when actually they could do better if they did either of those things themselves one true advantage of the whole term policy is that if you should fall on hard times and are not able to work the premium payments can be taken out of the cash value that way even if you ca n't make the monthly payments the insurance policy basically pays for itself i actually experienced this myself many years ago after i lost my job and had some health issues i was out of work a long time but my life insurance never lapsed that in itself made it worthwhile for me

a major reason that i can think of is financial security most people have reoccurring costs such as housing car medical expenses if you were to put all you money into dept and live from check to check than you could be increasing risk of financial loss think about what would happen if one were to default on their mortgage risk management plays a huge role in personal finance and a way of preventing financial loss is to have enough money in an accessible place to pay reoccurring costs in the event that ones situation changes unexpectedly

there are a lot of things that go into your credit score but the following steps are core to building it now in your case you obviously have some flexibility in your monthly budget since you 're considering paying down your college loan faster   you have to weigh whether it would be better to pay off the loan that much faster or just save the money towards buying the car   if you can pile up enough cash to buy the car and still leave yourself an emergency fund it would be better to buy the car than add another interest payment   as other answers have noted you do n't want to get in a situation where you have no cash for unexpected events some links of interest

this is why i hate any article talking about luck and success   it gives people an excuse as to why they are n't successful in life i 'm not lucky and a way to shit on anyone that is successful something reddit loves   see if you throw enough mud at a wall eventually some of it will stick and if 20,000 people start a business then most will fail but some will succeed and some will go through the roof   this does n't really work   if you keep doing the same stupid things over and over you most likely will not succeed   however if you fail learn from the failure and try again over and over you most likely will succeed at some point   this is n't because of luck   i 've worked with a lot of people in business and the reason most fail is because they give up or are just not experienced enough to know the correct path   i suppose i should be glad that the majority of people are lazy it just means less competition for me   the business acumen of the directors is sometimes capable of making a business more successful than it otherwise would be but mostly it 's down to luck   if it really was luck anyone could sit there do nothing and success would come upon them   this never happens   every decision in life that you make involves some sort of chance or luck but it 's not nearly as much as what you would like us to believe

very wealthy people usually have an investment manager who is constantly moving money between investments and accounts they hold cash or cash equivalent accounts for use in a near term buying opportunity for example if they believe certain stocks will go down in price soon this amount can vary from under 1 for a money manager with no intention of any short term trading to over 20 for a market pessimist who expects a huge price reduction shortly   in rare cases they will also hold significant cash because of a planned large purchase but there 's almost never a reason for that to exceed 1 of their net worth

uber would have been a better company if they just started up the world 's largest payday loans business it would actually be cheaper to operate by a substantial margin and they could run their business legitimately instead of and illegally on most locations   when i looked at uber i laughed so hard it actually made my stomach hurt a guy i knew he was it i used simply maths to show he was making 4 cents a by the time running costs were accounted for and many uber drivers will be operating at an actual loss   at least a payday loan has no hidden costs associated with it and you do n't have to spend days raising the small amount of cash you need to get through the month   uber must be the most dishonest business of the planet right now and its employees lol are the dumbest fucks on the planet

this is an excellent topic as it impacts so many in so many different ways here are some thoughts on how the accounts are used which is almost as important as the as calculating the income or tax the roth is the best bang for the buck once you have taken full advantage of employer matched 401k.   yes you pay taxes upfront   all income earned is n't taxed under current tax rules   this money can be passed on to family and can continue forever   contributions can be funded past age 70.5   once account is active for over 5 years contributions can be withdrawn and used ie house down payment college medical bills without any penalties   all income earned must be left in the account to avoid penalties   for younger workers without an employer match this is idea given the income tax savings over the longer term and they are most likely in the lowest tax bracket the 401k is great for retirement which is made better if employer matches contributions   this is like getting paid for retirement saving   these funds are locked up until age 59.5 with exceptions   all contributed funds and all earnings are untaxed until withdrawn the idea here is that at the time contributions are added you are at a higher tax rate then when you expect to withdrawn funds trade accounts investments as stated before are the used of taxed dollars   the biggest advantage of these are the liquidity

now if i 'm not mistaken tracking a value weighted index is extremely easy just buy the shares in the exact amount they are in the index and wait yes in theory in practise this is difficult most funds that track s&p do it on sample basis this is to maintain the fund size although i do n't have know the exact number if one wants to replicate the 500 stocks in the same one would need close to billion in fund size as funds are not this large there are various strategies adopted including sampling of companies i.e. do n't buy all select a set of companies that mimic the s&p behaviour etc all these strategies result in tracking errors there are algorithms to reduce this the only time you would need to rebalance your holdings is when there is a change in the index i.e. a company is dropped and a new one is added right so essentially rebalance is done to if so why do passive etfs require frequent rebalancing and generally lose to their benchmark index lets take an index with just 3 companies with below price the total market cap is 1000   the minimum required to mimic this index is 200 or multiples of 200 if so you are fine     more often funds ca n't be this large for example approx 100 funds track the s&p index together they hold around 8 10 of market cap few large funds like etc may hold around 2 but most of the 100 + s&p funds hold something in 0.1 to 0.5 range so lets say a fund only has 100 to maintain same proportion it has to buy shares in fraction but it can only buy shares in whole numbers this would then force the fund manager to allocate out of proportion some may remain cash etc as you can see below illustrative there is a tracking error the fund is not truly able to mimic the index   now lets say after 1st april the share price moved now this would mean more tracking error if no action is taken block 2 and less tracking error if one share of company b is sold and one share of company c is purchased   again the above is a very simplified view tracking error computation is involved mathematics   now that we have the basic concepts more often funds tracking s&p thus they need to rebalance

well what s the source of income from   social security   dividends   at 40k that 's the good thing about a progressive tax you would n't be taxed heavily   even 40k of capital gains which lets be honest is mostly high income individuals is barely taxed at a higher level than that from a fixed income source again that 's the gain aka profit one is receiving from selling shares of a company

i 'm not 100 certain on boats since they are n't typically sold for a gain but the tax base of an asset is typically the cost of the asset plus the cost of any improvements so your $ 15,000 gain looks right check with a cpa to be certain though if you can   your cost basis would be $ 50,000 + $ 25,000 = $ 75,000 and your net gain would be $ 90,000 $ 75,000 = $ 15,000   the result is the same but the arithmetic is organized a little differently i am fairly confident you can not include your time in the cost of improvements   if you incorporated and paid yourself for the time then the payment would be considered income and taxed if it was even allowed depending on your tax bracket that may be a worse option for you you can look at it this way you only pay the tax on the $ 15k gain versus paying someone else $ 15k to do the labor
