no   and furthermore canceling based on insider information is not considered insider trading sec interpretation from october of 2000 a does the act of terminating a plan while aware of material nonpublic information result in liability under section and rule no section and rule apply in connection with the purchase or sale of any security thus a purchase or sale of a security must be present for liability to attach see blue chip stamps v. manor drug stores u.s. 1975 link mine a 2 is a rule in the sec 's section in federal law that governs trading on material nonpublic information fried 2002 even concluded that the sec 's safe permitting insiders to buy or sell shares pursuant to trading plans while in possession of material nonpublic information and to cancel the plans while aware of material nonpublic information enables insiders to profit from their access to such information   the sec could easily eliminate insider 's advantages over public shareholders by not allowing insiders to cancel their plans after becoming aware of material nonpublic information

401(k does n't have a return rate because 401(k is not a type of investment it is a vehicle for investment with certain tax treatments just like your money that 's not in a 401(k you can invest it in either the bank a cd stocks mutual funds bonds etc you can similarly depending on the options given to you by your 401(k plan invest the money in the 401(k in a cash account buy stocks mutual funds etc your return is dependent on how you invest your money not whether it 's in a 401(k or not whether it 's in a roth or traditional 401(k simply affects when and how it gets taxed it is true that most 401(k plans offer little variety in types of investments you can choose however this is not a big deal as chances are that in a few years you will leave your company at which point you are able to rollover the 401(k into an ira at which point you will have many many options for how to invest it to make a valid comparison you should be comparing the same type of investment in both cases that means you should assume the same return for both the money outside the 401(k and the money inside the 401(k and only consider the taxes and penalties if you plan to withdraw early

apparently it 's based on either the address of the seller or vendor or your shipping address from the blog post destination and origin based sales tax a few states have laws that are origin based where products that are shipped to the customer are taxed based on the location of the business itself as of this writing these states are most states use destination based sales tax which defines the source of the transaction to be the destination at which the product will eventually be used or the address to which the product is shipped the following states and districts operate on a destination based model at the time of this writing the page do i charge sales tax or not from about.com seems to somewhat clarify that if the business is located in a state or other jurisdiction with an origin based sales tax then they will charge you the sales tax for their state and presumably not the sales tax for the state of the shipping address

some of the factors that will act on house prices are there will likely be a recession in that country which will lower incomes and probably lower housing prices it will likely be harder to get credit in that country so that too will increase demand and depress demand for housing cf the usa in 2010 if greece leaves the euro that will possibly depress future economic growth through decreased trade and investment and possibly decreased transfer payments eventually the budget will need to come back into balanced which also is likely to push down house prices in some european countries most famously spain there 's been a lot of speculative building which is likely to hang over the market both countries have governance and mandate problems and who knows how long or how much turmoil it will take to sort that out some of these factors may already be priced in and perhaps prices are already near what will turn out to be the low in the euro zone you have the nearly unprecedented situation of the countries being very strongly tied into another currency so the typical exchange rate movements that played out in argentina can not act here   a lot will depend on whether the countries are bailed out or leave the euro and if so how etc   typically inflation has been a knock on effect of the exchange rate moves so it 's hard to see if that will happen in greece looking back from buying in southern europe in 2011 may turn out to be a good investment   but i do n't think you could reasonably call it a safe defensive investment

you have several issues at work if in the next few years you have a leak in the roof that causes another insurance claim they may decide not to cover it because they already paid you to replace the roof and it is your fault that it was n't that might also mean they do n't pay you for the stuff that is damaged because of the new leak if you minimize the claim that may make it less likely that they will drop you in the future or increase you rate next year but if you do n't return the excess funds they will evaluate you on the larger claim size of course if they are sending the money directly to the repair company they will only pay the bill up to a maximum amount usually the issue has been that the repair company wants to do a larger repair the dispute resolves around some aspect of the building code i had a car repair that had to be increased because the roof damage was within x inches of the windshield so the windshield had to be replaced the insurance company eventually agreed but it slowed down the process for a couple of days because they wanted to measure it it is possible that the insurance company has rules related to the age of the roof and the amount of damage that triggers a total replacement
# 407759
you have just answered your question in the last sentence of your question   more volume just means more people are interested in the stock i.e supply and demand are matched well if the stock is illiquid there is more chance of the spread and slippage being larger even if the spread is small to start with once a trade has been transacted if no new buyers and sellers enter the market near the last transacted price then you could get a large spread occurring between the bid and ask prices here is an example has a 50 day moving average volume of only 1200 share traded per day obviously it does not trade every day   as you can see there is already an 86 spread from the bid price if a new bid price is entered to match and take out the offer price at $ then this spread would instantly increase to from the bid price
# 402112
a smaller spread indicates a flat yield curve which means banks and investors are uncertain about future economic conditions like the current environment    when the spread widens and the curve becomes upward sloping considered a normal yield curve investors expect future growth and minimal inflation longer term rates increase as investors demand a higher yield in return for lending their money for a longer period of time increase demand for credit industries expanding also drive up longer term rates    a negative spread indicates an inverted yield curve and investors believe the economy is overheating and interest rates will fall investors pull money out of the stock market and into long term bonds raising the price lowering the yield while companies stop borrowing reducing the demand for credit and lower the cost or interest rate on a loan    keep in mind central banks determine short term rates so inverted curves are rare in the sense the market perceives uncertainty and rushes to safety bonds before the central bank reacts and lowers short term rates

using a simple investment calculator to get a sense of scale here to have 70k total including the 500 a month invested after ten years you just need returns of 2   to earn 70k on top of the money invested you would need returns over 20   to do that in five years you would need over 50 annual return that is quite a big difference   annualized returns of 20 would require high risk and a very large amount of time invested skill and luck   2 returns can be nearly guaranteed without much effort i would encourage you to think about your money more if you get very unlucky with investments and do n't make any money will you not go on the vacations even if your income allows   that does n't make a lot of sense   as always spend all your money with the current and future in mind   investment return euros are no different from any other euros at that point the advice is the same for all investors try to get as much return as possible for the risk you are comfortable with   you seem to have a high tolerance for risk   generally for investors with a high risk tolerance a broadly diversified portfolio of stocks with maybe a small amount of bonds other investments will give the most return over the long term for the risk taken after that generally the next most useful way to boost your returns is to try to avoid taxes which is why we talk about 401(k)s so much around here   each european country has different tax law but please ask questions here about your own country as well as you mention could use more ex us questions

here 's how capital gains are totaled long and short term capital gains and losses are either long term or    short term it depends on how long the taxpayer holds the property if    the taxpayer holds it for one year or less the gain or loss is    short term net capital gain   if a taxpayer ’s long term gains are more than their    long term losses the difference between the two is a net long term    capital gain if the net long term capital gain is more than the net    short term capital loss the taxpayer has a net capital gain so your net long term gains from all investments through all brokers are offset by any net short term loss   short term gains are taxed separately at a higher rate i 'm trying to avoid realizing a long term capital gain but at the same time trade the stock if you close in the next year one of two things will happen either the stock will go down and you 'll have short term gains on the short or the stock will go up and you 'll have short term losses on the short that will offset the gains on the stock   so i don;t see how it reduces your tax liability   at best it defers it

the true answer is it depends because   it is up to the credit card issuer to follow the right path when issuing a replacement credit card typically issuers will transfer the account history to the new trade line says barry the consumer operations manager at fico the creator of the fico scoring formula the new account should have the old open date so you should retain your payment history he says the credit limit and balance should also stay the same how issuers report replacement cards we asked the major card issuers how they report replacement cards to credit reporting agencies american express the new card has the same open date and member since year as the previous card the balance on the old account number is transferred to the new account number all payment history transfers over bank of america all transactions and account history are transferred to the new account number when there is a card replacement or renewal capital one the new account number with all the original account data original open date etc is reported along with a notification to the bureaus that the new account number is replacing the old   the two can then be into one so that all the applicable payment history balance etc is now under the new account number chase the original does not change the history on the account remains just the account number field is updated with the new account number there is no new in this scenario

if you are intent on becoming a quant i concur with most of the opinions in this thread you will need a graduate degree because it is a relatively small field and it is densely populated with people who have graduate degrees specializing more closely in the field than engineering will ever touch upon   however do n't give up searching for killer work opportunities like the kind you are currently getting if you maintain an excellent gpa in combination with these work placements you can easily secure a spot in a top degree program you are placed in an comparable program meaning you will possess a top notch understanding of math and have demonstrated experience in business    if you plan to search for work in canada after graduation i would highly recommend getting your graduate degree from university of toronto while it is often a poorly regarded undergraduate finance school when employers are looking for soft skills and queens slaughter undergrads for job placements absolutely no one disputes that university of toronto students have a top notch grasp of theory and it is commonly regarded from what i have heard at least as one of the toughest schools   at u of t there are two degrees that might fit for your field the and index mfe it would probably be prudent to call around or tap people in the industry in nyc or toronto to let you know which is preferable or a best fit i sense the but my opinion is next to worthless here    if you are interested in working in nyc and have the money for a graduate degree in the states without putting yourself under a mountain of debt get educated there your program directors will know the street better than those in toronto most likely gave excellent advice though i would add one thing know that doing this work in canada and the us are very different propositions especially for the sell side you probably know this but look no further than places like wso or colleagues at internships for horror stories related to hours conditions perks pay etc at american banks these days i have friends that have worked 55 hours straight in their offices if you consider that a point of pride go crazy otherwise be wary

it is not necessarily proportional 401k are all unique per the plan and how they are set up it is impossible to find any two exactly alike you should have separate buckets of the money types pre tax after tax roth employer contribution etc if the plan is good you may have a source specific withdraw option which allows you to take only roth or pretax at your choosing they should track the growth of each bucket separately it does indeed appear complicated but just think of it as different buckets of cash store in the same vault most people end up rolling over the 401k into an ira when they retire for flexibility to get out from under the plan rules when you do this you will create a roth ira and a traditional ira then you can pick and choose when you want to take what type of money

first of all one thing that is very important match is always better than no match   so you should definitely use that match on your hsa if you 've already maxed out the company match on your 401(k   in fact for most people there wo n't be much reason to invest in your 401(k above the company match at all if for example your company matches only up to 5 and you want to invest 15 of income into retirement you ought to open an ira instead roth or standard depending on your situation and put the extra 10 in there beyond that you 're right hsa 's the accounts themselves have all the benefits of a 401(k   i would n't invest there for retirement instead an ira though   there is just no reason the only built in downside of an hsa is the hdhp attachment which may be undesirable to some employees or in certain situations if you want to get down to raw dollar figures and your company is offering both a standard health plan and a the calculation will be dependent on the premiums and benefits of each and your projected costs of your health care which is always a crystal ball estimation anyway   those costs and benefits can vary wildly from a completely obvious choice on either the hdhp or standard plan or pretty much a wash where you decide based on your comfort level with a high deductible to illustrate standard plan your company might offer a standard plan that costs you $ 100 out of pocket for an individual   that means you pay a minimum of $ 1200 a year for health care   most plans will have copays a flat amount like $ 15 you pay for standard doctor consultations a deductible you pay 100 of fees up to this co pays do n't count a percentage you pay beyond the deductible 20 is typical and a maximum like $ 1000 per individual per year beyond this up to a lifetime maximum benefit of like $ 2 million you wo n't be charged anything in a standard plan where you have no expenses you might pay $ 1200 a year plus a couple co pays for a total of $   in a bad year with surgery you might max out so $ 1200 + $ 30 + $ 1000 = $ hdhp hsa these plans are very different   you might still pay a premium i.e. $ 30 a month   they will still have a deductible and maximum but they might be the same amount   you will probably not have copays i did n't when i had one but i could be wrong which means a standard doctor visit will cost more like $ 80 100 in a good year this will mean that you pocket $ 500 from your company but pay back $ 360 in premiums   a couple doctor visits would mean there 's only $ 300 left in your account at the end of the year   but that 's still a net cost of only $ 60 compared to $   big win in a bad year you would end up out of pocket the max say $ 2000 plus premiums minus the $ 500 for a total of $ 1860   in this case still better than the standard plan the important difference will come in an in between year   you will reach the max quicker on an hdhp than you will on a standard plan   with a family where all of these numbers are higher and you have more people to be getting sick injured this might make the standard plan a better benefit however since whatever you build up in an hsa account stays with you forever while you 're single and have only your own health to be concerned about that is probably a good choice   when you have a family things might change and you switch to a standard plan but you still have that war chest to offset copays and hospital visits in future years i was forced onto an hsa for 2 years with a smaller company   they had a really good contribution $ 2500 if i remember right and we saved up big time later when my wife was pregnant we were on a low deductible standard plan and paid all our fees out of the hsa   it worked out great i say as long as the averaged yearly expected costs make sense after doing calculations illustrated above go for it

there 's really no general rule of thumb there are a lot of factors that go into that decision    it highly depends on the type of business your financials and business strategy    it 's a double edged sword because retained earnings lose the potential to provide a higher return while being cash poor can easily kill a company   it sounds like you 're experiencing significant growth if there is high market potential and expansion prospects a safe bet is to keep about 3 months of operating costs accessible while leveraging a bank loan to fund the growth   that 's the best answer i can provide without having any information

this is yet another in a long series of stop whining the economy is fine articles   it 's a lie   the economy is not fine    there are good points in the article and it is important to not be misled by bad statistics but he works hard to pretend that there are not problems in places where those problems are evident in the statistics    he claims that falling labor force participation rate is because the statistics do n't adjust to an increasing percentage of retirees but everyone i know talks about the 25 54 statistics in which retirement is negligible   when you compare those to overall numbers it shows big problems in the 25 54 numbers and that people over 54 are working more and longer than they used to not retiring sooner an indication that they ca n't afford retirement   he claims stagnation in median household income is misleading   because of a 5 drop in hours worked which is completely bogus given the scale of the difference we 're talking about   then he the disconnect between productivity and median wages by claiming that it 's inappropriate to compare an average with a median despite the fact that that 's exactly what inequality is

disclaimer i am not canadian and have no experience with their laws and regulations there really are n't any safe short term investment options at the moment with interest rates being close to zero so just put the money aside you will need for the car and the computer maybe on a callable savings account to make at least a few dollars do not take out any loans it is very unlikely you will earn more than the cost of the loan you did n't say how much will be left but unfortunately it really is not much to go on anyway considering that you seem to have enough income to cover your expenses you could transfer the rest to your rrsp invest and just forget about it i suggest to follow this rule of thumb the growth portion of your portfolio which for you means equities should be directly related to the number of years you wo n't need to touch these funds 1 year 0 equity 2 years 10 3 years 20 and so on what 's not in equities you could put in short term bonds meaning an average duration of about 3 years needless to say single stocks bonds are out of question ideally you can find 2 etfs one for stocks and one for bonds respectively however if there is any possibility you did not mention that you could suddenly depend on this money you have to keep your equity exposure and thus your potential earnings low just a humble thought i really do n't know your specific situation my apologies if i 'm out of line often disability means that you are not capable of doing one particular thing anymore i.e. work physically just maybe you would still be capable to do some other type of work maybe even from the comfort of your home that would allow you to generate a certain income and also keep you busy   i hope this helps good luck

as far as i read in many articles all earnings capital gains and    dividends from canadian stocks will be always tax free right    there 's no withholding tax ie a $ 100 dividend means you get $ 100   there 's no withholding for capital gains in shares for anybody   you will still have to pay taxes on the amounts but that 's only due at tax time and it could be very minor or even a refund for eligible canadian dividends   that 's because the company has already paid tax on those dividends in contrast holding u.s. or any foreign stock that yields dividends    in a tfsa will pay 15 withholding tax and it is not recoverable correct but the 15 is a special rate for regular shares and you need to fill out a w8-ben   your broker will probably make sure you have every few years but if you hold the same stock in a non registered account this 15    withholding tax can be used as a foreign tax credit is this true or    not or what are the considerations that 's true but reduces your canadian tax payable it 's not refundable so you have to have some tax to subtract it from another consideration is foreign dividends are included 100 in income no mater what the character is   that means you pay tax at your highest rate always if not held in a tax sheltered account canadian dividends that are in a non registered account will pay    taxes i presume and i do n't know how much but the amount can be used    also as a tax credit or are unrecoverable what happens in order to take into account taxes paid by the company is i read also that if you do n't want to pay withholding taxes from foreign > dividends you can hold your stock in a rrsp or   you do n't have any withholding taxes from us entities to what they consider canadian retirement accounts   so tfsas and resps are n't covered note that it has to be a us fund like spy or vti that trades in the us and the account has to be rrsp   you ca n't buy a canadian listed etf that holds us stocks and get the same treatment   this is also only for the us not foreign like europe or asia also something like vt total world in the us will have withholding taxes from foreign europe asia mostly before the money gets to the us   you ca n't get that back just an mention for the uk there 's no withholding taxes for anybody and i hear it 's on sale but at some point if i withdraw the money who do i need to pay taxes > u.s. or canada canada

when purchasing a condo in a university town it is almost guaranteed that the prices will be inflated as a result   this is because you are competing not only with single home primary residence homeowners but also with a multitude of investment buyers and landlords who want to purchase a rental property   universities are popular rental markets due to their stability there will always be students looking for a place to live and as a result the areas attract investors more than other markets this can work in your favor however   if you do n't mind sharing your residence with other students and you do n't mind the part time work that being a landlord requires you can live much cheaper and even make money over the next few years as your roommates pay your bills   owning a primary residence rental property also brings a lot of tax benefits because you can claim expenses and depreciation against your income   this could benefit your father who could be a co owner and would certainly benefit from the write offs against his higher tax bracket the real trick that makes or breaks the experience is finding mature responsible roommates who will cause the minimum amount of headache   if this part of the equation is missing it can lead to distractions from school and even legal worries when you have to think about things like unpaid rent and/or

you need to do a bit more research and as @littleadv often wisely advises consult a professional in this case a tax layer or cpa you are not allowed to just pull money out of a property and write off the interest   from deducting mortgage interest faqs if you own rental property and borrow against it to buy a home the    interest does not qualify as mortgage interest because the loan is not    secured by the home itself interest paid on that loan ca n't be    deducted as a rental expense either because the funds were not used    for the rental property the interest expense is actually considered    personal interest which is no longer deductible this is not exactly your situation of course but it illustrates the restriction that will apply to you   elsewhere in the article it references how if used for a business the interest deduction still will not apply to the rental but to the business via schedule c.   in your case it 's worse you can never deduct interest used to fund a tax free bond or to invest in such a tax favored product   putting the facts aside i often use the line do n't let the tax tail wag the investing dog borrowing in order to reduce taxes is rarely a wise move if you look at the interest on the 90 k vs 290 k you 'll see you are paying in effect on the extra 200 k due the higher rate on the entire sum elsewhere on this board there are members who would say that given the choice to invest or pay off a 4 mortgage paying it off is guaranteed and the wiser thing to do i think there 's a fine line and might not be so quick to pay that loan off an after tax 3 cost of borrowing is barely higher than inflation but to borrow at over 5 to invest in an annuity product whose terms you did n't disclose does seem right to me borrow to invest in the next property that 's another story

i do n't like your strategy   do n't wait   open an investment account today with a low cost providers and put those funds into a low cost investment that represents as much of the market as you can find i am going to start by assuming you are a really smart person   with that assumption i am going to assume you can see details and trends and read into the lines   as a computer programmer i am going to assume you are pretty task oriented and that you look for optimal solutions now i am going to ask you to step back   you are clearly very good at managing your money but i believe you are over thinking your opportunity reading your question you need a starting place and some managed expectations so here is your plan now that you have a personal retirement account ira roth ira and perhaps a 401(k or equivalent at work you can start to select which investments go into that account   i know that was your question but things you said in your question made me wonder if you had all of that clear in your head the key point here is do n't wait   you wo n't be able to time the market certainly not consistently   get in now and stay in   you adjust your investments based on your risk tolerance as you age and you adjust your investments based on your wealth and needs   but get in now    over the course of 40 years you are likely to be working sometimes the market will be up and sometimes the market will be down but keep buying in   because every day you are in you money can grow and over 40 years the chances that you will grow substantially is pretty high   no need to wait start growing today things i did n't discuss but are important to you

if you are investing for 10 years then you just keep buying at whatever price the fund is at this is called dollar cost averaging if the fund is declining in value from when you first bought it then when you buy more the average price you bought in at is now lower so therefore your losses are lower and when it goes back up you will make more even if it continues to decline in value then you keep adding more money in periodically eventually your position will be so large that on the first uptick you will have a huge percent gain anyway this is only suggested because you are in it for 10 years other people 's investment goals vary

basically what you describe exists in many countries not in the usa though in europe people have checking accounts with allowed overdraft typically three month net salaries you can just this money any day as you like and pay it back completely or partially any day as you like interest is calculated for each day on the amount used that day and the collateral is future income predicted expected from previous income in the usa credit cards have taken its place with stricter different rules and limitations in addition many of the extra rules in loans were invented to take advantage of the ignorance or situation of the borrower to make even more money for example applying extra payments to future due payments instead of to the principal makes that principal produce more interest while the extra payments just sit around

this often occurs because of misrepresentation of the corporation income most of the income in the us is payed at or a little below the 35 rate but when the figure is calculated non us income is counted alongside us income   for some reason in the us it makes sense for corporations to pay income taxes in the countries they actually made the income in and the us mind you only usa and have this sort of backwards thinking   so yeah if they make $ 100 worldwide income out of which $ 50 is us income and the company reports $ 15 in us taxes they get represented as paying 15 effective tax rate when in reality they payed 30 on us taxes for their us income

tl dr version   what you propose to do might not save you taxes and may well be illegal since you mention your wife i assume that the inherited ira has been inherited from someone other than your spouse your mother maybe who passed away in fall 2015 as mentioned in your other question cf the comment by ben miller above if so you must take at least the required minimum distribution rmd from the inherited ira each year and pay   taxes on the distribution what the rmd is depends on how old the owner of the ira was when the owner passed away but in most cases it works out to be the rmd for you the beneficiary considered   to be a single person see publication 590b available on the irs web site for details so have you taken the at least the rmd amount for 2016 from this inherited ira if not you will owe a 50 penalty of the difference    between the amount withdrawn and the rmd amount no it is not a typo    the penalty it is called an excise tax is indeed 50 assuming that the total amount that you have taken as   a distribution from the inherited ira during 2016 is the   rmd for 2016 plus possibly some extra amount $ x then that amount is included in your taxable income for that year   you can not rollover any part of the total amount distributed into   your own ira and thereby avoid taxation on the money note that it does not matter whether you will be rolling over the money into an existing ira in your name or will be establishing a new rollover ira account in your name with the money the prohibition applies to both ways of handling the matter if you wish you can roll over up to $ x the amount over and above the rmd into a new inherited ira account titled exactly the same as the existing inherited ira account with a different custodian if you choose to do so then the amount that you roll over into the new inherited ira account will not included in your taxable income for 2016 to my mind there is no point to doing such a rollover unless you are unhappy with the current custodian of your inherited ira but the option is included for completeness note that the rmd amount can not be rolled over in this fashion only the excess over the rmd if you do n't really need to spend the money distributed from your inherited ira for your household expenses your opening statement that your income for 2016 is low might make this unlikely and i you and/or your spouse received compensation earned income such as wages salary self employment income commissions for sales nontaxable combat pay for us military personnel etc in 2016 and ii you were not 70.5 years of age by december 2016   then you and your wife can make   contributions to existing iras in your names   or establish new iras in your names   the amount that can be contributed for each ira is limited to the smaller of $ 5500 $ 6500 for people over 50 and that person 's compensation for 2016 but if a joint tax return is filed for 2016 then both can make contributions to their iras as long as the sum of the amounts contributed to the iras does not exceed   the total compensation reported on the joint return   the deadline for making such ira contributions is the due date for your 2016 federal income tax return since your income for 2016 is less than $ 98 k you can deduct the entire ira contribution even if you or your wife are covered by an employer plan such as a 401(k plan   thus your taxable income will be reduced by the ira contributions up to a maximum of $ 11 k or $ 12 k or $ 13 k depending on ages and this can offset the increase in taxable income due to the   distribution from the inherited ira       since money is fungible is n't this last bullet point achieving the same result as rolling over the entire $ 9.6 k including the rmd into an ira in your name the very thing that the first bullet point above says can not be done the answer is that it really is n't the same result and differs from what you wanted to do in several different ways first the $ 9.6 k is being put into iras for two different people   you and your wife and not just you alone should there god forbid be an end to the marriage that part of your inheritance is gone second you might not even be entitled to make contributions to iras no compensation or over 70.5 years old in 2016 which would make the whole thing moot third the amount that can be contributed to an ira is limited to $ for each person while this does not affect the present case if the distribution had been $ 15 k instead of $ 9.6 k   not all of that money could be contributed to iras for you and your wife finally the contribution to a traditional ira might be non deductible for income tax purposes because the adjusted gross income is too high   once again not an issue for you for 2016 but something to keep in mind for future years in contrast rollovers from one ira into another ira both titled the same can be in any amount and they can be done at any time regardless of whether there is compensation for that year or not or what the adjusted gross income is or whether there is coverage by a 401(k plan there are no   tax consequences to rollovers unless the rollover is from a traditional ira to a roth ira in which case the distribution is included in taxable   income for that year   what is prohibited is taking the entire amount of the $ 9.6 k distribution from an inherited ira and rolling it over   into your existing ira or establishing a rollover ira in your name with that $ 9.6 k ditto for some money going into your ira and some into your wife 's ira i expect that any ira custodian will   likely refuse to allow you to carry out such a rollover transaction but will be glad to accept 2016 contributions in amounts of up to $ from you into existing iras or open a new ira for you the custodian will not ask whether you have compensation for 2016 or not but will check your age it is your responsibility to ensure that you do not contribute more than the compensation etc incidentally subject to the $ maximum limit you can if you choose to do so contribute the entire amount of your compensation to an ira not just the take home pay amount which will be smaller than your compensation because of withholding for social security and medicare tax state and federal income tax etc

i suppose it depends on how liquid you need and if you 're willing to put forth any risk whatsoever   the stock market can be dangerous but there are strategies out there that will allow you to insure yourself against significant loss while likely earning you a decent return   you can buy and sell options along with stocks so that if the stock drops your loss is limited and if it goes up or even stays where it 's at you make money a lot more than 1 annually of course there 's risk of loss but if you plan ahead you can cap that risk wherever you want maybe 5 maybe 10 whatever suits your needs   and as far as liquidity goes it should be no more than a week or so to close your positions and get your money if you really need it but even so i would only recommend this after putting aside at least a few thousand in a cash account for emergencies

it depends on the vesting schedule and the likelihood you 'll be there long enough to get any vesting a typical 6 year schedule gets you 20 after 2 years you already know you 'll be there 1 year so now you need to decide if you 'll last 2 years unless you know for sure you wo n't last 2 years you should take the match on the 4 suppose your retirement plan earns 10 if you leave before 2 years compared with your 18 you 're only behind by 8 return but if you last 2 years you 'd be making a 32 return on that same amount after 3 years you 'd make 54 and up it goes from there until you hit a 120 return after 6 years i 'd take the match simply because you have a lot more to gain than you have to lose if you leave early

any publicly traded financial instrument can be sold short in theory   there are however many regulations associated with short sales of us equities that may prevent certain stocks from being sold short at certain times or through certain brokers some examples the most basic requirement this is n't a regulation it 's just the definition of a short sale is that you or your broker must have access to someone willing to loan you his her shares   if you are interested in shorting a security with few shares outstanding or low trade volume there may simply not be enough people in the world willing to loan you theirs   alternatively there may be a shareholder willing to loan shares but your broker may not have a relationship with the clearing house that shareholder is using   a larger better different broker might be able to help threshold securities list since 2005 each day certain securities are not allowed to be sold short based on their recent history of liquidity   basically if a certain number of transactions in a security have not been correctly settled over the past few days then the sec has reason to believe that short sales which require extra transactions are at higher risk of falling through circuit breaker a.k.a alternative uptick since 2011 during certain market conditions exchanges are now required to reject short sales for certain securities in order to prevent market crashes market abuse

as joetaxpayer has commented the markets are littered with the of those who buy into the idea that markets submit readily to formal analysis    financial markets are amongst the most complex systems we know of   to borrow a concept from mathematics that of a chaotic system one might say that financial markets are a chaotic system comprised of a structure of chaotic for example the unpredictable behaviour of a single big market participant can have dramatic effects on overall market behaviour in my experience becoming a successful investor requires a considerable amount of time and commitment and has a steep learning curve   your actions in abandoning your graduate studies hint that you are perhaps lacking in commitment most people believe that they are special and that investing will be easy money   if you are currently entertaining such thoughts then you would be well advised to forget them immediately and prepare to show some humility tl dr it is currently considered that behavioural psychology is a valuable tool in understanding investors behaviour as well as overall market trends   also in the area of psychology confirmation bias is another aspect of trading that it is important to keep in mind   quantitative analysis is a mathematical tool that is currently used by hedge funds and the big investment banks however these methods require considerable resources and given the   performance of hedge funds in the last few years it does not appear to be worth the investment if you are serious in wanting to make the necessary commitments then here are a few ideas on where to start there are certain technical details that you will need to understand in order to quantify the risks you are taking beyond simple buying and holding financial instruments   for example how option strategies can be used limit your risk how margin requirements may force your hand in volatile markets how different markets impact on one another e.g. the relationship between bond markets and equity markets and a host of other issues   also to repeat it is important to understand how your own psychology can impact on your investment decisions

it may seem weird but interest rates are set by a market risk is a very large component of the price that a saver will accept to deposit their money in a bank but not the only one essentially you are lending deposited cash to the bank that you put it in and they will lend it out at a certain risk to themselves and a certain risk to you by diversifying who they lend to corporations home buyers each other etc the banks mitigate a lot of the risk but lending to the bank is still a risky endeavour for the saver and the saver accepts a given interest rate for the amount of risk there is in having the money in that particular bank the bank is also unable to diversify away all possible risk but tries to do the best job it can if a bank is seen to take bigger risks and therefore be in greater risk of failing having a run on deposits it must have a higher interest rates on deposits compared to a lower risk bank savers therefore shop around for the best interest rate for a given level of risk which sets the viable interest rate for that bank any higher and the bank would not make a profit on the money that it lends out and so would not be viable as a business any lower and savers would not deposit their money as the risk would be too high for the reward hence competition or lack of it will set the rate as a trade off between risk and return note that governments are also customers of the banking industry when they are issuing fixed income securities bonds and a good deal of the lending done by any bank is to various governments so the price that they borrow money at is a key determinant of what interest rate the bank can afford to give and are part of the competitive banking industry whether they want to be or not since governments in most countries provide insurance for deposits the basic level of perceived risk for all of the banks in any given country is about the same that these banks lend to each other on an incredibly regular basis look into the overnight or repo money market if you want to see exactly how much the rates that these banks pay to and receive from each other are governed by interbank lending rates called libor and and are even more complicated than this answer simply compounds this effect because it makes all of the banks reliant on each other and therefore they help each other to stay liquid to some extent note that i have n't mentioned currency at all so far but this market in every country applies over a number of currencies the way that this occurs is due to arbitrage if i can put foreign money into a bank in a country at a rate that is higher than the rate in its native country after exchange costs and exchange rate risk i will convert all of my money to that currency and take the higher interest rate for an ordinary individual 's savings that is not really possible but remember that the large multinational banks can do exactly the same thing with billions of dollars of deposits and effectively get free money this means that either the bank 's interest rate will fall to a risk adjusted level or the exchange rate will move either of those moves will remove the potential for making money for nothing in this case therefore it is both the exchange rate risk and costs as well as the loan market in that country that set the interest rate in foreign currencies demand for loans in the foreign currency is not a major mover for the same reason companies importing from foreign entities need cash in foreign currencies to pay their bills and so will borrow money in other currencies to fulfil these operations which could come from deposits in the foreign currency if they were available at a lower interest rate than a loan in local currency plus the costs of exchange but the banks will be unwilling to loan to them for less than the highest return that they can get so will push up interest rates to their risk level in the same way that they did in the market before currencies were taken into account freedom of movement of foreign currencies however does move interest rates in foreign currencies as the banks want to be able to lend as much of currencies that are not freely deliverable as they can so will pay a premium for these currencies other political moves such as the government wanting to borrow large amounts of foreign currency etc will also move the interest rate given for foreign currencies not just because loaning to the government is less risky but also because they sometimes pay a premium in interest for being able to borrow foreign currency which may balance this out speculation that a country may change its base interest rate will move short term rates and can move long term rates if it is seen to be a part of a country 's economic strategy the theory behind this is deep and involved but the tl;dr answer would be the standard invisible hand response when anything market or arbitrage related is involved references i work in credit risk and got a colleague who is also a credit risk consultant and economist to look over it arbitrage theory and the repo markets are both fascinating so worth reading about

congratulations you 're making enough money to invest there are two easy places to start i recommend against savings accounts because they will quite safely lose your money the inflation rate is usually higher than the interest rate on a savings account you may have twice as much money after 50 years but if everything costs four times as much then you 've lost buying power if in the course of learning about investing you 'd like to try buying individual stocks do it only with money you would n't mind losing index funds will go down slightly if one of the companies in that index fails entirely but the stock of a failed company is worthless

do you guys think it 's a good idea to put that much down on the car in my opinion it depends on a lot of factors   if you have nothing to pay and are not planning to invest in something that cost a lot soon i.e an house etc then i see no problem in put that much down on the car remember that the more you pay at first the less you will pay interest on however if you are planning on buying something big soon then you might want to pay less and keep moneys for your future investment i would honestly not finance a car with the garage as i find their interest rate to high possibilities depends a lot of your bank accounts but what i would personally do is pay it cash using my credit margin with the bank which is only 2.8 interest rate garage where i live rarely finance under 7 interest rate you may not have a credit margin but maybe you could get a loan with the bank instead many bank keep an history of your loan which will get you a better credit name when trying to buy an home later on the other side having a good credit name is not really useful in a garage what interest rate is reasonable based on my credit score i do n't think it is possible to give a real answer to this as it change a lot around the world however i would recommend to simply compare with the interest rate asked when being loan by the bank

if you believe in the efficient market hypothesis then the stock price reflects the information known to market participants consequently if the market expected earnings to rise and they did then the price wo n't change clearly there are circumstances especially in the short term and for illiquid stocks where this is n't true but a lot of work points to this being the case on average

gt from what i understand the prices of futures are decided after the parties discover the price they think is appropriate for the underlying asset after some time    what do you mean by that the price you buy a futures contract at in the market is the price you get   the concept of price discovery does n't always apply as directly to derivatives as it does to equities when you buy a futures contract not only are you price discovery for the underlying asset you 're also signaling the value of tangible things like storage weather and transportation costs as well as intangibles such as future macroeconomic events global policy decisions etc   also consider that derivatives markets have significant percentages of market participants who are the classic example is a farmer who 's going to be harvesting his corn in oct nov but wants to lock in the price of his corn right now so he can sell futures contracts for delivery any time after nov at whatever they happen to be priced at currently in the market maybe he sells dec contracts for 400 400 cents per bushel 5k bushels per contract assuming he 's based in the us and trading these at trading agricultural grain and whatever happens to the price of corn between now and december he knows he can deliver his corn for $

one of the best things you can do for this purpose while getting a modest roi on a passive investment is invest in a company that profitably does whatever you want to see more of for example you could invest in a for profit company that sells needed goods to low income people at lower prices   something like wal mart which is one of the most effective anti poverty engines in the us   you might also say the same of something like aldi owner of aldi stores and trader joe 's which is a discount store chain   this is true even though a company like wal mart is seeking to make money first   its customer base tends to skew heavily towards low income consumers and historically to rural and elderly consumers   when wal mart is able to provide food clothing appliances and the like to poor people at a lower cost it is making it marginally less painful to have a low income peter can explain why wal mart is a humanitarian enterprise walmart ’s customer base is heavily concentrated in the bottom income quintile which spends heavily on food the bottom income quintile spends about 25 percent of income on food compared to just 3.5 percent for the top quintile so the benefits of walmart ’s substantially lower prices to the lowest earning cohort are huge especially on food as points out this view of wal mart dramatically lowering prices that low income people pay for food was by an obama adviser that 's just one company   you can pick the industry and company that best suits your personal preferences alternatively you could invest in something like whole foods a company with multiple missions to improve the planet and the community in addition to the more typical mission of being a prosperous retail chain of course as a general proposition a less than entirely altruistic charity inclined investment does n't need to be targeted at those with low incomes or at saving the planet   you could invest in almost anything you think is good yachts yo energy production industrial inputs music performances and the company will take care of making more of that good thing   you did n't say whether your goal was to help the poor the planet arts sciences knowledge community or whatever what i understand you to be saying is you are willing to accept a lower roi in exchange for some warm from your investment   that seems perfectly valid and reasonable to me but it makes it much more subjective and particular to your tastes   so you 'll need to pick something that 's meaningful to you   if you 're going to trade roi for positive feelings then you should pick whatever gives you your optimal blend of emotions and returns alternatively you could invest in something stable and predictable to beat inflation some sort of index or fund and then annually use some portion of those profits to simply give to the charity of your choice   your investment and your charity do not necessarily need to be the same vehicle

the independent contractor vs. employee distinction is a red herring to this discussion and not at all important just because someone suggested you use your llc to do the job is a very common way to do contracting and having an llc with business bank accounts provides you with more tax deductions such as deducting interest on credit lines some accounting practices prefer to pay entities by their tax id numbers instead of an individual 's social security number the actual reasoning behind this would be dubious but the llc only benefits you and gives you more advantages by having one than not for example it is easier for you to hire subcontractors through your llc to assist with your job due to the of the private entity similarly your llc can sign non disclosure and intellectual property agreements automatically extending the trade secrets to all of its members as opposed to just you as an individual by signing whatever agreement with the company that is paying you through your llc your llc will be privy to all of this next assuming you did have subcontractors or other liability inducing assets the llc limits the liability you personally have to deal with in a court system to an extent but even if you did n't the of an llc can deter potential creditors for example your client may just assume you are a in a wheel a random employee of the llc as opposed to the sole owner having a business account for the llc keeps all of your expenses in one account statement making your tax deductions easier if you had a business credit line the interest is tax deductible compared to just having a personal credit card for business purposes regarding the time costs of setting up and managing an llc this does vary by jurisdiction it can negligible or it can be complex you also only have to do it once hire an attorney to give you a head start on that if you feel that is necessary now back to the independent contractor vs. employee distinction it is true that the client will not be paying your social security but they expect you to charge more hourly than an equivalent actual employee would solely because you do n't get health insurance from them or paid leave or retirement plans or any other perk and you will receive the entire paycheck without any withheld by the employer you also get more tax deductions to utilize although you will now have self employment tax assuming you are a us citizen this becomes less and less important the higher over $ you make as it stops being counted slightly more complicated than that but self employment tax is it 's own discussion

it 's not quite clear what you are asking so i 'll answer a few possible interpretations businesses pay taxes on their profits so if your business took a million pounds in revenue e.g. sold a million pounds worth of stuff then you would subtract roughly speaking everything the business spent on making and selling that stuff and pay taxes only on the profit vat however is a different matter and you would have to pay vat on all of that income technically the vat portion is n't even income it 's tax you are forced to collect on behalf of the government if your business made a million pounds pounds profit it would pay tax on all of that million subject to what a tax accountant can do to reduce that which ought to be considerable   you ca n't subtract your personal living expenses like that however the company can pay you a salary which counts as an expense and the company does n't pay tax on that you might also take some money from the company as dividends both salary and dividends count as personal income to yourself and you will need to pay personal income tax on them   as for the ferrari it depends on whether you can justify it as a business expense a lot of companies provide cars for their employees so that they can use them for business however you have to be able to show that is for business otherwise they are taxed like salary the rules for company cars are quite complicated and you would need an accountant if this is a real rather than hypothetical situation definitely get a tax accountant involved

from myfico a foreclosure remains on your credit report for 7 years but its impact to your fico ® score will lessen over time while a foreclosure is considered a very negative event by your fico score it 's a common misconception that it will ruin your score for a very long time in fact if you keep all of your other credit obligations in good standing your fico score can begin to rebound in as little as 2 years the important thing to keep in mind is that a foreclosure is a single negative item and if you keep this item isolated it will be much less damaging to your fico score than if you had a foreclosure in addition to defaulting on other credit obligations personal note i tip my hat to you sir regardless of party we owe our a debt of gratitude if i had my way a va loan would ignore the past short sale i wish you well and thank you for serving

any time there is a share adjustment from spin off merger stock split or reverse there is zero chance for the stockholders to hang on to fractional shares they are turned into cash    for the employees in the 401 k program or investors via a mutual fund or etf this is n't a problem because the fraction of a share left over is compared to the thousands or millions of shares owned by the fund as a collective for the individual investor in the company this can be a problem that they are n't happy about   in some cases the fractional share is a byproduct that will result from any of these events in the case of a corporate merger or spin off most investors will not have an integer number of shares so that fraction leftover that gets converted to cash is n't a big deal when they want to boost the price to a specific range to meet a regulatory requirement they are getting desperate and do n't care that some will be forced out in other cases it is by design to force many shareholders out they want to go private they to split if you had less than 1000 shares pre split then you will end up with zero shares plus cash they know exactly what number to use the result after the split is that the number of investors is small enough they they can now fall under a different set of regulations they have gone dark they do n't have to file as many reports and they can keep control of the company   once the board of directors or the majority stockholders votes on this the small investors have no choice

advantage of cash you can spend the money without having to pay any fees or taxes to get it out disadvantage when inflation is greater than zero which it has been for many decades your cash is continually losing value advantages of an ira roth or classic your money will usually grow as the investments return a profit you get special tax benefits disadvantages there 's risk you may lose money there are tax penalties for withdrawing the money before retirement in general you should only put money in an ira if you expect to leave it there until you retire or at least for a long time whole life is a combination of a life insurance policy and an investment advantages combines insurance and investment into one convenient monthly payment disadvantages the investment portion typically has lower returns than you could get elsewhere if you have no need for life insurance if you 're not supporting anyone or you 're they could get along without you or you do n't like them and do n't care what happens to them when you 're gone or whatever then there 's no point buying life insurance whole or term you 're paying for a product that you do n't need it 's pretty common advice to tell people that instead of buying a whole life policy they should buy a term policy with the same coverage and then invest the difference in the premium for example if you were considering getting a $ 100,000 whole life policy that costs $ 50 per month just making up numbers of course it depends on your age health etc and you see you could get a $ 100,000 term life policy for $ 30 per month you will almost certainly do better in the long run to buy the $ 30 term policy and put the other $ 20 into investments the catch to this plan is that there are usually transaction costs to investing even a discount broker like ameritrade or scott trade charges around $ 10 per transaction so if you tried to invest $ 20 each month you 'd lose half of it to transaction fees which means that in practice you 'd have to save that money up until you had at least a few hundred and at that point many people find other things always seem to come up to spend the money on so that while they start out with every intention of investing this money they do n't

gt;it 's sad when i hear young workers talk about their job application strategies more often than not they involve figuring out how to fool the hr bots   lol   it took me a second with your hr bots to realize you were talking about the software and not the hr personnel   because i have always even 30 years back viewed hr as basically operating on a lot of faulty fundamental assumptions the best way to get hired even back then before the software application screening process was to do an end run around hr   part of the reason is that hr or previously the personnel dept was really designed from the get go only to fill the generic factory worker positions jobs that had minimal base level skill requirements i.e. the checkbox type stuff where any relatively intelligent person should be able to determine with a pretty high accuracy whether the candidates could do the job in other words the open positions that were effectively commodities and where the turnover was high and/or the number of people employed fairly large   but then a combination of hr wanting to be more professional combined with the advent of the generic mba manager who believes he she can manage anything without specific domain knowledge or experience created an opening for hr to take over the hiring of virtually all positions   so what we ended up with was the generic mba manager lacking domain knowledge experience shifting the responsibility or at least most of it for candidate filtering amp hiring off to generic hr people processes who pretty much by definition lack domain knowledge experience and who then attempted to the whole thing     add in stuff like equal opportunity anti discrimination laws and lawsuits to drive the generic of the whole process and you have the perfect pre conditions for the storm that is the current fiasco   so we end up with generic and lets face it often ignorant managers taking job requirements and coming up with checklist style help wanted ads cs degree 5 10 years of ruby on rails work experience hr departments that are clueless about the validity availability of those requirements pretty much just the crap into the ads amp application filtering software in a rote fashion and like a badly constructed google search it should n't be surprising that they come up with minimal results   of course within the discarded applicants are probably several potentially excellent hires but they will simply never be found     so smart people will still again do their best not to game the bots but to do an end run around the whole thing   and that means using your network to get your name in the door and your resume in the hands of the person that matters within the company that may or just as often may not be the manager who makes the hiring decision it may very well be the most experienced person in his department who then pushes the manager to interview and hire you and you preferably do that before the damned ad is even written and before the hr department is even aware that there is a need for a hire keep in mind that there is often a span of several weeks if not several months between the real awareness of a need and the manager hr getting around to actually starting the help wanted fiasco ridden process   one key aspect of that is that via the in the door ahead of time even if the company requires the hr process to be followed the job spec can be constructed to match the pre qualified candidate and his her resume can go to the top of the stack already being in the manager 's hands with a recommendation endorsement from one of his critical team members i.e. hire this guy gal   unfortunately it seems that for all the emphasis on networking these days colleges and other how to get hired classes seldom if ever teach those techniques   but if you ask around look around within companies and identify the really good fit people a lot of them will have been hired by this method and emphatically were not found via hr listings amp processes

there are a couple of things that are missing from your estimate in addition to your standard deduction you also have a personal exemption of $ 4050   so d in your calculation should be $ 6300 + $ 4050 = $ 10,350 as a self employed individual you need to pay both the employee and employer side of the social security and medicare taxes   instead of 6.2 + 1.45 you need to pay 6.2 + 1.45 2 = 15.3 self employment tax in addition there are some problems with your calculation quarter 1 estimated income should be your adjusted annual income divided by 4 not 3 likewise you should estimate your quarterly tax by estimating your income for the whole year then dividing by 4   so annual estimated federal tax should be quarterly estimated federal tax would be = 4 annual estimated self employment tax is = 15.3 a with the quarterly self employment tax being one fourth of that = 4 self employment tax gets added on to your federal income tax   so when you send in your quarterly payment using form 1040-es you should send in + the form 1040-es instructions pdf comes with the 2016 estimated tax worksheet that walks you through these calculations

i can not tell you what is or is not allowed under islamic law what i can tell you is that when most investors talk about the power of compound interest they are not actually necessarily talking about interest the idea of the magic of compound interest is that when you receive an interest payment on your investment you now have a larger investment earning more interest your investment grows exponentially this does n't just apply to interest payments however but can apply to any type of investment where the profits of the investment cause the investment to get larger   for example if you invest in a company 's stock and the value of the stock goes up 10 in a year after that year your investment is worth more than it was at the beginning if it goes up another 10 the following year you have gained more money in the second year than you did in the first your gains are compounding even though interest payments are not involved at all the same is true if you reinvest dividends or if you use business profit to expand your business for example   the term power of compound interest is so named for historical reasons but really applies to any type of investment where the investment itself is growing

something that 's come up in comments and been alluded to in answers but not explicit as far as i can tell even if your marginal tax rate now were equal to your marginal tax rate in retirement or even lower a traditional ira may have advantages   that 's because it 's your effective tax rate that matters on withdrawls based on ty 2014 single person but applies at higher numbers for other arrangements you pay 0 taxes on the first $ of income and then pay 10 on the next $ then 15 on $ then 25 on the total amount over that up to $ etc   as such even if your marginal rate is 25 say you earn $ 80k your effective rate is much less for example $ 80k income you pay taxes on $   that ends up being $ for an effective rate in total of let 's say you had the same salary $ 80k from 20 to 65 and for 45 years saved up 10k a year plus earned enough returns to pay you out $ 80k a year in retirement   in a roth you pay 25 on all $ 10k   in a traditional you save that $ 2500 a year because it comes off the top the amount over $ and then pay during retirement your effective tax rate because it 's the amount in total that matters    so for roth you had while for traditional the correct amount is n't but   you make the difference between .75 and back even with the identical income   of course if your $ 10k would take you down a marginal bracket then it also has an effective tax rate of something between the two rates thus roth makes sense if you expect your effective tax rate to be higher in retirement than it is now   this is very possible still because for people like me with a mortgage high property taxes two kids and student loans my marginal tax rate is pretty low even with a reasonably nice salary i still pay 15 on the stuff that 's heading into my ira   sadly my employer has only a traditional 401k but they also contribute to it without requiring a match so i wo n't complain too much   since i expect my eventual tax rate to be in that 18 20 at a minimum i 'd benefit from a roth ira right now this matters more for people in the middle brackets earning high 5 figure salaries as individuals or low 6 figure as a couple because the big difference is relevant when a large percentage of your income is in the 15 and below brackets   if you 're earning $ 200k then so much of your income is taxed at 28 33 it does n't make nearly as much of a difference and odds are you can play various tricks when you 're retiring to avoid having as high of a tax rate

listing on nyse has more associated overhead costs than listing on nasdaq   in the case of young technology companies this makes nasdaq a more attractive option perhaps the most important factor is that nyse requires that a company has an independent compensation committee and an independent committee while nasdaq requires only that executive compensation and decisions are made by a majority of independent directors   no self respecting would be instant tech is going to want some independent committee it over their pay packet   additionally listing on nyse requires a company have stated guidance for corporate governance while nasdaq imposes no such requirement   similarly nyse requires a company have an internal audit team while nasdaq imposes no such requirement    fees on nyse are also a bit higher than nasdaq but the difference is not significant a good rundown of the pros cons

it 's slightly more complicated than that usually a country that was in greece 's situation would be able to use inflation to devalue their currency which would have the effect of lowering the value of the government 's debts and also of making greek prices more competitive in the international market or they could use quantitative easing to inject cheap cash into the economy to help stimulate it because greece is on the euro however they have no control over their own currency and their options are highly limited additionally when you join the eu especially the eurozone that 's supposed to come with additional internal responsibilities but it 's also supposed to come with additional external ones as well greece has a responsibility to get its shit together but the whole point is that more financially stable countries have a responsibility to help them right now that means germany they 're the ones with the greatest control over the euro and they 're away from their duties if the rest of europe did n't want to risk ending up in this position they should n't have let greece into the eurozone

some stocks do fall to zero i do n't have statistics handy but i 'd guess that a majority of all the companies ever started are now bankrupt and worth zero even if a company does not go bankrupt there is no guarantee that it 's value will increase forever even in a general overall sense you might buy a stock when it is at or near its peak and then it loses value and never it even if a stock will go back up you ca n't know for certain that it will suppose you bought a stock for $ 10 and it 's now at $ 5 if you sell you lose half your money but if you hold on it might go back up and you make a profit or it might continue going down and you lose even more perhaps your entire investment a rational person might decide to sell now and cut his losses of course i 'm sure many investors have had the experience of selling a stock at a loss and then seeing the price skyrocket but there have also been plenty of investors who decided to hold on only to lose more money just a couple of weeks ago a stock i bought for $ 1.50 was selling for $ 14 i could have sold for like 900 profit instead i decided to hold on and see if it went yet higher it 's now at $ 2.50 fortunately i only invested something like $ 800 if it goes to zero it will be annoying but not ruin me on a bigger scale if you invest in a variety of stocks and hold on to them for a long period of time the chance that you will lose money is small the stock market as a whole has consistently gone up in the long term but the chance is not zero and a key phrase is in the long term if you need the money today the fact that the market will probably go back up within a few months or a year or so may not help

i will answer the question from the back who can not afford luxury cars those whose parents paid for their college education can not afford luxury cars but buy them anyway why i have what may seem a rather shocking proposition related to the point of not saving for kids college parents do not owe children a college education why should they did your parents fund your college or did you get it through a mix of pell grants loans and work if they did then you owe them $ back for it adjusted for inflation if they did not well then why do you feel your children deserve more than you deserved when you were a child you do not owe your children a college education they owe it to themselves gifts do not set one up for success they set one up for dependence    i will add one more hypothesis financial discipline is best learned through one 's own experiences when an 18 + year old adult gets a very large amount of money as a gift every year for several years in the form of paid tuition does that teach them frugality and responsibility my proposition is that those who get a free ride on their parents backs are not well served in terms of becoming disciplined they become the subjects of the question in this post those why buy cars and houses they can not afford and pay for vacations with credit cards we reap what we as a society   of course college is only one case in point but a very illustrative one the bigger point is that financial discipline can only be developed when there are opportunities to develop it such opportunities arise under one important condition financial independence   what does buying children cars for their high school graduation buying them 4 years of college tuition and buying them who knows what else study abroad trips airfare apartment leases textbooks etc etc teach does it teach independence or dependence   it can certainly at least that 's what you hope for teach them to appreciate when others do super nice things for them but does free money instill financial responsibility   try to ask kids whose parents paid for their college why they did it because my parents want me to succeed is probably the best you can hope for now ask them but do your parents owe you a college education why yes i guess they do why well i guess because they told me they do they said they owe it to me to set me up for success in life now think about this do people who become financially successful achieve that success because someone owed something to them or because they recognized that nobody owes them anything and took it upon themselves to create that success for themselves these are not very comfortable topics to consider especially for those of you who have either already sunk many tens of thousands of dollars into your childrens college education or for those who have been living very frugally and for the past 10 15 years driven by the goal of doing so but i want to open this can of worms because i believe fundamentally it may be creating more problems than it is solving i am sure there are some historical and cultural explanations for the assumption that has at some point formed in the american society that parents owe their children a college education   but as with most social conventions it is merely an idea a shared belief it has become so ingrained in conversations at work parties and family that it seems that many of those who are advocates of the idea of paying for their childrens education no longer even understand why they feel that way they simply go with the flow of social expectations unwilling or unable to question either the premises behind these expectations or the long term consequences and results of such expectations   with this comment i want to point to the connection between the free financial gifts that parents give to their adult children and the level of financial discipline of these young adults their spending habits sense of entitlement and sense of responsibility over their financial decisions the statistics of the u.s. savings rate average credit card debt foreclosures and bankruptcy indeed tell a troubling story   my point is that these trends do n't just happen because of lots of tv advertising and the proverbial jones 's these trends happen because of a lack of financial education discipline and experience with balancing one 's own checkbook perhaps we need to think more deeply about the consequences of our socially motivated decisions as parents and what is really in our children 's best interests not while they are in college but while they live the rest of their lives after college finally to all the 18 + adult children who are from the traumatic experience of not having their parents pay for their college while some of their friends parents totally did i have this perspective to offer   like you are now your parents are adults their money is theirs to spend because it was theirs to earn you are under no obligation to pay for your parents retirement not that you were going to similarly your parents have no obligation to pay for your college they can spend their money on absolutely whatever they want be it a cottage vacations a or slots in the casino how they spend their money is their concern only and has nothing to do with your adult needs such as college education   if your parents their finances and go bankrupt it is their obligation to get themselves back in the black not yours if you have the means and may be so inclined you may help them if you do not or are not fair enough regardless of what you do they will still love you as their child no less   similarly if your parents have the means and are so inclined they may help you if they do not or are not fair enough regardless of what they do you are to love them as your parents no less   your task as an adult is to focus on how you will meet your own financial needs not to dwell on which of your needs were not met by people whose finances should well be completely separate from yours at this point in life for an adult to harbor an expectation of receiving something of value for free is misguided it unjustified illusory entitlement it is the expectation of someone who is clueless as to the value of money measured by the effort and time needed to earn it when adults want to acquire stuff or services they have to pay for these things with their own money that 's how adults live when adults want to get a massage or take a ride in a cab are they by their parents obligation to pay for these services no they realize that it 's their own responsibility to take care of these needs they either need to earn the money to pay for these things or buy them on credit and pay off the debt later   education is a type of service just like a massage or a cab ride it is a service that you decide you need to get in order to do xyz become smarter get a better paying job join a profession etc therefore as with any other service the primary responsibility for paying for this service is yours   you have 3 options or their combination work now so that you can earn the money to pay for this service later work part time while you are receiving this service acquire the service on credit and work later to pay it off that 's it this is called the real world the better you can deal with it the more successful you will become in it good luck

you might convert all your money in local currency but you need take care of following tips while studying abroad here are some money tips that can be useful during a trip abroad know about fees when you use a debit card or credit card in a foreign country there are generally two types of transaction fees that may apply understand exchange rates the exchange rate lets you know the amount of nearby money you can get for each u.s. dollar missing any expenses there are sell rates for individuals who are trading u.s. dollars for foreign currency and the other way around purchase rates it 's a smart thought to recognize what the neighborhood money is worth in dollars so you can comprehend the estimation of your buys abroad   sites like x rates offer a currency converter that gives the current exchange rate so you can make speedy comparisons you can utilize it to get a feel for how much certain amount say $ 1 $ 10 $ 25 $ 50 $ 100 are worth in local currency remember that rates fluctuate so you will be unable to suspect precisely the amount of a buy made in a foreign currency will cost you in u.s. dollars to get cash check for buddy banks if you already have an account with a large bank or credit union in the u.s. you may have an advantage   being a client of a big financial institution with a large atm system may make it easier to find a subsidiary cash machine and stay away from an out of system charge   bank of america for example is a part of the global atm alliance which lets clients of taking an interest banks use their debit cards to withdraw money at any alliance atm without paying the machine 's operator an access fee in spite of the fact that you may at present be charged for converting dollars into local currency used for purchases   citibank is another well known bank for travelers because it has 45,000 atms in more than 30 countries including popular study abroad destinations such as the u.k. italy and spain atms in a foreign country may allow withdrawals just from a financial records and not from savings so make sure to keep an adequate checking balance also atm withdrawal limits will apply just as they do in the u.s. but the amount may vary based on the local currency and exchange rates weigh the benefits of other banks for general needs online banks and even foreign banks can also be good options   with online banks you do n’t have to visit physical branches and these institutions typically have lower fees use our checking account tool to find one that ’s a good fit foreign many american debit cards may not work in europe asia and latin america especially those that do n’t have an emv chip that help prevent fraud or some cards may work at one atm but not another one option for students who expect a more extended stay in a foreign country is to open a new account at a local bank this will let you have better access to atms and to make purchases more easily and without as many fees see our chart below for the names of the largest banks in several countries guard against fraud and identity one of the most important things you can do as you plan your trip is to let your bank know that you ’ll be abroad include exact countries and dates when possible to avoid having your card flagged for fraud unfortunately incidents may still arise despite providing ample warning to your bank bring a backup credit card or debit card so you can still access some sort of money in case one is canceled are also critical not just for traveling from place to place but also as identification to open a bank account and for everyday purposes you ’ll want to make two and give one to a friend or family member to keep at home and put the other in a separate secure location just in case your actual passport is lost or stolen

since all the other answers thus far seem to the risk likelihood of the money being seized i figure i may as well make my comment an answer unless you happen to have your legal team travelling with you and your suitcase of cash you should expect that you 'll be questioned extensively so that any sign of in your answers or anything you say that does n't make sense to the officer will be used as an excuse to seize your money and you 'll learn an expensive lesson in civil asset forfeiture the government will file a complaint against your money leading to a ridiculously named case such as united states v. $ in u.s. currency worth noting that while the outcome in this case was not in the government 's favor in the vast majority of cases the government keeps the cash between 9/11 and 2014 u.s police forces have seized over 2.5 billion dollars in cash without search warrants or and returned the money in less than 10 of cases   that last link is kind of a long read but contains cases where people with completely legitimate money and documentation for their money had it seized anyway and were only able to recover it after months or years in court

is your mother still paying the premiums or are you if you 're paying the premiums then just contact the company and say you are no longer willing to pay and want to cancel the policy if she 's paying the premiums why do you care if the issue is the non smoking declaration and you are a smoker or want to take up smoking i do n't know what country you live in but i 'd be surprised if there 's a law anywhere that gives your mother the legal authority to forbid you from smoking when you are over 18 if you are paying the premiums then contact the insurance company and tell them that you are no longer a non smoker the premiums may go up if she is paying the premiums tell her that you are now a smoker and that she should contact the insurance company about changing this clause in the policy if she wants to be sure it remains valid if she declines to do this that 's between her and the insurance company as you 're not a party to the contract it really has nothing to do with you if as you say your mother is not fully capable of managing her affairs you could contact the insurance company for her i do n't see how you could get the policy invalidated unless there is some evidence that the life insurance company made false claims or somehow tricked your mother into buying the policy or that the policy violates local law there is nothing invalid about it just because you 've decided you do n't want the policy does n't make it invalid likewise i do n't see how you could get the premiums refunded the whole point of life insurance is that you pay a monthly premium and if and when you die they pay the beneficiary the face value of the policy life insurance is often described as a kind of gambling game the insurance company is betting that you will live long enough to pay more in premiums than they pay out in benefits you are betting that you will get more in benefits than you pay in premiums if you die young you win if you could wait and see if you die within some time period and if not demand your premiums back well that would be like saying that you want to bet on a spin of the roulette wheel and if you win you take your winnings and if you lose you want to get your original bet back what casino would agree to that you should be able to cancel the policy at any time i suppose there might be some specific commitment in the contract like you pledge not to cancel within x years if you never signed it i do n't see how you could be obligated to pay for it regardless of what commitments your mother made i do n't know where you live or your country 's laws but i doubt your mother can sign a contract legally committing you to pay for something for the rest of your life you say it 's a whole life policy which means it should have some cash value if you cancel it i.e. you get some money back not everything you and/or your mother paid in but something

the answer is to your question is somewhat complicated you will be unable to compete with the firms traditionally associated with high frequency trading in any of their strategies most of these strategies which involve marketing making latency arbitrage and rebate collection the amount of engineering required to build the infrastructure required to run this at scale makes it something which can only be undertaken by a team of highly skilled engineers indeed the advantage of firms competing in this space such as tradeworx and comes from this infrastructure as most of the strategies that are developed are necessarily simple due to the latency requirements now if you expand the definition of hft to include all computerized automated trading you most certainly can build strategies that are profitable it is not something that you probably want to tackle on your own but i know of a couple of people that did go it alone successfully for a couple of years before joining an established firm to run a book for them in order to be successful you will most likely need to develop a unique strategies the good news is because that you are trying to deploy a very tiny amount of capital you can engage in trades that larger firms would not because the strategies can not hold enough capital relative to the firms capital base   i am the co founder of a small trading firm that successfully trades the us equities and equity derivatives markets a couple of things to note is that if you want to do this you should consider building a real business having some more smart brains around you will help you do n't need exchange for all strategies many firms including ours in a data center that simply has proximity to the exchanges data centers you will need to keep things simple to be effective   do n't except all the group think that this is impossible it is possible although as a single individual it will be more difficult it will require long long hours as you climb the algorithmic trading learning curve good luck

off the top of my head i do n't know of any publicly traded companies that routinely earmark distributions as return of capital but theoretically it 's certainly applicable to any publicly traded company the wikipedia article gives one situation in which a publicly traded company may use return of capital public business may return capital as a means to increase the debt equity ratio and increase their leverage risk profile since return of capital is a distribution it shrinks the firm 's equity thus increasing its leverage investopedia also has an article dividend facts you may not know that gives an example of when return of capital might be used sometimes especially in the case of a special large dividend part of the dividend is actually declared by the company to be a return of capital in this case instead of being taxed at the time of distribution the return of capital is used to reduce the basis of the stock making for a larger capital gain down the road assuming the selling price is higher than the basis for instance if you buy shares with a basis of $ 10 each and you get a $ 1 special dividend 55 cents of which is return of capital the taxable dividend is 45 cents the new basis is $ and you will pay capital gains tax on that 55 cents when you sell your shares sometime in the future a company may choose to earmark some or all of its distribution as return of capital in order to provide shareholders with a more beneficial tax treatment the irs describes this different tax treatment distributions that qualify as a return of capital are not dividends a return of capital is a return of some or all of your investment in the stock of the company a return of capital reduces the basis of your stock these distributions do n't necessarily count as taxable income except in some instances once the basis of your stock has been reduced to zero any further non dividend distribution is capital gain the irs also states a distribution generally qualifies as a return of capital if the corporation making the distribution does not have any accumulated or current year earnings and profits in this case the firm is lowering its equity because it 's paying distributions out of that equity instead of accumulated earnings profits a company may use return of capital to maintain a distribution even in times of financial difficulty   in the context of closed end funds however return of capital can be much more complicated and can affect the fund 's performance and reputation in numerous ways also jb king is correct in you that return of capital is not the same thing as return on the latter is a method for valuing a company and determining how efficient a company is where it comes to using its resources to quote jb king 's comment again

why would i ever choose to open a savings account this is slightly broad and opinion based if the interest rates are same and other aspects are same or same to you for example savings account allows say 6 debits per month and you only need 4 then its same   unless one compares the specifics one ca n't decide a checking account may have fees at times waived if there is direct deposit set up it maybe more easy to get phone banking or other aspects   quite a few items were initially possible with only checking account get a check book get a debit card not just atm card etc   these days there are multiple of products that bank is which blur out the lines hence traditional comparison will not do justice

there are all sorts of topics in finance that take a lot of time to learn   you have valuation time value of money capital asset pricing model dividend discount model etc financial statement analysis ratio analysis free cash flow amp discounted cash flow etc capital structure amp miller theories of capital structure weighted average cost of capital more capm the likes and portfolio management asset allocation security selection financial statement analysis + other fields like derivatives fixed income forex and commodity markets and all sorts    my opinion of investopedia is that there is a lot of wheat with the   i think articles entries are just user submitted and there are good gems in investopedia but a lot of it only covers very basic concepts   and you often do n't know what you do n't know so you might come out with a weak understanding of something     to begin you need to understand tvm and why it works   time value of money is a critical concept of finance that i feel many people do n't truly grasp and just understand you need some rate to use for this formula   also as a you should understand basics of accrual accounting debits amp credits and how the accounting system works   do n't need to know things like asset retirement obligations or anything fancy just how accounting works and how things affect certain financial statements   after that i 'd jump into capm and cost of capital   cost of capital is also a very misunderstood concept since schools often just give students the cost of capital for math problems when in reality it 's not just an explicit number but more of a general feeling in the environment   calculating cost of capital is actually often very tricky market risk premium and subjective sometimes it 's not libor based     after that you can build up on those basic concepts and start to do things like dividend discount models basic theory underlying asset pricing models and capital asset pricing models which builds on the idea of cost of capital     then go into valuation   learn how to price equities bonds derivatives etc   for example you have the dividend discount model with typical equities and perpetuities   fixed income has things like duration amp convexity to measure risk and analyze yield curves   derivatives you have the black scholes model and other derivatives heh of that formula for calculating prices of options futures cdos etc   valuation is essentially taking the idea of tvm to the next logical step   then you can start into financial modelling   free cash flows discounted cash flows ratio analysis pro forma projections   start small use a structured problem that gives you some inputs and just do calculations   bonuses would be ideas of capital structure really not necessary for entry level positions like the on capital structure debt vs equity portfolio management risk management asset allocation hedging investment strategies like straddles inverse etc and knowledge of financial institutions and banking regulations basel accords depository regulations the fed etc     once you gain an understanding of how this works pick something out there and do a report on it   then you 'll be left with a single word problem that gives you nothing except a problem and tells you to find an answer   you 'll have to find all the inputs and give reasons why these inputs are sound and reasonable inputs for this analysis     a big part that people do n't understand about projections and analysis is that inputs do n't exist in plain   you have to make a lot of judgment calls when making these assumptions and it takes a lot of technical understanding to make a reasonable assumption of which the results of your report highly depend on   as a finance student you get a taste for all of this   i 'm gon na say it 's going to be hard to learn a lot of substantial info in 2 months but i 'm not exactly sure what big business expects out of their   you 'll mostly be doing practical work like desk jockey business data entry and other labor based jobs   if you know what you 're talking about you can probably work up to something more specialized like underwriting or risk management or something else    source   finance degree but currently working towards starting a finance related company to draw on my programming background as well

a stop loss order becomes a market order when a trade has occurred at or below the trigger price you set when creating the order this means that you could possibly end up selling some or all of your position at a price lower than your trigger price for relatively illiquid securities your order may be split into transactions with several buyers at different prices and you could see a significant drop in price between the first part of the order and the last few shares to mitigate this brokers also offer a stop limit order where you set not only a trigger price but also a minimum price that you are will to accept for your shares this reduces the risk of selling at rock bottom prices especially if you are selling a very large position however in the case of a flash crash where other sellers are driving the price below your limit that part of your order may never execute and you could end up being stuck with a whole lot of shares that are worth less than both your stop loss trigger and limit price for securities that are liquid and not very volatile either option is a pretty safe way to cut your losses for securities that are illiquid and/or very volatile a stop limit order will prevent you from cashing out at bottom dollar and giving away a bargain to lurkers hanging out at the bottom of the market but you may end up stuck with shares you do n't want for longer than originally planned it 's up to you to decide which kind of risk you prefer

broadly there 's a bunch of stuff you need to be accounting for that 's not reflected in the above which will impact the a d profile of an acquisition   consideration paid all cash on substantially the same terms is going to be more accretive than an all stock transaction because in the latter your denominator is much bigger   shares outstanding including repurchases in kind dividends and option exercise   financing interest expense   upside base downside case for all of your assumptions best to have a based on a choose function that will allow the user to easily between these   i 'm not sure what ebitda is getting you eps accretion dilution typically looks at earnings but you could also look at cash eps a d which measures shares outstanding   the point is this really depends on how back of the envelope you want the a d computation to be at a minimum you need an earnings schedule projected over the next 2 3 years and you need a schedule reflecting outstanding shares over the same time period   your earnings can have varying degrees of granularity you can project cost synergies over the forecast period which most obviously is going to affect your earnings but you can also drill down further financing transaction fees etc your and from your b s combination may result in certain deferred tax items that will affect your bottom line over the forecast period   your share schedule can also have varying degrees of complexity one way to do it is to just presume that the company will not issue any more shares and will not repurchase any shares and that there will be no options exercised over the forecast period this is a bad series of assumptions it is likely that as options vest if in the money they will be exercised resulting in dilution for existing shareholders it is also likely that certain preferred shareholders and are going to experience adjustments to the conversion prices based on provisions in their securities these may be but are not always disclosed in the 10k.   last point models are tools what are you trying to build an accretion dilution model for this will affect and determine the degree of granularity you 'll want to go into

this is a very common misconception i 've been studying equities and credits for a while now and the simplest way to explain the difference is this   credit is about stable cash flows your investment in a bond has almost read almost nothing to do with growth rate it has everything to do with how stable the cash flows are and interest coverage   equity is about growth no wonder companies with highly irregular cash flows e.g. every single young tech company in the history of tech companies can have the most in demand equity while few bond investors would touch them with a ten foot pole

there is another reason why an investor might buy negative yielding bonds if the investor expects that bond yields will go even further negative then they are also expecting the price of the bond to go up they can resell the bond later at a profit as an example they may expect an increase in central bank bond purchases to drive yields lower and prices higher

do you have a separate bank account for your business   that is generally highly recommended i have a credit card for my single member llc   i prefer it this way because it makes the separation of personal and business expenses very clear using a personal credit card but using it for only business expenses seems to be a reasonable practice   you may be able to do one better though for your sole proprietorship you can file a dba which establishes the business name   the details of this depend on your state   with a dba i believe you can open a bank account in the name of your business and you may also be able to open a credit card account in the name of the business   i 'm not sure what practical difference it makes but it does make the personal business distinction clearer   though at that point you might as well just do the llc

it is true that with a job that pays you via payroll check that will result in a w-2 because you are an employee the threshold that you are worried about before you have to file is in the thousands unless of course you make a lot of money from bank interest or you have income tax withheld and you want it refunded to you table 2 and table 3 in irs pub 501 does a great job of telling you when you must   for you table 3 is most likely to apply because you were n't an employee and you will not be getting a w-2 if any of the five conditions listed below applied to you for 2016 you must file a return you owe any special taxes including any of the following a. alternative minimum tax see form     b. additional tax on a    qualified plan including an individual retirement arrangement ira    or other account   see pub contributions to    individual retirement arrangements iras pub distributions    from   individual retirement arrangements iras and pub 969 health    savings accounts and other health   plans but if you are    filing a return only because you owe this tax you can file form 5329    by itself    c. social security or medicare tax on tips you did n't    report to your employer see pub reporting tip income or on     wages you received from an employer who did n't withhold these taxes    see form     d. taxes including social    security medicare or railroad retirement tax on tips you reported to    your   employer or on life insurance and additional taxes on    health savings accounts see pub pub 969   and the form 1040    instructions for line 62    e. household employment taxes but if you    are filing a return only because you owe these taxes you can file     schedule h form 1040 by itself f. recapture taxes see the form    1040 instructions for lines 44 and 62 you or your spouse if filing jointly received archer medicare advantage or health savings account   distributions you had net earnings from of at least $ 400 see schedule se form 1040 and its instructions you had wages of $ or more from a church or qualified organization that is exempt from employer   social    security and medicare taxes see schedule se form 1040 and its    instructions advance payments of the premium tax credit were made for you your spouse or a dependent who enrolled in coverage   through the health    insurance marketplace you should have received showing    the amount of the advance   payments if any it appears that item 3 you had net earnings from of at least $ 400 see schedule se form 1040 and its instructions would most likely apply it obviously is not too late to file for 2016 because taxes are n't due for another month as to previous years that would depend if you made money those years and how much

perhaps an example will help make it more clear any given year   revenue   200 k profit 60 k you get 40 k in profit plus any salary he gets 20 k next year you attract the attention of a competitor and they offer and you accept to sell   you would get 100 of the proceeds this is kind of a bad deal for him as you could easily play accounting tricks to diminish the company 's profits and reduce his pay   for the given example you could pay yourself a 60 k bonus and reduce the profit to zero and eliminate his compensation   there should probably be a revenue metric included in his compensation edit it is really nice to hear you have a desire to treat this person fairly   honesty in business is necessary for long term success   i would simply make his salary dependent upon the revenue he generates   for example lets say you can make a widget for 4 and you expect to sell them for 10   your profit would be 6 and with the suggested split he would receive $ 2 you $ 4 instead i would have him receive like 15 of the revenue generated this allows for some discounts for bulk items and covers the cost of processing sales   it also allows him to share revenue with his staff    alternatively you could also do a split   perhaps 7.5 of revenue and 10 of profit

the backdoor roth ira contribution has been possible for a few years now and is fairly widely known the irs has n't said anything negative about it an answer to my question here mentions that it could hypothetically be disallowed through the step transaction doctrine although that is the only time i have heard that possibility raised for some background the income limit on roth conversions was removed as a revenue offsetting provision of the tax increase prevention and reconciliation act of 2005 they want people who have deducted contributions in traditional iras to convert to roth and pay taxes now rather than waiting many years until retirement conversely people performing the backdoor roth ira contribution have already paid taxes on that money and it 's just preventing them from having to pay taxes many years later it 's easy to see how congress would find this a satisfactory exchange

the error in the example is here now if you contribute 5 to a roth 401(k your employer would match your after tax 5 contribution if the tax rate is 25 that would be 5 of $ 60,000 which is $ 3,000 however that $ 3,000 is put in to a traditional 401(k so it is taxed when withdrawn assuming the tax rate is still 25 when you withdraw you are only getting $ essentially you are giving up $ 750 of free money in this case you set your contribution to roth 401k as a function of the gross 80,000   you choose 5 and contribute 4000 your employer matches 4000 at the end of the year your taxable income to the irs is and you pay 30 or   you have k to live on or 52 k if you chose the alternate regular 401k then you contribute 4 k your income to the irs is 80 and you pay 30 k in tax   you have 80 4 or k to live on or to come at it the other way you have 4000 30 = 1200 extra tax reduction in your income this year    if the extra income in 401k versus extra current year tax in roth ira means you have to reduce less like 2800 k to the roth so you maintain a k lifestyle then yes the roth ira match is reduced   if you have the cash flow to prepay the current year tax and maximum match contribution you will get the full match based on your gross income

no spdr etfs are not a good fit for a novice investor with a low level of financial literacy   in fact there is no investment that is safe for an absolute beginner not even a savings account   an absolute beginner could easily overdraw his savings account leading to fees and collections i would say that an investment becomes a good fit for an investor as soon as said investor understands how the investment works   a savings account at a bank or credit union is fairly easy to understand and is therefore a suitable place to hold money after a few hours to a day of research   even after 0 hours of research however a savings account is still better than a sock drawer money market accounts through a bank certificates of deposit through a bank and money market mutual funds through a mutual fund provider are probably the next easiest thing to understand   this could take a few hours to a few weeks of research depending on the learner equities corporate bonds and government bonds are another step up in complexity and could take weeks or months of schooling to understand well enough to try   equity or bond mutual funds or the etf versions of those which is what you asked about are another level after that also important to understand along the way are the financial institutions and market infrastructure that exist to provide these products   banks credit unions public corporations brokerages stock exchanges bond exchanges mutual fund providers etf providers etc

you can execute block trades on the options market and get exercised for shares to create a very large position in energy transfer partners lp without moving the stock market you can then place limit sell orders after selling directly into the market and keep an of low priced shares the technical analysis traders wo n't know what you specifically are doing and will call this resistance if you hit nice even numbers multiples of 5 multiples of 10 with your sell orders you can exacerbate selling as many market participants will have their own stop loss orders at those numbers causing other people to sell at lower and lower prices automatically and simultaneously keep your massive ask in effect if your position is bigger than the demand then you can keep a stock lower the secondary market does n't inherently affect a company in any way but many companies have borrowed against the price of their shares and if you get the share price low enough they can get suddenly margin called and be unable to service their existing debt you will also lose a lot of money doing this so you can also buy puts along the way or attempt to execute a collar to lower your own losses the collar strategy is nice because it is unlikely that other traders and analysts will notice what you are doing since there are calls puts and share orders involved in creating it one person may notice the block trade for the calls initially but nobody will notice it is part of a larger strategy with multiple legs with the share position you may also be able to vote on some things but that solely depends on the conditions of the shares

the issue here is that the transaction your funds to her account looks very similar to the rent payments which you plan to make in the future those rental payments if deemed to be commercial would normally be subject to tax consider the scenario where rather than an up front $ 5000 and $ 5000 over 2 years you paid her $ 10000 and paid no rent that might be an attempt to avoid paying tax a commercial transaction ca n't be re labeled as a gift just based on your election the transaction needs to be considered as a whole however an interest free unsecured loan connected with you paying rent at market rate would be depending on local laws simply foolish to some extent i do n't think you are able to structure the transaction as a joint purchase since the mortgage will prevent her from allocating a part of the property to you its also likely that you can live in her house and contribute an adequate amount to the household costs without creating a taxable income for her for example in the uk up to pa rental income generated from the property in which you reside does not need to be declared you need to identify the scenarios where your particular arrangement could be imagined as resulting in a taxable or potentially taxable event then make sure you are not avoiding those events just by choosing how you label the events

a strategy of rebalancing assumes that the business cycle will continue that all bull and bear markets end eventually   imagine that you maintained a 50 split between a us treasury bond mutual fund and an s&p 500 stock mutual fund vfinx beginning with a $ 10,000 investment in each on january 1 2008 then on the first of each year you rebalanced your portfolio on the first of january we can pretend the markets are open that day the following table illustrates the values in each of those funds with the rebalancing transactions this second table shows what that same money would look like without any rebalancing over those years obviously this is cherry picking for the biggest drop we 've recently experienced but even if you skipped 2008 and 2009 the increase for a rebalanced portfolio from 2010 2017 is 85 verses 54 for the portfolio that is not being rebalanced in the same period this is also a plenty conservative portfolio you can see that a 100 stock portfolio dropped 40 in 2008 but the combined portfolio only dropped 18 a 100 stock portfolio has gained 175 since 2009 compared to 105 for the balanced portfolio but it 's common to trade gains for safety as you get closer to retirement you did n't ask about a 100 stock portfolio in your initial question these results would be repeated in many other portfolio allocations because some asset classes outperform others one year then underperform the next you sell after the years it outperforms then you buy after years that it underperforms

there are two reasons why most options are n't exercised   the first is obvious and the second less so the obvious an option that 's practically worthless does n't get exercised options that reach expiry and remain unexercised are almost always worthless bets that simply did n't pay off this includes calls with strikes above the current underlying price and puts with strikes below it a heck of a lot of options if an option with value was somehow left to expire it was probably a mistake or else the transaction costs outweighed the value remaining not quite worthless but not worth it either the less obvious an option with value can be cancelled any time before expiration a trader that buys an option may at some point show a gain sooner than anticipated or a loss in excess of his tolerance if a gain he may want to sell before expiry to realize the gain sooner similarly if a loss he may want to take the loss sooner in both cases his capital is freed up and he can take another position and this is the key part the other end matched up with that option sale is often a buyer that had created written exactly such an option contract in the first place the option writer and who is looking to get out of his position option writers are the traders responsible in the first place for creating options and increasing the open interest   anybody with the right kind and level of options trading account can do this a trader that writes an option does so by instructing his broker to sell to open a new instance of the option the trader then has a short position negative quantity in that option and all the while may be subject to the obligations that match the option 's exercise rights the only way for the option writer to get out of that short position and its obligations are these not by choice   to get assigned that is to say a buyer exercised the option the writer has to fulfill his obligation by delivering the underlying if a call to the option holder or buying the underlying if a put from the option holder not by choice the option expires worthless this is the ideal scenario for a writer because 100 of the premium received less transaction costs is profit by choice the writer is free to buy back exactly the same kind of option before expiry using a buy to close order with their broker once the option has been purchased with a buy to close it eliminates the short position and obligation   the option is cancelled   the open interest declines options thus cancelled just do n't live long enough to either expire or be exercised

in the us there is only one stock market ignoring penny stocks and of different exchanges behind it   nyse and nasdaq are two different exchanges but all the products you can buy on one can also be bought on the other i.e. they are all the same market   so a us equities broker can not possibly restrict access to any markets in the us because there is only one interestingly it is commonplace for us equity brokers to cheat their customers by using only exchanges where they the brokers get the best deals even if it means your order is not executed as quickly or cheaply as possible   this is called payment for order flow and unfortunately will probably take an act of congress to stop some very large brokers will have trading access to popular equity markets in other countries toronto stock exchange mexico stock exchange london stock exchange and can support your trades there   however at many brokers or in less popular foreign markets this is usually not the case to trade in the average foreign country you typically must open an account with a broker in that country

the risk besides the extra interest is that you might be upside down on the loan because the car loses value the moment you drive off the lot the slower you pay it off the longer it takes to get the loan balance below the resale value of course if you have a significant down payment the risk of being upside down is not as great even buying a used car does n't help because if you try to sell it back to the dealer the next week they wo nt give you the full price you paid some people try and split the difference get the longer term loan but then pay it off as quickly as the shorter term loan yes the interest rate is higher but if you need to drop the payment back to the required level you can do so

chris you realize that when you buy a stock the seller gets the money not the company itself unless of course you bought ipo shares and the amount you 'd own would be such a small portion of the company they do n't know you exist   as far as morals go if you wish to avoid certain stocks for this reason look at the socially responsible funds that are out there there are also funds that are targeted to certain religions and avoid alcohol and tobacco the other choice is to invest in individual stocks which for the small investor is very tough and expensive you 'll spend more money to avoid the shares than these very shares are worth   your proposal is interesting but impractical in a portfolio of say $ 100 k in the s&p the bottom 400 stocks are disproportionately smaller amounts of money in those shares than the top 100 so we 're talking $ 100 or less you 'd need to short 2 or 3 shares even at $ 1 m in that fund 20 30 shares shorted is pretty silly no offense   why not do the math and during the year you purchase the fund donate the amount you own in the bad companies to charity   and what littleadv said that too

in the uk if you come into the possession of the information in a way that is n't available to the general public that 's insider trading it even states this in section 7 and uses the example of if you observe something like a burning factory as a member of the public that 's not insider information as anyone could have seen it    if you attended a meeting or somehow got hold of private information not yet made public then it would be considered insider information    its possible the op got this information through public observation but considering the nature of the information it 's highly unlikely

also a layman and i did nt read the article because it did the whole screw you for blocking my ads thing but judging from the title i 'd guess someone bought a massive amount of call options for vix the stock that tracks volatility in the market whenever the market crashes or goes through difficult times the vix fund the by october part makes me think it was call options that he purchased basically he paid a premium for each share a fraction of the shares cost for the right to buy that share at today 's price from now until october so if the share increases in value for each call option he has he can buy one share at todays price and sell it at the price it is that day options can your profit into the next dimension but if the share decreases in value or even stays the same price he loses everything vicious redditors please correct the mistakes i ve made here with utmost discrimination

make sure to check the language describing the discount the company may be matching your contribution by 5 instead of a discount   you will likely be taxed on the match as compensation and your benefit would net to less than 5    the next risk is that you 've increased your exposure if your company does poorly   in the worst case scenario you could lose your wages to a layoff and your portfolio to a falling share price   investing in other companies will diversify this risk as for benefits you get the 5 less taxes for free which is n't a bad thing in my book just do n't put everything you own into the stock   it should be part of your overall investing strategy

in steady state the refrigerator only has to pump out the heat that has leaked in from outside   the amount of heat leaked is related to the difference between interior and exterior temperatures and the overall insulation quality   thus a refrigerator full of cold food uses the same amount of energy as a refrigerator full of cold air    in practice people open the door take cold food out put warm food in and the unit may also make ice dispense cold water and itself   aside from tweaking those uses e.g. minimizing time with the door open a useful trick is to use empty milk cartons or similar containers to fill up unused space   this helps by reducing the amount of cold air that escapes when the door is opened and the air in the cartons has low thermal mass so it cools down rapidly   when you need the space you can remove the cartons and set them aside similarly water filled cartons may be used as a sort of thermal leveling out the temperature fluctuations within the refrigerator particularly if the electric utilities are erratic   however they increase the cost of when cooling the water in the first place and when you eventually dump out the water the expense of cooling it goes down the drain

this is accepted law in pennsylvania however i will defer to your expertise and state that the decades long precedents are incorrect and every judge that allows cases to continue is wrong and you are correct     the internet is great for things like that     hopefully the next person in court can simply state   no your honor the landlord did not follow established law    court rulings be damned     i was on reddit and /u stated unequivocally said that what is happening is legally impossible and that the decades of precedent that exist is simply because the court screwed up     heck they can take it further to state that every lease in pennsylvania is illegal     i offer sarcasm as a response but if this was a single ruling i might agree with you   it 's well established here in the great commonwealth of pa   i say it 's been around 30 years because i 've been a landlord here for over 20 years and a renter for about 10 or so before that   the clause has always been there   the basis for today 's laws here in pa are from the landlord tenant act of   i 'm not a lawyer so i ca n't tell you when the first waiver of rights came about but it 's very possible it could go back that far

the short answer is you 're tax exempt if the tax laws say you are   there are a bunch of specific exemptions based on who you are what you 're buying and why taking british columbia as an example one exemption is supplies for business use some exemptions are only available to certain purchasers in certain circumstances these exemptions include you can also claim an exemption if you are buying adult size clothing for a child under 15 years farmers are exempt from sales tax on various goods and services first nations individuals are exempt in some circumstances and so on and so on

there are not always capital efficient ways for a company to reinvest its own profits this is why dividends exist   imagine a company will reinvest 80 of its profits into a project with a huge projected return but the other 20 of the company 's profits can not be reinvested efficiently because there are zero projects in which to reinvest the profits into that would return a better profit than what the company 's shareholders could make by reinvesting those profits in their own way ie a benchmark market index like an s&amp;p 500 index fund   since the shareholders could make a better return with this than the company could with any company project it would be irresponsible technically maybe even illegal for the company to reinvest that 20 of the profits   this reason for companies sometimes paying out profits to shareholders in the form of dividends is a market efficient part of the economic system and it really is great   if a ceo cfo anyone is paying out so much profit from a company that it is irresponsible to the company 's investors then that would also technically be illegal since the company is evading efficient project that would benefit its shareholders more than they could benefit themselves elsewhere in the market   these legalities with shareholder laws are not explicitly put into action very often but their effects are always there    it 's also worth noting payout strategy is very important for the strategy and financing of a company particularly for public investments

there 's no additional income tax burden created when you decide to make roth ira contributions your roth ira contributions are taxed at the same time all your income is taxed if you earned that $ 100 by working a job then your employer likely withheld taxes when they paid you if you earned it through self employment then you 'll pay estimated taxes on that income quarterly etc in any case when you file your annual tax return the actual taxes owed vs taxes paid gets reconciled and you 're left with a refund or owe an additional sum

if the gift was stock that they have owned for years there can be one hitch the basis of the stock does n't reset when it is gifted for example if grandparents have owned stock that is currently worth $ 10,000 today but they bought it decades ago when it only cost them $ 1,000 then if the new owner sells it today they will have a gain of $ 9,000 the clock to determine short term long term also does n't reset which is good the basis needs to be determined now so that the gain   can be accurately calculated in the future this information should be stored in a safe place gains for dividends are investment income and the rules regarding the kiddie tax need to be followed

it is not clear to me why you believe you can lose more than you put in without margin it is difficult and the chances are virtually nil however i can think of a few ways lets say you are an american and deposit $ 1000 now lets say you think the indian rupee is going to devalue relative to the euro so that means you want to go long going long without margin is still different than converting your into euros assume = 72 what s actually happening is your broker is taking out a 72,000 rupee loan and using it to buy euros with your $ 1000 acting as collateral you will need to pay interest on this loan about 7 annualized if i remember correctly you will earn interest on the euros you hold in the meantime for simplicity lets say its 1 the difference between interest you earn and interest you pay is called the cost of carry or commonly referred to as swap so your annualized cost of carry is $ 60 $ lets say you have this position open for 1 year and the exchange rate does nt move your total equity is $ now lets say an destroys all of europe your euros instantly become worthless you now must repay the rupee loan to close the trade the cost of which is $ 1000 but you only have $ in your account you have lost more than you deposited using no margin i would actually say that all buying and selling of currency pairs is inherently using margin because they all involve a short sale i do note that depending on your broker you can convert to another currency but that s not what forex traders do most of the time

i think you raise a very good point here    it is a very well known fact that the us is not a leader in automated manufacturing europe has traditionally been the place that consumes the majority of the automated manufacturing equipment that in turn comes out of japan    japan specializes in the manufacture of automated manufacturing equipment and has since the us this market to them in the 1950s offering the japanese access to the technology created at general motors called ladder logic and logic controllers these technologies were created from scratch on the shop floor at general motors at a time when there was a saying that what is good for general motors is good for the america   this was back before were affordable those early manufacturing robots actually used of and ladder logic which is still used till this days in the robots that come out of japan is still based on although they are now virtual    the japanese ran with the tech and now many people believe that the japanese invented it certainly they refined it over the years but the early work was handed to them in part as an effort to win them over from their potential allegiance with the japan was always a much larger lynch pin than either korea or vietnam where the actual military battles went down what was really scary to america was losing japan and the transfer of robotics technology to the japanese was part of the arrangement to keep them cozy with the us military empire    but the largest customer was not within japan the actual sales of equipment went to the europeans that 's where automated manufacturing is currently at its peak however things have been rapidly changing and for over a decade the fastest rising automation market has been china    currently foxconn or the large contract manufacturer famous for their apple contracts is in the process of building an automation base in the middle of taiwan    if you want jobs in automated manufacturing technology you should be studying chinese as well as

my answer is n't a full one but that 's because i think the answer depends on at minimum the country your broker is in the type of order you place limit market algo etc and the size of your order for example i can tell from watching live rates on regular lot limit orders i place with my uk based broker that they hold limit orders internally until they see a crossing rate on the exchange my requested stock is trading on then they submit a limit order to that exchange   i only get filled from that one exchange and this happens noticeably after i see my limit price print and my fills are always better than my limit price whereas with my us based broker i can see my regular limit order in the order book depth of book data prior to any fills   i will routinely be notified of a fill before i see the limit price print   and my fills come from any number of us exchanges nyse arca bats etc even for the same stock i should point out that the nbbo rule in the us under sec regulation probably causes more complications in handling of market and limit orders than you 're likely to find in most countries

these are all factually correct claims s corporation is a pass through entity so whatever gain you have on the corporate level is passed to the shareholders if your s corp has capital gains you 'll get your pro rata share of the capital gains interest the same dividends you get it on your k-1 earned income taxed as such to you i.e. whether you earn income as a s corp or as a sole proprietor matters not that 's the answer to your bottom line question the big issue however is this you can not have more than 25 passive income in your s corp you pass that limit three consecutive years one off is ok your s corp automatically converts to c corp and you 're taxed at the corporate level at the corporate rates you then lose the capital gains rates personal brackets etc this means that an s corp can not be an investment company most of its income has to be earned not passive another problem with s corp is that people who work as self proprietors incorporated as s corp try to abuse it and claim that the income they earned by the virtue of their own personal performance should n't be taxed as self employed income irs upon such a position and if considerable amounts are at stake will take you all the way up to the tax court to prove you wrong this has happened before you should talk to a licensed tax adviser ea cpa attorney licensed in your state to educate you about what s corp is and how it is taxed and whether or not it is appropriate for you

asset allocation serves many purposes not just mitigating risk via a diversification of asset classes but also allowing you to take a level of risk that is appropriate for a given investor at a given time by how much is allocated to which asset classes a younger investor with a longer timeframe may wish to take a lot more risk investing heavily in equities and perhaps managed funds that are of the aggressive growth variety seeking better than market returns someone a little older may wish to pull back a bit especially after a bull market has brought them substantial gains and begin to take money off the table perhaps by starting to establish some fixed income positions or pulling back to slightly less risky index   value or balanced funds an investor who is near or in retirement will generally want even less risk going to a much more balanced approach with half or more of their investments in fixed income and the remainder often in income producing blue chip type stocks or income funds   this allows them to protect a good amount of their wealth from potential loss at a time when they have to be able to depend on it for a majority of their income an institution such as yale has very different concerns and may always be in a more aggressive long term mode since retirement is not a factor for them   they are willing to invest mostly in very aggressive ways using diversification to protect them from one of those choices tanking but still overall taking a pretty high level of risk much more so than might be appropriate for an individual who will generally need to seek safety and to preserve gains as they get older   for example look at the pdf that linked and observe the overall risk level that yale is taking and in addition observe the large allocations they make to things like private equity with a risk level compared to their very small amount of fixed income with a 10 risk level   yale has a very long time horizon and invests in a way that is atypical of the needs and concerns of an individual investor   they also have as you pointed out the economy of scale with something like in assets to afford to hire proven experts and their own internal phd level experts to watch over the whole thing all of which very few individual investors have for either class of investor diversification is a means to mitigate risk by not having all your eggs in one basket   via having multiple different investments such as picking multiple individual stocks or aggressive funds with different approaches or just an index fund to get multiple stocks you are protected from being wiped out as might happen if a single choice might fail   for example imagine what would have happened if you had in 2005 put all your money into a single stock with a company that had been showing record profits   such as lehman brothers and left it there until 2008 when the stock tanked or even faster collapses such as enron etc that all looked great up until shortly after they failed utterly    being allocated across multiple asset classes provides some diversification all on it 's own but you can also be diversified within a class yale uses the diversification across several asset classes to have lower risk than being invested in a single asset class such as private equity but their allocation places much more of their funds in high risk classes and much less of their funds in the lowest risk classes such as fixed income

there is no typical return for an ira understand that an ira is not an investment type it is just an account that gets special tax treatment by the federal government the money in the ira could be invested in almost anything including gold stocks bonds cash cds etc so the question as phrased is n't exactly meaningful it is kind of like asking what is the typical price of things if i use $ 10 bills as for a annualized return on your portfolio that 's not a bad return at that rate you will double your investment with compounding every 7.2 years again however some context is needed you can really only evaluate investment returns with your risk profile in mind if you are invested in super safe investments like cds that is an absolutely incredible return you compare it to several indexes which is a good way to do it if you are investing in the types of investments tracked by those indexes

gt securitize the mortgages and sell them off to clients   to expand on that these loans were being packaged with 100s of others and sold to investors who could not possibly be bothered with examining each of the properties or borrowers   they were sold for decent fees to the bank and if the bank sold them all had no risk and pocketed fees from both ends   the banks needed as many loans as possible because they thought they could sell them all   the significance of this admission is n't so much that it was always ridiculous that the illiterate and unsophisticated were taking advantage of banks generosity but that they can no longer say the ridiculous with a straight face

you can report the violation to the payment network i.e. mastercard or visa   for instance here is a report form for visa and here is one for mastercard   i just found those by googling there are no doubt other ways of contacting the companies needless to say you should n't expect that this will result in an immediate hammer of justice being brought down on the merchant   given the presence of large scale fraud schemes it 's unlikely visa is going to come after every little corner store owner who charges a naughty surcharge   it is also unlikely that threatening to do this will scare the merchant enough to get them to drop the fee on your individual transaction   many times the cashier will be someone who has no idea how the process actually works and wo n't even understand the threat   however this is the real solution in that it allows the payment networks to track these violations and at least in theory they could come after the merchant if they notice a lot of violations

as others have said if you do n't have dependents there 's little need for life insurance if you ca n't think of any obvious beneficiary for an insurance policy than you probably do n't need one dependents here should be understood broadly it would n't necessarily be limited to wife and children if you 're the only support for your handicapped cousin for example you might want to provide for him but i take it from your question that you have no such special case of course even if you have no dependents now you might pick some up in the future and if and when that does happen your medical situation may have changed making it difficult to get life insurance but if you have no immediate plans so that any such even is likely to be far away a serious alternative to consider would be to invest the money you would have paid in insurance premiums then if someday you do acquire dependents you have a pot of money set aside to provide for them in case something happens to you if it 's not enough and you can get insurance at that time then great but if you ca n't get insurance at least there 's something if you never do acquire dependents you can consider that pot of money part of your retirement fund

yes simply put printing money is called monetizing the debt and would result in some nasty inflation it 's a no no as it quickly devalues the currency and makes it far more difficult to borrow in the future an entire generation will remember getting burned by it if say canada 's currency were suddenly worth half as much and you received half your investment back in us dollars e.g. you paid us$ 10,000 but now have us$ 5000 would you ever trust them again   the economy is far more complex than one can discuss here but the fractional reserve system is the next creator of money although it 's not unlimited the reserve requirement it back the demand for loans is impacted both by the rate itself and the bank 's willingness to lend   the housing bubble had multiple causes in a sense is right anything we do to make houses more affordable can cause house price inflation but the over the top underwriting had more impact in my opinion people lost sight of good lending practices the option rate interest only arms were financial time bombs

does a good answer of addressing the gains and when you are taxed on them and at what kind of rate money held in a brokerage account will usually be in a money market fund so you would own taxes on the interest it earned    there is one important consideration that must be understood for capitol losses   this is called the wash sale rule   this rule comes into affect if you sell a stock at a loss and buy shares of the same stock within 30 days before or after the sale   a common tactic used to minimize taxes paid is to capture losses when they occur since these can be used to offset gains and lower your taxes   this is normally done by selling a stock in which you have a loss and then either buying another similar stock or waiting and buying back the stock you sold    however if you are intending to buy back the same stock you must not trigger the wash sale rule or you are forbidden to take the loss examples   lets presume you own 1000 shares of a stock and it 's trading 25 below where you bought it and you want to capture the loss to use on your taxes this can be a very important consideration if trading index etf 's   if you have a loss in something like a s&p500 etf you would likely incur a wash sale if you sold it and bought a different s&p500 etf from another company since they are effectively the same thing   otoh if you sold an s&p500 etf and bought something like a stock market etf it should be different enough to not trigger the wash sale rule   if you are trying to minimize the taxes you pay on stocks there are basically two rules to follow   1 when a gain is involved hold things at least a year before selling if at all possible   2 capture losses when they occur and use to offset gains but be sure not to trigger the wash sale rule when doing so

what other pieces of info should i consider if you do n't have liquid case available for unexpected repairs then you probably do n't want to use this money for either option   the 7 return on the stocks is absolutely not guaranteed there is a good amount of risk involved with any stock investment paying down the mortgage by contrast has a much lower risk in the case of the mortgage you know you 'll get a 2.1 annual return until it adjusts and then you can put some constraints on the return you 'll get after it adjusts in the case of stocks it 's reasonable to guess that it will return more than 2.1 annually if you hold it long enough but there will be huge swings from month to month and from year to year the sooner you need it the more guaranteed you will want the return to be if you have few or no stock or assets then nearly all of your wealth is in your house and that is independent of the remaining balance on your mortgage if you are going to sell the house soon then you will want to diversify your assets to protect you against a drop in home value if you are going to stay in the house forever then you will eventually need non house assets to consume ultimately neither option is inherently better it really depends on what you need

pre qualification is only a step above what you can do with a rate payment calculator   they do n't check your credit history and credit score they do n't ask for verification of your income or verify that you have reported your debts correctly they also do n't guarantee the interest rate but if you answer truthfully and completely and nothing else changes you have an idea of how much you can afford factoring in the down payment and estimates of other fees taxes and insurance you can get pre by multiple lenders then base your decision on rates and fees   you want to get pre approved they do everything to approve you you can even lock in a rate you want to finalize on one lender at that point because you will incur some fees getting to that point then knowing the maximum amount you can borrow including all the payments taxes insurance and fees you can make an offer on a house once the contract is accepted you have a few days to get the appraisal and the final approval documents from the lender they will only loan you the minimum of what you are pre approved for and the appraisal minus down payment also do n't go with the lender recommended by the real estate agent or builder they are probably getting a kick back based on the amount of business they funnel to that company

you ca n't get there from here   this is n't the right data   consider the following five year history   2 16 32 14 1   that would give a 13 average annual return   now compare to 26 15 2 16   that would give a 4 average annual return    notice anything about those numbers   two of them are in both series   this is n't an accident   the first set of five numbers are actual stock market returns from the last five years while the latter five start three years earlier   the critical thing is that five years of returns are n't enough   you 'd need to know not just how you can handle a bull market but how you do in a bear market as well   because there will be bear markets    also consider whether average annual returns are what you want   consider what actually happens in the second set of numbers    but if you had had a steady 4 return you would have had a total return of 21 not the 8 that would have really happened   the point being that calculating from averages gives misleading results   this gets even worse if you remove money from your principal for living expenses every year    the usual way to compensate for that is to do a 70 bond mix or with five years of expenses in cash equivalent savings   with cash equivalents you wo n't even keep up with inflation   the stock bond mix might give you a 7 return after inflation   so the five years of expenses are more and more problematic as your nest egg shrinks   it 's better to live off the interest if you can   you do n't know how long you 'll live or how the market will do    from there it 's just about how much risk you want to take   a current nest egg of twenty times expenses might be enough but thirty times would be better   since the 1970s the stock market has n't had a long bad patch relative to inflation   maybe you could through with ten   but if the are like the 1970s you 'd be in trouble

if there is land for sale you can buy it the united states does n't have many restrictions on the purchase of land however you need to be able to afford it dependent on where you are looking $ 20,000 can either be a lot or very little land i suspect that the question you were looking to ask is can i afford it have a look around there should be plenty of places for you to find land for sale as for credit it is more important that you do n't build bad credit with things like mortgages your salary is likely to be more important than your credit score alone but no one will give you a dime if you have a record of not paying your bills

this article is misleading in it 's of its findings it does have a control group which is a good start but the findings are based on call center employees whose functions are almost perfectly suited for remote work in a way we already knew this because of how much call center work is outsourced and outside of provincial management in other words most companies do n't bother housing customer service call centers at company headquarters let 's see them try to replicate those results with other industries    treating the ability to work from home as a panacea is just as foolish as believing that workers ca n't ever be remote the truth is that individual personalities and more importantly an individual 's work functions are better suited for remote work than others and it takes good management to understand why they take the strategy they take with regards to remote work    all in all the study might be a good case study for encouraging remote work among call center employees but any further of that for other industries is going to be a baseless claim influenced by personal agendas

for the mortgage you 're confusing cause and effect loans like mortgages generally have a very simple principle behind them at any given time the interest charged at that time is the product of the amount still owing and the interest rate so for example on a mortgage of $ 100,000 at an interest rate of 5 the interest charged for the first year would be $ 5,000 if you pay the interest plus another $ 20,000 after the first year then in the second year the interest charge would be $ 4,000 this view is a bit of an over simplification but it gets the basic point across in practice you would actually make payments through the year so the actual balance that interest is charged on would vary different mortgages would also treat compounding slightly differently e.g. the interest might be added to the mortgage balance daily or monthly so it 's natural that the interest charged on a mortgage reduces year by year as you pay off some of the mortgage mortgages are typically setup to have constant payments over the life of the mortgage an schedule calculated so that by the end of the planned mortgage term you 'll have paid off all of the principal it 's a straightforward effect of the way that interest works in general that these schedules incorporate higher interest payments early on in the mortgage because that 's the time when you owe more money if you go for a 15-year mortgage each payment will involve you paying off significantly more principal each time than with a 30-year mortgage for the same balance because with a 15-year mortgage you need to hit 0 after 15 years not 30 so since you pay off the principal faster you naturally pay less interest even when you just compare the first 15 years in your case what you 're talking about is paying off the mortgage using the 30-year payments for the first 15 years and then suddenly paying off the remaining principal with a lump sum but when you do that overall you 're still paying off principal later than if it had been a 15-year mortgage to begin with so you should be charged more interest because what you 've done is not the same as having a 15-year mortgage you still will save the rest of the interest on the remaining 15 years of the term unless there are pre payment penalties for the car loan i 'm not sure what is happening perhaps it 's the same situation and you just misunderstood how it was explained or maybe it 's setup with significant pre payment penalties so you genuinely do n't save anything by paying early

i 'm not familiar with the model i 'll have to take a look at it sounds cool though   i think that all arbitrage free models are incomplete in the sense that they do n't say this is a price that does n't imply any arbitrage opportunities anywhere but instead say this is a price that does n't imply any arbitrage opportunities within a specific set of securities   what set you 're using will vary from one model to another and i 'd say although other people might reasonably disagree that taking a volatility structure as given is as much no arbitrage as taking a term structure as given   as a side note i 'd say that what theoretically distinguishes an equilibrium model is that you 're supposed to know the parameters not guess at them or observe them from the real world   by that definition a really complete capm or black scholes would explain how to derive the correct beta or volatility from fundamental analysis   also i 've upvoted you elsewhere for some really good comments you made about intrinsic value

gt;so i would like to ask you which at this project poor management skill of oracle staffs or plan of oregon are worse to be accused   i believe there is an increased burden on the employer oregon to effectively manage the scope of the work required for the project that the contractor oracle is working   otherwise the contractor has plausible for being able to provide deliver a quality working solution   gt;or do you think that plan was made mainly by oracle   i think the plan was mostly made by oracle with the requirements given by oregon and that 's where things seem messy   my gut tells me though that when an employer hires a contractor for the creation of a fully integrated enterprise system that the employer essentially signs their financial life away to the project in a way that the contractor of indirect or direct damages that come from the result of unforeseen implementation requirements or issues   oracle has been around long enough to know how to legally cover their asses   if there is anything that oregon may have traction on it would be a few of their fraud claims given that oracle has made two wiki with federal agencies of ~$100 amp ~$200 million since 2011 which were from allegations of fraud or false claims   such claims by oregon may be supported by the fact that they allegedly have a former oracle employee who can substantiate the poor quality of the product they were giving to oregon but that blame might go back to oregon 's specifications which i have no insight into   as someone who has witnessed a couple of employer and contractor relationships between public amp private entities my hope out of all of this is that   sales people for contractors think twice before over promising technology solutions that their company ca n't fully deliver on given resource constraints or lack of employer specifications   employers hiring such entities manage them expectations plus the overall project effectively while accepting personal accountability amp responsibility   i think the only people who have a clear picture of what was going on were anyone from either party who were on the front lines of managing the project developing the systems or running them

it 's not quite identical due to fees stock rights and reporting tax obligations   but the primary difference is that a person could have voting rights in a company while maintaining zero economic exposure to the company sometimes known as empty voting as an abstract matter it 's identical in that you reduce your financial exposure whether you sell your stock or short it   so the essence of your question is fundamentally true   but the details make it different   of course there are fee differences in how your broker will handle it and also margin requirements for shorting   somebody playing games with overlapping features of ownership sales and purchases may have tax and reporting obligations for straddles wash sales and related issues   a straight sale is generally less complicated for tax reporting purposes and a loss is more likely to be respected than someone playing games with sales and purchases but the empty voting issue is an important difference   you could buy stock with rights such as voting engage in other behavior such as forwards shorts or options to negate your economic exposure to the stock while maintaining the right to vote   of course in some cases this may have to be disclosed or may be covered by contract and most people engaging in stock trades are unlikely to have meaningful voting power in a public company   but the principle is still there as explained in the article by henry and bernie black hedge funds have been especially creative in voting rights from economic ownership sometimes they hold more votes than economic ownership a pattern we call empty voting in an extreme situation a vote holder can have a negative economic interest and thus an incentive to vote in ways that reduce the company 's share price sometimes investors hold more economic ownership than votes though often with voting rights the de facto ability to acquire the votes if needed we call this situation hidden ownership because the economic ownership and de facto voting ownership are often not disclosed

the signature actually back to the days before every business checked every transaction online when charge cards were introduced did n't exist nowadays stolen credit cards are usually reported within 24 hours and the card wo n't work businesses that face low fraud rates do n't bother checking they probably figure that a certain percentage of charges get charged back because the cardholder claims that they did n't make them and the credit card company usually just passes the cost on to the merchant so it 's really the merchant who should be worried about fraud since he or she is going to pay for it   the real question for the merchant is whether checking signatures actually reduces charge backs   if the credit card is stolen how hard would it be for thieves to practice the signature on the card a few times until they can reproduce it well enough to fool someone businesses that face high fraud rates are often more careful in new york city try buying some on street and you 'll get your signature checked your driver 's license checked and they 'll call up your 5th grade social studies teacher

if you 're losing money or breaking even you own a bad investment   the problem you have is that you are emotionally invested in your tenant that is n't a bad thing in general but it 's costing you money and unless interest rates fall enough to justify a refi or property taxes go down in your area that 's kind of unlikely to change   option 1 tell your wife that you are willing to accept a loss up to a certain level because of your long term relationship with your tenant in a perfect world the two of you would then discuss what the magic number would be where you got out and come to a compromise for example if you are comfortable losing up to $ 3,000 per year and she is unhappy with any loss you may agree on selling the house when your losses climb to $ 1,500 in a less perfect world it would cause an argument as she has already told you what she wants you to do   option 2 raise the rent to the break even point from what you 've said this will likely result in the loss of your tenant but you could then rent to someone else for significantly more   option 3 sell the house it 's an investment property which means it 's supposed to make money for you it can do that very quickly by way of a sale and then it 's no longer your problem option 4 sell the house to your tenant you bought it for $ 50,000 and it 's currently worth $ 150,000 roughly the problem you face is that property taxes have gone up and caused your mortgage to increase past your tenants ability to pay my guess is after 15 years your payoff is somewhere in the high $ 20 's to mid 30 's assuming you got a 30 year loan and have n't refinanced if you sell to her for say $ 75,000 or even up to $ 90,000 you will still make a profit wife is happy she will get a mortgage she can afford and be able to stay in the house you and the tenant are happy added bonus is that her property taxes would be lower assuming a different rate for investment property in your area i would discuss this at length with your wife as well before making such an offer   option 5 get a property management company as mentioned above they will keep a percentage but will remove your emotions from the equation altogether and turn the situation into a winner   i do n't know if your wife is right in saying you do n't have the stomach for this but i do think your heart is getting in the way in this particular situation i get the feeling that if your tenant was 25 years old and had only been renting from you since last october you would have no problem raising the rent to market levels at every renewal

the biggest issue with a pure physical dividend is the cost of transfer cash or stock dividends are decentralized and easy to transfer ownership hence the majority of value can be transferred to the shareholder    if you were to deliver wine to every shareholder you would have to deduct the cost of transport from the value of the wine dividend otherwise it becomes value to shareholders and they 'd be better off keeping the dividend as stock value

this means that if your capital under my management ends up turning a profit i will keep half of those profits but if i lose you money i will cover half those losses the bold part is where you lose me this absolutely exists with the exception of the loss insurance   it just requires a lot more than the general retail consumer investor has to contribute   nobody wants to take on the responsibility of your money then split 50 of the gross proceeds of your $ 10,000 or whatever nominal amount of money you 're dealing with investment and return it all to you after a year   and no money manager will insure that the market wo n't decline hedge funds pe firms vc firms investment partnerships etc all basically run the way you 're describing again without your loss insurance   everyone 's money is pooled and investments are made   everyone shares the and everyone shares the losses   and to top it off the people making investment decisions have their money invested in the fund   all of them have to pay rent and accountants and other costs associated with running the fund and that will eat in to the proceeds to some degree because returns are calculated on net proceeds with enough money you can buy yourself in to a hedge fund for the rest of us there are etfs and other extremely fee reasonable investment options   and if you do n't think the performance and preservation of assets under management is not an incentive to treat the money with care you 're kidding yourself your first bullet point i 'll add that aside from skewing the manager 's risk tolerance toward guaranteed returns i doubt you would fair favorably over the long term compared to simply paying even an egregious 1 expense ratio on an etf   if you look at the s&p performance for 10 or 20 or however many years i 'd venture that a couple good years of giving up half of your gains would have you screaming for your money back   the bad years would put the money manager out of business and the good years would squander your gains

in my opinion every person regardless of his or her situation should be keeping track of their personal finances   in addition i believe that everyone regardless of their situation should have some sort of budget spending plan for many people it is tempting to ignore the details of their finances and not worry about it   after all the bank knows how much money i have right   i get a statement from them each month that shows what i have spent and i can always go to the bank 's website and find out how much money i have right   unfortunately this type of thinking can lead to several different problems overspending   in olden days it was difficult to spend more money than you had   most purchases were made in cash so if your wallet had cash in it you could spend it and when your wallet was empty you were required to stop spending   in this age of credit and electronic transactions this is no longer the case   it is extremely easy to spend money that you do n't yet have and find yourself in debt   debt of course leads to interest charges and future burdens for the future   without a plan it is difficult to know if you have saved up enough for large future expenses   will you have enough money to pay the water bill that only shows up once every three months or the property tax bill that only shows up once a year   will you have enough money to pay to fix your car when it breaks   will you have enough money to replace your car when it is time   how about helping out your kids with college tuition or funding your retirement   without a plan all of these are very difficult to manage without proper accounting    anxiety   not having a clear picture of your finances can lead to anxiety   this can happen whether or not you are actually overspending and whether or not you have enough saved up to cover future expenses because you simply do n't know if you have adequately covered your situation or not   making a plan and doing the accounting necessary to ensure you are following your plan can take the worry out of your finances fear of spending   there was an interesting question from a user last year who was not at all in trouble with his finances yet was always afraid to spend any money because he did n't have a budget spending plan in place   if you spend money on a vacation are you putting your property tax bill in jeopardy   with a good budget in place you can know for sure whether or not you will have enough money to pay your future expenses and can spend on something else today this can all be done with or without the aid of software but like many things a computer makes the job easier   a good personal finance program will do two things keeps track of your spending and balances apart from your bank   the bank can only show you things that have cleared the bank   if you set up future payments outside of the bank or you write a check that has not been cashed yet or you spend money on a credit card and have not paid the bill yet these will not be reflected in your bank balance online   however if you manually enter these things into your own personal finance program you can see how much money you actually have available to spend lets you plan for future spending   the spending plan or budget lets you assign a job to every dollar that you own   by doing this you wo n't spend rent money at the bar and you wo n't spend the car insurance money on a vacation i 've written before about the details on how some of these software packages work   to answer your question about double entry accounting some software packages do use true double entry accounting gnucash ledger and some do not ynab everydollar mvelopes   in my opinion double entry accounting is an unnecessary complication for personal finances   if you do n't already know what double entry accounting is stick with one of the simpler solutions

no one here said doctors were infallible so you 're fighting your own strawman as usual    points raised were   1 efficacy of aspirin to which you said doctors were bad at stats irrelevant to the question of efficacy of aspirin    2 doctors are likely better at stats than the average person    then to back up your strawman you post an article about stats related specifically to cancer screening not or to doctors compared to the general public you sure defeated that strawman   and the beauty of your reasoning trying to argue with the poster about the efficacy of aspirin you said doctors were bad at stats yet in the article you posted who do you trust to talk about doctors statistical skill other doctors using statistics    so apparently the statistics of doctors only are trustworthy when they support your point but not when they do n't support your point you are an amazing collection of logical inconsistencies and inability to answer a question on topic   your logic is baffling it is as if you expect   people to believe you because you post a lot of peripheral things and   you confuse strawmen you introduce as the main point and then keep defeating it this is almost as beautiful as you trying to defend your claim a few days ago that india has more people than china   here 's a tip on what might be useful evidence    1 show that the evidence for or against aspirin is sound or not by ad hominem on the whole class of doctors but by looking at the actual evidence   2 find statistical literacy for doctors and average people either through some large survey or test and compare them or even make a plausible argument why doctors would be worse than average    good job excellent display of logic

gt;so where is all the money i mean labor has been produced to make things and wages paid to the laborers the things are purchased by other laborers who were paid for producing goods or services etc it 's a closed loop right    almost right the problem is that the wages paid to the laborers are not high enough to buy all the goods produced so there is constant overproduction and at the same time there are people who would want to buy these goods but ca n't afford them some people lose their jobs which reduces demand for goods even further it 's a vicious circle and loses in the long run

just because gold performed that well in the past does not mean it will perform that well in the future   i 'm not saying you should or should not buy gold but the mere fact that it went up a lot recently is not sufficient reason to buy it also note that on the house an investment that accrues continuous interest for 30 years at an annual rate of about will multiply by a factor of 10 in 30 years   that rate is pretty high by today 's standards but it might have been more feasible in the past i do n't know historical interest rates very well   yet again note that the fact that houses went up a lot over the last 30 years does not mean they will continue to do so

i would be more than happy to find a good use for your money well you have a bunch of money far in excess of your regular expenses the standard things are usually if you are very confused it 's probably worth spending some of your windfall to hire professional help it beats you in the dark and possibly doing something stupid but as you 've seen not all professionals are equal and finding a good one is another can of worms if you can find a good one it 's probably worth it even better would be for you to take the time and thoroughly educate yourself about investment by reading books and then make a knowledgeable decision being a casual investor ie not full time trader you will likely arrive like many do at a portfolio that is mostly a mix of s&p etfs and high grade eg govt and aaa corporate bonds with a small part 5 or so in individual stock and other more complicated securities a good financial advisor will likely recommend something similar i 've had good luck with the one at my credit union and can guide you through the details and technicalities of it all a word of caution since you remark about your car and house be careful about upgrading your lifestyle business is good now and you can afford nicer things but maybe next year it 's not so good what if you are by then too used to the high life to give it up and end up under mountains of debt humans are naturally optimistic but be wary of this tendency when making assumptions about what you will be able to afford in the future that said if you really have no idea hey take a nice vacation get an art tutor for the kids spend it well ideally not all of it on something you wo n't regret investments are fickle any asset can crash tomorrow and ruin your day but often experiences are easier to judge and less likely to lose value over time

it 's still the purchase price or the price at which the shares are purchased or granted this investopedia article describes how the price is used for tax purposes the amount that must be declared for tax purposes is determined by subtracting the original purchase or exercise price of the stock which may be zero from the fair market value of the stock as of the date that the stock becomes fully vested restricted stock awards are similar to stock options the employer promises to grant the employee a certain number of shares upon the completion of the vesting schedule the price at which the shares are purchased or granted if the price is zero is the exercise price

a growth fund is looking to invest in stocks that will appreciate in stock price over time as the companies grow revenues and market share a dividend fund is looking to invest in stocks of companies that pay dividends per share   these may also be called income funds in general growth stocks tend to be younger companies and tend to have a higher volatility larger up and down swings in stock price as compared to more established companies   so growth stocks are a little riskier than stocks of more established stable companies stocks that pay dividends are usually more established companies with a good revenue stream and well established market share who do n't expect to grow the company by leaps and bounds   having a stable balance sheet over several years and paying dividends to shareholders tends to stabilize the stock price lower volatility less speculation smaller swings in stock price   so income stocks are considered lower risk than growth stocks    funds that invest in dividend stocks are looking for steady reliable returns not necessarily the highest possible return they will favor lower more reliable returns in order to avoid the drama of high volatility and possible loss of capital funds that invest in growth stocks are looking for higher returns but with that comes a greater risk of losing value   if the fund manager believes an industry sector is on a growth path the fund may invest in several small promising companies in the hopes that one or two of them will do very well and make up for lackluster performance by the rest as with all stock investments there are no guarantees   investing in funds instead of individual stocks allows you invest in multiple companies to ride the average avoid large losses if a single company takes a sudden downturn   dividend funds can lose value if the market in general or the industry sector that the fund focuses on takes a downturn

from the way you frame the question it sounds like you more or less know the answer already yes you can make a non deductable contribution to a traditional ira and convert it to a roth ira here is wikipedia 's explanation regardless of income but subject to contribution limits contributions can be made to a traditional ira and then converted to a roth this allows for backdoor contributions where individuals are able to avoid the income limitations of the roth ira there is no limit to the frequency with which conversions can occur so this process can be repeated indefinitely one major caveat to the entire backdoor roth ira contribution process however is that it only works for people who do not have any pre tax contributed money in ira accounts at the time of the backdoor conversion to roth conversions made when other ira money exists are subject to pro rata calculations and may lead to tax liabilities on the part of the converter 9 do note the caveat in the second paragraph this article explains it more thoroughly the irs does not allow to specify which dollars are being converted as they can with shares of stock being sold for the purposes of determining taxes on conversions the irs considers a person ’s non roth ira money to be a single co sum hence if a person has any funds in any non roth ira accounts it is impossible to contribute to a traditional ira and then convert that account to a roth ira as suggested by various pundits and the wikipedia piece referenced above conversions must be performed on a pro rata basis of all ira money not on specific dollars or accounts say you have $ 20k of pre tax assets in a traditional ira and make a non deductable contribution of $ 5k the account is now 80 pre tax assets and 20 post tax assets so if you move $ 5k into a roth ira $ 4k of it would be taxed in the conversion the traditional ira would be left with $ 16k of pre tax assets and $ 4k of post tax assets

i think this is possible under very special conditions   the important part of the description here is probably retired and rich   the answers so far apply to people with normal incomes both in the sense of not rich and in the sense of earned income if you sit at the top tax bracket and get most of your income through things like dividends then you might be able to win multiple ways with the strategy described   first you get the tax deduction on the mortgage interest which everyone has properly noted is not by itself a winning game you spend more than you save    but there are other factors especially for the rich and those whose income is mostly passive i 'm not motivated enough on the hypothetical situation to come up with a detailed example but i think it 's possible that this could work out   in any case the current answers using normal sized incomes and middle tax brackets do n't necessarily give the insight that you might hope if the tax payer really is unusually wealthy and retired
