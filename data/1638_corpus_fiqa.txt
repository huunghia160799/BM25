lets pretend that your parents were given the opportunity to pay x for a year of college tuition in the year that you were born that would have been a significant portion of their yearly income   but what if they were given the opportunity to pay for that year of college when you are 18 but at the price it was when you were born that tuition bill would be much easier to pay that would be a very small amount of their yearly income   why the cost of tuition grew at a high inflation rate but the second option allowed them to skip inflation on the bill side but keep inflation regarding wages you asked about paying for stuff you want today with future money where my example was to pay new money for old expenses   if you believe that inflation will be high and your income will keep up with it it is advantageous to pay with future $ 's

i would think it depends on when within the 7 years you 're planning to move if you want to move within a year or two the closing costs for the new mortgage may postpone the break even until after your move date that would n't be a financially smart decision if your plans suggest you 're going to move after the break even point i 'd definitely refi sooner rather than later and would try to reduce the term either by overpaying or by choosing a 15 year mortgage that should have an even lower interest rate anyway

many people assume that if the price of something is $ 10 and they have 1,000 of that thing they should expect to be able to sell them for something around $ 10,000   such an assumption may hold much of the time but it does n't always   worse the cases where it fails to hold are often those where it would be relied upon most heavily   such an assumption should thus be considered dangerous in a liquid market the quantity of a something that people would be willing to buy at something close to the market price will be large relative to the quantity that people would seek to sell in the short term   if at some moment in time one person in the market was willing to immediately buy 500 shares at $ 9.98 and another was willing to immediately buy 750 at $ someone seeking to sell 1,000 shares could immediately receive $ for them selling 500 to the first person and 500 to the second who would then be ready to buy 250 more from the first person who was willing to sell for $   such behavior would be in line with what many people 's assumptions in an illiquid market however the quantity of something that people would be willing to buy near market price could be surprisingly low   this is more often a problem in the marketplace of things like collectibles than of stocks but the same thing can happen in the stock market   if there 's one potential buyer for a stock who thinks it 's overpriced but has potential and would be worth $ 9.50 but that person only has $ 950 to spend and nobody else thinks the stock would be worth more than $ then until people sold a total of 100 shares the price would be $ 9.50 but after that the price would drop instantly to $ 0.02   there would be no of the fall   if the person with 1,000 shares was first in line he 'd get to sell 100 shares for $ 950 to the aforementioned seller but would be unable to get more than $ 18 for the remaining 900 a major danger with markets is that markets which are perceived as liquid attract people to the buying side while those which are seen as illiquid people   the danger in the latter is obvious having people flee a seemingly illiquid market will reduce its liquidity further but the former is just as bad   having people flock to a market because of its perceived liquidity will increase its liquidity but can also create a false price floor causing demand to appear much stronger than it actually is   unless real demand increases to match the false price floor the people who buy at the higher price will never be able to recoup their investment

if john signs the lease he is entitled to stay there for the duration of the lease regardless of the foreclosure status    i would suggest that signing a year lease even by email with the plan to leave as early as possible is a good thing   the key will be to make sure the penalty for leaving early is nothing john does n't know the status of the foreclosure how long it will take who might own afterwards and a lot of other unknowns   the worst case is to be unsure of where you are living sign the lease and be secure for one whole year that you know where you will be living   spend that year finding a new place to live    if the bank does n't offer you clear and obvious ways to submit rent open an account at the bank and deposit the rent there on time you are establishing credibility that you deserve to stay   you still owe the rent so pay it they do n't want to be your landlord but do n't let a bank bully you around

i will solely address your fear because from what i read you fear investing in something that could possibly go down in the future   this is almost identical to market timing so let 's use the spy as an example   look at the spy on yahoo finance specifically in 2011   the market experienced a little bit of a pull back during the year and some analysts claimed that it would fall below 600 read this   in fact a co worker of mine said that he feared buying the s&p 500 in 2011 as well as in 2010 so he bought gold compare the two from 2011 to now to put it bluntly he experienced 50 less gain than i did did the s&p 500 ever fall below 600 in that timeframe or according to the linked analyst there were plenty of similar predictions then   no   if you avoid doing something because you 're afraid it could drop technically you should be just as afraid of it rising fear of losing everything vs. fear of missing out both are real   that 's not to say invest out of fear but that fear cuts both ways and generally we only look at it from one side retirement investing should be a boring automated process where ideally we do n't try and time the market though some will try and like in 2011 fail   if you ca n't help your fear you can always approach retirement investing with automated re balancing where you hold some money in less risky forms and others in higher risk forms and automate a rebalance every month or quarter

the simplest way is to invest in a few etfs depending on your tolerance for risk assuming you 're very short term risk tolerant you can invest almost all in a stock etf like voo or vti   stock market etfs return close to 10 unadjusted over long periods of time which will out earn almost any other option and are very easy for a non finance person to invest in you do n't trade actively you leave the money there for years   if you want to hedge some of your risk you can also invest in bond funds which tend to move up in stock market downturns but if you 're looking for the long term you do n't need to put much there otherwise try to make sure you take advantage of tax breaks when you can iras 401ks etc most of those will have etfs whether vanguard or similar available to invest in   look for funds that have low expense ratios and are fairly diversified ie do n't just invest in one small sector of the economy as long as the economy continues to grow the etfs will grow

arbitrage is basically taking advantage of a difference in price   generally extending to in different places for the same thing a monetary version would be stocks that is stocks in companies that are on both the nyse nasdaq and toronto stock exchanges   if somebody comes along and buys a large number of shares in toronto that will tend to make the price go up standard supply and demand but if someone else can buy shares instead in ny and then sell them in toronto where the first person is buying up shares where the price is higher they the the second person can make pretty easy money by its very nature this tends to bring the prices back in line as ny will then go up and toronto will then go down ignoring fx rates and the like for ease of explanation the same can work for physical goods although it does tend to get more complex with taxes duties and the like

never is n't that the whole idea of the limit order you want a bargain not the price the seller wants and when the market opens it is volatile at the most just an observation may n't be correct let it stabilize a bit the other thing is you might miss the opportunity but as an investor you should stick to your guns and say i would n't buy any higher than this or sell any lower than this as you are going long buying at the right price is essential you are n't going to run away tomorrow so be smart   probably this is what warren buffet said it is important to buy a good stock at the right price rather than buying a good stock at the wrong price there is no fixed answer to your question it can be anything you can check what analysts someone with reputation of predicting always say would be the increase decrease in the price of a stock in the projected future they do quite a lot of data crunching to reach a price do n't take their values as but from a number of sources and take an average or some sorts of it you can then take an educated guess of how much you would be willing to pay depending the gain or loss predicted else if you do n't believe the all do n't have a stellar reputation you can do all the data crunching yourself if you have the time and right tools

i moved from contributing 10 to maxing as my salary rose over the course of three years after graduation   because of my raises my monthly take home still increased so it was a pretty painless way to increase my 401(k contribution and also avoid lifestyle inflation that said i would not do it if you have any credit card debt school loans or an auto loan   pay that off first   then work on maxing the 401(k   personally i rate owning a home behind that but that 's partially because i 'm in an area where the rent ratios are barely on the side of buying so i do n't find buying to be a pressing matter one thing to investigate is if your company offers a roth 401(k option   it 's a nice option where you can go roth without worrying about income limits   my personal experience does not include a roth ira because when i still qualified for one i did n't know much about them and now that i know about them i have the happy issue of not qualifying

the most likely reason for this is that the relocation company wants to have a guaranteed sale so as to get a new mortgage in the new location   understand that the relocation company generally works for a prospective employer   so they are trying to make the process as painless as possible for the homeowner who is probably getting hired as a professional either a manager or someone like an engineer or accountant    if the sale is guaranteed to go through regardless of any problems then it is easy for them to arrange a new mortgage   in fact they may bridge the gap by securing the initial financing and making the downpayment then use the payout from the house you are buying to buy out their position   that puts them on the hook for a bunch of money a downpayment on a house while they 're waiting on the house you 're purchasing to close    this does not necessarily mean that there is anything wrong with the house   the relocation company would only know about something wrong if the owner had disclosed it   they do n't really care about the house they 're selling   their job is to make the transition easy   with a relocation company it is more likely that they are simply in a hurry and want to avoid a busted purchase   if this sale fails to go through for any reason they have to start over   that could make the employment change fall through    this is a variation of a no contingencies sale   sellers like no contingencies sales because they are easier   buyers dislike them because their protections are weaker   but some buyers will offer them because they get better prices that way   in particular house flippers will do this frequently so as to get the house for less money than they might otherwise pay   this is better than a pure no contingencies sale as they are agreeing to the repairs    this is a reasonable excuse to not proceed with the transaction   if this makes you so uncomfortable that you 'd rather continue looking that 's fine   however it also gives you a bit of leverage as it means that they are motivated to close this transaction quickly   you can consider any of the following    or you can do some combination of those or something else entirely that makes you fell more secure   if you do decide to move forward with any version of this provision get a real estate lawyer to draft the agreement   also insist on disclosure of any previous failed sales and the reason for the failure before signing the agreement   the lawyer can make that request in such a way as to get a truthful response    and again in case you missed it when i said this earlier   you can say no and simply refuse to move forward with such a provision   you may not get the house but you 'll save a certain amount of worry   if you do move forward you should be sure that you are getting a good deal   they 're asking for special provisions they should bear the cost of that   either your current deal is already good and it may be or you should make them adjust until it is

advantages of buying with every mortgage payment you build equity while with rent once you sign the check the money is gone eventually you will own the house and can live there for free you can or remodel to your own liking rather than being stuck with what the landlord decides is attractive cost effective etc here in the u.s. there are tax breaks for homeowners i 'm not sure if that 's true in u.k. advantages of renting if you decide to move you may be stuck paying out a lease but the financial penalty is small with a house you may find it difficult to sell you may be stuck accepting a big loss or having to pay a mortgage on the empty house while you are also paying for your new place when there are maintenance issues you call the landlord and it 's up to him to fix it you do n't have to come up with the money to pay for repairs you usually have less maintenance work to do with a house you have to mow the lawn clear snow from the driveway etc with a rental usually the landlord does that for you not always depends on type of rental but you can often buy a house for less than it would cost to rent an equivalent property but this can be misleading when you buy you have to pay property taxes and pay for maintenance when you rent these things are included in the rent how expensive a house you can afford to buy is not a question that can be answered objectively banks have formulas that limit how much they will loan you but in my experience that 's always been a rather high upper bound much more than i would actually be comfortable borrowing the biggest issue really is how important is it to you to have a nice house if your life long dream is to have a big luxurious expensive house then maybe it 's worth it to you to pour every spare penny you have into the mortgage other people might prefer to spend less on their house so that they have spare cash for a nice car concert tickets video games cocaine whatever bear in mind that if you get a mortgage that you can just barely afford what do you do if something goes wrong and you ca n't afford it any more what if you lose your job and have to take a lower paying job what if some disaster strikes and you have some other huge expense etc on the flip side the burden of a mortgage usually goes down over time most people find that their incomes go up over time between inflation and growing experience but the amount of a mortgage is fixed or if it varies it varies with interest rates probably bouncing up and down rather than going steadily up like inflation so it 's likely not at all certain but likely that if you can just barely afford the payment now that in 5 or 10 years it wo n't be as big a burden

paying interest on a loan costs you money the tax deduction just reduces that cost but it 's still there so the only possible reason to borrow more than you have to e.g. with the interest only loan is that you can invest the excess elsewhere and make more money can you invest money and make more than 4.5 expected return before tax with a risk level you 're comfortable with if you can invest tax free then the hurdle is tax deduction instead e.g. 3.6 if your marginal tax rate is 20   one possible such investment would be paying down any mortgage on your own home as you do n't get a tax deduction for such a mortgage overpayments are effectively tax free so 3.6 or whatever is the appropriate hurdle if you ca n't do that then even switching to a principal and interest mortgage at 4.5 would be worthwhile the principal payments would effectively be an investment in reducing your future interest bill and that investment is better than anything else you have available given that what you actually have on offer is a mortgage with a lower rate of interest the hurdle for an alternative investment is quite a bit higher than 4.5 with the interest only mortgage you can invest some of the money that would otherwise go to principal elsewhere but in exchange you are paying a higher interest rate on the rest of your loan balance you 'd need to look at the exact numbers to work out the right hurdle which would vary depending on your marginal tax rate the term of the mortgage and your guess as to where interest rates would go after the 2 year fixed term

if the correction results in you owing them money you typically just need to pay them the appropriate amount i believe they charge back dated interest on the amount if it was supposed to have been paid in the past but if it 's for this year 's taxes then payment is n't due until the end of april and so interest would not apply in some circumstances they may apply fines or press charges for tax evasion but only if they have reason to believe you intentionally knowingly attempted to your tax return in order to avoid paying taxes you can challenge their decision to fine you but you are considered guilty until proven innocent obviously that 's the opposite for any criminal charges the good news is lots of people accidentally enter the wrong numbers and the cra is aware of this and rarely takes action against them other than making them pay what they owe they have ways to look for suspicious behavior and differentiate that from innocent mistakes so do n't worry you should be fine not fined

while this is a totally personal decision i still think it would be a good idea to have some life insurance simply because you have someone that is currently dependent on your income   yes you have about 22 years in retirement but if you consider taxes and market risk there 's still some uncertainty there    also while your wife may be willing and able to work now will she want to do that for years just to earn living expenses    i would look at the costs on 10-year term life insurance and see if it 's worth the extra peace of mind to you and your wife   if your wife is fine with using your retirement as life insurance then you can probably be ok without it so to answer the question it may be acceptable but it 's generally a very cheap way to get a lot of peace i would not worry too much about the opinions of your parents unless they are going to pay for the insurance it 's your decision

if you do n't want to take any risk and you want your money to be liquid then the best place to invest such money is in an insured bank deposit such as a high interest savings account however you are n't likely to find a savings account interest rate that comes close to that charged by your mortgage so the better decision from a numbers perspective is to pay down more on your mortgage or other debt paying down your debt has almost no risk but has a better payoff than simply saving the money in a bank account however if you choose to pay down more debt i suggest you still keep aside enough cash to have an adequate emergency fund   since you want safety and liquidity do n't expect high returns from such money

all very good answers for the most part but i have a definition for good and bad debt which is a little bit different from those mentioned here so far the definitions come from robert kiyosaki in his book rich dad poor dad which i have applied to all my debts good debt good debt is debt used to fund a money making asset an asset which puts money into your pockets or bank account each month in other words the income produced by that asset is more than all the expenses including the interest repayments on the debt associated with the asset bad debt bad debt is debt used to fund both money losing assets and non assets where the interest repayments on the debt are more than any income if any at all produced by the goods or services the debt was used to purchase so that you need to take money out of your pockets or bank account each month to sustain the debt based on this definition a mortgage used to purchase the house you live in would be classed as bad debt why because you are making interest repayments on the mortgage and you have other expenses related to the house like rates and maintenance but you have no income being produced by the house even a mortgage on an investment or rental property where the rent is not enough to cover all the expenses is considered to be bad debt for the debt on an investment property to be considered as good debt the rent would have to cover the full interest payments and all other expenses in other words it would need to be a positively geared or a cashflow positive asset why is this definition important in distinguishing between good and bad debt because it looks at the cashflow associated with the debt and not the profit the main reason why most investors and businesses end up selling up or closing down is due to insufficient cashflow it may be a profitable business or the value of the property may have increased since you bought it but if you do n't have enough cash every month to pay the bills associated with the asset you will need to sell it if the asset produces enough cashflow to pay for all the expenses associated with the asset then you do n't have to fund the asset through other sources of income or savings this is important in two ways firstly if you are working and suddenly lose your job you do n't have to worry about paying for the asset as it is more than paying for itself secondly if you do n't have to dig into your other source s of income or savings to sustain the asset then theoretically you can buy an unlimited number of similar type assets just a note regarding the mortgage to buy a house you live in being classed as bad debt even though in this definition it is considered as bad debt there are usually other factors which still can make this kind of debt worthwhile firstly you have to live and the fact that you have to live means that if you did not buy the house you would probably be renting instead and still be stuck with a similar monthly payment secondly the house will still appreciate over the long term so in the end you will end up with an asset compared to nothing if you were renting just another note to mention the definition provided by john stern debt is a technology that allows borrower to bring forward their spending it 's a financial time machine that 's a clever way to think of it especially when it comes to good debt

source see if you have access to it convertible notes are often used by angel investors who wish to fund businesses without establishing an explicit valuation of the company in which they are investing     when an investor purchases equity in a startup the purchase price of the equity implies a company valuation   for example if an investor purchases a 10 per cent ownership stake in a company and pay $ 1 m for that stake this implies that the company is worth $ 10 m some early stage investors may wish to avoid placing a value on the company in this way because this in turn will affect the terms under which later stage investors will invest in the company   convertible notes are structured as loans at the time the investment is made   the outstanding balance of the loan is automatically converted to equity when a later equity investor appears under terms that are governed by the terms set by the later stage equity investor   an equity investor is someone who purchases equity in a company suppose an angel investor invests $ 100,000 using a convertible note   later an equity investor invests $ 1 m and receives 10 of the company 's shares   in the simplest possible case the initial angel investor 's convertible note would convert to 1/10th of the equity investor 's claim   depending on the exact structure of the convertible note however the angel investor may also receive extra shares to compensate them for the additional risk associated with being an earlier investor the worst case scenario would be if the issuing company initially performed well meaning that the debt would be converted into shares and subsequently went bankrupt the converted shares would become worthless but the holder of the note would no longer have any recourse will twitter have to sell their offices and liquidate staff to close this debt this depends on the of the debt debt is serviced according to seniority the higher seniority debts will be paid off first and then only the lower seniority debts be serviced this will all be in the agreements when you enter into a transaction when you say liquidate staff you mean sell off their assets and not sell their staff into slavery

this is supply side nonsense the primary driver of growth is demand if demand is growing then lower taxes will allow the company to meet growing demand faster however if demand is stable and currently being met by the company reducing taxes will only enrich shareholders at the expense of society at large unless there is growing demand a corporation will always choose to allocate profit via tax cuts to shareholders rather than to employees in the form of jobs or raises

if you are considering this to be an entry for your business this is how you would handle it you said you were making a balance sheet for monthly expenses so on the balance sheet you would be debiting cash for the income statement side you would be crediting owner 's equity to balance the equation assets = liabilities + owner 's equity so if you deposited $ 100 to your account the equation would be affected thus $ 100 in assets debit to cash account = 0 liabilities $ 100 credit to owner 's equity it is correctly stated above from the bank 's perspective that they would be crediting you account with $ 100 and any outflow from the bank account would be debiting your account

the thing you get wrong is that you think the llc does n't pay taxes on gains when it sells assets   it does in fact in many countries llc are considered separate entities for tax properties and you have double taxation the llc pays its own taxes and then when you withdraw the money from the llc to your own account i.e. take dividends you pay income tax on the withdrawal again corporate entities usually do not have preferential tax treatment for investments in the us llc is a pass though entity unless explicitly chosen to be taxed as a corporation and then the above scenario happens pass through entities llcs and partnerships do n't pay taxes but instead report the gains to the owners which then pay taxes as if the transaction was their personal one so if you 're in the us investing under llc would have no effect whatsoever on your taxes or adverse effect if you chose to treat it as a corporation in any case investing in stocks is not a deductible expense and as such does n't reduce profits

price does n't mean anything   price is simply total value market capitalization divided by number of shares make sure you consider historical dividends when hunting for big yields   it 's very possible that the data you 're pulling is only the annualized yield on the most recent dividend payment typically dividends are declared in dollar terms   the total amount of the dividend to be issued is then divided by the number of shares and paid out   companies rarely probably never but rarely to avoid the peanut gallery comments about the one company that does this decide dividend payments based on some proportion of the stock price    between company a and company b paying approximately the same historical yield i 'd look at both companies to make sure neither is circling the tank   if both look strong i 'd probably buy a bit of both   if one looks terrible buy the other one   do n't pick based on the price

yeah i 'll take the challenge how trustworthy these are and what are their sources of income these are in fact two separate questions but the answers are related how trustworthy as trustworthy as they 're clear about their own sources of income if you can not find any clue as to why what for and how they 're paying you you probably should walk away what 's too good to be true usually is indeed too good to be true for those of the sites that i know of their sources of income it is usually advertisements and surveys to get paid you have to watch advertisements and/or answer surveys i know of some sites who are legit and pay people not money but gift cards airline miles etc for participating in surveys my own kaiser in california in fact pays small amounts to members who participate in enough surveys so its legit are these sites worthwhile to consider for extra income not something you could live off but definitely can get you enough gift cards for your weekly trip to starbucks what do i need to consider tax wise usually the amounts are very low and are not paid in cash while it is income i doubt the irs will chase you if you do n't report the $ 20 amazon gift card you got from there it should strictly speaking be reported probably as hobby income on your tax return most people do n't bother dealing with such small amounts though in some cases like the i mentioned its basically a rebate of the money paid you pay your copays deductibles etc since the surveys are only for members you basically get your money back not additional income this is in fact similar to credit card rebates is there a best practice for handling the income if we 're talking about significant amounts more than $ 20 30 a year then you need to keep track of the income and related expenses and report it as any other business income on your taxes schedule c. is there a good test to determine what is and is n't a scam as i said if it looks too good to be true it most likely is if you 're required to provide your personal financial information without any explanation as to why what it will be used for and why and what for you 're going to be paid i 'd walk away otherwise you can also check internet reviews bbb ratings ftc information and the relevant state agencies and consumer for example whether they 've heard of that particular site and what is the information they have on it a very good sign for a scam is contact information do they have a phone number to call to is it in your own country if its not in your own country definitely go away for example the original link that was in the question pointed to a service whose phone number is in the uk but listed address is in los angeles ca a clear sign of a scam if they do have a phone number try it talk to them call several times and see how many different people you 're going to talk to if its always the same person run and hide do they have an address if not walk away if they do look it up is it a a virtual office or do they have a proper office set up which you can see on the map and in the listings as their office and of course your guts if your guts tell you its a scam it very likely is

the property tax valuation and the fair market price are not one and the same   they track each other correlate to each other but are almost never the same number in some parts of the usa a municipality has to re assess property tax values every ten years   in these places the tax value of a property is on something like a 10-year moving average not on the volatile daily market price edit   it is easy to fall into the trap of thinking that property tax valuation is intended to represent fair market value   it 's intent is to provide an accurate or as accurate as possible relative valuation of your property compared to the other properties in the municipality the sum of all the property values is the tax base of the municipality   when the town budget which is paid in part via property taxes is set the town simply divides the tax base into the budget total to arrive at the ratio of tax to collect to the tax base also called the tax rate per thousand dollars of valuation   i.e. if the town tax base is us$ 10,000,000 and the town budget is us$ 500,000 then the ratio is 0.05 or $ 50 per thousand dollars of valuation   if your property is assessed at us$ 100,000 then you would pay 100 x $ 50 or $ 5000 in property taxes that year since this is the goal of the property tax valuation not deciding what your house is worth on the open market then we are left with the question of why use the market value of a house for property assessment and the answer is that of all the various schemes and algorithms you can try fair market value is the easiest and most accurate if time are taken out   for example if i buy a house in a development for $ 250,000 today and next summer the housing market crashes and you buy the identical house next door to me for $ 150,000 it does not stand to reason that you should pay less taxes than me because your house is worth $ 100,000 less   in fact both our houses are worth $ 100,000 less what matters most in property tax valuation is n't the actual number but rather is your valuation the same as other essentially similar properties in your tax base   getting the relative ratio of value between you and your neighbors correct is the goal of property tax valuation

in the united states short term capital gains are taxed at rates similar to regular income which is 25 if you make less than $ and 28 if you make more than that but less than $ 190,000 if you make more than $ 190,000 then the rate is 33 if you hold the stock for a year or more than the tax rate is 15 unless your income is less than $ in which case there is no tax on long term gains as a general rule the way to make money is to stay out of debt so i can not advise you to assume a mortgage financially you are better off investing your money much like you i bought a house with a mortgage using about $ 30,000 in a down payment about 20 years ago and i paid it off a few years ago if i had to do it over again i would have bought a shack a steel building for $ 30,000 and lived in that and invested my income if i had done that i would be about $ 500,000 richer today than i am now

paying off your house quickly should be a priority behind making sure you have some basic savings but definitely ahead of any investing concerns because your house is not an investment it 's your home   if you 're brave foolish enough to try buying houses as investments in the current climate this obviously does n't apply to you this is n't a financial matter so much as an issue of basic prudence   if something disastrous happens you lose your job get in a serious car accident your kid comes down with cancer etc it will put tremendous strain on your financial resources   if you own your home outright when this happens it means that no matter what else might go wrong you ca n't get foreclosed on and end up out on the streets and that 's worth more than any rate of return you can reasonably expect to find even in the best of times it 's a well known investing to never bet anything that you ca n't afford to lose   in light of that consider this if you have a mortgage that is not paid off that 's exactly what you 're doing   you are placing a bet against a bank that you 'll remain solvent long enough to pay off the mortgage and your home is the wager   mortgages may be a necessary evil with housing prices being what they are but make no mistake they are evil   get rid of yours as quickly as you can

although it may be a little late for you the real answer is this   when you close on a mortgage for a primary residence you are in an affidavit two intents now these are intentions not guarantees so if a homeowner has a change of circumstance and can not meet these affirmed intentions there is almost always no penalty   frankly the mortgage holder 's primary concern is you make payments on time and they likely wo n't bother with any inquiry    that being said should a homeowner have a pattern of buying primary residences and in less than 1 year converting that primary to a rental and purchasing a new primary there will likely be a grounds for prosecution for mortgage fraud in your specific situation you can not legally sign the owner occupancy affidavit with the intention of not staying for 1 year   a solution would be to purchase the condo as a second home or investment both of which you can still typically get 80 financing   a second home is tricky i would ask your lender what their requirements are for 2nd home classification    outside that you could buy the condo as a primary stay in it for a year then convert   if you absolutely had to purchase the 2nd property before 1 year you could buy it as a primary with a 2 month rent back once you reach 10 months   should you need it earlier just buy the 2nd house as an investment then once you move in refinance it as a primary this last strategy requires some planning ahead and you should explain your intention to the loan officer ahead of time so they can properly price the non owner occupied loan

i would say generally the answer is no    there might be some short term relief to people in certain situations but generally speaking you sign a contract to borrow money and you are responsible to pay   this is why home loans offer better terms then auto loans and auto loans better than credit cards or things like furniture   the better terms offer less risk to the lender because there are assets that can be repossessed   homes retain values better than autos autos better than furniture and credit cards are not secured at all people are not as helpless as your question suggests   sure a person might lose their high paying job but could they still make a mortgage payment if they worked really hard at it   this might mean taking several part time jobs   now if a person buys a home that has a very large mortgage payment this might not be possible   however wise people do n't buy every bit of house they can afford    people should also be wise about the kinds of mortgages they use to buy a home   many people lost their homes due to missing a payment on their interest only loan   penalty rates and fees jacked up their payment that was way beyond their means   if they had a fixed rate loan the chance to catch up would have not been impossible perhaps an injury might prevent a person from working   this is why long term disability insurance is a must for most people   you can buy quite a bit of coverage for not very much money typical us households have quite a bit of debt   car payments phone payments and either a mortgage or rent and of course credit cards   if income is drastically reduced making all of those payments becomes next to impossible   which one gets paid first   just this last week i attempted to help a client in just this situation   they foolishly chose to pay the credit card first and were going to pay the house payment last if there was anything left over   there was n't and they are risking eviction renters      people finding themselves in crisis generally do a poor job of paying the most important things first   basic food first housing and utilities second etc   let the credit card slip if need be no matter how often one is threatened by creditors   they do this to maintain their credit score how foolish i feel like you have a sense of associated with debt   it is there and real despite many people noticing it   there is also the fact that compounding interest is working against you and with your labor you are enriching the bank   this is a great reason to have the goal of living a debt free life   i can tell you it is quite

first of all congratulations on admitting your problem and on your determination to be debt free   recognizing your mistakes is a huge first step and getting rid of your debt is a very worthwhile goal when considering debt consolidation there are really only two reasons to do so reason 1 to lower your monthly payment   if you are having trouble coming up with enough money to meet your monthly obligations debt consolidation can lower your monthly payment by extending the time frame of the debt   the problem with this one is that it does n't help you get out of debt faster   it actually makes it longer before you are out of debt and will increase the total amount of interest that you will pay to the banks before you are done   so i would not recommend debt consolidation for this reason unless you are truly struggling with your cashflow because your minimum monthly payments are too high   in your situation it does not sound like you need to consolidate for this reason reason 2 to lower your interest rate   if your debt is at a very high rate debt consolidation can lower your interest rate which can reduce the time it will take to eliminate your debt the consolidation loan you are considering is at a high interest rate on its own   now it is true that some of your debt is higher than that but it looks like the majority of your debt is less than that rate   it does n't sound to me that you will save a significant amount of money by consolidating in this loan   if you can obtain a better consolidation loan in the future it might be worth considering from your question it looks like your reasoning for the consolidation loan is to close the credit card accounts as quickly as possible   i agree that you need to quit using the cards but this can also be accomplished by destroying the cards   the consolidation loan is not needed for this you also mentioned that you are considering adding $ 3,000 to your debt   i have to say that it does n't make sense at all to me to add to your debt especially at when your goal is to eliminate your debt   to answer your question explicitly yes the cash buffer from the loan is a very bad idea here is what i recommend this is based on this answer but customized for you cut up destroy your credit cards   today   you 've already recognized that they are a problem for you   cash checks and debit cards are what you need to use from now on start working from a monthly budget assigning a job for every dollar that you have   this will allow you to decide what to spend your money on rather than arriving at the end of the month with no idea where your money was lost   budgeting software can make this task easier   see this question for more information your first goal should be to put a small amount of money in a savings account perhaps $ 1000 $ 1500 total   this is the start of your emergency fund   this money will ensure that if something unexpected and urgent comes up you wo n't be so cash poor that you need to borrow money again   note this money should only be touched in an actual emergency and if spent should be replenished as soon as possible   at the rate you are talking about it should take you less than a month to do this after you 've got your small emergency fund in place attack the debt as quickly and aggressively as possible   the order that you pay off your debts is not significant the optimal method is up for debate   at the rate you suggested $ 2,000 2,500 per month you can be completely debt free in maybe 18 months as you pay off those credit cards completely close the accounts   ignore the conventional wisdom that tells you to leave the unused credit card accounts open to try to preserve a few points on your credit score   just close them after you are completely debt free take the money that you were throwing at your debt and use it to build up your emergency fund until it is 3 6 months worth of your expenses   that way you 'll be able to handle a small crisis without borrowing anything if you need more help motivation on becoming debt free and budgeting i recommend the book the total money makeover by dave ramsey

it 's not a 60 raise he made 60 more than the previous year there 's lots of things that could account for that one of them is an annual bonus that was larger than his previous annual bonus the calculation of that bonus was likely negotiated as part of his contract   a large chunk of the gains seems to be between that and stock option awards often stock option vest differently in the first year than remaining years and the value changes over time as the stock market moves if you have options granted with a strike price set based on the closing price of stock the day you start and you cash them out as you get them after a year if it 's gone up 5 you make a bit after the second year if it 's gone up 10 you doubled your income from that source even though you did n't receive any more options that year   his salary raise does n't seem out of line i 've gotten larger raises in my career   now suppose all of his compensation was spread out evenly across all of the employees cat has a bit over 100 k employees his total compensation was $ 16 m 16 m 100 k = $ 160 you could give every employee $ more for the cost of the ceo 's entire compensation package that comes out at 7 8 cents hour if you only do it with his raise and not the one time bonuses and returns from stock option grants well $ yr   the best way to invest in people is to offer training to help them move to higher value jobs things like tuition reimbursement programs based on maintaining good performance in classes are solid benefits to offer or even job training to those who show aptitude for different classes of work maybe some merit based bonus structure people who come up with good ideas for cutting costs improving efficiency etc and work to see them implemented qualify for some sort of bonus based on a percentage of the value of that change   the bigger problem with those types of programs is that collective bargaining agreements tend to forbid any sort of merit based pay they also make jumping line in seniority impossible i.e. the union agreement would say that the person most qualified for the extra training is the one who 's been in the job the longest some of these rules make sense if your goal is that everybody is equal and your idea of fairness is based on avoiding inequality to justify it they 'll throw up things like the boss 's cousin 's brother in law 's ex wife 's son could get preferential treatment if the contract does n't prevent it

20-year treasury bonds are not equivalent to cash not even close   even though the bonds are backed by the full faith and credit of the u.s. government they are long term debt and therefore their principal value will fluctuate considerably as market interest rates change when interest rates rise the market value of 20-year bonds will drop and drop more than shorter term bonds would   your principal is not protected in the short term   principal is only guaranteed returned at the 20-year maturity of those bonds   but oops there is no maturity on the 20-year bond etfs because every year the etf rolls the positions into new 20-year positions for an equivalent to cash piece of a portfolio i 'd want my principal to be intact over the short term and continually reinvested at the higher short term rates as rates are rising   reinvesting at short term rates can be an inflation hedge   but money locked in for is a sitting duck for inflation still inflation aside why do we want our equivalent to cash position to be relatively liquid and principal protected when it comes time to rebalance your portfolio after disastrous equity and/or bond returns you 've got in your cash component some excess weighting since it was unaffected by the disastrous performance that excess cash is ready to be deployed to purchase equities and/or bonds at the lower current prices   rebalancing from cash can add a bonus to your returns and smooth volatility   if you have no cash component and only equities and bonds you have no money to deploy when both equities and bonds are depressed   you did n't keep any powder dry   and btw i would personally keep a bit more than 3 of my powder dry consider a short term cash deposit or good money market fund for your equivalent to cash position

you have interpreted the instructions correctly the issue with two jobs at the same time is that that second job will be taxed at the highest rate but the second employer has no idea what the other position is paying you   if you make enough to be in the 15 tax bracket for your main job that means some of the money from each paycheck is   taxed zero some is taxed at 10 and the last dollars are taxed at 15 but the second job should withhold for taxes to cover all the income at 15 to avoid problems you should look at the tax form you are filling out this year look at the total tax you paid not the refund or the amount you owed when you filed but your total tax paid the government allows a safe harbor if you make sure that in 2016 you have the same amount withheld this calendar year if that is n't enough you will owe money in april 2017 but you will not have to pay a penalty after you have a couple of paycheck from your main employer check to see that if you work the rest of the year at that same rate that the federal withholding will make the safe harbor if you will make it   you do n't have to worry about the penalty if you will fall short adjust the w-4 accordingly

you need to negotiate with your broker to allow you to do more exotic order types   one in particular i recommend is a hidden aka iceberg order   you enter two numbers   the first is the number of shares for your entire order the second is the amount that will be displayed in the book this is the tip of the iceberg the remaining shares are hidden below the surface the maker taker rule applies as follows the amount displayed will receive the rebate for providing liquidity   the amount hidden will be charged the fee for taking liquidity example you want to sell 10,000 shares total   you enter a hidden order for 10,000 shares with 1,000 displayed   on the level 2 screen traders will see 1,000 shares and those shares will stay displayed there until the entire order is filled   you receive a rebate for 1,000 shares you pay the brokerage fee for 9,000 shares also like one of the previous posters mentioned only trade high liquidity stocks   large market cap companies with high volume   this is why day traders love tesla amazon netflix etc large market cap high volume and high volatility   easy to catch $ 10 + moves in price hope this helps happy trading

i was going to ask do you feel lucky punk but then it occurred to me that the film this quote came from dirty harry is 43 years old   and yet the question remains the stock market as measured by the s&p has returned   compounded over the last 100 years but with a standard deviation just under 20 there are years when you 'll do better and years you 'll lose and i 'd not ignore the last decade which was pretty bad a loss for the decade   there are clearly two schools of thought one says that no one ever lost sleep over not having a mortgage payment the other school states that at the very beginning you have a long investing horizon and the chances are very good that the 30 years to come will bring a return north of 6 the two decades prior to the last were so good that these past 30 years were still pretty good compounded   there is no right or wrong here my gut says fund your retirement accounts to the maximum build your emergency fund you see if you pay down your mortgage but lose your job you 'll still need to make those payments once you build your security think of the mortgage as the cash side of your investing i.e. focus less on the relatively low rate of return 4.3 and more on the eventual result once paid your cash flow goes up nicely    edit in light of the extra information you provided your profile reads that you have a high risk tolerance low overhead no dependents and secure employment combine to lead me to this conclusion at 23 i 'd not be investing at 4.3 i 'd learn how to invest in a way i was comfortable with and take it from there   disclosure updated i am older and am semi retired i still have some time left on the mortgage but it does n't bother me not at 3.5 i also have a 16 year old to put through college but her college account i fully funded

first off i would label this as speculation not investing   there are many variables that you do n't seem to be considering and putting down such a small amount opens you to a wide variety of risks   not having an emergency fund for the rental increases that risk greatly   i assume that you would not have an emergency fund based upon the basic idea is to save up a 20 down payment on a property and take out a mortgage this type of speculation lent a hand in the housing bubble is your home paid off   if not you can reduce your personal risk by owning your home and have a pretty safe investment in real estate   mission accomplished my hope for you would be that you are also putting money in the market   historically it has performed quite well while always having its share of chicken

the danger to your savings depends on how much sovereign debt your bank is holding   if the government defaults then the bank if it is holding a lot of sovereign debt could be short funds and not able to meet its obligations i believe default is the best option for the euro long term but it will be painful in the short term   yes historically governments have shut down banks to prevent people from withdrawing their money in times of crisis   see argentina circa 2001 or us during great depression   the government prevented people from withdrawing their money and people could do nothing while their money rapidly lost value see the emergency banking act where title i section 4 authorizes the us make it illegal for a bank to do business during a national emergency per section 2 without the approval of the president   fdr declared a banking holiday four days before the act was approved by congress   this documentary on the crisis in argentina follows a woman as she tries to withdraw her savings from her bank but the government has prevented her from withdrawing her money if the printing press is chosen to avoid default then this will allow banks and governments to meet their obligations   this however comes at the cost of a seriously debased euro i.e. higher prices   the euro could then soon become a hot potato as everyone tries to get rid of them before the ecb prints more   the us dollar could meet the same fate what can you do to avert these risks   yes you could exchange into another currency   unfortunately the printing presses of most of the major central banks today are in   this may preserve your savings temporarily i would purchase some gold or silver coins and keep them in your possession   this you from the banking system and gold and silver have value anywhere you go   the coins are also portable in case things really start to get interesting   attempt to purchase the coins with cash so there is no record of the purchase   this may not be possible

you may use an app called or one that serves your area to check fliers while in the store if your preferred store has a price match policy this can save you a few bucks every trip just look up at the app what you are buying and price match it over the cashier it may or may not work on your store always ask first try to learn some of the products you always buy regular prices that way you can tell a real special from a fake one like i write here about the specials buy generic brands for things you do n't care that much like bleach and other cleaning products that does not have a real quality difference from the branded ones try different cheaper brands until you find one that is ok for you there are lots of ways to save money on groceries you just need the will to do so good luck

the catch is in the premium amount you pay in a pure term insurance there is no survival benefit you get paid only for the event i.e. when you die during the policy term the sum assured is paid to your nominee the money back on the other hand charges a huge premium typically 5x more than the pure term part of it is for the risk cover the balance is then invested in safe instruments and at the end if you survive you would get that money typical calculations would show that if you had yourself invested the difference in premium even in cd 's you would get much more money back the reason this product is available in the market is more of people can not part with money when they do n't get anything back to these vast majority it looks like insurance company is taking all their money and does n't give them back if they survive hence to make it seem better to these vast majority there is money back hence people all over the world buy these policy much more than a pure term policy

someone is paid a certain sum each month and wants to spend only a certain amount each month can he spend more and then take it out of next month 's payment using the example 100 month 1 60 first month save 40 second month 100 salary spend 70 save 30 overall savings 70 third month 100 salary spend 50 save 50 overall savings 120 so in short term or once a while doing this is fine however if and this depends on individuals it goes beyond control i.e. you keep spending say 90 every month you would have to save for quite a few months to get back to normal a better way would be to reverse this using the example 100 month 1 60 first month save 40 second month 100 salary spend 50 save 50 overall savings 90 third month 100 salary spend 70 save 30 overall savings 120 i.e. save more first and then spend rather than spending now and saying you will save in future generally this is the trap quite a few fall into specially when saving for retirement they keep putting it to future and very soon realize that they ca n't get back to the goal

yes the s corp can deduct up to the amount it actually incurred in expenses if your actual expenses to build the were $ 1000 then the $ 1000 would be deductible and your business should be able to show $ 1000 in receipts or inventory changes note you can not deduct beyond your actual expenses even if you would normally charge more for example suppose you invoiced the non profit $ 2000 for the and once the bill was paid you turned around and donated the $ 2000 back to the non profit in that case you would be deducting $ 1000 for your cost + $ 2000 donation for a total of $ 3000 but you also would have $ 2000 in income so in the end you would end up with a $ 1000 loss which is exactly what your expenses were to begin with it would probably be a good idea to be able to explain why you did this for free if somehow you personally benefit from it then it could possibly be considered income to you similar to if you bought a tv for your home with company funds it would probably be cleaner from an accounting perspective if you followed through as described invoice the non profit and then donate the payment back to them though not necessary it could lesson any doubt about your motives

i ca n't find the underlying legislation but a few online resources suggest that if you contact a lender about a payment plan they should put repayments on hold temporarily we do nât think it âs fair if your lender does nât help you    get on top of things if you ask for help or breathing space to sort    things out if you 've had problems repaying the loan you can complain if your payday lender did not offer to freeze interest and charges if you are able to make payments under a reasonable repayment plan by law they must suspend recovery of the debt for a reasonable period if you âre developing a repayment plan with a debt adviser or on your own i 'd start by making an immediate complaint to the lender make them aware that you 're unable to meet basic living expenses because of the money they took and ask for them to suspend collection temporarily and for the money to be returned i would also dispute the charge with your bank on the grounds that it should not have been taken given the circumstances and ask for them to credit your account while they investigate the dispute they may not be too keen given it 'll leave you overdrawn if they later reject the dispute but it 's worth asking in parallel with that contact citizens advice and/or the financial ombudsman details in the links and see if there 's anything they can do or suggest

years ago when buying checks through one 's bank was the sole option if you got a business account with a bank you had to buy business checks   one difference between a business account and a personal account was that on the business account the incorporated or unincorporated company say simply wonderful apps had the option of changing from john doe to richard roe as the treasurer of simply wonderful apps and the person signing the checks whereas a personal account in john doe 's name could not be changed to allow richard roe signature authority over the account   for a self employed person doing business as simply wonderful apps a personal checking account would do just as well   since the need to change the person responsible for signing checks might never arise it was of course important to have a separate checking account for the business because it made book keeping simpler and also separated business expenses deductible on schedule c from personal expenses but it was not necessary to have a business account or business checks to run a small business in addition to the various advantages described in other answers one advantage that i found for larger checks is that various money management programs could do things like print an address below the name on computer checks so that after folding   the check could be put into a window envelope and mailed directly for the one check to a page format the programs could print additional information on the blank area below the check e.g. explanations about the check company logo etc so it was convenient if one had to write several checks each month but if   outgoing checks are infrequent and extra security is not much of an issue there   is less reason to spend a lot extra on business style checks rather than the personal style checks

has a great answer about dividends generally but to answer your question specifically about yield traps here are a few things that i look for as with everything if it looks too good to be true it probably is   a 17 yield is pretty out of this world even for a reit   and i would n't bet on it holding up   compare a company 's yield to that of others in the same industry different industries have different standards for what is considered a high or low yield dividends have to come from somewhere and that somewhere is cash flow   look at the company 's financial statements   do they have sufficient cash flow to pay the dividend   have there been any recent changes in their cash flow situation   how are earnings holding up   debt levels cash on hand sudden moves in stock price   a sudden drop in the stock price will cause the yield to rise   sometimes this indicates a bargain but if the drop is due to a real worry about the company 's financial health see 2 it 's probably an indication that a dividend cut is coming what does their dividend history look like   do they have a consistent track record of paying out good dividends for years and years   companies with a track record of paying dividends consistently and/or increasing their dividend regularly are likely to continue to do so

in short yes by forward selling you enter into a futures contract by which you agree to trade euros for dollars us or singapore at a set rate agreed to by both parties at some future time you are basically making a bet you think that the dollar will gain on the euro and thus you 'd pay a higher rate on the spot than you 've locked in with the future the other party to the contract is betting against you he thinks the dollar will weaken and so the dollars he 'll sell you will be worth less than the euros he gets for them at the agreed rate now in a traditional futures contract you are obligated to execute it whether it ends up good or bad for you you can to avoid this buy an option by buying the option you pay the other party to the deal for the right to say no thanks that way if the dollar weakens and you 'd rather pay spot price at time of delivery you simply let the contract expire un executed the tradeoff is that options cost money up front which is now sunk whether you exercise the option or not the other party gets the option price that basically creates a point spread you win if the dollar appreciates against the euro enough that you still save money even after buying the option or if the dollar depreciates against the euro enough that again you still save money after subtracting the option price while you lose if the exchange rates are close enough to what was agreed on that it cost you more to buy the option than you gained by being able to choose to use it

no you have to reimburse the current mortgage you have and a new one for your new house a mortgage is a loan from a financial institution that accepts to give you money if you pay it back the total amount adding interests interests are the price you pay to the financial institution for it to give you money for a while in the mortgage you have an legal agreement with the financial institution on how to reimburse the total amount that is given to you for a while breaking that agreement is breaking the law the fact of the matter is that when 30 of your mortgage is reimbursed the financial institution own your house legally for real at 70 your live in the house own by the financial institution at 70 it is the same exact logic for a car loan the mortgage goes with a specific house at a legal address that you live in as a primary residence

there is actually a recent paper that attempted to buffett 's outperformance i 've quoted the abstract below berkshire hathaway has realized a sharpe ratio of higher than any other stock or mutual fund with a history of more than 30 years and berkshire has a significant alpha to traditional risk factors however we find that the alpha becomes insignificant when controlling for exposures to betting against beta and quality minus junk factors further we estimate that buffett âs leverage is about on average buffett âs returns appear to be neither luck nor magic but rather reward for the use of leverage combined with a focus on cheap safe quality stocks portfolio into ownership in publicly traded stocks versus wholly owned private companies we find that the former performs the best suggesting that buffett âs returns are more due to stock selection than to his effect on management these results have broad implications for market efficiency and the of academic factors

if you have the cash on hand to pay the tax on the amount you are transferring i recommend moving to a roth ira an ira is tax deferred you put in pretax contributions in to an ira and you are taxed on that money your contributions and interest earned when you withdraw it at retirement age 59 1/2   the idea being that you will be taking less out per year in your retirement years putting you into a lower tax bracket the major problem is most people draw out as much or more a year in their retirement years than when they were working a roth ira grows tax free you put after tax contributions into a roth ira you have paid taxes on the contributions and you are never taxed on the growth when you draw the money out at retirement you do n't pay any income taxes on that money let me give you an example for this example we will use the following information for both scenario we will invest $ 400 per month for a total of $ 4800 the current maximum is $ 5000 if you are under 50 years old $ 400 dollars after taxes is $ 300 invest $ 300 a month at age 65 you have you owe no taxes on this money it does n't matter how much you take out a year $ 400 dollars a month is taken pretax out of your paycheck invest $ 400 per month at age 65 you have $ you owe taxes of 25 as you draw that out for at total tax of = cash in your pocket the problem is if you draw out more than $ current 2010 filing single per year you will be pushed to a higher tax bracket and take more of your money away if you decide to buy a vacation home and you take out $ 250,000 to pay for it that 's counted as income for that year any you will be in the 33 tax bracket even if you can keep yourself to a low income the government forces your hand and makes you draw out more money at age 70 based on their tables forcing you into a higher tax bracket

you 're mostly correct although i think you 're missing something essential about no arbitrage versus an arbitrage argument   black scholes makes an arbitrage argument which is that the value of an option should be the same as any portfolio that has identical cash flows and this is generally a sound argument   notice however that bs is ultimately an equilibrium model it tells you the correct price of an option if the assumptions of bs hold and does n't necessarily match observed market prices   a no arbitrage condition or model deliberately incorporates observed prices or yields or whatever into the model so that there can not be an arbitrage opportunity implied by the model   this comes up a lot in term structure of interest rate problems where equilibrium models like or cox ross wo n't perfectly reproduce the current observed term structure and so imply an arbitrage opportunity   no arbitrage models like hull white specifically match the model 's term structure to observed yields prices so that there is no arbitrage opportunity between the observed term structure and your model of it   it 's important to note that this will still allow for arbitrage involving bonds that are not part of the observed term structure   as for equivalent martingale measures you might think about it more generally   the process involves changing the probability distribution from the actual which is hard to use for pricing to a different one that 's easier to use but will result in the same prices this is nearly always a risk neutral probability   you can think of equivalent martingale   pricing as asking how would this security behave and be priced in a world that is completely risk neutral and then making an argument that the prices are in fact equivalent   edit grammar

it 's clearly a risk but is it any different than investing in your own business yes it is different   if you own a business you determine the path of the business   you determine how much risk the business takes   you can put in extra effort to try to make the business work   you can choose to liquidate to preserve your capital    if you invest without ownership perhaps the founder retains a 50 plus one share stake then whomever controls the business controls all those things   so you have all the risks of owning the business in terms of things going wrong without the control to make things go right   this makes investing in someone else 's business inherently riskier    another problem that can occur is that you could find out that the business is fraudulent   or the business can become fraudulent   neither of those are risks if you are the business owner   you wo n't defraud yourself    angel investing that is to say investing in someone else 's startup is inherently risky   this is why it is difficult to find investors even though some startups go on to become wealthy google youtube facebook twitter etc   most startups fail   they offer the possibility of great returns because it 's really hard to determine which ones will fail and which will succeed   otherwise the business would just take out the same loan that jane 's getting and leave jane out of it

the limit order are matched based on amount and time the orders are listed highest to lowest on the buy side the orders are listed lowest to highest on the sell side if there are 2 sell orders for same amount the order which is first in time fractions of milliseconds is first   the about is the example as to how the orders would look like on any exchange   now the highest price the buyer is ready to pay is 20.21 and the lowest price a seller is ready to sell for is 20.25 hence there is no trade now if a new buy order comes in at 20.25 it matches with the sell and the deal is made if a new buy order comes in at it still matches at 20.25 similarly if a sell order come in at 20.21 it matches and a deal is made if a sell order come in at it still matches 20.21    incase of market order with the above example if there is a buy order it would match with the lowest sell order at 20.25 if there is not enough quantity it would match the remaining quantity to the next highest at and continue down similarly if there is a sell market order the it would match to the maximum a seller is ready to buy ie 20.21 if there is not sufficient buy quantity at 20.21 it will match with next for    if say there are new buy order at and sell orders at these will sit first the the above queue to be matched in your above example the lowest sell order was at at time t1 and hence any buy order after time t1 for amount or greater would match to this and the price would be however if the buy order was first ie at t1 there was a buy order for 20.21 and then at time later than t1 there is a sell order for say amount less than or equal to 20.21 it would match for 20.21 essentially the market looks at who was the first to sell at lower price or who was the first to buy at higher price and then decide the trade   edit to clarify xyz say if there is an sell order at $ 10 qty 100 there is a buyer who is willing to pay max $ 20 and is looking for qty 500 your key assumption that the buyer does not know the current sell price of $ 10 is incorrect now there are multiple things the buyer knows the lowest sell order is at $ 10 he can put a matching buy order at $ 10 qty 100 and say $ 11 qty 100 etc this is painful second lets say he puts a buy order at $ 10 qty 100 by the time the order hits the system someone else has put the trade at $ 10 and his order is fulfilled so this buyer has to keep looking at booking and keep making adjustments if its a large order it would be extremely difficult and frustrating for this buyer hence the logic of giving preference the later buy order says the max i can pay is $ 20 match at the current price and get the required shares

i 'm a not an accountant   but my feeling has been that the distinction between asset and liability is mainly a sign convention and comes from a wish to avoid negative numbers suppose you take out a loan for $ 1000 and deposit the proceeds in your bank account   under normal accounting conventions your bank account is an asset and the loan is a liability   after the loan bank has a balance of 1000 and loan has a balance of 1000   you can compute your net worth by adding all assets and subtracting all liabilities so in this case your net worth remains 0 if you treat loan as an asset account then after taking out the loan you should give it a balance of   under this convention you have lots of negative numbers to deal with everywhere which i suspect early accountants would have found inconvenient   the asset liability convention means you only need to deal with negative numbers in unusual situations overdrawn bank account overpaid loan etc likewise in theory you could treat expense accounts as negative income but i 'm not sure why you feel the need to reinvent the wheel by simplifying double entry accounting like this   the standard conventions are not that complicated and their major advantage is that they 're standard other people will be able to understand your books if they ever need to   say you want to hire somebody to do your taxes at some point if your books are kept in your own idiosyncratic system their job will be at best error prone and at worst impossible    it 's a bit like a proposal to simplify english spelling a this mit bee in sum but if can reed it it

the answer to your question is governed by the structure of the company and your ownership or lack thereof in the business   australian business can be structured the same way u.s. ones are as a sole proprietorship partnership llc or company   if you are only on the board and have no equity you can not be affected   you must have some amount of equity in the business to have any chance of being affected if the business is a sole proprietorship then the single individual running the business is personally responsible for all debt and the inability to pay obligations would result in personal bankruptcy which would in all likelihood affect your credit score it would in the u.s. if it is a partnership then anyone holding stock in the company is likewise personally responsible for a portion of the debt and can be subject to bankruptcy and credit score implications if the business is structured as a limited liability company or a corporation a stakeholder 's personal finances are separate from the business 's and their credit score can not be affected

i 'll add 2 observations regarding current answers   jack nailed it a 401(k match beats all but choose the right flavor account   you are currently in the 15 bracket i.e. your marginal tax rate the rate paid on the last taxed $ 100 and next taxed $ 100 you should focus on roth roth 401(k and if any company match that goes into a traditional pretax 401(k but if they permit conversions to the roth side do it you have a long time before retirement to earn your way into the next tax bracket 25 as your income rises use the deductible 401(k to take out money pretax that would otherwise be taxed at 25   one day you 'll be so far into the 25 bracket you 'll benefit by 100    traditional but why waste the opportunity to deposit to roth money    that 's taxed at just 15 to clarify the above this is the single rate table for 2015   for this discussion i am talking taxable income the line on the tax return designating this number if that line is $ or less you are in the 15 bracket and i recommend roth say it 's $ 40,000 in hindsight on should put $ in a pretax account traditional 401(k or ira to bring it down to the $ in other words try to keep the 15 bracket full but not push into 25   last after enough raises say you at $ 60,000 taxable that to me is far into the 25 bracket $ 20,000 or 1/3 of income into the 401(k and ira and you 're still in the 25 bracket one can plan to a point and then use the ira flavors to get it dead on in april of the following year   to ben 's point regarding paying off the student loan faster a $ 33 k income for a single person about to have the new expense of rent is not a huge income i 'll concede that there 's a sleep factor the long benefit of being debt free and wo n't argue the long term market return vs the rate on the loan but here we have the probability that op is not investing at all it may take $ to his 401(k capture the match my 401 had a dollar for dollar match up to first 6 of income this $ 45 k after killing the card may be his only source for the extra money to replace what he deposits to his 401(k and also serve as his emergency fund along the way

a general principle in finance is that you should n't stick with an investment or situation just because it 's how you 're currently invested you can ask yourself the following question to help you think it through if instead i had enough gbp to buy 20000 chf would i think it was a good idea to do so i 'm guessing the answer is probably no this way of thinking assumes you can actually make the exchange without giving someone too big of a cut with that much money on the line be sure to shop around for a good exchange rate

this is 100 accurate conversely an industry with two or three firms can be more competitive than one with 50 such as supermarkets or online platforms like uber where economies of scale can enhance competition between fewer but healthier players the last years of economic research is clear simply counting the number of firms in an industry tells you very little about competition

all else being equal you should look for more volatile riskier stocks technically it was all time value the entire value of an out of the money option is time value    what 's confusing is that time value is affected by numerous variables only one of which is time the reason volatility is the one to look at is that all the rest are likely already intuitive to you or are too minor an influence to worry about current risk free interest rates and a stock 's dividend payout during the life of the option affect the value of the call but are usually minor    higher interest rates makes call values higher and higher dividend yield makes call values lower longer time to expiration will increase the value of the call but you 're pretty likely already focused on that the strike price 's proximity to the current price affects the call 's value agreeing to sell a stock 5 above current levels will pay more than agreeing to sell it 10 above current levels but again this is likely obvious to you volatility or the percent by which the stock is likely to move up or down on a given day is almost certainly the variable that 's not already obvious stocks that jump all over the place have higher volatility than those that move more predictably      the reason that options calls and puts cost more on higher volatility names is that options payout is   in the case of calls the option holder gets all the upside but none of the downside other than what they paid for the      if one stock goes up or down $ 5 every day and another goes up or down $ 20 every day and you could pay some fixed amount to get that stock 's upside but not have any exposure to its downside other than that fixed amount you 'd pay more for the one that pays you $ 20 or $ 0 than you would for the one that pays you $ 5 or $ 0     that 's why higher volatility meaning larger daily moves makes optimum prices higher

i would like to add one minor point for clarity cosigning means that you alongside your friend enter into a contract with the bank it does not necessarily mean that you now have a contract with your friend although that could implicitly be concluded if the bank makes use of their contracted right to make you pay your friend 's debts with them this has no effect on your legal relationship with your friend of course you can hold him or her liable for your damages he or she has caused it is another question whether this would help you in practice but that has been discussed before

the response to this question will be different depending which of the investment you are using   value investors look at the situation the company is in and try to determine what the company is worth and what it will be worth in the future then they look at the current stock price and decide whether or not the stock is priced at a good deal or not if the stock price is priced lower than they believe the company is worth they would want to buy stock and if the price rises above what they believe to be the true value they would sell these types of investors are not looking at the history or trend of what the price has done in the past only what the current price is and where they believe the price should be in the future   technical analysis investors do something different it is their belief that as stock prices go up and down they generally follow patterns by looking at a chart of what a stock price has been in the past they try to predict where it is headed and buy or sell based on that prediction   in general value investors are longer term investors and technical analysis investors are short term investors   the advice you are considering makes a lot of sense if you are using technical analysis if you have a stock that is trending down your strategy probably tells you to sell buying more in the hopes of turning things around would be seen as a mistake it is like the gambler in vegas who keeps playing a game he is losing hoping that his luck changes   however for the value investor the historical price of a stock and even the amount you currently have gained or lost in the stock are essentially ignored all that matters is whether or not the stock price is above or below the true value determined by the investor for him if the stock price falls and he believes the company still has a high value it could be a signal to buy more the above advice does n't really apply for them   many investors do n't follow either of these strategies they believe that it is too difficult and risky to try to predict the future price of an individual stock instead they invest in many companies all at once using index mutual funds believing that the stock market as a whole always heads up over a long time frame those investors do n't care at all if the prices of stock are going up or down they simply keep investing each month and hold until they have another use for the money the above advice is n't useful for them at all   no matter which kind of investing you are doing the most important thing is to pick a strategy you believe in and follow the plan without emotion emotions can cause investors to make mistakes and start buying when their strategy tells them to sell   instead of trying to follow fortune cookie advice like do n't throw good money after bad choose an investment strategy make a plan test it and follow it cautiously after all it may be a bad plan for what it is worth i am the third type of investor listed above i do n't buy individual stocks and i do n't look at the stock prices when investing more each month your description of your own strategy as buy and hold suggests you might prefer the same approach

well if the bond notes are the only currency around then the electric company will have to choose from at least one of the money supplies to accept as payment bonds will be the cash   whichever firm they choose will just see their money demand go up     second it will most likely be implied that those people choosing to go into a certain money supply will want to look for a produced good or service in the economy from that firm before taking on it 's notes   if the supply has too much inflation for everyone than they can all move to another one that ensures their capital value     the idea of these systems is also to facilitate productive decision making which is one of the things are education system should do more of these days   this will be more possible when government is more limited to and more focused on the role of researcher and developer

in the us if it 's a large donation to a tax exempt organization or equivalent you may want to consider giving appreciated equities stocks bonds mutual fund shares which are now worth more than you paid for them   you get to claim the deduction 's value at the time you transfer it to their account and you avoid capital gains tax   they would pay the capital gains tax when they redeem it for cash but if exempt they get the full value and the tax is completely avoided   effectively   your donation costs you less for the same impact   it does take a bit of work to coordinate this with the receiving organization and there may be brokerage fees so it probably is n't worth doing for small within the same brokerage house may avoid those so again you should talk to the charity about what 's best but for larger donations where larger probably starts at a few thou it can save you a nice chunk of change

perhaps you can track your vat amounts in a liability account   using a tax liability account is a common thing in accounting to do this when you receive money split the transaction such that your actual revenue which you will keep after vat remittance goes into an asset account and the amount you will eventually have to pay back to the state goes into a liability account   later when you pay the vat back to the state your transaction will effectively pay back the liability with one end of your double entry decreasing the funds in your checking account and the other end decreasing the funds in your tax liability account having said that i 've found that there are many shortcomings in the cash flow report and i 'm not sure that using a tax liability account which i think is the right thing to do will necessarily solve this problem for you

you want to buy a house for $ 150,000   it may be possible to do this with $ 10,000 and a 3.5 downpayment but it would be a lot better to have $ 40,000 and make a 20 downpayment   that would give you a cushion in case house prices fall and there are often advantages to a 20 downpayment lower rate less mandatory insurance    you have an income of $ 35,000 and expenses of $ 23,000 if you are careful with the money what if you are n't   you should have savings of either $ 17,500 or $ 11,500 in case of emergencies   perhaps you simply were n't mentioning that   note that you also need at least $ 137 26 = $ more to cover mortgage payments so $ by the expenses standard   this is in addition to the $ 40,000 for downpayment and closing costs    what do you plan to do if there is a problem with the new house e.g. you need a new roof   or smaller expenses like a new furnace or appliance   a plumbing problem   damages from a storm   what if the tenants teenage child has a party and the place   what if your tenants stop paying rent but refuse to move out trashing the place while being evicted   your emergency savings need to be able to cover those situations    you checked comps comparable properties   great   but notice that you are looking at a one bathroom property for $ 150,000 and comparing to $ 180,000 houses   consider that you may not get the $ 235 for that house which is cheaper   perhaps the rent for that house will only be $ or less because one bathroom does n't really support three bedrooms of people    while real estate can be part of a portfolio balance would suggest that much more of your portfolio be in things like stocks and bonds   what are you doing for retirement   are you maxing out any tax advantaged options that you have available   it might be better to do that before entering the real estate market    i am a 23 year old australian man with a degree in computer science and a steady job from home working as a web developer i 'm a bit unclear on this   what makes the job steady   is it employment with a large company   are you self employed with what has been a steady flow of customers   regardless of which it is consider the possibility of a recession   the company can lay you off presumably you are at the bottom of the seniority   the new customers may be reluctant to start new projects while their cash flow is restrained   and your tenants may move out   at the same time   what will you do then    a mortgage is an obligation   you have to pay it regardless   while currently flush are you the kind of flush that can weather a major setback   i would feel a lot better about an investment like this if you had $ 600,000 in savings and were using this as a complementary investment to broaden your portfolio   even if you had $ 60,000 in savings and would still have substantial savings after the purchase   this feels more like you are trying to maximize your purchase   money burning a hole in your pocket and trying to escape    it would be a lot safer to stick to securities   the worst that happens there is that you lose your investment and it 's more likely that the value will be reduced but recover   with mortgages you can lose your entire investment and then some   yes the price may recover but it may do so after the bank forecloses on the mortgage

i would be very careful with annuity products if you do n't mind sharing what are the terms for the annuity   usually i would recommend not to use retirement account to pay off debt mainly because of the penalty that comes from withdrawing prematurely but in this case first of all stop contributing to the annuity account if you 're not contractually obligated second try to convert your annuity assets to more common equity debt products thirdly try to cut back on spending to pay off debt assuming you stopped paying 2x on housing since 30k debt should n't be that hard to pay off with 100k income lastly if all of the above are impossible you can withdraw from that account to pay off your debt

its definitely not a stupid question the average american has absolutely no idea how this process works i know this might be annoying but i 'm answering without 100 certainty    the fed would increase the money supply by buying back government bonds this increased demand for bonds would raise their price and therefore lower the interest return that they deliver since u.s. treasury bonds are considered to be the very safest possible investment their rate is the risk free rate upon which all other rates are based so if the government buys billions of these bonds that much money ends up in the hands of whoever sold them these sellers are the large financial organizations that hold all of our money banks and large investment vehicles now since bond rates are lower they have an incentive to put that money somewhere else it goes into stocks and investment in business ventures    i 'm less certain about how this turns into inflation that consumers will recognize the short answer is that there is only a finite number of goods and services for us to buy if the amount of money increases and there are still the same number of goods and services the prices will increase slightly    your question about printing money to pay off debts is too complex for me to answer i know that the inflation dynamic does play a role it makes debts easier to pay off in the future than they seem right now however causing massive inflation to pay off debts brings a lot of other problems

the assumption is not necessarily correct while the seven years affects the credit report the statute of limitations for collections may be different and is based on the state law where the debt was given or a federal law for na banks keep in mind that the creditor can reset the clock any time by taking legal action for example filing a lawsuit in a court to garnish some of his income or put a lien on some of his assets many   times just contacting the debtor is enough to reset the clock the statute of limitations on collections is a legal issue and he should talk to a lawyer about it different accounts may have different statutes affecting them

where do you live i have not seen a single instance where renting is cheaper per month then purchasing a home you are obviously doing well so i 'm not questioning the logistics just curious    $ 200,000 home or less is roughly $ 1,300 $ 1,500 a month with everything included property taxes etc based on when i was looking at homes to purchase to rent the same size home would have been about the same or more depending on the area texas and california being my main two areas of interest the property i purchased now was being rented out for $ 1,100 but a 30-year fixed mortage w/ property taxes is only about $ 630 a month

there are people well companies who make money doing roughly what you describe but not exactly they 're called market makers their value for x% is somewhere on the scale of 1 that is to say a scale at which almost everything is volatile but they use leverage shorting and hedging to complicate things to the point where it 's nothing like a simple as making a 1 profit every time they trade their actions tend to reduce volatility and increase liquidity the reason you ca n't do this is that you do n't have enough capital to do what market makers do and you do n't receive any advantages that the exchange might offer to official market makers in return for them contracting to always make both buy bids and sell offers at different prices hence the bid offer spread they have to be able to cover large short term losses on individual stocks but when the stock does n't move too much they do make profits from the spread the reason you ca n't just buy a lot of volatile stocks assuming i do n't make too many poor choices is that the reason the stocks are volatile is that nobody knows which ones are the good choices and which ones are the poor choices so if you buy volatile stocks then you will buy a bunch of losers so what 's your strategy for ensuring there are n't too many supposing that you 're going to hold 10 stocks with 10 of your money in each what do you do the first time all 10 of them fall the day after you bought them or maybe not all 10 but suppose 75 of your holdings give no impression that they 're going to hit your target any time soon do you just sit tight and stop trading until one of them hits your x% target in which case you start to look a little bit more like a long term investor after all or are you tempted to change your strategy as the months and years roll by if you will eventually sell things at a loss to make cash available for new trades then you can not assess your strategy as if you always make an x% gain since that is n't true if you do n't ever sell at a loss then you 'll inevitably sometimes have no cash to trade with through picking losers the big practical question then is when that state of affairs persists for how long and whether it 's in force when you want to spend the money on something other than investing so sure if you used a short term time machine to know in advance which volatile stocks are the good ones today then it would be more profitable to day trade those than it would be to invest for the long term investing on the assumption that you 'll only pick short term winners is basically the same as assuming you have that time machine there are various strategies for analysing the market and trying to find ways to more modestly do what market makers do which is to take profit from the inherent volatility of the market the simple strategy you describe is n't complete and can not be assessed since you do n't say how to decide what to buy but the selling strategy sell as soon as i 've made x% but not otherwise can certainly be improved if you 're keen you can test a give strategy for yourself using historical share price data or current share price data run an imaginary account and see how you 're doing in 12 months when using historical data you have to be realistic about how you 'd choose what stocks to buy each day or else you 're just cheating at when using current data you have to beware that there might not be a major market slump in the next 12 months in which case you wo n't know how your strategy performs under conditions that it inevitably will meet eventually if you run it for real you also have to be sure in either case to factor in the transaction costs you 'd be paying and the fact that you 're buying at the offer price and selling at the bid price you ca n't trade at the headline mid market price finally you have to consider that to do pure technical analysis as an individual you are in effect competing against a bank that 's on top of the exchange to get fastest possible access to trade it has a and a team of kids and it 's trying to find and extract the same opportunities you are this is not to say the ca n't do well but there are systematic reasons not to just assume you will so folks investing for their retirement generally prefer a low risk strategy that plays the averages and settles for taking long term trends

definitely depends on the field i work in derivatives but not on the pure quant side though and that 's one of the fields that tends to hire the most guys basically involves applying a lot of stochastic calculus and probabilistic concepts to practical pricing problems    if you want a nice little application from a math perspective but not necessarily practical check out a closed form solution for options with stochastic volatility by 1992 should give a decent idea of how typically the problem solving process works in derivative land start with a practical problem relating to a probabilistic modelling concept eg implied distribution of expected returns -&gt apply some math -&gt come up with some sort of solution   edit clarification 1st paragraph

when you want to invest in an asset denominated by a foreign currency your investment is going to have some currency risk to it you need to worry not just about what happens to your own currency but also the foreign currency lets say you want to invest $ 10000 in us stocks as a canadian today that will cost you $ since just hit you now have two ways you can make money one is if goes up two is if the stocks go up the former may not be obvious but remember you are holding us denominated assets currently with the intention of one day converting those assets back into cad essentially you are long long usd short cad since you are short cad if cad goes up it hurts you it may seem odd to think about this as a currency trade but it opens up a possibility if you want a foreign investment to be currency neutral you just make the opposite currency trade in addition to your original investment so in this case you would buy $ 10,000 in us stocks and then short ie long cad short usd $ 10,000 this is kind of savvy and may not be something you would do but its worth mentioning and there are also some currency hedged etfs out there that do this for you however most are hedged relative to usd and are meant to hedge the target countries currency not your own

yeah most employers will say that their employment is at will and they can fire for anything but that 's usually not true if someone gets fired there has to be a reason those agreements that people are often required to sign when they start a job are not legally binding in any at all   employers will usually lie about it because they are breaking the law and they know it the only situation where they could get away with not having a reason to terminate someone is if they do not replace that person which is a lay off basically any other circumstance they had a reason and they are responsible for that reason

i think you might be asking the wrong question you have plenty of capital on the side that can be invested instead of asking whether you should get an adviser you might want to examine what your end goal is are you looking to build long term growth of you capital are you asking about and adviser because you do n't want to handle your money or is it simply because that 's what people do i would imagine that the answer to 1 is yes and that the answer to 2 is that you want to handle your money and you always considered this something best left to the advisers i shall proceed on these hypothetical assumptions in my humble opinion i would do the following skip the adviser and the fees that go with it for a young professional like yourself especially with an engineering background you can certainly handle the education required to learn the mechanics of investing invest some time to learn the fundamentals of the market such as asset classes basic terminology ect you will benefit in several ways for one you will learn an invaluable skill and save tens of thousands in fees during your lifetime moreover you will have complete control of your risk profile allocation and every penny that belongs to you i really am not bashing advisers but no one will care as much about your money as you will and do n't be fooled the market is efficient an adviser does not have any more edge in a market than anyone else and from first hand experience they rarely outperform benchmarks net of fees i assume you have made it to this step because you want to manage your own money and financial future sounds scary how should one proceed let 's assume that $ 100,000 is in play and since you are learning the ropes let 's leave $ 50,000 in cash for now this leaves $ 50,000 to start a portfolio i 'd start by building a core position of all the major asset classes in etf form this means buying things like spy or tlt if you 're comfortable you can start selling monthly calls against these positions to reduce basis and earn some income the point is your only limitation at this point is taking time to learn the ropes the technology is there the free education is there and liquidity and product mix is there next thing you know you 're learning how gamma scalping works or maybe you 're more of a buffett type   this is how i view finance in general and truly hope you break through the initial barrier to your own finances

these have the potential to become end of the world scenarios so i 'll keep this very clear if you start to feel that any particular investment may suddenly become worthless then it is wise to liquidate that asset and transfer your wealth somewhere else if your wealth happens to be invested in cash then transferring that wealth into something else is still valid   digging a hole in the ground is n't useful and running for the border probably wo n't be necessary consider countries that have suffered actual currency collapse and debt default   take zimbabwe for example   even as inflation went into the millions of percent the zimbabwe stock exchange soared as investors were prepared to spend ever more of their devaluing currency to buy stable stocks in a small number of locally listed companies even if the euro were to suffer a critical fall european companies would probably be ok if you did n't panic and dig in the back garden over the fall of dotcom there is no need to panic over the decline of certain currencies   just diversify your risk and buy non cash or euro assets update a few ideas re diversification the problem for greece is n't really a euro problem it is local local property local companies these can be affected by default because no one believes in the entirety of the greek economy not just the currency it happens to be using so diversification really means buying things that are outside greece

my experience is in the united states only in the past american express marketed its products as more exclusive and prestigious than other cards   there was an attempt to give the impression that cardholders were more qualified financially   in return fees were higher both to merchants and to cardholders   at the time early 1990 's it was not common to use credit cards for small purchases such as groceries or fast food   credit cards were used for larger purchases such as jewelry or electronics or dinner in a nicer restaurant once it became popular to use credit cards for everyday purchases the demand for customers using credit cards changed to the highest number of people instead of people of higher status   at that point visa and to a lesser extent mastercard transaction volume increased dramatically   merchants needed the largest number of customers with cards not the most financially stable   as visa volume grew and people started using visa for small purchases the use of american express decreased as their habits changed once someone got used to pulling out visa they did it in every situation   merchants are less willing to go through the extra hassle of accepting cards that are used by fewer people   over time i suspect this process led to the gap between visa and american express as a merchant in order to accept credit cards you have to set up a bank account and maintain a merchant account   accepting visa mc and discover can all be done through one account but american express has traditionally required a separate relationship as well as its own set of rules and fees that were generally higher   since there are relatively few american express cardholders compared to visa there is doubt about whether it is worth it accept the card   it depends upon the customer base   fine restaurants still generally accept american express

i used to do this it worked well for my simple case though you are limited in the number of people you can name for example to inherit a share of your estate and as thomas pointed out you do need to have your signature witnessed i would certainly use again for a simple will though i suspect my next will is going to be complicated enough that i 'll actually have to use an attorney note that a significant life change such as getting married may invalidate any current will this is certainly the case in my jurisdiction but this may not necessarily be true for you note that if you die without a will your estate will be divided up in a deterministic manner my wife died recently and as her immediate next of kin and with no children i was therefore entirely for her estate had we had children the children would have received $ 40,000 each the rest coming to me this will depend greatly on your jurisdiction and i 'm not sure what happens if the estate is insufficient i bring this up simply because both my wife and i were happy with the other handling the estate and a will would not have made dealing with her death significantly easier

in order to understand how much you might gain or lose from participating in the futures markets it is important to first understand the different ways in which the slope of the futures markets can be described in many of the futures markets there is a possibility of somebody buying a commodity at the spot price and selling a futures contract on it in order to do this they need to hold the commodity in storage most commodities cost money to hold in storage so the futures price will tend to be above the spot price for these commodities   in the case of stock index futures the holder receives a potential benefit from holding the stocks in an index    if the futures market is upward sloping compared to the spot price then it can be called normal if the futures market is usually downward sloping compared to the spot price then it can be called inverted if the futures market is high enough above the spot price so that more of the commodity gets stored for the future then the market can be called in contango if the futures market is below the point where the commodity can be profitably stored for the future and the market can be called in in many of these cases there is an implicit cost that the buyer of a future pays in order to hold the contract for certainly time your question is how much money you make if the price of gold goes up by a specific amount or how much money you lose if the price of gold goes down by the same specific amount   the problem is you do not say whether it is the spot price or the futures price which goes up or down   in most cases it is assumed that the change in the futures price will be similar to the change in the spot price of gold   if the spot price of gold goes up by a small amount then the futures price of gold will go up by a small amount as well   if the futures price of gold goes up by a small amount this will also drive the spot price of gold up   even for these small price changes the expected futures price change in expected spot price change will not be exactly the same   for larger price changes there will be more of a difference between the expected spot price change in expected future price change    if the price eventually goes up then the cost of holding the contract will be subtracted from any future gains   if the price eventually goes down then this holding cost should be added to the losses   if you bought the contract when it was above the spot price the price will slowly drift toward the spot price causing you this holding cost   if the price of gold does not change any from the current spot price then all you are left with is this holding cost

assume you 're asking about things like the consumer price index   different countries have different approaches   if they 're honest then the statistical sampling is conducted independently and consistently with a clear publication schedule and as littleadv answered by the men with it is that publication schedule which leads to a little of speculation as investors try to guess what unemployment growth or inflation figures may be immediately prior to release for many countries such inflation measurement is entirely political and so the statistical sampling is anything but honest or consistent   argentina 's official inflation rate for example is but analysts regard the real inflation rate as closer to 25   places like venezuela zimbabwe iran and even egypt prior to their revolution who knows now all manipulate statistics to portray their countries economies in a better light however even in the us where the bureau of labour statistics bls has been nominally independent for over a century the choice of what to include in the consumer basket the official basket of items chosen to reflect cost of living and measured by the men with is not always honest   for 30 years the us basket has excluded house prices because they were too volatile   enter house price credit disaster

what you have suggested would work in spain ireland us even italy but not in greece because the last piece of the cycle of money you outlined earlier would be that greek economy would expand and the government would collect revenues   the problem is that public and private projects in greece are very expensive due to strict labor laws a good chunk of any public money would end up in bank accounts outside greece and the resultant building would be of poor quality and little use in summary the greek government would be even more debt the economy would see very little benefit no increase in tax revenue and you would end up with a useless structure   even if greece had nât joined the euro it would either suffer from inflation or from a crisis similar to this the global economic crisis has made the situation much worse it is not the cause of the crisis at least for greece

past results are not a predictor of future results there is no explicit upper bound on a market and even if individual companies values were remaining unchanged one would expect the market to drift upward in the long term plus there 's been some   shift from managing companies for dividends to managing stocks for growth which will tend to increase the upward push trying to time the market to guess when it 's going to move in any particular direction is usually closer to gambling than investing the simplest answer remains a combination of buy and hold and dollar cost averaging buy at a constant number of dollars per month or whatever frequency you prefer and you will automatically buy more when the stock fund is lower less when it is higher that takes advantage of downturns as buying opportunities without missing out on possible gains at the other end personally i add a bit of contrarian buying to that i increased my buying another notch or two while the market was depressed since i had money i would n't need any time soon buy and hold and i was reasonably confident that enough of the market would come back strongly enough that i was n't at significant risk of losing the investment that 's one of the things which causes me to be categorized as an aggressive investor even though i 'm operating with a very vanilla mix of mutual funds and not attempting to micromanage my money my goal is to have the money work for me not vice versa

paying the minimum balance on a loan can be devastating and is highly un recommended it is important you understand your loan and the terms associated with it loans are given for a period of time but if you pay the minimum it does not mean you will pay it all off by the end when paying a loan money is applied to the interest first and any extra amount is then applied to the principle here 's an example if i have a $ 12 loan for 1 year the interest is 100 my minimum payment each month is $ 1 if i pay that minimum only i will be stuck paying $ 12 at the end of the loan why you ask because each month i 'm being charged $ 1 interest and the payment i am making is only going towards that interest however if i paid $ 2 instead now $ 1 goes to the principal the original $ 12 i borrowed this means that next month i will only be charged interest on $ 11 dollars instead of $ 12 you need to know how much is going towards the interest of your loan and how much is going towards the principle you can speak with your bank about this and they will help you understand in many cases they actually provide you with the numbers on your with examples of how long it would take to payoff your loan with minimum only and how long it would take if you added an extra x amount each month i recommend using the snowball method to pay of your debt it 's simple and effective how much you should add to each monthly payment depends on how much you can afford to add here are some calculators you can play around with cnn money bank rate calc edit so with the additional information you provided we can estimate that you have about 2200 free cash flow each 's your cash after you pay all your bills we can put away 500 each month for a rainy day fund just to be loss accidents or anything we ca n't predict so assuming that is all your expenses including the money you spend on entertainment that leaves you with $ 1700 you can add on to your loan payments so you can pay off your third loan in 1 month then add the remaining balance to the 2nd loan with this income it should take you less then a year to pay off all your loans

it is my understanding that banks pay less than the going rate on savings accounts and require that the person who takes out a loan pay more than the going rate that is how the bank gets its money   usually the going rate is affected by the current inflation rate but that has not been true for the last few weeks so that means that typically the money you have in the bank is gradually losing purchasing power as the bank typically pays you less than the inflation rate   so if you want your money to keep pace with inflation or do a bit better then you should buy bonds

to answer the first part of your question yes i 've done that   i did even a bit more   i once had a job that i was n't sure i 'd keep and the economy was n't great either   in case my next employer would n't let me contribute to a 401(k from day one and because i did n't want to my retirement and be stuck with a higher tax bill i front loaded my 401(k contributions to be maxed out before the end of the year   the contribution limits were lower than $ back then as for the reduced cash flow you need of course a buffer account containing several months worth of living expenses to afford maxing out or front loading 401(k contributions   you should be paying your bills out of such buffer account and not out of each paycheck   as for the reduced cash flow i think large scale contributions can crowd out other long term saving   priorities such as saving for a house down payment and the trade off between them is a real concern   if they 're out basic and discretionary consumer expenses that 's a totally different kind of problem which you do n't seem to have which is great so about the trade off between large scale 401(k contributions and saving for the down payment   i 'd say maxing out 401(k can foster the savings culture that will eventually pay its dividends   if after several years of maxing out your 401(k you decide that saving for the house is the top priority you 'll see money flow to the money market account marked for the down payment at a substantial monthly rate thanks to that savings culture as for the increasing future earnings no   most people i 've known for a long time if they saved 20 when they made $ 20k year they continued to save 20 or more when they later made $ 100k year   people who spent the entire paycheck while making $ 50k year always say if only i got a raise to $ 60k year i 'd save a few thousand   but they eventually graduate to $ 100k year and still spend the entire paycheck   it 's all about your savings culture on the second part of your question yes roth is a great tool especially if you believe that the future tax rates will be higher to fix the long term budget deficits   so contributing to 401(k to maximize the match then max out roth as others suggested is a great advice   after you 've done that see what else you can do more 401(k saving for the house etc

the first statement is talking about a sudden sharp increase in volume double or more of average volume with a sudden increase in price in other words there has been a last rush to buy the stock exhausting all the current bulls buyers so the bears sellers take over at least temporarily whilst the second statement is talking about a gradual increase in volume as the price up trends thus the use of a volume oscillator in other words in an uptrend the bulls buyers are gradually increasing in numbers sending the price higher and new buyers keep entering the market the opposite is the case for a down trend

what i think warren means is that people like him are really good at making money and setting things up to continue being rich in warren 's case he 's very good at evaluating businesses and if they would be good investments in the micro this is n't really a problem instead the problem is on the macro level when enough potential market participants i.e. people businesses are n't enabled to participate in the economy in the same way this feeds into a growing wealth inequality the people who have the resources to continue playing the game can also continue with more chances it 's a principle situation no opportunity to play little to improve and a continually disadvantaged population add time into the soup rich get richer the poor poorer the gap widens more add inflationary mechanics and the fact that being poor is more expensive add debt and an inability to purchase for long term solutions you get a situation where 99 of the money is cycling around in the top 1 of players   the other 99 of potential market participants are poorly utilized up to the point where their wealth is something they have trouble spending for things like healthcare   the idea of poorly utilized market participants is key a growing economy wants more bandwidth it wants more agents or market participants contributing to the flow get rich enough and you 'll find you ca n't spend more than the interest on investments on the contrary if you do n't have very much money it 's easy as hell to spend it quickly it 's straightforward to say that if more of the global population were n't in debt if they were n't in a state where they ca n't participate in economic growth then maybe the economic growth of human society would n't be so bottle

it only matters for purposes of the dependent so if you are clearly at 50 then you do n't need to calculate this cost   if it is close to not being 50 then you will have to allocate between your sister and mother   to calculate support costs you can of course include the costs incurred for transportation per pub 17 p 34   if you and your sister have an arrangement where she uses the car and in exchange she shoulders extra costs for your mother then that 's legitimately your expense for your mother as long as this is a true agreement then it was money she owed you but paid directly to the vendors and creditors that you would have paid note that there is a simpler avenue   if your sister agrees that you will claim your mother as dependent and nobody else provides any substantial support of costs then she can just agree that it 's you who will claim her   if you like such an agreement may be attached to your taxes possibly using form   as a general rule though you do not need to use or any other agreement nor submit any support calculations   if your sister verbally agrees that she has n't and wo n't claim your mother then it 's unlikely to cause any problems   her signed agreement not to claim your mother is merely the most conservative possible documentation strategy but is n't really necessary   see pub 17 p 35 on multiple support agreements for more info

the answer posted by is incorrect according to my series 65 text book and practice question answers the everyday investor buys at the ask and sells at the bid but the market maker does the opposite the market maker buys at the bid and sells at the ask he makes a profit form the spread i have posted a quiz question and the answer created by the financial industry regulatory authority finra to fill a customer buy order for 800 shares your firm requests a quote from a market maker the response is bid 15 ask 15.25 if the order is placed the market maker must sell a    800 shares at $ 15.25 per share b    800 shares at $ 15 per share c    100 shares at $ 15.25 per share d    800 shares at no more than $ 15 per share your answer sell 800 shares at $ 15.25 per share was a market maker is responsible for honoring a firm quote if no size is requested by the trader a quote is firm for 100 shares in this example the trader requested an quote so the market maker is responsible for selling 8 round lots of 100 shares at the ask price of $ 15.25 per share

the federal funds rate is one of the risk free short term rates in the economy we often think of fixed income securities as paying this rate plus some premia associated with risk for a treasury security we can think this way interest rate = fed funds rate + term premium the term premium is a bit extra the bond pays because if you hold a long term bond you are exposed to interest rate risk which is the risk that rates will generally rise after you buy making your bond worth less   the relation is more complex if people have expectations of future rate moves but this is the general idea   anyway generally speaking longer term bonds are exposed to more interest rate risk so they pay more on average for a corporate bond we think this way interest rate = fed funds rate + term premium + default premium where the default premium is some extra that the bond must pay to compensate the holder for default risk which is the risk that the bond defaults or loses value as the company 's prospects fall   you can see that corporate and government bonds are affected the same way approximately this is all hand waving by changes in the fed funds rate now that all refers to the rates on new bonds   after a bond is issued its value falls if rates rise because new bonds are relatively more attractive   its value rises if rates on new bonds falls   so if there is an unexpected rise in the fed funds rate and you are holding a bond you will be sad especially if it is a long term bond does n't matter if it 's corporate or government   ask yourself though whether an increase in fed funds will be unexpected at this point   if the increase was expected it will already be priced in   are you more of an expert than the folks on wall street at predicting interest rate changes   if not it might not make sense to make decisions based on your belief about where rates are going   just saying brick points out that treasuries are tax advantaged   that is you do n't have to pay state income tax on them but you do pay federal if you live in a state where this is true this may matter to you a little bit they also pay little because they are convenient for use as a cash substitute in transactions and convenience yield   in general treasuries just do n't pay much   young folk like you tend to buy corporate bonds instead so they can make money on the default and term premia

great work so far and good question   i think a lot of it depends on how risky your financial life is    for example lets say that you are working a temp or contract job that ends in 3 months   that is also the same month your savings and student loan will be equal   i think most would agree that it would be foolish to empty out your savings in such a risky month    now same situation one month later   the company you were working for takes you on as a full time employee   i would go ahead and empty out my savings and make the student loan go away    there could be other risks to consider like needing a different car moving to a new place potential medical bills or a needing to travel   anything like that on the horizon i would hold off out my savings   however once it is smooth sailing go for it being debt free is wonderful and it is a worthy goal

were you just offered a car loan for 1.4 or did you sign for a car loan for 1.4 if you signed it 's too late if you did n't sign   you should realise that your car loan is n't really 1.4 nobody will give you a car loan for less than a mortgage loan what really happened is that you gave up your chance to get a rebate on the car purchase a car worth $ 18,000 will have a price tag of $ 20,000 you can buy it for cash and haggle the dealer down to $ 18,000 or you can take that cheap 1.4 loan and pay $ 20,000 for the car   so if at all possible you would try to get a cheap loan from your bank possibly through your mortgage so you can buy the car without taking a loan from the car dealer

one of the main advantages is that duplication from a few sources is no longer a vector   the two big examples the lesser first card skimming and breaches like target 's   the chip essentially generates a unique transaction code and that is generated inside the chip   so even if you installed a chip you 'd have to beat the merchant to using the code and it would only be good once   the same is true if you get something like the target breach   instead of a giant dump of card numbers you get a giant dump of used codes which are n't very useful for getting money   even if the risk of stolen cards goes up it should be a huge advantage for the banks    additionally a number of the banks are now implementing quick and short term freezes like the discover it card app   you simply click freeze in the app if you are n't sure where your card is and unfreeze it when you do   the assumption here is that people are more likely to freeze it and do so sooner than if they have to wait for a new card in the mail   theoretically there 's nothing stopping a consumer from keeping the card frozen all the time and it when they walk into a store except the of it

actually if you look at a loan for $ 115,000 over 30 years at current interest rates you would have a payment of about $ 500 a month i would argue your $ 500 monthly payments are building equity the same way a loan repayment schedule would is your agreement in writing if it is there 's nothing you can do unless they agree if it 's not then write up a contract for a $ loan that you will pay back over 30 years at $ 500 a month with the amortization table that will show how much equity you 're building over time it 's not much the first 10 years note that some states require real estate contract to be in writing or else they are by either party whatever you do get something in writing or you 'll probably either end up in court or feeling bitter for the next few decades

in general i 'd say yeah if you can pay cash pay cash if you pay cash then by definition you pay zero interest if you get a loan you 'll pay interest most people get a loan to buy a car because they do n't have the cash possible reasons not to pay cash when you could one technically you can pay cash but if you did you would have little or no reserve for emergencies like if the car costs say $ and you have $ in your bank account then technically you could afford to pay cash but you probably should n't because you do n't want to have just $ 10 left what if tomorrow something comes up two arguably you have a place to invest money that pays more than the interest on the loan like say you can get a car loan for whatever the going rate is today say 6 and you know a place to invest your money that is very safe and almost guaranteed to pay 10 it would make sense to borrow to buy the car invest the cash and then withdraw money from the investment to make the payments on the car you 'd end up 4 ahead there are a lot of catches to that strategy though the biggest is that the more the investment pays the more likely that it is risky if you thought the investment would pay 10 but it ends up paying only 4 then you will lose money by this strategy also there 's the psychological element many people say and fully intend to invest their money but then find other things they want to buy and so spend it instead if you pay cash you 're committed

this is a short diagonal put spread generally you 're writing that long dated one at the money and buying the short dated one out of the money   the maximum amount that can be made is if the stock breaks out strongly to the upside and you keep the upfront credit minus whatever small amount it took to buy the april puts back   you can also make money if it breaks strongly to the downside but only if the credit when you opened your positions was more than $ 10 example   now say the stock falls to $ 500 by the time of that march expiration you 'd make $ on the march put and lose $ 100/share on the april put or a little more but that deep in the money there wo n't be much premium on it that 's a loss of $ 10/share or so i make a point of pointing this out because in that article i linked to the fact that your upfront credit needs to be greater than the strike spread in order to profit to the downside is not clearly mentioned

he 's misunderstanding buffett 's argument which is that all forms of investment compete and so when interest rates give you guaranteed low returns it makes sense for stocks to give you average low returns   that implies high prices for current stocks because your return on equities is the price tomorrow over the price today   buffett would likely agree with him that this implies slow growth in the future though he may not want to say so for competitive reasons   historical p e norms are a more wrong metric because they do n't capture any fundamental change that might have happened in the economy   what 's likely going on is a surplus of capital as business becomes more efficient i.e. generates more revenue with fewer workers that excess cash flow becomes investable capital but as it becomes more efficient i.e. less of that revenue filters down to workers in the form of wages that they can spend on consumer goods the amount of productive uses where that capital can be effectively deployed in income generating activities declines   more capital + fewer investable opportunities = higher supply + lower demand = the price of securities for the few areas of the economy that are doing well increases   this is why you see insane valuations for tech companies   if we do get a major economic crash it will likely come from a style financial crisis where all the money gets concentrated within emerging new industries focused on new technology who ca n't sell their products because nobody else has any money   we 're on the path to that already but it will likely take a decade or two to play out there 's still a lot of money left in the old economy which can be extracted   also these style of financial crises usually are accompanied by war and a breakdown of the established political order and so all bets are off anyway

gt you are the one using false equivalency   no i am using a rather simple parallel to show that consent is socially created and can exist non explicitly   your response is simply to assert your own opinion that you have not consented to the state without any reason to take that view seriously you grew up under the rule of your state you were educated about the implications of that long before you were expected to start paying taxes and there is nothing preventing you from leaving the state 's jurisdiction at any time your opinion that this does not indicate consent is irrelevant because the whole rest of society thinks that it does if arbitrarily asserting that you have n't consented to things was an argument literally anything can be oppressive i can walk into your home and set up camp in your living room and say i did n't consent to this being your house all social rules are instantly out the window is that how society works   i 've jumped through these hoops before i know how you people try and pull this off it does n't work your position is not it 's just a series of language tricks that people who have n't thought it all the way through   you 're either a charlatan or you 've been deceived by one and i do n't really care to learn which   quoting myself from weeks ago   gt gt gt gt i 'd like to know how exactly i opt into paying    gt gt gt by choosing to occupy the territory ruled by your state despite being fully informed about the implications of doing so and having been made informed well before you had an obligation to start paying    gt gt that 's not an agreement    gt let 's say i walk into a shop say i 'll have a medium coke please they hand me one i walk out of the building am i stealing well i did n't specifically agree to pay for it did i but that argument would n't hold much weight in an actual legal dispute because obviously i understand that when you ask for an item in a shop you 're implicitly agreeing to pay for it at some point   gt   gt but what about some less obvious cases if a put a small sign near the that said entry fee ten dollars entering the store constitutes agreement to pay you could reasonably argue this is invalid because you walked into the store without noticing the sign and the practice is quite unusual but if instead of a shop it were a theater performance you walked into maybe that argument would n't hold up because you should be expected to understand there 's an entry fee at a theater and maybe if you were from a country that does n't have theaters and you were thus genuinely unaware of this particular social custom they would make an exception and you 'd get away with it this is the kind of problem a judicial system exists for to take social context into account   gt   gt the point is whether something constitutes agreement or not and thus what are the legal repercussions to your actions is a matter of opinion and in this case i do n't see any particular reason to think that your opinion about the government ought to overrule that of the rest of society your actions are interpreted as indicating consent for the system you 're acting in and this being so if you took the government to court on the charge that it 's stealing from you you would obviously lose so how is it an argument to just say but that 's not an agreement in my opinion that 's as irrelevant as me saying but i did n't agree to pay for this food i just ate officer i just walked in and asked for food and they gave it to me and i ate it that 's not an agreement in my opinion   gt

um no   easy google what makes stock prices go up      gt;this is how it works with stocks supply is the amount of shares that people want to sell and demand is the amount of shares that people want to purchase if there are a greater number of buyers than sellers more demand the buyers bid up the prices of the stocks to entice sellers to get rid of them   so sure if a company is performing well people will want to buy the stock causing it to go up   but even if a company was performing well and no one wanted to buy the stock   there would be only sellers and the price would go down

with a short position you make your money profit when you buy the stocks back to close the position at a lower price than what you bought them at as short selling is classed as speculation and not investing and you at no time own any actual assets you can not donate any short to charity if you did want to avoid paying tax on the profits you could donate the proceeds of the profits after closing the position and thus get a tax deduction equal to the profits you made but that raises a new and more important question why are you trading in the first place if you are afraid to make profits in case you have to pay tax on those profits

the value of getting into the landlord business or any other business depends on circumstances at the time how much will it cost you to buy the property how much can you reasonably expect to collect in rent how easy or difficult is it to find a tenant etc i owned a rental property for about ten years and i lost a bundle of money on it things people often do n't consider when calculating likely rental income are there will be times when you have no tenant someone moves out and you do n't always find a new tenant right away maintenance there 's always something that the tenant expects you to fix tenants are n't likely to take as good a care of the property as someone who owned it would and while a homeowner might fix little things himself like a broken light switch or the tenant expects the landlord to fix such things if you live nearby and have the time and ability to do minor maintenance this may be no big deal if you have to call a professional this can get very expensive very quickly like for example i once had a tenant complain that the water heater was n't working i called a plumber he found that the knob on the water heater was set to low so he turned it up he charged me i think it was $ 200 i ca n't really complain about the charge he had to drive to the property figure out that that was all the problem was turn the knob and then verify that that really solved the problem tenants do n't always pay the rent on time or at all i had several tenants who apparently saw the rent as something optional to be paid if they had money left over that they could n't think of anything better to do with you may get bad tenants who destroy the place i had one tenant who did $ 10,000 worth of damage that include six inches deep of trash all over the house that had to be cleared out rotting food all over on walls holes in the walls and many things broken i thought it was disgusting just to have to go in to clean it up i ca n't imagine living like that but whatever depending on the laws in your area it may be very difficult to kick out a bad tenant in my case i had to evict two tenants and it took about three months each time to go through the legal process on the slip side the big advantage to owning real estate is that once you pay it off you own it and can continue to collect rent and as most currencies in the world are subject to inflation the rent you can charge will normally go up while your mortgage payments are constant

how is that possible the mutual fund does n't pay taxes and passes along the tax bill to shareholders via distributions would be the short answer your basis likely changed as now you have bought more shares but i gained absolutely nothing from my dividend so how is it    taxable the fund has either realized capital gains dividends interest or some other form of income that it has to pass along to shareholders as the fund does n't pay taxes itself did i get screwed the first year because i bought into the fund too    late in the year perhaps if you do n't notice that your cost basis has changed here so that you 'll have lower taxes when you sell your shares   is anyone familiar with what causes this kind of situation of    receiving a taxable dividend that does n't actually increase the    account balance yes i am rather familiar with this the point to understand is that the fund does n't pay taxes itself but passes this along the shareholders that hold funds in tax advantaged accounts like 401ks and iras still get the distribution but are shielded from paying taxes on those gains at that point at time is it because i bought too late in the year   no it is because you did n't know the fund would have a distribution of that size that year some funds can have negative returns yet still have a capital gains distribution if the fund experiences enough redemptions that the fund had to sell appreciated shares in a security this is part of the risk in having stock funds in taxable accounts or is it because the fund had a negative return that year   no it is because you do n't understand how mutual funds and taxes work along with what distribution schedule the fund had do i wait until after the distribution date this year to buy i 'd likely consider it for taxable accounts yes however if you are buying in a tax advantaged account then there is n't that same issue

danger the affidavit is a legal document understand the risk of getting caught if you are planning on using the condo to generate income the chances that you default on the loan are higher than an owner occupied property that is why they demand more down payment 20%+ and charge a higher rate   the document is n't about making sure you spend 183 + nights a year in the property it is making sure that it is n't a business and you are n't letting a 3rd party live in the property   if you within the first year tell the mortgage company to send the bill to a new address or you change how the property is insured they will suspect that it is now a rental property   what can they do undo the loan ask for penalty fee limit your ability to get a mortgage in the future or a percentage of the profits how likely is it the exact penalty will be in the packet of documents you receive it will depend on which government agency is involved in the loan and the lenders plan to sell it on the secondary market   it can also depend on the program involved in the sale of the property hud and sister agencies lock out investors   during the initial selling period they do n't want somebody to represent themselves as homeowner but is actually an investor note some local governments are interested not just in non investors but in properties being occupied therefore they may offer tax discounts to residents living in their homes then they will be looking at the number of nights that you occupy the house in a year if they detect that you are n't really a resident living in the house that has tax penalties suggestion if you do n't want to wait a year buy the condo and let the loan officer know what your plan is you will have to meet the down payment and interest rate requirements for an investment property your question implies that you will have enough money to pay the required 20 down payment then when you are ready buy the bigger house and move in if you try and buy the condo with a non investment loan you will have to wait a year if you try and pay cash now and then get a home equity loan later you will have to admit it is a rental and still have to meet the investor requirements

since you did not treat the house as a you have to use usd as your functional currency   to calculate capital gains you need to calculate the usd value at the time of purchase using the exchange rate at the time of purchase and the usd value at the time of sale using the exchange rate at the time of sale   the capital gain loss is then the difference between the two   this link describes it in more detail and provides some references that link also discusses additional potential complications if you have a mortgage on the house this link gives more detail on the court case referenced in the above link the court cases references 54 105   this link from the irs has some details from that 54 105 1 12 states that for purposes of determining    gain the basis and selling price of property acquired by a u.s. citizen living in a foreign country should be expressed in united states dollars at the rates of exchange prevailing as of the dates of purchase and sale of the property    respectively the text of this implies it is for u.s. citizen is living in a foreign country but the court case makes it clear that it also applies in your scenario house purchased while living abroad but now residing in the us agree that the pounds received for their residence should be translated into u.s. dollars at the $ exchange rate prevailing at the date of sale they argue however that the pound adjusted cost basis of the residence consisting of the pound purchase price and the pounds paid for capital improvements likewise should be expressed in u.s. dollar terms as of the date of the sale correctly state that viewed in the foreign currency in which it was transacted the purchase generated a pound gain as of the date of the sale which translates to approximately $ 200,000 at the $ per pound exchange rate however fair and reasonable their argument may be it amounts to an untenable attempt to convert their functional currency from the u.s. dollar to the pound sterling under use of a functional currency other than the u.s. dollar is restricted to qualified business units correctly assert that their residence was purchased for a pound denominated value while they were living and working in a pound denominated economy and since concede that the purchase and sale of their residence was not carried out by a the district court properly rejected their plea to treat the pound as their functional currency

my theory is that for every stock you buy you should have an exit strategy and follow it   it is too hard to let emotions rule if you let your default strategy be let 's see what happens and emotional investing will almost never serve you well   so before buying a stock set a maximum loss and maximum gain that you will watch for on the stock and when it hits that number sell   at the very least when it hits one of your numbers consciously make a decision that you are effectively buying it again at the current price if you decide to stay in when you do this set a new high and low price and repeat the above strategy

you have to read some appeals court cases see as well as sec enforcement actions on to get an understanding of how the sec operates there are court created guidelines for how insider trading would be proven there is no clear line but it is the emergency asset freezing your assets if you nailed a lucrative trade you really want to avoid and this is often times enforced reported by the brokers themselves since the sec does not have the resources to monitor every account 's trading activities there are some thin lines such as having your lawyer file a lawsuit and as soon as it is filed it is technically public so you short the recipient 's stock or having someone in a court room updating you on case developments as soon as possible so you can make trades although this may just be actually public depending on the court but the rules create the opportunities also consider that the united states is the most strict country in this regard there are tons of capital markets and the ideals or views of illegal insider trading compared to having reached a level of society where you are privileged to obtain this information vary across the board contains charts of countries where an existing insider trading prohibition is actually enforced finally consider some markets that do n't include equities as trading on an information advantage is only applicable to things the sec regulates and there are plenty of things that agency does n't regulate so trying to reverse engineer the sec may not be the most optimal use of energy

the art of short selling by stanley providers for many case studies about what kind of opportunities to look for from a fundamental analysis perspective typically things you can look for are financing terms that are not very favorable expensive interest payments as well as other on cash flow arbitrary decisions by management poor management and dilution that does n't make sense usually another product of poor management from a quantitative analysis perspective you can gain insight by looking at the credit default swap rate history if the company is listed in that market the things that affect a cds spread are different than what immediately affects share prices some market participants trade over credit default swaps when they are betting on a company 's insolvency but looking at large trades in the options market is n't indicative of anything on its own but you can use that information to help confirm your opinion you can certainly jump on a trend using bad headlines but typically by the time it is headline news the majority of the downward move in the share price has already happened or the stock opened lower because the news came outside of market hours you have to factor in the short interest of the company if the short interest is high then it will be very easy to squeeze the shorts resulting in a rally of share prices the opposite of what you want a short squeeze does n't change the fundamental or quantitative reasons you wanted to short the technical analysis should only be used to help you decide your entry and exit price ranges amongst an otherwise random walk the technical rules you created sound like something a very basic program or stock screener might be able to follow but it does n't tell you anything you will have to do research in the company 's public filings yourself

there are several ways that the issuers profit from cfds if the broker has trades on both sides buy and sell they can net the volumes off against each other and profit off the spread whilst using the posted margins to cover p&l from both sides because settlement for most securities is not on the same day that the order is placed they can also buy the security with no intention of taking delivery and simply sell it off at the end of day to pass delivery on to someone else here again they profit from the spread and that their volumes give them really low commissions so their costs are much lower than the value of the spread if they have to do this rather than netting the position out the spreads will be wider   sometimes that may be forced to buy the security outright but that is rare and the spreads will be even wider so that they can make a decent profit

there are different perspectives from which to calculate the gain but the way i think it should be done is with respect to the risk you 've assumed in the original position which the simplistic calculation does n't factor in there 's a good explanation about calculating the return from a short sale at investopedia   here 's the part that i consider most relevant when calculating the return of a short sale you need to compare the amount the trader gets to keep to the initial amount of the liability    had the trade in our example turned against you you as the short    seller would owe not only the initial proceeds amount but also the    excess amount and this would come out of your pocket refer to the source link for the full explanation update as you can see from the other answers and comments it is a more complex a q&a than it may first appear   i subsequently found this interesting paper which discusses the difficulty of rate of return with respect to short sales and other atypical trades excerpt    the problem causing this almost uniform of a percentage    return on short sales options especially writing and futures it    may be speculated is that the nigh well universal and conventional    definition of rate of return involving an initial cash outflow    followed by a later cash inflow does not appear to fit these    investment situations none of the investment finance texts nor    general finance texts undergraduate or graduate have formally or    explicitly shown how to resolve this predicament or how to justify the    calculations they actually use

a fund is a portfolio in that it is a collection so the term is interchangeable for the most part   funds are made up of a combination of equities positions i.e. stocks bonds etc plus some amount of un invested cash most of the time when people are talking about a fund they are describing what is really an investment strategy   in other words an example would be a far east agressive fund just a made up name for illustration here which focuses on investment opportunities in the far east that have a higher level of risk than most other investments thus they provide better returns for the investors   the portfolio part of that is what the stocks are that the fund has purchased and is holding on behalf of its investors   other funds focus on municipal bonds or government bonds and the list goes on i hope this helps good luck

it depends on how you place your stop order and the type of stop orders available from your broker if you place a stop market order and the following day the stock opens below your stop your stock will be stopped out at or around the opening price meaning you can potentially end up with quite a large gap if you place a stop limit order say you place your stop at $ 10.00 with a limit price of $ 9.90 and if the price opens below $ 9.90 say at $ 9.50 your limit sell order of $ 9.90 will be placed onto the market but it will not be executed until the price goes back up to $ 9.90 or above the third option is to place a guaranteed stop loss and as specified you are guaranteed your stop price even if the price gaps down below your stop price you will be paying an extra fee for the guaranteed stop loss order and they are usually mainly available with cfd brokers so if you are in the usa you might be out of luck

if both cards have the same interest rate there 's likely no practical difference here very likely the required minimum payment is calculated the same on both cards pay off one card and put the rest on the other or split the payment across both cards my personal preference would be to entirely pay off one card and put the rest on the other it feels like a bigger accomplishment if one card has a significantly different interest rate obviously you 'd try to pay that one down first alternatively if you owe less on one card you may choose to pay that off and then cut up the card if you are trying to recover from a poor financial situation this way you have achieved a specific goal but again in your case it sounds like your two cards are entirely interchangeable either way you do it well done on putting your money where it 'll make the most difference right now

i do n't expect you to remember the area for the surface of a sphere i do expect you to be able to take a derivative of a volume especially if you are a believe it or not it is faster than looking it up on the internet and abilities to do quick back of the napkin estimations are very handy in my field cs   also i noticed that meetings with people who are in command of basic facts are usually faster and more productive than with people who are constantly looking things up on the internet

does this make sense to anyone it estimated he s made 300 mil in the last fight but lets say its a conservative 100 mil 4 in the market after inflation is a year if it was the 300 mil then it 'd be 12 mil he s giving up probably more and that 's just the first year not compounded        so he expects me to believe that he 's making smart investments in his strip club but not putting the money in the market this makes zero sense

's are pretty much the best crash course to financial modelling with excel be aware though he has two distinct types of book one is more of a walk through of financial principles in of finance with excel 2nd ed and the other could better be described as a of financial applications in oft recommended financial modeling as far as i 'm aware both contain roughly the same volume of information about the same topics could be some minor differences as the walk through style book is newer but are taught in somewhat different ways it might be useful to obtain a copy of one or the other from a library and see if you enjoy the style of the book before purchasing it i was fortunate enough to have a roommate where between us we have both but doing this individually is a 200 + dollar endeavor and you will only be duplicating identical information   if you 're interested in reading other interesting material that may help you develop different perspectives insight into investing i would suggest aside from reading the usual stuff intelligent investor random walk etc also obtaining a copy of seth klarman 's margin of safety you 'll have to do so in form as the book is entirely out of print and from what i 've heard klarman himself bought out many retailers of all of their copies and had them destroyed but it 's an interesting read that has a lot of modern relevance   perhaps best evidenced by the fact that it 's author president of one of the largest hedge funds in the world no longer wants it in print

any answer for what to do in a taper will assume ceteris paribus because how markets initially react when they suspect a taper may immediately change depending on what data are released after the taper for instance i 've seen soros and a few other hedge fund managers hold shorts when expecting a taper because the theory is that the market may fall   however suppose the market falls 5 but then positive employment numbers are released   what then   the same holds true for betting against emerging markets em something i 've seen jesse colombo and others suggest the claim that emerging markets are in a bubble thanks to the u.s. federal reserve the more money they release the more the money goes overseas   again this is possibly true but if good data are released after the taper for these emerging markets they could see growth and those with the shorts could get killed tl;dr when we ask about what happens after the taper we have to remember we 're assuming some things about everything else    i do think that the safest play post taper is what bill gross mentioned about bonds basically a bubble as we should see interest rates rise and the chinese seem to be reluctant to buy as much of u.s. bonds as they have in the past though some like mish assert the u.s. would welcome this   the other play i like is the vix if you think the market will fall or against if you think the market will rise   has been one of the best plays since 2011 compare it to the spy for the same time period

your question indicates confusion regarding what an individual retirement account whether roth or traditional is vs. the s&p 500 which is nothing but a list of stocks iow it 's perfectly reasonable to open a roth ira put your $ 3000 in it and then use that money to buy a mutual fund or etf which tracks the s&p 500 in fact it 's ridiculously common

all who think that the magical title ii is going to fix this are being   all one has to do is consider the old at&amp;t that was an absolute vertically integrated monopoly and a common carrier at the same   net neutrality will never be solved by regulatory agencies there need to be laws to make it happen on the order of an updated sherman antitrust event sherman antitrust act improved with iron clad definitions not subject to judicial   bonus you do n't want the internet to be under title ii anyway that 's what brought us like the fairness doctrine and will impose the same type of censorship as affects radio and tv now on the internet

no credit card companies will typically not care about your individual credit card account instead they look either at a package of card accounts opened at roughly the same time or of slices of cardholder accounts by credit rating if an entire package 's or slice 's balance drops significantly they 'll take a look and will adjust rates accordingly often they may actually decrease rates as an incentive to increase you use of the card because credit card debt is debt the bank can not impose an early payment penalty of any kind there 's no schedule for paying it off so there 's no way to prove that they 're missing out on $ x in interest because you paid early generally banks do n't like cc debt anyway it 's very risky debt and they often end up writing large balances off for pennies on the dollar so when you pay down your balance by a significant amount the banks breathe a sigh of relief the real money the stable money is in the usage fees every time you swipe your card the business who accepted it owes the credit card company 3 of your purchase and sometimes more

best strategy that has worked for me is to remember first of all that you hardly ever need anything right now try this if you see something you want to buy leave it for at least two weeks better yet a month if after that time you have hardly thought about it then you almost certainly do n't need it but if you 've thought quite a lot about owning it and how it will be beneficial then perhaps it 's worth picking up you will probably find that a small percentage of things you 'd like to buy make it through that screening period
