companies are expected to make a profit otherwise there is no point to their existence and no motivation for investment that profit comes back to shareholders as growth and/or dividend if a company is doing well and has a healthy profit to turn back into investment to facilitate increased future earnings it increases shareholder equity and share price if a company is doing well and has a healthy profit to pay out in dividend it makes the shares more attractive to investors which pushes the price up either way shares go up share prices drop when companies lose money or there are market affecting all companies recessions or when individual companies fail averaged over all companies over the long term decades stocks can be reasonably expected to go up

the last 300 years of civilization have been amazingly atypical we have experienced industrial revolution after industrial revolution   economic revolutions that would have changed the world in 1000 ad show up as noise   coal canal rail trade electricity oil gas nuclear assembly line vacuum tube mass education integrated circuit nano tech antibiotics of absolute poverty democratic automobile airplane and on and on and on a cascade of miracles and world shaking events that have intertwined and together generated a many century long economic that has the entire world and generated today 's world the question you should ask is tomorrow going to be like today   and the answer is yes in weather and in economics the most likely bet bet is always things keep on going like they have in the short term   but next week   next month   that is often not much like today there is reason to believe that the yield on the above revolutions will continue to propel the economy forward and that there are multiple promising new revolutions on the horizon but barring that kind of world shaking revolution you are not going to maintain a 5 real return on investment over another centuries for the stock market   the value of investments has to go up by a factor of over 100 in order for that to happen and the us stock market is already close to 20 trillion dollars for it to have a market cap of 2 quadrillion dollars the world economy will have to be much larger than it is today   and to be that much larger the world would have to be a much stranger place that values very different things we are currently roughly a k type civilization   a simple linear expansion of our power of 100x brings us up to k type which is going to cook the planet from waste heat not from co2 but just from the waste heat of the energy it uses efficiency can mitigate this but only to a degree   100x more efficient technology is going to less believable than a and space colonies if you believe that the stock market is going to continue to grow at for the next century start investing in really out there technologies   gene editing virtual and augmented reality space and private lift miraculously cheap energy storage etc   because simply refining the technology of today wo n't get us there modern industrial civilization has been a miracle factory   that is what pulled off that growth rate   if the miracles stop coming so does the growth there is a road to it   it would involve clean energy mass personal automation and friendly not smarter than human ai and the entire world lifted up to the standard of living of the top 3 of the usa on average   but it is far from guaranteed

does it make sense for stocks to earn a premium indefinitely yes there is good reason to think that the stock market will make money indefinitely the stock market is the primary mechanism through which investors bear market risk which requires compensation   if you think of all the owners of firms stockholders and bondholders generally the risk premium that stocks earn stocks is the way bondholders pay equityholders to bear the risk that they do not wish to will stock prices always go up in the long run as long as companies pay out less in dividends than their profit prices will go up   that could change if we were to change our corporate culture and/or tax practices so that firms paid out more in dividends   however for the purposes of your question i think it does n't matter much whether the investor makes money as dividends or capital gains does the 5 7 guess apply only to the us market i did n't write nor read the books in question but most likely that is a global number   the us dominates the global equity market so it 's often a good proxy   however international returns taken together have no less risk and earn no less over long horizons in general   the particular examples you have pointed out are special cases that only apply to a part of the global economy and a particular time period   there are plenty of examples of stock markets and time periods that did much better than the us market to offset your examples is 5 7 a reasonable long term estimate of equity returns equity will always earn more in expectation than risk free securities will   how much more depends on major economic factors   5 7 has been a good estimate for the market risk premium for many many decades stocks should earn this plus whatever the risk free rate is   however that is just an empirical observation not a rule   it can change   some day technological progress could slow down or stop we could run out of important resources in a way that we ca n't compensate for our population permanently could stop growing aliens could invade etc   down the road it is certainly possible for expected equity returns to go down and never go back up again   this would result from a permanent global economic shift that i think would be pretty obvious   that is you would n't have to look at stock prices to know it was happening

i have read in many personal finance books that stocks are a great investment for the long term because on average they go up 5 7 every year this has been true for the last 100 years for the s&p500 index but is there reason to believe this trend will continue indefinitely into the future it has also been wrong for 20 + year time periods during those last 100 years it 's an average and you can live your whole career at a loss there are many things to support the retention of the average over the next 100 years i think the is out of scope of your actual investment philosophy but basically there are many ways to lower your cost basis by reinvesting dividends selling options or contributing to your position at any price from a portion of your income and by inflation and by the growth of the world economy with a low enough cost basis then a smaller percentage gain in the index gives you a magnified profit

stock returns can not be evaluated on its own you need to take into account inflation and the return of other investment vehicles over the long run you want to earn more than your peers ie inflation or lose less than them stock lets you buy into the profits of a company managed by others so the fundamental question is do those company managers make better decision than average person of course there are times when they make awful decisions eg just before dotcom bubble and sometimes the best decision is to close the business but overall those people are much better educated have higher iq more etc and so over long time and across all the companies this is correct and hence the stock market premium

stocks go up 5 7 every year this has been true for the last 100 years for the s&p500 index this was true in the 20th century in america it was not true over the whole century for other major countries like germany russia japan or china it was more or less true for britain and certain commonwealth countries like australia and canada a lot of this had to do with which countries were occupied or not during the two world wars in one of his company 's annual reports warren buffett pointed out that the u.s. standard of living went up 6 7 times in the 20th century that this was unprecedented and might not be repeatable in the 21st century the performance of the u.s. stock market in the past century is representative of those and other past facts if a different set of facts prevails going forward the u.s. stock market would be reflective of those different facts

the total value of the stock market more or less tracks the total value of the companies listed in the stock market which is more or less the total value of the us economy since very few industries are nationalized or dominated by privately held companies the us economy has consistently grown over time thanks to the wonders of industrialization the discovery of new markets new natural resources etc   thus the stock market has continued to grow as well will it forever   no   the united states will not exist for ever   but there 's no obvious reason it wo n't continue to grow at least for a while though of course if i could accurately predict that i would be far richer than i am why do other countries not have the same result   china is its own ball of wax since it 's a sort of market sort of command economy   japan has major issues economically right now and does n't really have the natural or people resources it also had a huge market bubble a while back that it 's never recovered from and many european countries are doing fine   german 's index was at around 2500 in 2004 and is now at nearly   that 's pretty fast growth if you go back further there was a crash ending in around 2004 you can see around the fall of the berlin wall it was still around 2000 even going that far back that 's about an 8 annual bump   the ftse was also around 2000 back then around 8000 now which is around 5 annual growth    many of these indexes were more seriously hurt than the us markets in the two major crashes of this while the us markets fell a lot in 2008 they did n't fall nearly as much as many smaller markets in 2002 so had less to recover from   both dax and ftse suffered similar falls in 2002 to 2008 and so even though during good periods they 've grown quite quickly they have n't overall done as well as they could have given the crashes

never take the first quote consider what it would really cost to replace the house to rebuild and pay for living while you do so including demolition etc and/or pay off the mortgage and return your equity if it is a financed property   most insurances will have a limit on how much coverage you can get based on the property value and your goods value estimates   shop around for a company that will give you a good price but also good customer service and a smooth claims process   they should be solvent able to pay your claim if say a hit the whole neighborhood   and they should cover your reasonable replacement costs and remember insurance is about the big losses like fires know what you are comfortable self insuring higher or lower deductibles optional coverages etc and you will have an easier time getting the coverage you need for the price you want to pay

good credit is calculated by many lenders by taking your fico score which is calculated based upon what is in your credit report   building credit generally means building up your fico score your fico score is impacted my many factors one small one of which is your utilization ratio of your installment loans like student loans   this is the ratio of the current balance to your original balance   to improve your score slightly you would want a lower ratio   i would recommend paying your student loan down to 75 ratio as fast as you can and then you can go back to $ 50/month a much better way to improve your fico score is to have revolving credit   your student loans are not revolving they are installment loans   therefore you should open at least one credit card assuming you currently have none right away   the longer you have had a credit card open the better your fico score gets   your revolving credit utilization ratio is way more important than your installment loan ratio   therefore to maximize your fico try to never have more than 10 utilization on your revolving credit report to the credit bureaus each month   only the current month 's ratio affects your score at any given moment   you can ensure you do n't go above 10 by paying your balance before the statement cuts each month to get it below 10 way before any payment would be due   you should always pay your remaining credit card statement balance in full each month by the due date after the statement cuts to avoid any interest charges   note that there is a slight fico advantage to having at least one major bank credit card instead of just only credit union credit cards   also never let all your revolving credit report a zero balance in a month you must always have at least $ 1 reporting to the credit bureaus on at least one of your open credit cards or your fico score will take a big negative hit if you can not get a normal credit card go to a credit union and find one that offers secured credit cards or a bank that does   a secured credit card is where you place a deposit with the bank that they hold and give you a credit limit to match your security   ideally it would be a card that graduates to unsecured after your demonstrate good history with them   for example the navy federal credit union secured card for many people   i also believe the wells fargo bank credit card you can join if there is a family member who served or a who did also will   the reason you want it to and not be forced to open a new account to get an unsecured account is that you want your average age and oldest age of open revolving credit accounts to be as high as possible as this is another impact on your fico score credit unions that anyone can join include digital federal credit union the pentagon federal credit union which offers a secured card that does not graduate and the state department federal credit union also offers secured card that i think does not graduate one other method to boost your fico score is to get added as an authorized user on one of your parent 's credit cards that has been open a long time   not all lenders will report such an authorized user however ones that are known to do so are bank of america citi bank and capital one   it is a good sign that it will report if they ask for the social security number of the authorized user however note that the authorized user addition can have no impact if the lender is using one of the newer versions of the fico scoring model only the older versions reward you for the age of accounts for which you are an authorized user a very long term boost is to open your first american express card underwritten directly by amex such as their card which is pretty easy to get   the advantage of american express is that they remember the date your first credit card was opened with them and if you open new accounts in the future they will back date the date of their opening to match the date your first card was opened   if you let your membership lapse be sure to record the account number and date opened in your personal files so that you can help them locate it again if you reopen as they can have trouble if it has been on the order of ten years or more finally note that the number of accounts opened in the last twelve months is a small negative mark on your score along with number of inquiries so if you open a lot of accounts all at once in addition to bringing down your average age of accounts you will also get dinged for how many were opened in the last year

yeah i understand that is a nebulous term akin to stopping pork in various bills however getting back to that economist article this really stood out to me   gt america ’s corporate tax has two horrible flaws the first is the tax rate which at 35 is the highest among the 34 mostly rich country members of the oecd yet it raises less revenue than the oecd average thanks to myriad loopholes and tax breaks aimed at everything from machinery investment to nascar race tracks last year these breaks cost $ 150 billion in forgone revenue more than half of what america collected in total corporate taxes   i 'm not clear on where they got that number but assuming it is true there are certainly plenty of places we could start if we were to lower the tax rate to a sane level    also i still do n't see how just lowering the tax rate and removing the repatriation tax on foreign earned profit would truly inversion if there are countries like still out there with say random number here a 5 corporate tax would n't the incentive still exist

long term capital gains which is often the main element of investment income for investors who are not high frequency day traders are taxed at a single rate that is often substantially below the marginal rate they would otherwise be taxed at particularly for wealthy individuals there are a few behind this treatment the two most common are that the government wants to encourage long term investments as opposed to short term speculation and that capital gains are a kind of double taxation from one point of view as they are coming from income that has already been taxed once before as wage or ordinary income   the latter in particular is highly controversial but this is one of the more divisive political issues in the taxation front one party would eliminate the tax entirely the other would eliminate the difference for most individuals the majority of their long term capital gains are taxed at 15 up to almost half of a million dollars total agi which is a fairly low rate it 's equivalent to the rate a taxpayer would pay on up to $ 37,000 in wage income after deductions exemptions etc   you can see from this table in wikipedia that it is much preferred to pay long term capital gains rates when possible at every point it 's at least 10 lower than the tax rate for ordinary income ordinary income includes wages and many other sources of income basically anything that is not long term capital gains wage income is taxed at this rate and also subject to some non income tax taxes fica and medicare in particular other sources of ordinary income are not subject to those taxes including ira income   short term capital gains are generally included in this bucket qualified dividends are treated similarly to long term capital gains as they are of a similar nature and taxed accordingly the net investment tax is basically applying the medicare tax to investment income for higher income taxpayers $ 125k single $ 250k joint   it 's on top of capital gains rates for them   it came about through the affordable care act and is one of the first provisions likely to be repealed by the new congress as it can be repealed through the budgeting provision   it seems likely that 2017 taxes will not contain this provision

i ’m going to answer this because accounting books only reflect the dollar value of inventories which means if you look at the balance sheet of mcdonalds you will not see how many bags of french fries are remaining at their storage facility you will only see the total value at cost basis   your requirement for noting the number of shares purchased is not part of the double entry accounting system   when you transfer $ 10000 from bank to broker the entries would be   the bank ’s name and the broker ’s name will not appear on the balance sheet   when you purchase 50 shares at $ 40 per share the accounting system does not care about the number of shares or the price all it cares is the $ 2000 total cost and the commission of $ 10   you have two choices either place $ 10 to an expense account or incorporate it into the total cost making it $ 2010   the entries for the second method would be now your balance sheet would reflect what happens if the price increases from $ 40 per share to $ 50 per share tomorrow do nothing your balance sheet will show the cost of $ 2010 until the shares are sold or the accounting period ends it will not show the market value of $ 2500   instead the portfolio tracker would show $ 2500 the most basic tracker is   later if you finally sell the shares at $ 50 per share with $ 10 commission again the number of shares will not be reflected anywhere in the accounting system only the total proceeds from the sale matters

in a similar situation i wrote about how i made $ 4,000 + on a cash back credit card offer the total was actually $ and was from an insane offer from a new credit card my bank advertised 10 cash back on all spending during the first 90 days i wondered if gift card purchases counted and more than store cards i saw that visa gift cards with a $ 500 value sold for a $ 4.95 fee a 1 hit   it would have been foolish to load up and realize that they were somehow excluded so i bought 2 and followed the transaction on line when i saw the 10 credit i went full steam and bought these $ 2000 at a time as that was the limit cvs imposed in the end i stopped at $ 50,000 and the bank killed the online offer about $ 25 k into this but still honored my 90 days yes i had to make payments mid cycle to avoid the card limit $ 20 k but in the end the bit of effort paid off it took a bit over a year and a half to burn through them in hindsight i 'd do it for $ 100 k if the opportunity came up cash in the bank is earning near zero     tl dr make a small purchase and confirm your card gives you the bonus you expect

no all the leveraged etfs are designed to multiply the performance of the underlying asset for that day read the prospectus their price is adjusted at the end of the day to reflect what is called a nav unit basically they know that their price is subject to fluctuations due to supply and demand throughout the day simply because they trade in a quote driven system but the price is automatically corrected at the end of the day regardless in practice though all sorts of crazy things happen with leveraged etfs that will simply make them more and more unfavorable to hold long term the longer you look at it

tl;dr   sears is failing because the ceo is running the company into the ground for personal profit   there have been many many articles written on the issue   the ceo is having the stores sell their property at a discount to one of his other companies then having the stores pay rent   except boutique stores actually pay more money than sears does   so whenever a store closes his other company can rent the space out for almost double   oh and he encouraged a corporate culture where the department heads use those screen hospitals use to keep each other from spying on their laptops during meetings   the way it works some departments actually contract out to a 3rd party rather than going through corporate since it 's cheaper   yes departments individually have an it budget and are required to have their own contract to use in house it   it 's so bad that many employees say they are explicitly barred from helping another department   so customers feel and end up because there 's no one to help them or to run the register   that 's the power of a bad ceo that the board refuses to fire

if you get a loan for 80 of the value of your house that 's equivalent to buying a house with a 20 down payment assuming the appraised value is what you 'd buy it for   that 's the minimum down payment for fannie mae backed loans without pmi mortgage insurance   see this table for more details freddie mac the other major mortgage has a good fact sheet on cash out loans which is what this is called here   it also specifies maximum ltv ratio of 80 percent for primary residences   as noted in other answers the 80 rule is to protect the bank and ultimately fannie mae and freddie mac who will eventually buy most of these loans so it is more likely to recoup the total value of the mortgage if they must foreclose on the house

a couple options that i know of interactive brokers offers a paper trading mode to its account holders that allows you to start with a pretend stack of money and place simulated trades to test trading ideas they also provide an api that allows you to interface with their platform for retrieving quotes placing orders and the such as you noted however it 's not free you must hold a funded brokerage account in order to qualify for access to their platform in order to maintain an account there are minimums for required equity and monthly activity measured in dollars that you spend on commissions so you wo n't get access to their platform without having a decent amount of skin in the game ib 's native api is java based is an unofficial wrapper that makes the interface available in python i 've not used ib at all myself but i 've heard good things about their api and its accessibility via edit ib now supports python via their published api so using is no longer needed unless you wish to use python the officially supported api is based on python 3 td ameritrade also offers an api that is usable by its brokerage clients they do not offer any such paper trading mode so you would need to execute transactions based on quotes at the corresponding trade times and then keep track of your simulated account history yourself the api supports quote retrieval price history and trade execution among other functions tda might be more attractive than ib if you 're looking for a low cost link into market data as i believe their minimum equity levels are lower to get access you 'll need to sign up for an api developer account which i believe requires an nda i do n't believe there is an official python implementation of the api but if you 're a capable python writer you should n't have trouble up to the published interfaces some caveats as when doing any strategy backtesting you 'll want to be sure to be pessimistic when doing so so your optimism does n't make your trades look more successful than they would be in the real world at a minimum you 'll want to ensure that your simulations transact at the posted bid ask prices not necessarily the last trade 's price as well as any commissions and fees associated with the trade a more robust scheme would also take into account the depth of the order book also known as level 2 quotes which can cause additional slippage in the prices at which you buy sell your security an even more robust scheme would take into account the potential latency of trade execution looking at all prices over some time period that covers the maximum expected latency and simulating the trade at the worst possible price

the broker would give you a margin call and get you to deposit more funds into your account they would n't wait for the stock price to reach $ 30 but would take this action much earlier more over it is very unrealistic for any stock to go up 275 over a few hours and if the stock was this volatile the broker would be asking for a higher margin to start with what i am really worried about is that if there were any situation like this you are not considering what you would do as part of your risk management strategy before writing the option you should already have an exit point at which you would buy back the option to limit your losses

the people who cause this sort of sell off immediately are mostly speculators short term day traders and the like they realize that because of the lowered potential for earnings in the future the companies in question wo n't be worth as much in the future they will sell shares at the elevated price including sometimes shares that they borrow for the explicit purpose of selling short selling until the share price is more reasonable now the other question is why the companies in question wo n't sell for as much in the future even if every other company in the world looks less attractive all at once global economic catastrophe etc people have other options they could just put the money in the bank or in corporate bonds or in mortgage bonds or treasury bonds or some other low risk instrument or something crazy like gold if the expected return on a stock does n't justify the price you 're unlikely to find someone paying that price so you do n't actually need to have a huge sell off to lower the price you just need a sell off that 's big enough that you run out of people willing to pay elevated prices

if the employer provides housing to the employee the employer has to identify whether it is taxable or not if it is the amounts would be added to the taxable income on your w2 all the withholding and fica tax calculations will be performed based on that taxable income if the employer fails to do that and you get audited you can be left on the hook for the unpaid taxes on the unreported income in some cases employee housing is a non taxable fringe benefit in others it is taxable your tax adviser will help identify which case applies to you after you added in a comment that you 're trying to see if you should be asking your boss to pay your personal expenses vs. giving you a raise as i said in the comments your personal expenses are not deductible neither for you nor for anyone else if your boss pays your rent instead of a raise its taxable income for you

i just wanted to give you a different perspective as i own a house purchased with a mortgage with my girlfriend i think it can be done safely and fairly but you do need to involve legal help to do it right there really is nothing to be terrified about the extra cost to set this up was almost irrelevant in the bigger picture of legal costs around purchasing and the documents describing the ownership scheme are quite straightforward maybe it 's a uk thing but it seems rather commonplace here   we 've chosen to hold this as tenants in common and use a trust deed for this when we purchased we had a solicitor write the trust deed and it clearly states what percentage of the house is owned by either party and exactly what the steps would be taken should we decide to end the trust e.g. in case of a split up this includes things like the right to buy out the other person before selling on the market etc   we also had to make wills separately to indicate what should happen with our percentage of the property in case one of us died as with this type of ownership it does n't automatically go to the other person   finally we 're both on the mortgage which i guess is the main difference versus your situation but again you could get legal advice as to how this should best be handled

an important thing that many people fail to realize is that the number of shares outstanding in a stock times the current market price of those shares does not represent anything related to the total value of those shares   if a company has one million shares outstanding and its total value is $ 10 million then the real worth of each share is $ 10   if few people feels like buying or selling but a few people think the company is worth $ 50 million and offer $ 50/share that could raise the market price to $ 50/share but it would n't mean that the company became worth five times as much it would merely mean the stock was overpriced if after the price went to $ 50/share all the owners of the stock put in stop loss orders at $ 45   note that the real $ 10/share real value of their stock would never have changed   if the people who thought the stock was worth $ 50 decided to get out of the market and nobody else was willing to offer more than $ 10 that would instantly drop the price to $ 10   the fact that a million shares of stock have stop loss orders at $ 45 would n't magically generate buyers for those stocks at that price   indeed unchecked stop loss orders would have the reverse effect since many people who would have been willing if not eager to buy the stock if it had been available for less than $ 10/share would instead be trying to sell it below that price it 's too bad people think that the number of shares outstanding times the current market price represents some kind of meaningful quantity   if the present cash value of all future payouts associated with a share of stock is $ 10 then someone who buys a share of stock for less than that makes money off the seller someone who pays more loses money to the seller   many people think they can lose money to the seller and still come out okay if the price goes higher but what that really means is that they 're hoping to find a bigger sucker a game where it 's guaranteed that some people will have losses they do n't recoup

you can likely use bollinger band values to recognize sideways trending stocks bollinger band averages expand during periods of volatility and then converge on the matched prices the longer there is little volatility in the asset prices also look at the bollinger band formula to see if you can glean how that indicator does it so that you can create something more custom fit to your idea

the only authoritative document issued by the irs to date relating to cryptocurrencies is notice 2014 21 it has this to say as the first q&a how is virtual currency treated for federal tax purposes    for federal tax purposes virtual currency is treated as property general tax principles applicable to property transactions apply to transactions using virtual currency that is to say it should be treated as property like any other asset basis reporting the same as any other property would apply as described in irs documentation like publication 550 investment income and expenses and publication 551 basis of assets you should be able to use the same basis tracking method as you would use for any other capital asset like stocks or bonds per publication 550 how to figure gain or loss you figure gain or loss on a sale or trade of property by comparing the amount you realize with the adjusted basis of the property gain if the amount you realize from a sale or trade is more than the adjusted basis of the property you transfer the difference is a gain loss if the adjusted basis of the property you transfer is more than the amount you realize the difference is a loss   that is the assumption with property is that you would be using specific identification there are specific rules for mutual funds to allow for using average cost or defaulting to fifo but for general property including individual stocks and bonds there is just specific identification or fifo and fifo is just making an assumption about what you 're choosing to sell first in the absence of any further information you do n't need to track exactly which bitcoin was sold in terms of exactly how the transactions are on the bitcoin ledger it 's just that you bought x bitcoins on date d and when you sell a lot of up to x bitcoins you specify in your own records that the sale was of those specific bitcoins that you bought on date d and report it on your tax forms accordingly and keep track of how much of that lot is remaining it works just like with stocks where once you buy a share of xyz corp on one date and two shares on another date you do n't need to track the movement of stock certificates and ensure that you sell that exact certificate you just identify which purchase lot is being sold at the time of sale

why would it being private be necessarily evil and it is for profit but it 's not a business trying to maximize profits it is trying to keep the banking system stable among other uses and a stable banking system benefits us all finally the fed is made of many branches and they fight over policy so it is not some entity trying to screw people and it 's private because history has shown giving politicians the power the fed has turns out badly for economies which is why most economies now structure central banking along similar lines    i actually started learning after reading the creature from island which paint the fed as a monster designed to rape the populace and i was so outraged i wanted to help fight it as i read through it 's documents read economic theory to understand and read through historical boom and bust cycles i learned that the island types vastly ignore large components of history and economics    the way i think of that book now is if i only told you the cases where airbags killed you 'd think airbags are horrible and should be banned and i could list many details all of which could be true but i 'm ignoring many other needed facts without careful weighing of both sides including all data can you find that airbags are actually a very good thing with some bad cases the fed to me is the same

i work in banking for the private bank division for a major bank as a banker i have been helping clients with these types of transactions for years i believe that large transactions like this are best left to the big boys that is where the talented bankers loan officers underwriters are and that is the type of transaction they specialize in i know for a fact that your credit union will not be able to suit your needs and a smaller bank will be tough to deal with i would n't worry at all about the credit pulls as much as picking a rock solid bank with lots of experiences doing these kinds of deals that is my 2 cents albeit a little bit biased but it is also coming from experience history with the bank definitely matters but what business you can bring to the bank along with the lending deposits 401k management personal investments business services etc matter just as much and can make or break the approval decline or even the terms being favorable or not favorable to your company

it 's incredibly difficult to beat the market especially after you 're paying out significant fees for managed funds the bogleheads have some good things going for them on their low cost vanguard style funds the biggest winners in the financial markets are the people collecting fees from churn or setting up the deals which take advantage of less sophisticated connected players buy hold and forget has been shown as a loser as well in this recession diversifying and re balancing however takes advantage of market swings by cashing out winners and buying beaten down stocks if you take advantages of general market highs and lows without worrying about strict timing every few months to re balance you buy some protection from crashes in any given sector one common guideline is to use your age as the percentage of your holdings that are in cash equivalents rather than stocks at age 28 at least 28 of my account should be in bonds real estate commodities etc this should help guide your allocation and re balancing strategy finally focusing on growth and income funds may give you a better shot at above s&p returns but it 's wise to hold a small percentage in the s&p 500 as well

which option will save you the most money in the long run that is tough assuming you stay healthy do n't lose your job do n't experience a pay cut or any major emergency that drains your savings then applying the $ 6000 to the higher interest loan will save you more money in the long run however the difference in savings is a few hundred dollars not much really so in this case i 'd put the $ 6k towards the smaller loan why because then you 'd pay it off faster once that 's done you open up your cash flow by the minimum monthly payment you would have had on that loan   assuming they both have the same or similar number of months left by paying the smaller loan off sooner you 'd open up $ x month where $ x is your minimum monthly payment this could be useful to you if you want to take on some other debt like buying a house because it lowers your debt to income ratio if you put that money towards the higher loan your dti wo n't change until the normal time you would have paid off the smaller loan even if you are not looking to purchase anything that requires you to have a lower dti paying the smaller loan off sooner increases your cash flow sooner because your monthly payment on the higher loan does n't change just because you lowered the balance by $ 6k so you 'd be more robust to emergencies if your current income does n't allow for much savings a major emergency could wipe out all savings from paying down the bigger balance so i 'd suggest edit asked a question pretty much requesting more details for why i was biased towards paying off the smaller loan first what follows is my response with a bit of reorganization typically people asking these questions do n't have so much wealth that which loan to pay first is an academic question they need to make smart financial decisions while paying the highest interest loan saves the most money in interest that only occurs under the assumption that nothing bad will ever happen to you until the loans are paid off in reality other things happen tires blow out children get sick you get laid off and so the best thing to do is the one that maximizes your long term financial health even if it comes at the expense of a few $ k more interest each loan has a minimum monthly payment let 's assume barring any windfalls of additional cash you will just make the minimum payments each month towards a loan if you pay off the smaller loan first that increases your available monthly cash flow at that point you can put extra towards the other loan however if an emergency should come up or you need to save for a vacation you can do that without negatively impacting the second loan because you 'd just drop back to its minimum payment putting the money towards the higher balance loan would mean it takes you longer to reach this point as the time to reach payoff on the first loan will not change $ 6k only reduces the $ loan to $ so you never gain the flexibility of additional cash flow until the time you would have paid off the $ originally i 'd rather have a few hundred dollars each month that i can choose to use to make additional loan payments eat out pay for car repairs pay for emergencies than be forced to dip into credit or worse pay day loans should an emergency happen

construction loans are typically short term that then get rolled into conventional mortgages at the end of the construction period since the actual construction loan is short term you can not combine it with a long term land loan as well you could do the two separate loans up front to buy the land and finance the construction then at the end roll both into a conventional mortgage to close out the land and construction loans this option will only work if you do all three through the same lender trying to engage various lenders will require a whole new refinance process which i very much doubt you would want to go through these are sometimes called combo loans since they aggregate several different loan products in one transaction not a lot of places do land loans so i would suggest first find a lender that will give you a land loan and set an appoint with a loan representative explain what you are trying to do and see what they can offer you you might have better luck with credit unions as well instead of traditional banks

it depends on the market that you participate in stock markets are not zero sum as joetaxpayer explained on the other hand any kind of derivative markets such as options or futures are indeed zero sum due to the nature of the financial instruments that are exchanged those markets tend to be more i do n't have evidence for this but i believe one of the reasons that investors so often lose their money is psychology the majority of us as humans are not wired to naturally make the kinds of rigorous and quick decisions that markets require especially if day trading some people can invest time and energy to improve themselves and get over that those are the ones who succeed

the difference is that if you end up owing more than $ 1k in taxes come april you will be mandated for withholding next year that 's at the federal level i do n't know ca law in particular and if this is n't the first time you 've done it you may owe additional penalties as well   your actual tax liability comes out the same either way you 're probably better off just letting uncle sam have an interest free loan for a few months and getting the difference back in april than risking it but if you 've done the math and know you 'll only owe exactly $ you can do what you want

current account offers a lot of benefits for sole proprietors think of it like bank account for a company the bank provides a host of facilities for the company a sole proprietor does not have enough value as that of a company for a bank but needs similar services thus indian banks offer a down version of the account offered to a company current account offer very good overdraft withdrawing money even if balance is zero this feature is very useful as   business cycles and payment schedules can be different for each supplier customer the sole proprietor does business with imagine the sole proprietor account has balance of zero on day 0 customer x made payment by cheque on day 1 cheques will get credited only on day 3 assume day 2 is a national holiday or weekend   sole proprietor gave a cheque to his supplier on day 0 the supplier deposited the cheque on day 0 and the sole proprietor 's bank will debit the the proprietor 's account on day 1 as customer 's cheque will get credited only day 3 the overdraft facility will let the proprietor borrow from the bank interestingly current accounts were offered long before indian banks started   offering customized accounts to corporate customers the payment schedule mentioned in my example is based on a clearing system > 10 years ago systems have become much simpler now but banks have always managed to offer something significantly extra on lines similar to my example above to proprietor over a savings bank account

it is not an either or decision   if you want to retire decades early then you will need to have a taxable account anyway as you wo n't be able to stuff enough money into the tax advantaged accounts to meet that goal and if you are making a huge sum then you will be in a high tax bracket and so the tax advantages of saving into a 401 k or ira will be substantial so max out your 401k ira and then save the rest into the taxable brokerage account   when you retire at 39 live off your taxable account until you are old enough to tap the other ones without penalty unless you plan to die decades early as well as retire decades early   in that case you can bypass the 401k ira

do not mix personal accounts and corporate accounts if you 're paid as your self person this money belongs to you not the corporation you can contribute it to the corporation but it is another tax event and you should understand fully the consequences talk to a tax adviser ea cpa licensed in your state if they pay to you personally 1099 it goes on your schedule c and you pay se taxes on it if they pay to your corporation the corporation will pay it to you as salary and will pay payroll taxes on it generally payroll through corporation will be slightly more expensive than regular schedule c. if you have employees subcontractors though you may earn money which is not from your own performance in which case s corp may be an advantage

mint.com uses something called ofx open financial exchange to get the information in your bank account if someone accessed your mint account they would not be able to perform any transactions with your bank all they would be able to do is view the same information you do which some of it could be personal < that 's up to you generally the weakest point in security is with the user an attacker is far more likely to get your account information from you then he is from the site your registered with   why you 're the weakest point when you enter your account information your password is never saved exactly how you enter it it 's passed through what is called a one way function these functions are easy to compute one way but given the end result is extremely difficult to compute in reverse so in a database if someone looked up your password they would see it something like this when you log in to an account your password is sent through this function and then the result is checked against what is saved in the database if they match you are granted access the way an attacker would go about getting your password is by entering values into the function and checking the values against yours this is known as a brute force attack for our example it would take someone 5 million years to decry pt using a basic brute force attack i used as my example password it 's 12 characters long this is why most sites urge you to create long passwords with a mix of numbers and symbols this is a very basic explanation of security and both sides have better tools then the one explained but this gives you an idea of how security works for sites like these you 're far more likely to get a virus or a key steal your information i do use mint edit from the mint faq do you store my bank login information on your servers    your bank login credentials are stored securely in a separate database    using multi layered hardware and software encryption we only store the    information needed to save you the trouble of updating or    uploading financial information manually edit 2   from ofx about security open financial exchange ofx is a unified specification for the    electronic exchange of financial data between financial institutions    businesses and consumers via the internet this is how mint is able to communicate with even your small local bank final edit this answers everything   for passwords to mint itself we compute a secure hash of the user 's    chosen password and store only the hash the hash is also salted see      is a one way function    and can not be reversed    it is not possible to ever see or recover    the password itself   when the user tries to login we compute the    hash of the password they are attempting to use and compare it to the    hashed value on record this is a standard technique which every site    should use for banking credentials we generally must use reversible encryption    for which we have special procedures and secure hardware kept in our    secure and guarded   the keys never leave the    hardware device which is built to destroy the key material if the    protection is attacked   this device will only after    it is activated by a of other keys each of which is stored on    a and also encrypted by a password known to only one person    furthermore the device requires a time limited    signed permission token for each the    system which i designed and patented also has facilities for secure    remote auditing of each source david k vp engineering mint.com

i want to caveat that i am not an active investor in australia you most likely should seek out other investors in your market and ask them for advice but since you came here i can give you some generalized advice   when investing in real estate there are a two main rules of thumb to quickly determine if the property will be a good investment the 50 rule and the 2 or 1 rule    the 50 rules says that in general 50 if the income from the property will go to expenses not including debt service   if you are bringing in $ 1000 a month 500 of that will go to utilities taxes repair capital expenditures advertising lawn care etc that leave you with 500 to pay the mortgage and if anything is left that can be cash flow   as this is your first property and it is in a relatively bad neighbourhood you might consider bumping that up to 60 just to make sure you have padding the 1 or 2 rules says that the monthly rent should be 2 percent of the purchase price in this case the home is bought at 150,000   if the rent is 1,500 a month it might be a good investment but if it rents for 3,000 a month it probably is a good investment   there are other factors to consider if a home meets the 2 rule it might be in a rough neighborhood which increases turnover which in general is the biggest expense in an investment property   if a property meets one or both of these rules you should take a closer look at it and with proper due diligence determine that it is a deal   these rules are just hard and fast guidelines to property analysis they may need to be adapted to you market   for example these rules will not hold in most all big cities

you may as well ask why a piece of wood is 25 long but only 10 inches most units of measure are very arbitrary somebody decides that this amount of heat or distance or money is a convenient unit and so that 's what they use suppose that tomorrow the government issued a whole new currency that had 10 times the value of the old currency so if you used to make 10,000 foobars a year now you make 1,000 new foobars and likewise the price of everything you buy is divided by 10 if a certain model car used to cost 2,000 foobars now it costs 200 new foobars are you better or worse off clearly if all prices change by the same percentage then it makes absolutely no difference aside from the hassle of making the switch and getting used to the new numbers a currency where 1 unit of money buys more is not necessarily a stronger currency any more than inches are better than because you get more wood for an inch than you get for a a currency is said to be strong when it 's value is stable or increasing relative to other currencies if yesterday i could trade 10 foobars for 1 but today i only need 9 foobars to buy 1 then foobars are stronger than even though i still need more foobars than to buy the same item

is there anything here i should be concerned about i do n't see anything you should be concerned about unless your career outlook is very poor and you are making minimum wage if that is the case you may struggle for the next 10 years are these rates considered super high or manageable the rates for the federal loans are around twice as high as your private loans but that is the going rate and there is nothing you can do about it now 6.5 is n't bad on what is essentially a personal loan 2 3 are very manageable assuming you pay them and do n't let the interest build up   what is a good mode of attack here i am by no means a financial adviser and do n't know the rest of your financial situation but the most general advice i can give you is pay down your highest interest rate loans first and always try to pay more than the minimum in your case i would put as much as you reasonably can towards the federal loans because that will save you money in the long run what are the main takeaways i should understand about these loans the main takeaway is that these are student loans and they can not be discharged if you were to ever declare bankruptcy pay them off but do n't be too concerned about them if you do apply for loans in the future most lenders wo n't be too concerned about student loans assuming you are paying them on time and especially if you are paying more than the minimum payment   what are the payoff dates for the other loans the payoff dates for the other loans are a little hard to easily calculate but it appears they all have different payoff dates between 8 and 12 years from now this part might be easier for someone who is better at financial calculations than me why do my citi loans have a higher balance than the original payoff amounts your citi loans have a higher balance probably because you have not payed anything towards them yet so the interest has been accruing since you got them

here are the few scenarios that may be worth noting in terms of using different types of accounts traditional ira in this case the monies would grow tax deferred and all monies coming out will be taxed as ordinary income think of it as everything is in one big black box and the whole thing is coming out to be taxed roth ira in this case you could withdraw the contributions anytime without penalty source should one want it for further research past 59.5 the withdrawals are tax free in my understanding thus one could access some monies earlier than retirement age if one considers all the contributions that are at least 5 years old taxable account in this case each year there will be distributions to pay taxes as well as anytime one sells shares as that will trigger capital gains in this case taxes are worth noting as depending on the index fund one may have various taxes to consider for example a bond index fund may have some interest that would be taxed that the ira could shelter to some extent while index funds can be a low cost option in some cases there may be capital gains each year to keep up with the index for example small cap indices and value indices would have stocks that may the index by either becoming mid cap or large cap in the case of small cap or the value stock 's valuation rises enough that it becomes a growth stock that is pulled out of the index this is why some people may prefer to use tax advantaged accounts for those funds that may not be as tax efficient the bogleheads have an article on various accounts that can also be useful as 's comment referenced disclosure i 'm not an accountant or work for the irs

the only problem that i see is that by not giving the 20 right away you might need to pay pmi for a few months in addition in the case of conventional loans i heard that banks will not remove the pmi after reaching 80 ltv without doing an appraisal in order to be removed automatically you need to reach 78 ltv   finally i think you can get a better interest by giving 20 down and you can get a conventional loan instead of a fha loan which offers the option to avoid the pmi altogether on fha you have two one upfront and one monthly and the monthly one is for the life of the loan if you give less than 10

yes depending on the timing   you generally can make a tax free withdrawal of contributions if you do it before the due date for filing your tax return for the year in which you made them this means that even if you are under age 59½ the 10 additional tax may not apply these distributions are explained in pub   i believe any growth is subject to the 10 penalty the 10 additional tax on distributions made before you     reach age 59½ does not apply to these tax free withdrawals of your contributions however the distribution of interest or other income must be reported on form 5329 and unless the distribution qualifies as an exception to the age 59½ rule it will be subject to this tax

there is a substantial likelihood over the next several years that the us dollar will experience inflation you may have heard terms like quantitative easing with inflation the value of each dollar you have will go down this also means that the value of each dollar you owe will go down as well   so taking out a loan issuing a bond at a very good rate converting it into an asset that 's a better way to store value possibly including stock in a big stable company like msft and then watching inflation reduce the real value of the loan faster than the interest piles up that 's like getting free money combine that with the tax shelter games alluded to by everyone else and it starts to look like a very profitable endeavour

you could not have two stocks both at $ 40 both with p e 2 but one an eps of $ 5 and the other $ 10   eps = earnings per share p e = price per share earnings per share so in your example the stock with eps of $ 5 has a p e of 8 and the stock with an eps of $ 10 has a p e of 4   so no it 's not valid way of looking at things because your understanding of eps and p e is incorrect update ok with that fixed i think i understand your question better this is n't a valid way of looking at p e. you nailed one problem yourself at the end of the post the tricky part is that you have to assume certain values remain    constant i suppose but besides that it still does n't work it seems to make sense in the context of investor psychology if a stock is supposed to trade at a low p e like a utility that it would stay at that low p e and thus a $ 1 worth of eps increase would result in lower $ $ price increase than a stock that was supposed to have a high p e. and that would be true but let 's game it out scenario say you have two stocks abc and xyz both have $ 5 eps abc is a utility so it has a low p e of 5 and thus trades at $ xyz is a high flying tech company so it has a p e of 10 thus trading at $ 50/share if both companies increase their eps by $ 1 to $ 6 and the p es remain the same that means company abc rises to $ 30 and company xyz rises to $ 60 hey one went up $ 5 and the other $ 10 twice as much that means xyz was the better investment right nope you see shares are not tokens and you do n't get an identical arbitrary number of them you make an investment and that 's in dollars so say you 'd invested $ 1,000 in each $ 1,000 in abc buys you 40 shares $ 1,000 in xyz buys you 20 shares their eps adds that buck the shares rise to maintain p e and you have abc $ 6 eps at p e 5 = $ 30/share position value = 40 shares x $ 30/share = $ 1,200 xyz $ 6 eps at p e 10 = $ position value = 20 shares x $ = $ 1,200 they both make you the exact same 20 profit it makes sense when you think about it this way a 20 increase in eps is going to give you a 20 increase in price if the p e is to remain constant it does n't matter what the dollar amount of the eps or the share price is

what you 've described is the norm in australia where it 's rare for anyone under sixty to use cheques assuming they 're transferring the funds using internet banking i would have the following suggestions you make it clear that the the funds must reach your account by the due date for rent it is their the tenant 's responsibility to allow for the normal transfer delay from their account to yours this will save unpleasant arguments later if the rent is late if you 're not comfortable with your tenant knowing your banking details set up another account specifically for receiving rental income payments and paying your costs associated with the property this may have the added benefit of simplifying things at tax time another alternative which i think others have mentioned is to use an escrow service like paypal but be aware that these kinds of services will usually charge a small percentage when you withdraw your funds

buying individual small basket of high dividend shares is exposing you to 50%+ and very fast potential downswings in capital margin calls there is no free lunch in returns in this respect nothing that pays enough to help you pay your mortgage at a high rate wo n’t expose you to a lot of potential volatility main issue here looks like you have very poorly performing rental investments you should consider selling or switching up rental usage how you rent them moving to shorter term higher yield lets ditching any agents that are taking up capital try and refinance to lower mortgage rates etc etc trying to use leveraged stock returns to pay for poorly performing housing investments is like spraying gasoline all over a fire fixing the actual issue in hand first is virtually always the best course of action in these scenarios

i 'd rent and put the $ yr into savings when the short sale comes off your credit you 'll have a substantial downpayment   you do n't mention the balance but the current rate you 're paying is 3 too high even if you get the rate reduced you have a $ 100 k issue   i recommend reading through will short sale prevent me from getting va home loan later a bit different question but it talks more about the short sale a comment for that question makes a key point if you have a short sale will the bank chase you for the balance if not you have a choice to make   adding note after commented first run the numbers if you were to pay the $ 100 k off over 7 years it 's $ extra nearly $ 130 k and even then you might not be at 80 ltv i do n't know what rents are like in your area but do the math first if the rent is less than the current tax and maintenance you will immediately have better cash flow each month and over time save towards the newer house   if you feel compelled to work this out and stay put i 'd go to the bank and tell them you 'd like them to the loan to a new rate they have more to lose than you do and there 's nothing wrong with a bit of a threat you can walk away or they can do what 's reasonable to just fix your rate with a 4 rate you 'd easily attack the principal if you wish as you commented above if the bank offers no option i 'd seriously consider the short sale there 's nothing wrong with that option from a moral standpoint in my opinion this is not falls and you are not hurting your neighbors the bank is amoral if not immoral

i do n't believe saturday is a business day either when i deposit a check at a bank 's drive in after 4 pm friday the receipt tells me it will credit as if i deposited on monday   if a business computer does n't adjust their billing to have a weekday due date they are supposed to accept the payment on the next business day else as you discovered a sunday due date is really the prior friday in which case they may be running afoul of the rules that require x number of days from the time they mail a bill to the time it 's due   the flip side to all of this is to pick and choose your battles in life just pay the bill 2 days early the interest on a few hundred dollars is a few cents per week you save that by not using a stamp just charge it on their site on the friday keep in mind you can be right but their computer still you so you call and spend your valuable time when ever the due date is over a weekend getting an agent to reverse the late fee the cost of right is wasting ten minutes which is worth far more than just avoiding the issue altogether   but if you are in the us you did n't give your country we have regulations for everything hr aka the card act of 2009 offers 2 weekend or holiday due dates if the payment due date for a    credit card account under an open end consumer credit plan is a day on    which the creditor does not receive or accept payments by mail    including weekends and holidays the creditor may not treat a    payment received on the next business day as late for any purpose so if you really want to pursue this you have the power of our congress on your side

the vix is a mathematical aggregate of the implied volatilities of the s&p 500 index components it itself can not be traded as there currently is no way to only hold a position on an implied volatility alone   implied volatility can only currently be derived from an option relative to its underlying   further the s&p 500 index itself can not be traded only the attempts to replicate it   for assets that are not tradable derivatives can be cash settled where the value of the underlying is delivered in cash   cash settlement can be used for underlyings that in fact due trade but are frequently only elected if the underlying is costly to deliver or there is an incentive to circumvent regulation currently only futures that settle on the value of the vix at the time of delivery trade in other words vix futures holders must deliver on the value of the vix in cash upon settlement   options in turn trade on those futures and in turn are also cash settled on the value of the underlying future at expiration the vxx etf holds one to two month vix futures that it trades out of before delivery so while it is impossible to know exactly what is held in the vxx accounts unless if one had information from an insider or the vxx published such details one can assume that it holds vix futures contracts no later than two settlements from the preset   it should be noted that the vxx does not track the vix over the long run because of the cost to roll the futures and that the futures are more stable than the vix so it is a poor substitute for the vix over time periods longer than one day underlying now implies any abstract from which a financial product derives its value

co signing is not the same as owning if your elderly lady did n't make any payments on the loan and is n't on the ownership of the car and there was no agreement that you would pay her anything then you do not owe either her or her daughter any money also the loan is not affecting the daughter 's credit and the mother 's credit is irrelevant since she is dead however you should be aware that the finance company will want to know about the demise of the mother since they can no longer make a claim against her if you default i would start by approaching the loan company telling them about the mother 's death and asking to refinance in your name only if you 've really been keeping up the payments well this could be ok with them if not i would find someone else who is prepared to co sign a new loan with you and still refinance then just tell the daughter that the loan her mother co signed for has been discharged and there is nothing for her to worry about

gt a the base value from infrastructure is derived on a per capita basis it is a fixed cost as opposed to a variable one in other words roads are just as useful to me as they are to you regardless of my net worth a tank a missile a police officer protects me the same as it does anyone else   a trucking company making millions of dollars a year on us highways derives more value from the roads than i do    honestly anyone who says that they do n't need to pay for roads because of their level of benefit from them is limited and i will call you a liar unless you are living in a box in the woods 100s of miles away from civilization you absolutely rely on the road system even if you never set foot on it    though at the same time a national highway system was something no business would ever make as it derives too little value for an individual business for the scale required to reach enough of the market this is a perfect example of a project that is good for society but wo n't see the tab picked up by business voluntarily    gt b as a percentage of income infrastructure is far more valuable to low income individuals than high income individuals a simple example if i have $ 5 m in net worth i can invest it in the stock market and stay home if you do n't have that option you need to go to work and that will likely require roads i wo n't be taking unemployment benefits but you are far more likely to and so on   it is foolish to assume your market value increases do not rely on infrastructure to happen as much as paper trading inflates value for the most part it is still tied to some kind of real work or rather the expectation of being done somewhere that assumption of ability for a corporation to serve it 's shareholders is based on the fact that companies have infrastructure needs handled and that expanding delivery to three new markets wo n't be hampered because the company must first complete the highway to serve these markets   the existence of infrastructure not only supports the market but allows you to exploit it the internet here makes a great example prior to funding and a push by the government to standardize military and academic networks and technology as well as make more powerful in order to stay ahead in tech race we had a mish mash of proprietary networks with very poor abilities to use them today we have the internet a largely private system today however it would not exist without the involvement and funding from the government for the multiple programs that led to it 's existence   gt c the activities of business owners generate massive tax revenues these far outweigh their personal utility from infrastructure   if the taxes really outweighed utility businesses would not operate in the area at all the thing is they do n't and taxes are not preventing businesses from growing     gt d society captures the majority of individual commercial efforts estimates vary but typically 85 in other words if i generate $ 10.00 of value as an entrepreneur i will realistically be able to capture only $ 1.50 of that   yes but that is because unless you are doing it all yourself then you did not generate that $ 10 as a business owner you are in charge of managing resources to help generate that $ 10 you yourself however did not generate that $ 10 you had employees and contractors and people managing your building payroll and yes even taxes every person involved in getting the product or service from idea to the door are all part of that $ 10 if your efforts in that co are netting you 15 of the total then you are beating the market already and i am not sure what your problem is if you are looking to double or triple your investments you are looking for las vegas not wall st or main st.   i think the issue i see among people with your opinion is a failure to understand 2nd and 3rd order effects your bubble extends to what you do in your daily life and the parts of it you visibly see and touch the world you see and touch every day is supported and made comfortable by a whole system and people whom you will never see or know

md tech 's answer is correct let me only point out that there are easier ways to invest in the djia index without having to buy individual stocks you can buy a mutual fund or etf that will track the index and your return will be almost identical to the performance of the underlying index it 's almost identical because the fund will take a small management fee you will have to pay annual taxes on capital gains if you hold the investment in a taxable account and because the fund has to actually invest in the underlying stocks there will be small differences due to rounding and timing of the fund 's trades you also ask assuming that i calculated those numbers correctly is this gain    approximately better equal to or worse than an average investment    for that while people argue about the numbers index funds tend to do better than average depends on what you call average of course they do better than most actively managed funds too and since they have low management fees index funds are often considered to be an important part of a long term investment portfolio because they require very little activity on your part other than buying and holding

the problem i have with gold is that it 's only worth what someone will pay you for it   to a degree that 's true with any equity but with a company there are other capital resources etc that provide a base value for the company and generally a business model that generates income gold just sits there it does n't make products it does n't perform services you ca n't eat it and the main people making money off of it are the folks charging a not commission to sell it to you or buy it back   sure it 's used in small quantities for things like plating electrical contacts dental work shielding etc but industrial uses account for only 10 of consumption   mostly it 's just hoarded either in the form of jewelry 50 or investment bullion coins 40   its value derives largely from rarity and other than the last few years there 's no track record of steady growth over time like the stock market or real estate just look at what gold prices did between 10 to 30 years ago i 'm not sure it came anywhere near close to keeping pace with inflation during that time   if you look at the chart you see a steady price until the us went off the gold standard in 1971 and rules regarding ownership and trading of gold were relaxed   there was a brief run up for a few years after that as the market found its level as it were and you really need to look from about 74 forward which it experienced its first test and demonstration of a supporting price around inflation adjusted   then the price fluctuated largely between 800 to 400 per ounce adjusted for inflation for the next 30 years other than a brief sympathetic silver tuesday spike due to the hunt brothers manipulation of silver prices in 1980   not sure if there is any causality but it is interesting to note that the recent in price starts in 2000 at almost the same time the last country the swiss went off the gold standard and gold was no longer tied to any currency or versa    if you bought in 75 as a hedge against inflation you were down as much as 50 during much of the next 33 years   if you managed to buy at a low the couple of times that gold was going down and found support around adjusted then you were on average up slightly as much as a little over 50 throwing out silver tuesday but then from about 98 through 05 had barely broken even   i personally view investments in gold at this time as a speculation   look at the history below and ask yourself if buying today would more likely end up as buying in 1972   or 1975 or gods forbid 1980   would you be taking advantage of a buying opportunity or piling onto a bubble and end up buying at the high   note from joe the article demand and supply adds to the discussion and supports chuck 's answer

the best way to invest in college for your kid is to buy an investment property and rent it out you might think i am really crazy to ask you to you to buy a real estate property when everyone is running from real estate   go where others are running away from it look where others are not looking find out the need for a decent rental property in your city or county and start following the real estate market to understand the real activities including the rental market i would say follow it for 6 months before jumping in with any investment   and manage your property with good tenants until your kid is ready to go to college by the time your kid is ready for college the property would have been paid off by the rents and you can sell the property to send your kid to college

to round out something that w. rea pointed out the business that a reit is in will be either a equity reit property management b mortgage reit lending or c hybrid reit both   a very key point about why reits broadly have been struggling lately and this would show up in the reit indices etfs you 've linked to is linked to the reit business models   for an equity reit they borrow money at the going rate let 's say for commercial scale loans and use that to take out mortgages on physical properties if a property rents for $ 15 k per month and they can take out a $ 1.8 million loan at $ 9,000 per month then their business is around managing maintenance operating expenses and taxes on that $ 6,000 per month margin for a mortgage reit they borrow funds as a highly qualified borrower again let 's say and lend those funds back out at a higher rate the basic concept is that if you borrow $ 10 million at 4.5 for 30 years you need to pay it back at $ per month if you can lend it out reliably at 5 you collect $ per month a handy $ 3,000 per month the cheaper you can get money at below 4.5 and the higher you can lend it at above 5 the better your margin is   the worry is that both reit business models are very highly dependent on the cost of borrowing money with the us fed changing its bond buying qe stimulus activity the prevailing interest rates are likely to go up while this has its benefits inflation it also will make it more expensive for these types of companies to do business

fundamentally interest rates reflect the time preference people place on money and the things money can buy   if i have a high time preference then i prefer money in my hand versus money promised to me at some date in the future   thus i will only loan my money to someone if they offer me an incentive which would be an amount of money to be received in the future that is larger than the amount of money i ’m giving the debtor in the present i.e. the interest rate many factors go into my time preference determination   my demand for cash i.e. my cash balance the credit rating of the borrower the length of the loan and my expectation of the change in currency value are just a few of the factors that affect what interest rate i will loan money the first loan i make will have a lower interest rate than the last loan ceteris paribus   this is because my supply of cash diminishes with each loan which makes my remaining cash more valuable and a higher interest rate will be needed to entice me to make additional loans   this is the theory behind why interest rates will rise when qe3 or ever stops   qe is where the federal reserve cartel prints new money to purchase bonds from cartel banks   if qe slows or ends the supply of money will stop increasing which will make cash more valuable and higher interest rates will be needed to entice creditors to loan money note that increasing the stock of money does not necessarily result in lower interest rates   as stated earlier the change in value of the currency also affects the interest rate lenders are willing to accept   if the federal reserve cartel deposited $ 1 million everyday into every us citizen ’s bank account it would n’t take long before lenders demanded very high interest rates as compensation for the decrease in the value of the currency does the federal reserve cartel affect interest rates   yes in two ways   first as mentioned before it prints new money that is loaned to the government   it either purchases the bonds directly or purchases the bonds from cartel banks which give them cash to purchase more government bonds   this keeps demand high for government bonds which lowers the yield on government bonds yields move inverse to the price of the bond   the federal reserve cartel also can provide an unlimited amount of funds at the federal funds rate to the cartel member banks   banks can borrow at this rate and then proceed to make loans at a higher rate and pocket the difference remember however that the federal reserve cartel is not the only market participant   other bond holders such as foreign governments and pension funds buy and sell us bonds   at some point they could demand higher rates   the federal reserve cartel which currently holds close to 17 of us public debt could attempt to keep rates low by printing new money to buy all existing us bonds to prevent the yield on bonds from going up   at that point however holding us dollars becomes very dangerous as it is apparent the federal reserve cartel is just a money printing machine for the us government   that ’s when most people begin to dump dollars en masse

the amount you are earning in the savings account is insignificant since you would only have the money in the account for 1 month after purchasing the car   the instant 1.5 cashback or travel mile reward on the other hand can be significant however it is not normal for a car dealership to allow you to put $ 16k on a credit card   the reason is that the fees that the dealer has to pay to process your credit card would be too burdensome   car dealers have a much smaller profit margin on their sales than a typical retail store so if the dealer has to pay 3 or 4 of the sales price in credit card fees it just eats up too much of their profit if the dealer does allow you to put the entire purchase price on a credit card be aware that they have already factored in their processing fees into the price   you might be able to get a better than 1.5 discount by offering to pay with cash instead

mortgage qualification is typically done based on pretax income to keep the math easy let 's assume $ 10k month gross   a well written loan allows 28 or $ 2800 to be used for the mortgage and property tax property tax varies but 1 is the average of the 2 states mentioned this results in $ property or $ tax leaving $ note here op stated $ 750 k house   $ will finance $ 450 k at years $ will finance $ 300 k at 3.5 let me pause here facts are most important to make these decisions unless you 're clear on gross income which may be higher the constraints above quickly come into play   once the numbers are spelled out you may find that you are qualified to only borrow $ 350 k based on a 30 year note nathan 's $ 2500 payment was correct but for the mortgage only add property tax and you 'd be at $ you 'd need a gross $ to meet the 28 rule   the above discussion would render any further thoughts of mine moot

firstly i think you need to separate your question into two parts if you are chinese live in china and intend to stay in china for most of your life then the default answer to question 1 should be   question 2 is not as important you can hold usd in almost any country in the world any investment you hold has risk which may include market risk credit risk liquidity risk inflation risk etc holding usd will expose you to exchange rate fluctuations as well   if the rises in value against the dollar your returns in usd will be reduced by the same amount remember that for currency fluctuations you have to multiply the percentages see here for a good explanation the first thing you probably want to do is find out exactly what the assets are in the you have invested in   the fact that there is a risk level even if it is only 2 would suggest to me that the fund is investing in some combination of bonds and stocks which means that your returns are not guaranteed and could make a loss interest rates on deposit accounts are mandated by the government in china and the current 12 month deposit rate on rmb is 3   to earn over 3 must be investing your assets in something else i 'm guessing bonds   bear in mind that 1.5 years is a very short amount of time in investments so do n't assume this return will continue   i 'm afraid i 've only been studying chinese for a year so i ca n't really help you much with the link you 've sent through you may want to check if there is any guaranteed minimum return which can be the case in more complex structured products ultimately you will need to pick an investment which you feel gives you the best combination of risk and return for your situation there are a huge amount of options to choose between   the 4 5 you are earning right now is not a huge risk premium on the 3 you could earn in china from a time deposit but in the current environment you may struggle to beat it without taking on more risk   before considering that though understand how much risk you already have with

if you want to monitor how well you did in choosing your investments you will want to use stock prices that account for the dividends and splits and other changes not just the closing price   the adjusted close will include these changes where the straight close will not include them   using the adjusted close you will get your true percentage change   for example i have a stock called pets that paid an $ 0.18 dividend in july 2015 the adjusted closes before that day in july are all $ 0.18 lower per share   say the closing price had been unchanged at $ 20.00   the close prices would say i made no profit but the adjusted closing price would say i made $ 0.18 per share on this investment because the adjusted close would read $ in june 2015 but would read $ 20.00 in august 2015 just like the closing price   the adjusted close allows me to know my true profit per share

the logic the interest rate on the mortgage was so low it did n't make sense not to buy is one reason the housing bubble happened the logic was that it made the house affordable even at high prices once the prices collapsed people still had affordable payments but were unable to sell because they were upside down on the mortgage if you can refinance to a 15-year mortgage or from a adjustable mortgage to a fixed rate mortgage it can make sense you can save on the monthly payment and on the total cost of the mortgage but do n't buy to take advantage of rates or to save on taxes or to build a guaranteed equity these can be false economies or things that ca n't be of course if nobody spends money the economy will stay poor as to hidden details only purchase housing you want to own for the long haul if you expect to flip it in a few years you might not be able to you might end up stuck as a long distance landlord

generally a one time thing is considered a gift for the donor this is obviously not a deductible expense except for some specific cases for example promotional gifts under $ 25 to vendors can be deducted if you 're a business or charitable contributions to a recognized charity however if this is a regular practice that would not be considered as a gift but rather as a tax fraud a criminal offense being attentive i would like to make a little gift or give some little    < 100 $ amount of money cash wire online for that why generally gift is exempt from income if no services were provided and the gift was made in good faith in the situation you describe this does n't hold when the gift is exempt from income to the receiver the donor pays the tax in this case below exemption the tax is zero if the gift is not exempt from income to the receiver it is no longer a gift and the receiver is paying income taxes not the donor the situation you describe is a classic tax evasion scheme if someone does it consistently and regularly as a receiver donor or both he would likely end up in jail

what you need will depend on a number of factors that are n't clear from the question this coverage is simply called vacant home insurance but not all companies are willing to offer this coverage unfortunately in new york insurers can also legally drop your standard homeowners coverage if they become aware that your property has become vacant for 30 days or more the insurer 's concerns typically a standard homeowners policy will have an exclusion clause for vacant homes the insurance company 's concern is that without someone in the home they will be at risk for break ins and if you 've ever seen flip men on spike you 'll know this is a serious concern great show by the way they will use a risk model to calculate an estimated risk for the property this is why a seasonal vacation home in a populated area is often less of a concern than a family home in an urban area if they estimate the risk to be low some insurance companies will allow to you buy back that exclusion so that vacant properties are covered in your case they have probably decided that either your options first you need to find a company that is comfortable with taking on the extra risk of a vacant home this will vary quite a bit by location but the main ones are farmer 's they use the foremost brand name in new york and castle rock there are lots of insurance agencies that also advertise these products but most of them are middlemen and use one of these two companies to actually write the coverage additionally since this is a specialty policy make sure you understand all of the details of the policy and how they vary from a regular policy including how to reduce your premium costs these are general tips from the murray group 's website an independent broker in ny on how to lower the additional cost of vacant coverage this may sound expensive but these steps will all reduce the risk of something really bad happening when you 're not there additionally do you know anyone you completely trust relative unemployed friend that might want to live in your old house rent free for a while this could work out for you if they are willing to keep the place 100 clean around the clock so that you can show the house at any time if you have additional specific questions you should be able to find an independent insurance broker in your area that would be willing to advise you on your specific situation for a flat fee best of luck with getting the home covered and sold quickly

how does equifax lose sales after a   unless their data has been corrupted or falsified it 's still good to sell or charge for each credit pull     i think it 's very different from say a consumer facing organization like sony or target or anthem   although even in all 3 cases you can argue they did n't lose much market share all three are above their pre hack prices     the goal is to allow the market to set a price on the value of security for the rest of the companies in the industry   i do n't think the penalty should be death but considering their total assets is $ 10b i do n't think any fair penalty would allow the organization to survive   if they were apple with $ market cap then yeah the $ 70b would be a harsh and fair but penalty

i think tradition is going to be a big obstacle to lab grown meat as there are nt that many ways to grow it in a way to fit the idea of meat for people who are used to eating actual meat for 20 or more years the taste and texture is going to be really different people are sensitive to this stuff its like i like meat i have been eating it all my life and now suddenly there is something entirely else that calls itself meat on the table   no if the cost is similar and it has a lot of marketing campaigns i m thinking years of marketing behind it its still going to be the same effect meaning its not going to be this big money maker that its makers expect you ca nt force a product to if there is no product market match

is it any different than if i decide to put similar amount of money in 401(k at some other time of the year   not from a tax standpoint but if can affect a few other things since the earnings difference is likely negligible you miss out on returns for only a few months i would look at other conditions   in the long run it probably wo n't make much difference but knocking out obstacles to wealth building can give you a sense of accomplishment that will encourage smart money decisions going forward

it 's always hard to know the exact policy terms but as a general rule there are two main contributions to insurance payouts the first part covers expenses aimed at restoring the situation to its previous state pre incident this may include repair work and materials etcetera the second part kicks in when it 's not reasonably possible to repair the damage or at least not in a financially efficient way in this case the insurer can decide to pay out the decrease in value this is in fact very common in car accidents where the car is a total loss   in your case it 's quite possible that your roof even with the two partial repairs is in a worse condition than it was before the storm for instance the new shingles may not match the old ones exactly thus the value of your home has decreased despite the reasonable repair attempt and as mhoran_psprep points out there can be hidden damage as well which is a liability if you 've accepted the cash payment in lieu of a full repair you also accept the roof in its new condition

i 'm pretty sick of the crying about the bailout my libertarian friends just do n't seem to grasp how much worse things would have been if we let them fail no one seems to recall their history courses on the great depression a bank run would probably have brought us to or knees for decades along with complete lack of trust that would have been in an entire generation yes the banks should have been punished but that 's a separate issue in my mind they also should be held to higher capital requirements to ensure their ability to weather these rare events but we need regulation because we can not allow them to fail and we need large fines or heavy handed to enforce them rather than a slap on the wrist

of course i know nothing about real estate or owning a home i would love to hear people 's thoughts on why this would or would not be a good idea are there any costs i am neglecting i want the house to be primarily an investment is there any reason that it would be a poor investment   i live and work in a college town but not your college town you like many students convinced to buy are missing a great many costs there are benefits of course there 's a healthy supply of renters and you get to live right next to campus but the stuff next to campus tends to be the oldest and therefore most repair prone property around which is where the bad neighborhood vibe comes from a lot of the value of your property would be riding on government policy could involve drastic cuts to their size in the near future and student loan reform could backfire and become even less available even city politics comes into play when property developers lobby city council to your neighborhood for apartments you could end up either surrounded with cheaper units or possibly eminent i 've seen both happen in my college town if you refuse to sell you could find yourself facing an oddly high number of rental inspections for example so on to the general advice firstly real estate in general does n't reliably increase in value at best it tends to track inflation most of the flipping and such you saw over the past decade was a prolonged bubble which is slowly and reliably tanking    beyond that property taxes insurance pmi and repairs need to be factored in as well as income tax from your renters and if you leave the home and continue to rent it out it 's not a owner occupied property anymore which is part of the agreement you sign and determines your interest rate there 's also risks if one of your buddies loses their job wrecks their car or loses financial aid you may find yourself having to eat the loss or evict a good friend or if they themselves just for an example alcohol poisoning it could land on your homeowners insurance or maybe the plumbing breaks and you 're out an expensive repair finally there are significant costs to transacting in real estate you can expect to pay like 5 6 percent of the price of the home to the agents and various fees to inspections it will be exceedingly difficult to recoup the cost of that transaction before you graduate you 'll also be anchored into managing this asset when you could be pursuing career opportunities elsewhere in the nation take a quick look at three houses you would consider buying and see how long they 've been on the market that 's months of your life dealing with this house in a bad neighborhood

i 'm going to discuss this in general as specific investment advice is n't allowed here what type of account is the $ 60 k in now i mean is it in a 401(k ira or regular account cd money market   you are still working does your company offer any kind of matched 401(k if so take advantage of that right up the level they 'll match if not are you currently depositing to pretax iras you ca n't just deposit that $ 60 k into an ira if it is n't already but you can put $ 11k yr $ 5 for you $ 6 k for hubby if you make $ 11 k or more this year now disclaimer i am anti annuity like many who are pro or con on issues this is my nature the one type of annuity i actually like is the immediate annuity the link is not for an end company it shows quotes from many and is meant as an example today a 65 yr old man can get $ with a $ 100 k purchase this is 7.2 in an economy in which rates are sub 3 you give up principal in exchange for this higher annual return   this is a viable solution for the just retired person whose money will run out when looking at a 4 5 withdrawal but 1 cd rate in general these products are no more complex that what i just described unlike annuities sold to younger fold which combine high fees with returns that are so complex to describe that most agents ca n't keep their story straight   aside from the immediate flavor all other annuities are partial sold there 's a quote among finance folk annuities are sold not bought based on their tax deferral features i do n't suspect you are in a tax bracket where that feature has any value to you   at with at least 10 years ahead of you i 'd research diversification and asset allocation even $ 60 k is enough to proper invest these funds until you retire and then decide what 's right for you    beginners guide to asset allocation diversification and rebalancing is an interesting introduction and it 's written by the sec so your tax dollars paid for it   some months ago i wrote diversifying to reduce risk which falls short of a complete discussion of asset allocation but it does illustrate the power of being in a stock bond mix the ups and downs were reduced significantly compared to the all stock portfolio   for follow up or to help others reply to you a bit more detail on the current investments and how you are devastated eg was there a huge loss from what you had a few years ago edit the original poster has n't returned posted the question and left it 's unfortunate as this was someone who would benefit from the dialog and the answers here can help others in a similar position but i feel more discussion is in order for the op last i caught a downvote on my reply today i take no offense but curious which part of my answer the disagreed with

if the correction results in you owing them money you typically just need to pay them the appropriate amount i believe they charge back dated interest on the amount if it was supposed to have been paid in the past but if it 's for this year 's taxes then payment is n't due until the end of april and so interest would not apply in some circumstances they may apply fines or press charges for tax evasion but only if they have reason to believe you intentionally knowingly attempted to your tax return in order to avoid paying taxes you can challenge their decision to fine you but you are considered guilty until proven innocent obviously that 's the opposite for any criminal charges the good news is lots of people accidentally enter the wrong numbers and the cra is aware of this and rarely takes action against them other than making them pay what they owe they have ways to look for suspicious behavior and differentiate that from innocent mistakes so do n't worry you should be fine not fined

just to make this a little less i will base everything on the mercedes benz american express mb amex card which is the closest to a $ 100 annual fee i found on american express 's website the benefits of a card with an annual fee generally are worth the cost if and only if you spend enough money on the card and avoid paying interest to offset the benefit   using the mb amex card as a reference it offers 5x points for mercedes benz purchases 3x points at gas stations 2x points at restaurants and 1x points everywhere else   even if we only make purchases at the 1x rate it only takes charging $ 10,000 to the card in a year in order to make up the difference   not too hard to do on a card someone uses as their main method of payment   every dollar spent at the higher rates only makes that easier there are a number of other benefits as well   after spending $ 5,000 on the card in a year you receive a $ 500 gift card towards the purchase of a mercedes benz car   for anyone on the market for a mercedes benz the card pays for itself multiple times with just this benefit

you do n't say what country you live in if it 's the u.s. the irs has very specific rules for business use of a car see for starters at least the gist of it is if you use the car 100 for business purposes you never use it to drive to the grocery store or to your friend 's house etc then it is a deductible business expense if you use a car party for business use and partly for personal use than you can deduct the portion of the expense of the car that is for business use but not the portion that is for personal use so basically if you use the car 75 for business purposes and 25 for personal use you can deduct 75 of the cost and expenses you can calculate the business use by a keeping careful records of how much you spent on gas oil repairs etc tracking the percentage of business use versus percentage of personal use and then multiplying the cost by the percentage business use and that is the amount you can deduct or b use the standard mileage allowance so many cents per mile which changes every year note that the fact that you paid for the car from a business account has absolutely nothing to do with it if it did then everyone could create a small business open a business account pay all their bills from there and all their personal expenses would magically become business expenses just by the way if you are going to try to stretch the rules on your taxes business use of a car or personal computer or expenses for a home office are the worst place to do it the irs knows that cars and computers are things that can easily be used for either personal or business purposes and so they keep a special eye out on these

the question you are asking concerns the exercise of a short option position   the other replies do not appear to address this situation suppose that apple is trading at $ 96 and you sell a put option with a strike price of $ 95 for some future delivery date say august 2016   the option contract is for 100 shares and you sell the contract for a premium of $ 3.20 when you sell the option your account will be credited with the premium and debited with the broker commission   the premium you receive will be $ 320 = 100 x $ 3.20   the commission you pay will depend on you broker now suppose that the price of apple drops to $ 90 and your option is exercised either on expiry or prior to expiry   then you would be obliged to take delivery of 100 apple shares at the contracted option strike price of $ 95 costing you $ 9,500 plus broker commission   if you immediately sell the apple shares you have purchased under your contract obligations then assuming you sell the shares at the current market price of $ 90 you would realise a loss of $ 500 = plus commission   since you received a premium of $ 320 when you sold the put option your net loss would be $ = $ 180 plus any commissions paid to your broker now let 's look at the case of selling a call option   again assume that the price of apple is $ 96 and you sell a call option for 100 shares with a strike price of $ 97 for a premium of $   the premium you receive would be $ 360 = 100 x $   you would also be debited for commission by your broker now suppose that the price of apple shares rises to $ 101 and your option is exercised   then you would be obliged to deliver 100 apple shares to the party exercising the option at the contracted strike price of $ 97   if you did not own the shares to effect delivery then you would need to purchase those shares in the market at the current market price of $ 101 and then sell them to the party exercising the option at the strike price of $ 97   this would realise an immediate loss of $ 400 = 100 x $ plus any   commission payable   if you did own the shares then you would simply deliver them and possibly pay some commission or a delivery fee to your broker   since you received $ 360 when you sold the option your net loss would be $ 40 = $ plus any commission and fees payable to the broker it is important to understand that in addition to these accounting items short option positions carry with them a margin requirement   you will need to maintain a margin deposit to show good faith so long as the short option position is open   if the option you have sold moves against you then you will be called upon to put up extra margin to cover any potential losses

a fascinating view on this the math of a 10 deposit and projected 10 return lead to an inevitable point when the account is worth 10x your income nice and the deposit 10 of income only represents 1 of the account balance   the use of an ira is neither here nor there as your proposed deposit is still just 1 of your retirement account total pay off debt for one with this level of savings it should be assumed you are n't carrying any high interest debt   it really depends on your age and retirement budget our number was our final income so at 10x we were still saving for you if you project hitting your number soon enough i 'd still deposit to the match but maybe no more it might be time to just enjoy the extra money for others their goal may be much higher and those extra years deposits are still needed i 'd play with a spreadsheet and see the impact of reduced retirement account deposits note the question asks about funding the 401(k vs paying down debt i 'd always advise to deposit to the match but beyond that one should focus on their high interest debt especially by their 50 's

what could a small guy with $ 100 do to make himself not poor the first priority is an emergency fund one of the largest expenses of poor people are short term loans for emergencies being able to avoid those will likely be more lucrative than an s&p investment remember just like a loan if you use your emergency fund you 'll need to refill it be smart and pay yourself 10 interest when you do it 's still less than you 'd pay for a payday loan and yet it means that after every emergency you 're better prepared for the next event to get an idea for how much you 'd need you probably own a car how much would you spend if you suddenly had to replace it that should be money you have available if you think must buy a new car better have that much available if you can live with a you 're still going to need a few k.   having said that the next goal after the emergency fund should be savings for the infrequent large purchases the emergency fund if for the case where your car unexpectedly gets totaled the saving is for the regular replacement again the point here is to avoid an expensive loan   paying down a mortgage is not that important mortgage loans are cheaper than   car loans and much cheaper than payday loans still it would be nice if your house is paid when you retire but here chances are that stocks are a better investment than real estate even if it 's the real estate you live in

cheapest is one thing   you can absolutely shop in the market and find the lowest possible price   i can think of three places to shop each with an up and downside i would think that what you really mean is the best price for the service   just like shopping for a car you have to decide what you need vs what is nice to have decide what features you need   do you need long distance   do you need caller i d   do you need to call friends and family find out what you have available to you through associations   often schools work or a club you belong to have deals for service discounts   look at your insurance plan or aaa membership for the crazy discounts decide what kinds of service will meet your needs buy the cheapest service do not enter a contract   even if the price is slightly lower   at least not at first   if you try out your service and love it enter the contract if and only if the total price measured over length of the contract is less   with cell phones especially it is absolutely possible to save money buying month to month vs a 2 year contract   even when you buy equipment for full price up front ask for the bare minimum service from your local phone company because phone companies are often regulated monopolies they might have a bare minimum level of service they are required to offer by the municipality   they probably do n't advertise it or push it but it might exist if you call and ask   you basically get a dial tone price is dictated by a government board so you do n't have to worry about shopping for deals not the cheapest possible solution this is popular plan the youth oriented market but more and more people of all demographics are using their cellphones only   there are downsides 911 etc and shopping for the best cell phone plan can be a full time job but it does offer a way to save money by simply not having home phone service might be possible to score organizational discounts through work or groups you belong to cellphones require batteries and can go dead not good for emergencies voice over internet protocol uses your existing internet connection   you can buy a cheap regular phone and plug it into the voip box and use it like any other phone   voip can either be very inexpensive for all the features you get or just plain inexpensive   there are providers who sell a monthly service yearly service or no service plan at all you buy a device and get service as long as you own the device   taxes to the government are always due so nothing is ever free sometimes the provider is just computer software so a minimalist would like that emergency services are more reliable than cellular if you follow extra steps to set them up can be confusing to buy   some require contracts some special devices some require a bit of technical know how to setup   be sure to evaluate the total cost of ownership when comparing prices

you should really talk to a lawyer about criminal concerns there may be some does usa credit score transfer to other countries the usa does n't do anything with credit scores in the usa credit records are maintained by private companies who provide the information to your creditor there 's no legal limitation for the creditors to be within usa only that you allow access so bottom line technically it is possible for foreign creditors to get that information if you do n't have local credit score it is likely that they will will someone come after me depends on the loan managers civil suite is possible since you can not discharge student loans in bankruptcy how likely is it probably not very likely could i be only if a criminal complaint is filed and the country you 're at has an agreement with the us would i be arrested if i ever came back to visit a family member i 'm not sure on this i believe it is possible for a lender to have your passport taken by a court but i do n't think you can be actually arrested unless there 's a criminal charge but as i said i believe your passport may be taken away from you when you come to the us to prevent you fleeing without paying the debt would someone go after my family to collect the debts can they do that unless they co signed or they have control over your assets unlikely could the usa somehow garnish my pay in another country yes if a court decides so that would have to be a court in that country though in addition the us can freeze your assets abroad if you keep them in a fatca compliant institution which is almost any bank nowadays also when you die the us may and probably will demand a portion of your estate to pay the debt talk to a lawyer about additional issues and concerns

based on the statement in your question you think it should have been on the 2014 w-2 but it was included on the 2015 w-2 if you are correct then you are asking them to correct two w-2 forms the 2014 form and the 2015 form you will also have to file form for 2014 to correct last years tax forms you will have to pay additional tax with that filing and there could be penalties and interest but if you directed them on the last day of the year it is likely that the transaction actually took place the next year you will have to look at the paperwork for the account to see what is the expected delay you should also be able to see from the account history when it actually took place and when the funds were credited to your account   or you could just pay the tax this year this might be the best if there is no real difference in the result now if you added the sale to your taxes year without a corresponding tax statement from your account that is a much more complex situation the irs could eventually flag the discrepancy so you may have to adjust last year filing anyway

apart from legal requirements to have insurance e.g. 3rd party car that other answers have covered well we can think of all insurance as protecting our usable income as we can use cashflow to pay the costs of a loan to replace whatever we decided not to insure     so for example if i do n’t insure my house contents i can replace them on my credit card if needed therefore we are paying for insurance out of our income so as to protect our income knowing that the cost of the protection is on average more than the benefit we get from it but we all know that having an income of $ 50 k is less than double the value of having an income of $ 25k.    e.g. being able to eat and remain warm is more important to us then being able to go on anther holiday   this is way when someone has a higher income it requires more money to effect their actions loss aversion is another factor we are people not logistical machines

a fund is a portfolio in that it is a collection so the term is interchangeable for the most part   funds are made up of a combination of equities positions i.e. stocks bonds etc plus some amount of un invested cash most of the time when people are talking about a fund they are describing what is really an investment strategy   in other words an example would be a far east agressive fund just a made up name for illustration here which focuses on investment opportunities in the far east that have a higher level of risk than most other investments thus they provide better returns for the investors   the portfolio part of that is what the stocks are that the fund has purchased and is holding on behalf of its investors   other funds focus on municipal bonds or government bonds and the list goes on i hope this helps good luck

buy term and invest the difference is certainly the standard recommendation and for good reason when you start looking at some sample numbers the buy term and invest the difference strategy starts to look very good here are the rates i found 27 yr old in texas with good health non smoker etc $ 200k term life $ $ 200k whole life $ if you were to invest the difference in a retirement account for 40 years assuming a 7 rate of return many retirement planning estimates use 10 you would have $ at the end of that period if you use 10 that figure jumps to over $ needless to say $ 400k in a retirement account is better than a $ 200k death benefit especially since you ca n't get the death benefit and the cash value certainly one big difficulty is making sure you invest that difference the best way to handle that is to set up a direct deposit that goes straight from your paycheck to the retirement account before it even touches your bank account the next best thing would be an automatic transfer from your bank account you may wonder what if i can no longer afford to invest that money first off take a second and third look at your finances before you start eating into that but if financial crisis comes and you truly ca n't afford to fund your own life insurance retirement account then perhaps it will be a good thing you 're not locked into a life insurance policy that forces you to pay those premiums that extra freedom is another benefit of the buy term and invest the difference strategy it is great that you are asking this question now while you are young because it is much easier to put this strategy into play now while you are young   as far as using a cash value policy to help diversify your portfolio i am no expert in how to allocate long term investments after maxing out my ira and 401k my ira maxes out at $ 5k year another $ 5k for my wife 's another $ for my 401k before i maxed that out i would have my house paid for and kid 's education saved for and by then it would make sense to pay a financial adviser to help you manage all those investments they would be the one to ask about using a cash value policy similar to 's description   i believe you should never put your money into something you don't understand cash value policies are complex and i do n't fully understand them i should add that of course my calculations are subject to the standard disclaimer that those investment returns are n't guaranteed as with any financial decision you must be willing to accept some level of risk and the question is not whether to accept risk but how much is acceptable that 's why i used 7 in my calculation instead of just 10 i wanted to demonstrate that you could still beat out whole life if you wanted to reduce your risk and/or if the stock market performs poorly

i 'm adding to @dilip 's basic answer to cover the additional points in your question   i 'll assume you are referring to publicly traded stock options such as those found on the cboe and not an option contract entered into privately between two specific counterparties e.g. as in an employer stock option plan since you are not obligated to exercise a call option you purchased on the market you do n't need to maintain funds on account for possible exercising   you could instead let the option expire or resell the option neither of which requires funds available for purchase of the underlying shares however should you actually choose to exercise the call option and usually this is done close to expiration if at all you will be required to fund your account much like if you bought the underlying shares in the first place   call your broker to determine the exact rules and timing for when they need the money for a call option exercise and to expand on the idea of cancelling an option you purchased no you can not cancel an option contract per se   but you are permitted to sell the call option to somebody else willing to buy via the market   when you sell your call option you 'll either make or lose money on the sale depending on the price of the underlying shares at the time are they in- or of the money volatility in the market and remaining time value   once you sell you 're back to no position   that 's not the same as cancelled but you are out of the trade whether at profit or loss furthermore the option writer i.e. the seller who sold to open a position in writing the call in the first place is also not permitted to cancel the option he wrote   however the option writer is permitted to close out the original short position by simply buying back a matching call option on the market   again this would occur at either profit or loss based on market prices at the time   this second kind of buy order i.e. made by someone who initially wrote a call option is called a buy to close meaning the purchase of an offsetting position   the other kind of buy is the buy to open then consider since an option buyer is free to re sell the option purchased and since an option writer who sold to open the new contract is also free to buy back an offsetting option a process known as clearing is required to match remaining buyers exercising the call options held with the remaining option writers having open short positions for the contract   for cboe options this clearing is performed by the options clearing corporation   here 's how it works see here what is the occ the options clearing corporation is the sole issuer of all securities    options listed at the cboe four other u.s. stock exchanges and the    national association of securities dealers inc. nasd and is the    entity through which all cboe option transactions are ultimately    cleared as the issuer of all options occ essentially takes the    opposite side of every option traded because occ basically becomes    the buyer for every seller and the seller for every buyer it allows    options traders to buy and sell in a secondary market without having    to find the original opposite party       emphasis above is mine when a call option writer must deliver shares to a call option buyer exercising a call it 's called assignment   i have been assigned before and it is n't pleasant to see a position called away that otherwise would have been very profitable if the call were n't written in the first place also re i know my counter party can not sell his shares that 's not strictly true   you are thinking of a covered call   but an option writer does n't necessarily need to own the underlying shares   look up naked call wikipedia   naked calls are n't frequently undertaken because a naked call is one of the riskiest options strategies because it carries unlimited risk   the average individual trader is n't usually permitted by their broker to enter such an order but there are market participants who can do such a trade finally you can learn more about options at the options industry council

there are many tactics you can use   if your biggest problem is regretting your larger purchases i 'd suggest giving yourself rules before making any purchases over a certain minimum dollar amount that you set for yourself   for example if that amount is $ 50 for an item then any item starting at an average price of $ 51 would be subject to these rules one of your long term goals ought to be to become the kind of person who finds joy in saving money rather than spending it   make friends with frugal people look for those who prefer games nights and to nights out at the club buying expensive drinks and dinners at the newest steak joint in town   learn the thrill of a deal but even more learn the thrill of your savings growing   you do n't want to enjoy money in the bank for the purposes of becoming a miser   instead you want to realize that money in the bank helps you achieve your goals   buying the house you want donating a significant amount of money to a cause you support allowing you to take a dream vacation letting you buy with cash the car you always wanted the possibilities are endless   as dave ramsey says live like no one else so you can live like no one else

to be absolutely sure you should call the agent and check that said i have been renting accommodation through both agencies and directly through landlords for seven years i live in london and this is quite a common situation it normally means that the deposit is being securely held by a third party so that it can not be taken or depleted without the agreement of both parties the deposit protection scheme is one way that deposits are securely held in this manner as a third party they will have different account details it may be the case that the agency is protecting the deposit and you are paying rent to the landlord directly this means that your deposit goes to the agency 's account and the rent goes to the landlord 's account obviously your landlord and agency have different accounts a little colour to your day i am currently paying my rent to the agency who also took the deposit but because of the way they handle deposits versus rent the deposit was sent to a different account held by the same agent in my previous flat i paid the deposit to an agency and the rent directly to the landlord this resulted in an issue one time where i got the two accounts confused and paid rent to the agency who after giving me a small slap on the wrist transferred it to my landlord in the flat before that i paid rent and the deposit to my landlords holding company that is one of the few times that i paid rent and the deposit into the same account again check with the agent that one of these situations is the case but this is absolutely normal when renting through an agency

first i want to point out that your question contains an assumption does anyone make significant money trading low volume stocks   i 'm not sure this is the case i 've never heard of a hedge fund trading in the pink sheets for example second if your assumption is valid here are a few ideas how it might work accumulate slowly exit slowly   this wo n't work for short term swings but if you feel like a low volume stock will be a longer term winner you can accumulate a sizable portion in small enough chunks not to swing the price and then slowly unwind your position when the price has increased sufficiently create additional buyers sellers   your frustration may be one of the reasons low volume stock is so full of scammers pumping and dumping read any investing message board to see examples of this   if you can scare holders of the stock into selling you can buy significant portions without driving the stock price up   similarly if you can convince people to buy the stock you can unload without destroying the price   this is of course morally and legally dubious so i would not recommend this practice

lower risk of having to fight to get their money back obviously that 's what credit rating is supposed to predict paying your bills on time and paying off the balance in full every month are different questions they want to know that you will make the minimum payments at least and that you will eventually pay back the loan compare that with subprime and/or loan sharks where the assumption is that being late or defaulting is more common and interest rates are truly obscene in order to make a profit despite that

several options are available she may ask the us bank to issue a debit card visa most probably to her account and mail this card to russia i think this can be done without much problems though sending anything by mail may be unreliable after this she just withdraws the money from local atm some withdrawal fee may apply which may be rather big if the sum of money is big in big banks bank citibank russia etc are atms that allow you to withdraw dollars and it is better to use one of them to avoid unfavorable exchange rate she may ask the us bank to transfer the money to her russian account i assume the currency on the us bank account is us dollars she needs an us dollar account in any russian bank this is no problem at all   she should find out from that bank the transfer parameters for transfering us dollars to her account this should include among other info a bank correspondent and a swift code or may be two swift codes after this she should contact her us bank and find out how can she request the money to be transferred to her russian bank providing these transfer parameters i can think of two problems that may be here first the bank may refuse to transfer money without her herself coming to the bank to confirm her identity how do they know that a person writing or calling them is she indeed however i guess there should be some workaround for this second with current us sanctions against russia the bank may just refuse the transfer or will have do some additional investigations however i have heard that bank transfers from us to private persons to russia are not blocked probably it is good to find this out in advance in addition the us bank will most probably charge some standard fee for foreign transfer after this she should wait for a couple of days maybe up to week for the money to appear on russian account i have done this once some four years ago and had no problems though at that time i was in the us so i just came to the bank myself the bank employee to whom i talked obviously was unsure whether the transfer parameters were enough obviously this was a very unusual situation for her but she took the information from me and i guess just passed it on to someone more knowledgable the fee was something about $ 40 another option that i might think of is her us bank issuing and mailing her a check for the whole sum and she trying to cash it here in russia this is possible but very few banks do cash checks here citibank russia is among those that do the bank will also charge a fee and it will be comparable to transfer fee plus mailing anything is not quite reliable here she would also have to consider whether she need to pay russian taxes on this sum if the sum is big and passes through a bank i guess russian tax police may find this out through and question her if it is withdrawn from a visa card i think it will not be noticed but even in this case she might be required to file a tax herself

a checking account almost never earns any significant interest a checking accounts often does not have any limits in terms of how many times you can draw funds from it a checking account often comes with a debit card allowing you to pay online draw cash from an atm machine etc a savings accounts has much higher yields so you should be getting a decent interest unfortunately in the current climate this is not always true especially not with the big banks so you may want to look into a high yield savings account a savings account is often limited in terms of number of transactions meaning you ca n't constantly draw funds from it it must be stable a savings account often does not come with a debit card no a savings account should not be used for regular transactions it 's an account to park your money for a medium long time understand that banks loan out the money in your savings account to third parties so if it would constantly fluctuate they ca n't have this money available to others in return of you parking your money with your bank you should get a nice return interest yes but it 's not common assuming you are from usa passing banking data account number and routing number to third parties is not safe in europe it 's totally safe to share your account number to accept money depends some banks do charge fees some do n't often there are fees when you 're not using the account no transactions or when you do n't have a certain minimum in an account assuming you are american please specify this information clearly in future i would look into an internet bank like ally they do n't have many fees and they have an excellent high yield savings account they also give you a debit card disadvantage is that they do n't have physical branches

the article said $ 65,000 rounds numbers imply an estimate was the original amount she borrowed however she is n't on the hook for only $ 65,000 her loans have interest and one of the loans had an 8 interest rate    let 's assume for the purposes of this exercise to illustrate what compound interest can do to good debt that all of her loans are at 8 interest over a 30 year repayment period her total payments over the course of the 30 years will amount to $ yes that 's a big number $ going to interest and $ 65,000 going towards the original loan balance    more realistically her loans are probably in the 6 8 interest range since interest rates were higher 20 years ago so the amount is a little smaller but the bulk of her payments will be for paying interest not paying down her loan balance she really could n't afford to borrow for a master 's degree to make so little in a high cost of living area

the are a couple of explanations that i can think of though for determining exactly what is different you will want to print out both returns and compare them line by line to see how they differ if the company up your income to account for the taxes on housing possibly by paying the additional withholding you may be just benefiting from them estimating your tax rate this can especially be the case if your only work was the three month internship they would have to assume your salary was for the entire year there is an earned income tax credit for low wage earners that you may have qualified for it would depend your specific circumstances if you meet the criteria but that credit for a range of income actually pays out more the more you earn to encourage working that extra hour instead of reducing benefit because you had another hour of employment as for the housing subsidy itself while the value is quite high the irs considers that to be a taxable benefit that the employer provided you and so it needs to be added to your w-2 wages $ 8k a month seems quite high but i do n't know the quality of the apartment you were provided and what the going rates are in the area given that you said you worked for a major tech company i can imagine that you might have been working in an area with high rents if the employer did gross up your paycheck so as to cover your taxes that $ 24k would also include that extra tax payment e.g. if the employer paid $ 8k in additional taxes for you then the housing cost that they directly paid were $ 16k

gt say you repeal a tax without reducing public spending then if you analyze the economic impact that does not fairly represent the impact of the tax now does it   you are right but my issue is that you are accounting for changes that are not happening   if you are comparing a country 's tax structure before and after a wealth tax then i would agree however in this case all the subjects are separate economies and have presumably found some sort of equilibrium   the wealth tax policy is not changing for them so there is no surplus or deficit of public spending to adjust for

going off hearsay here i believe your question is does not having a credit card lower your credit score if that is the question then in the uk at least the answer appears to be yes having a credit card makes you less of a risk because you have proven that you can handle a little bit of debt and pay it back i have a really tiny credit history never had a credit card and the only people who will lend to me are my own bank because they can actually see my income expenditure when i have my bank and at stores offering credit they have said that no credit history is n't far off a bad credit record simply having a credit card and doing the odd transactions show 's lenders you are at least semi responsible and is seen as a positive not having a credit card and not having much else for that matter makes you an unknown and an unknown is a risk in the eyes of lenders

can i give the bank the $ 300,000 to clear the mortgage or must i pay off the total interest that was agreed upon for the 30 year term this depends on the loan agreement   i had one loan where i was on the hook regardless   early payment was just that early payment   it would have allowed me to skip months without making payments because i had already made them    most loans charge interest on the remaining balance if you pay early it reduces your balance decreasing the interest   if you pay it off early there 's no more balance and no more interest    i 'm curious why the bank would let you do this since they will lose out on a lot of profit but they have their money back and can loan it out again   if they maintained the loan they are n't guaranteed of getting their money    interest is rent that you pay for the loan of the money   once you return the money why pay more rent   while some apartment leases require paying through the entire term most allow for early termination with proper notice   you give back the apartment the landlord rents it out again   why should they get paid two rents    another issue is that if someone with a mortgage switches jobs to a new location that person will likely prefer to sell the current house and buy one in the new location   this is actually the typical way for a mortgage to end   if the bank did not allow that they would essentially force the family to rent out the mortgaged house and rent a new house   so the bank would go from an owner occupied house that the inhabitants want to keep maintained to a rental where the inhabitants only care to the extent of their legal liability    consider the possibility that the homeowners lose one of their jobs   they ca n't afford the house   so they sell it and close out the mortgage   should the bank refuse to allow the sale and attempt to recover the interest from the impoverished homeowners   that situation would almost guarantee an expensive foreclosure    once there is any early termination clause for any reason it makes sense for the bank to structure the loan to include the possibility   that way they do n't have to investigate whatever excuse is involved   loan regulators may require this as well particularly on mortgages

as others have said it depends entirely on what benefits are provided and how much of the cost of those benefits is paid by the employer and how much is paid by the employee and compare that to what it would cost to obtain the necessary equivalent coverage without employer assistance in my case my employer pays more than $ 10,000 per year toward the cost of medical dental vision disability and life insurance for myself and my family that 's almost 20 of the average total household income in my state so it is not an insignificant amount at all

the dow jones industrial average djia is a price weighted index   that means that the index is calculated by adding up the prices of the constituent stocks and dividing by a constant the dow divisor   the value of the dow divisor is adjusted from time to time to maintain continuity when there are splits or changes in the   this has the curious effect of giving a member of the index influence proportional to its share price   that is if a stock costing $ 100 per share goes up by 1 that will change the index by 10 times as much as if a stock costing $ 10 per share goes up by the same 1 now look at the price of google   it 's currently trading at just a under $ 700 per share   most of the other stocks in the index trade somewhere between $ 30 and $ 150 so if google were included in the index it would contribute between 5 and 20 times the weight of any other stock in the index   that means that relatively small in google 's price would completely dominate the index on any given day   until june of 2014 apple was in the same boat with its stock trading at about $ 700 per share   at that time apple split its stock and after that its stock price was a little under $ 100 per share   so post split apple might be a candidate to be included in the dow the next time they change up the components of the index   since the dow is fixed at 30 stocks and since they try to keep a balance between different sectors this probably would n't happen until they drop another technology company from the lineup for some reason   correction apple is in the djia and has been for a little over a year now   mea the dow 's price weighting is unusual as stock indices go   most indices are weighted by market capitalization   that means the influence of a single company is proportional to its total value   this causes large companies like apple to have a lot of influence on those indices but since market capitalization is n't as arbitrary as stock price most people see that as ok   also notice that i said company and not stock   when a company has multiple classes of share as google does market cap weighted indices include all of the share classes while the dow has no provision for such situations which is another albeit less important reason why google is n't in the dow   keep this in mind the next time someone offers you a bar bet on how many stocks are in the s&p 500   the answer is currently 505 finally you might be wondering why the dow uses such an odd weighting in its calculations   the answer is that the dow averages go back to 1896 when charles dow used to calculate the averages by hand   if your only tools are a pencil and paper then a price weighted index with only 30 stocks in it is a lot easier to calculate than a market cap weighted index with hundreds of constituents about the dow jones averages dow constituents and prices apple 's stock price chart the split in 2014 is marked   note that prices before the split are retroactively adjusted to show a continuous curve

at the very least you should invest as much as you can that your employer will match as they are basically giving you free money for saving after that i would prioritize a roth ira as that offers similar tax benefits with more liquidity provided you have enough money available in your emergency fund and have plenty for everyday expenses i see no reason not to max out your 401k after that if you can afford it however if your emergency fund is lacking be sure to put some there other investments like a 529 may come into play if you have kids you plan on sending to college but it all depends on your situation

there are restrictions on transferring money out of egypt although less tight than previously but there are n't any such restrictions on sending money into egypt   if you go to hsbc 's retail uk banking pages and locate the page for international money transfers you can see that you can transfer up to £ 50,000 per day into egypt via online banking £ 10,000 via telephone banking or unlimited by visiting the branch i 'm not sure exactly what question you asked them or exactly what they said to you in response but it sounds like there was some misunderstanding along the way

be careful of the other answers here many are wrong or partially wrong the question implies that you knew this but for everyone else 's benefit you can keep you llc organization and still elect to be treated as a s corp by the irs just for tax purposes   you do this by filing form with the irs you can also by the way elect to be taxed as a regular c corp if you want although that 's probably not advantageous   see form the advantage of electing to be treated as an s corp is that income beyond what constitutes a reasonable salary are not subject to social security and medicare taxes as they would when paid was wages or counted as self employment income on schedule c.   depending on what you need to pay yourself to meet the reasonable salary test your overall income and other factors about your business this could result in tax savings contrary to other answers here making this election will not force you to create a board of directors   you are still an llc for all purposes except taxes so whatever requirements you had in organization and governance at the state level will not change   you will have to file a corporate tax return on form 1120s and likely some corresponding state tax form so that is additional paperwork but this corporate return does not mean the s corp pays taxes itself with a couple of exceptions the s corp pays no taxes directly and therefore does not pay at the corporate tax rate instead the s corp its income expenses and deductions to the owner(s on schedule k.   the owners get their portion reported from the s corp on schedule k1 and then include that on their personal form 1040 to pay tax at their personal rate in addition to filing form 1120s you will have to handle payroll taxes which will create some additional administrative work and/or cost using a payroll service for this will likely be your best option and not terribly expensive you 've also got the issue of determining your reasonable salary within the rules which is the subject of other questions on this site and other irs guidance

here 's how the police currently operate   you are forced to fund them with your tax money but if they fail to protect you or your property you get nothing in return if you pay a home owner 's insurance company and you get robbed or your house burns down they fully reimburse you what exactly are we getting for our police dollars they come after the crime and then put the criminal in jail at our we lose both ways it 's pretty clear that insurance is preferable to police and that insurance companies should expand their operations to include active security personnel to patrol their insured properties and people while the government 's police force should be and give us that portion of our taxes back   i just want to get more people realizing what a con job government 's monopoly services are in terms of what we get for our money every where the government services interface with us they involve forcing us to stop in some capacity their transportation vehicles stop in the middle of the roads school buses and city buses and their solution to are pathetic in comparison to which do n't leave half the cars stopped at any given time they spend $ 4 6 trillion in wars against desert morons because the other branch of govt which was supposed to round up immigrants who their visas failed we pay for their failure we 've been forced to pay over $ 16 trillion over 50 years for welfare checks to people who are more likely stupid than intrinsically needy i.e. poor due to circumstances rather than basic stupidity $ 16,000 billion we could have had to fund on the things we want more of such as space research roads better technology

i came across this € 1000 coin which can actually be bought for € 1000 it contains 17 grams of gold worth about € 600 today is there any downside to this over keeping € 1000 in regular banknotes these are medallions collectibles non circulating or whatever name one wants to call it a coin has a value because the central banks says so that enforces everyone accept it at that this as such is not a coin banks or anyone else will not accept this for face value   these are of interest and certain people do collect such items they are collectibles to the extent the price is dependent on general interest in future on such items and quantity available so if future the price may go up much higher than the gold price or may retain its gold price mints make these with intricate design best finish limited quantity to charge the additional premium if you are not into stay away a better options is buy simple gold bullion of similar weight for actual gold price

here in denver which is clearly in the midst of an economic boom the city 's shopping center cherry creek mall is struggling despite the presence of high end shops like marcus and restoration hardware among many others the adjacent business district cherry creek north is in new high rises office buildings and stand alone retail stores but the city council is in the pocket of developers so they 've approved all this growth while eliminating the need to provide adequate parking since so many non shoppers were leaving their cars in mall garages all day long mall officials instituted paid parking now you can park for free if you 're staying for less than an hour but beginning with the minute you 're being charged this has had a detrimental effect on many of the smaller stores in the mall most of which relied on visitors for a large share of their business with the limited free parking people are running their planned errands and then getting the hell out of there before the hour is up it seems like a pretty stupid way to run a business especially since several suburban malls have the same stores and unlimited parking

whenever you do paid work for a company you will need to fill out some sort of paperwork so that the company knows how to pay you and also how to report how much they paid you to the appropriate government agencies you should not think of this as a hurdle and you should n't worry that you have n't been employed for a long time the two most common ways a company pays an individual are via employee wages or independent contractor payments when you start a relationship with a company if you are going to become an employee then you will out a w4 form and at the end of the year you will receive a w2 form if you are an independent contractor which you would be considered in this case you will fill out form w9 and at the end of the year you will receive a 1099 this is completely normal and you have nothing to worry about all it means is that if you make more than a certain amount typically $ 600 in a year you will receive a 1099 in the mail or electronically the 1099 form basically means that they are reporting that amount to the irs and it also helps you file your tax return by showing you all the numbers you need on one form please remember that when you are paid as an independent contractor no taxes are withheld on your behalf so you may owe some tax on the money you make it 's best to set aside some of your income so you are prepared to pay it come tax time next year

it is important to remember that the stock price in principle reflects the value of the company so the market cap should drop upon issuance of the the dividend however the above reasoning neglects to consider taxes which make the question a bit more interesting the key fact is that different investors are going to get taxed on the dividend to varying degrees ranging from 20 for qualified dividends in the usa for a high income individual in a taxable account and even worse for non qualified dividends to 0 for tax exempt nonprofits retirement accounts and low income individuals the high tax investors are going to be a bit averse to paying tax on that dividend whereas the tax free investors are not hence in a tax rational market the tax free investors are going to be the ones buying right before a dividend and the tax paying investors will be buying right afterwards tax exempt investors could in principle make some amount of money buying dividends to keep them off the tax paying investors books   of course the strategy could backfire if too many people did it all at once that said the tax payers have the tax disincentive to prevent them from fully exploiting the opposite strategy of selling just before a dividend   in particular they are subject to capital gains tax when they sell at a profit unless they have enough compensating capital losses and it is to their after tax profit to defer taxation by not trading that said the stock market has well known irrationality when it comes to considering tax consequences so logic based on assumed rationality of the market does not always apply to the extent one would expect    the foremost example of tax irrationality is the so called dividend paradox which basically states that corporations should favor stock buybacks or perhaps loan repayment to the complete exclusion of dividends because capital gains are taxed less harshly than dividends in a variety of ways some of which are subtle 1 historically although not currently in the usa for qualified dividends the tax rate was higher for dividends   in canada for example dividends are taxed at twice the rate of capital gains 2 if you die holding appreciated stock then you meaning your heirs completely escape us the capital gains tax on the accrual during your lifetime 3 capital gains tax can be deferred by simply not selling   in comparison to dividends this is roughly equivalent to getting a tax free loan from the government which is invested for profit and paid at a later date after inflation has eaten away at the real value of the loan   for example if all your stock investments increase by but you sell every year in a high tax bracket situation you 're total after tax return will be only 8 per year   in contrast if you hold the same investments for many many years and then sell your total return will be nearly 10 per year because you only pay 20 once at the end 4 a capital gain can often be by a capital loss in another stock so that no tax results   if you loose money on a stock that is paying dividends you 're still going to have to pay tax on that dividend   there are companies that borrow money to pay out that taxable dividend each quarter which seems like gross tax malpractice on the part of the cfo if the dividend paradox does n't make sense first consider the case that you owned all the shares of a company   it would n't matter to you at all on a pre tax basis whether you got a $ 1000 company buyback or a $ 1000 dividend because after the buyback dividend you 'd still own the entire company and $ 1000   the number of shares would be reduced but that you owned fewer shares after the buyback would be like saying you have become shorter if your height is measured in inches rather than of course in the case of many shareholders you can get burned by failing to sell into the buyback when the share price is too high but that is another matter

buying a house can definitely make your net worth go down because there are expenses involved interest expense closing costs taxes maintenance etc so unless the house appreciates in value enough to offset these things you will see a drop in your net worth from buying a house more specifically it can have a negative impact on your net worth since changes in your net worth are the cumulative result of all your inflows and outflows of money

it seems that you 're interested in an asset which you can hold that would go up when the gold price went down it seems like a good place to start would be an index fund which invests in the general stock market when the gold market falls this would mainly affect gold mining companies these do not make up a sizable portion of any index fund which is invested broadly in the market unfortunately in order to act on this you would also have to believe that the stock market was a good investment    to test this theory i looked at an etf index fund which tracks the s&p 500 and compared it to an etf which invests in gold   i found that the daily price movements of the stock market were positively correlated with the price of gold this result was statistically significant   the weekly price movements of the stock market were also correlated with the price of gold this result was also statistically significant   when the holding period was stretched to one month there was still a positive relationship between the stock market 's price moves and the price of gold this result was not statistically significant   when the holding period was stretched to one year there was a negative relationship between the price changes in the stock market and the price of gold   this result was not statistically significant either

i believe the answer to your question boils down to a discussion of tax strategies and personal situation both now and in the future   as a result it 's pretty hard to give a concrete example to the question as asked right now for example if your tax rate now is likely to be higher than your tax rate at retirement it is for most people than putting the higher growth etf in a retirement fund makes some sense   but even then there are other considerations however if the opposite is true which could happen if your income is growing so fast that your retirement income looks like it will be higher than your current income than you might want the flexibility of holding all your etfs in your non tax advantaged brokerage account so that if you do incur capital gains they are paid at prevailing presumably lower tax rates    i assume you meant a brokerage account rather than a savings account since you usually ca n't hold etfs in a savings account i also want to mention that a holding in a corp account is n't necessarily taxed twice   it depends on the corporation type and the type of distribution   for example s corps pay no federal income tax themselves instead the owners pay taxes when money is distributed to them as personal income   which means you could trickle out the earnings from an holdings there such that it keeps you under any given federal tax bracket assuming it 's your only personal income    this might come in handy when retired for example    also distribution of the holdings as dividends would incur cap gains tax rates rather than personal income tax rates one thing i would definitely say any holdings in a roth account ira 401k will have no future taxes on earnings or distributions unless the gov't changes its mind   thus putting your highest total return etf there would always be the right move

for a lot of small beef farmers hobby farms like ours the price of fertilizer is already high enough that it 's proving effective in maintaining or possibly reducing costs   the most successful examples i 've seen have equal or higher carrying capacity cattle per acre for less monetary cost by moving to older methods of grazing   the tradeoff is that rotation takes more time to do than open field amp hay grazing   there 's also lower capital equipment costs tractor mower and are the major equipment for a small producer so being able to do without or use smaller ones is good   and less maintenance on that equipment   we 're not experts by any means and our farm is n't anywhere near its maximum carry capacity but every large full time farmer i know that has done it has had good results

by rounding my house payments up to the nearest $ 50.00 my 30 year mortgage was paid off in 7 years   initially my mortgage payment was roughly $ 600 $ 50 going to principal and $ 550 going to interest banker 's profits by paying $ 650 i was actually doubling the amount i was paying on principal   since interest is computed as a function percentage of the outstanding principal balance the amount of my fixed payment that went to interest decreased each month and the amount that went to principal increased in 7 years i owned my home free and clear and started putting the money i had been putting into the mortgage payments into investments a rule of thumb i have discovered is that it takes half the time to save money to meet a goal that it takes to pay off the same debt

setting aside for the moment the very relevant issue of whether you need the full amount quickly i 'll just tackle comparing which option gives you to maximum amount of money in terms of real dollars the trick is unless you think inflation will suddenly reverse itself or stop entirely not likely $ 50 k today is worth a lot more than $ 50 k in 20 years if you do n't believe me consider that just 30 years ago the average price for a mid level new car was around $ 3k when you grandfather says he got a burger for a nickel he is n't talking about 2010 dollars   so how do you account for this well the way financial people and project managers do it to estimate how much to pay today for $ 1 at some point in the future is through a net present value npv calculation you can find a calculator here in your question you gave some numbers for the payout but not the lump sum prize amount going solely on what you have provided i calculate that you should take the lump sum if it is greater than $ which is the net present value of 20 years of $ 50 k payments assuming 3 annual inflation which is fairly a fairly reasonable number given history however if you think the out of control gov't spending is going to send inflation through the roof possible but not a given then you almost certainly would want the lump sum i suppose in that scenario you might want the lump sum anyway because if the govt starts on their obligations doing it to a small number of lottery winners might be politically more popular than cutting other programs that affect a large number of voters

preparations for inflation that is not going to happen anytime soon is preventing much needed currency from being injected into the system   the deflationary pressures are so strong that less and less currency is being circulated as people fear for the future   they save more and spend less because their neighbor 's out of work and they might be next if they are lucky enough to still have a job   that 's not to mention that huge mortgage that they bought into and are now massively underwater with   with that they are constantly removing chunks of currency from circulation   when everyone is taking chunks out the demand for currency rises and demand for goods and services dies creating an ever hole   so yes i think the government should be making major purchases damn the deficit   fiber to everyone 's home absolutely massive funding of clean energy research and projects combat infrastructure decay etc etc   labor and resources are cheap right now and leaving all these people with stagnating skill sets by the with no options creates an exponential decrease in productivity   we have the methods to control inflation when and if it it head high taxation and high interest rates   let 's burn that bridge when we get there   the u.s. budget does not work like a household as as this analogy is   there is no paying back the deficit and there will never be a problem paying the interest on a a currency we can make more of at any point   the real limitation here is inflation and we have none
