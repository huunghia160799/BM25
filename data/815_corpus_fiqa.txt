anyone who claims they can consistently beat the market and asks you to pay them to tell you how is a liar this can not be done as the market adjusts itself there 's nothing they could possibly learn that analysts and institutional investors do n't already know they earn their money through the subscription fees not through capital gains on their beat the market suggestions that means that they do n't have to rely on themselves to earn money they only need you to rely on them they have to provide proof because they can not lie in advertisements but if you read carefully there are many small letters and disclaimers that basically remove any liability from them by saying that they do n't take responsibility for anything and do n't guarantee anything

yep i thought this was how it was done in almost engineering disciplines extremely detailed spec sheets but not blueprints it 's obvious why making blueprints for a manufacturing facility you do n't know anything about is difficult and i 'm sure it results in a nightmare of trading plans and revisions back and forth between the engineers at home and at the contractor as well as duplication of engineering talent and cost saving was the reason boeing was in the first place   nasa did n't provide blueprints when doing the original apollo mission arguably the best example of gigantic subcontractor jobs they provided extremely detailed specs and watched progress like a hawk   the main problem sounds like the subcontractors were subpar and not properly managed

first and foremost you should do more research on credit cards and what everything means   as expressed by others the balance transfer fee is not what you think it is   credit cards can be great they can also quickly erode your credit score and your standing   so understanding the basics is very important    the credit card that is right for you should have the following criteria   the first two points should be straight forward you should not have to pay a cc company for the privilege to use their card   they should pay you through perks and rewards   it should also be a cc that can be used for what you need it for   if you travel internationally a lot and the cc you choose only works within the us then what good is it the third point is where you need to ask yourself what you do a lot and if a cc can offer rewards through travel miles or cash back or other bonuses based on your lifestyle   the transfer fee is not what you think it is people who already are carrying debt on another credit card and would like to transfer that debt to another credit card would be interested in finding a fee or a low   people do this to get a batter rate or to get away from a bad credit card   if one charges 28 and another charges 13 well it makes sense to transfer existing debt over to the 13 provided they do n't crush you on fees   since you have no credit card debt assumption based on the fact you want to build your credit you should ask yourself for what purpose and how often do you plan to use the credit card   would this card be just for emergencies and wo nt be used on daily purchases then a credit card that offers 3 cash back on gasoline purchases is not for you   if you however love to travel and plan to use your credit card for a lot of purchases or have a few large purchases insurance tuition etc then get a credit card that provides rewards like miles   it really comes down to you and your situation there are numerous websites dedicated to the best credit card for any situation    the final thing i will say is what i mentioned at the beginning its important cc 's can be a tool to establish and improve your credit worthiness they can also be a tool to destroy your credit worthiness so be careful and make smart choices on what you use your card for   a credit score is like a mountain it requires a slow and steady discipline to reach the top but one and that credit score can tumble quickly

first off the mortgage interest is tax deductible argument is a red herring   what tax deductible sounds like it means is if i pay $ 100 on x i can pay $ 100 less on my taxes   if that were true you 're still not saving any money overall so it does n't help you any in the immediate term and it 's actually a bad idea long term because that mortgage interest compounds but you do n't pay compound interest on taxes but that 's not what it actually means   what it actually means is that you can deduct some percentage of that $ 100 usually not all of it from your gross income not from the final amount of tax you pay which reduces your top line income subject to taxation   unless you 're just barely over the line of a tax bracket spending money on something tax deductible is rarely a net gain having gotten that out of the way pay down the mortgage first   it 's a very simple matter of numbers anything you pay on a long term debt is money you would have paid anyway but it eliminates interest on that payment and all thereof from the equation for the entire duration of the loan   so ignoring for the moment the possibility of extreme situations like default and bank failure you can consider it to be essentially a guaranteed risk free investment that will pay you dividends equal to the rate of interest on the loan for the entire duration of the loan the mortgage is 3.9 presumably for 30 years   the car loan is 1.9 for a lot less than that   not sure how long let 's just pull a number out of a hat and say 5 years if you were given the option to invest at a guaranteed 3.9 for 30 years or a guaranteed 1.9 for 5 years which would you choose   it 's a no brainer when you look at it that way

currently there is simply no reason to do so it 's not a problem it is no more of a problem or effort to denote 5,000 than it is to denote 50.00 but if there were a reason to do so it would n't be all that difficult of course there would be some minor complications because some people mostly old people presumably would take time getting used to it but nothing that would stop a nation from doing so in iceland this has happened on several occasions in the past and while iceland is indeed a very small economy it should n't be that difficult at all for a larger one a country would need a grace period while the old currency is still valid new editions of already circulating cash would need to be produced and a coordinated time would need to be set at which point financial institutions change their balances of course it would take some planning and coordination but nothing close to for example two or more currencies into one like the did with the euro the biggest side effect there was an inflation shot when the currencies got changed in each country but this can be done even with giant economies like germany and france cutting off two zeros would be a in comparison but in case of currencies like the japanese yen there is simply no reason to take off 2 zeros yet northern americans may find it strange that the numbers are so high but that 's merely a matter of what you 're used to there is no added complication in paying vs. 50 at a restaurant it merely takes more space on a computer screen and bill and that 's not a real problem besides most of the time even in n america the cents are listed as well and that does n't seem to be enough of a problem for people to concern themselves with it 's only when you get into hyper inflation when the shear space required for prices becomes a problem that economies have a real reason to cut off zeros

this is your best answer so far a detail left out is that derivatives are mostly known for the amount of leverage allowed which is typically about 20 1 or 5 down this is legal because it 's generally assumed that someone is not going to buy or sell the underlying asset that they will offset their long or short position long before the contract 's delivery date your derivative futures instead of forwards because they 're a standardized size traded on an exchange and more liquid will call you when you lose about half of your 5 to tell you to either transfer some money to cover your position or to ask you to exit your position at a loss   are traded through clearinghouses not exchanges and they can be for any underlying asset for any delivery date for any price so long as parties agree on it just think of it as a contract

there are some circumstances in which it is a good idea chris w rea has already mentioned the case where you expect your marginal tax rate to decrease but there is also the case where lack of contributions might cause your marginal rate to increase assume your income is $ 20,000 over the 46 threshold and you normally contribute $ 20,000 to rrsp however this year you have only been able to contribute $ 10,000 if you wait until next year and contribute an extra $ 10,000 making $ 30,000 the extra $ 10,000 will only bring 35 tax back if you can borrow the money and make the contribution this year it will get 46 tax back that makes the loan worth taking making the contribution now can also get you a larger rebate this year you will have that money for twelve extra months and you can invest it that probably is n't enough to make it worthwhile alone but it certainly makes the damage less however i would always recommend taking out an rrsp loan for as short a time as possible my recommendation would always be to make the contribution as late in the period as possible apply for your tax refund as soon as you can and then pay off the loan with the refund you be able to get away with having the loan only for a couple of months

since you 're 20 30 years out of retirement you should be 90 to 100 in stocks and in one or two broad stock market funds likely i 'm not sure about the minimums at td ameritrade but at vanguard even $ 3k will get you into the basic funds one option is the targeted retirement year funds which automatically rebalance as you get closer to retirement   they 're a bit higher expense usually than a basic stock market fund but they 're often not too bad   look for expenses under 0.5 annually and preferably much lower i pay 0.05 on mine for example    otherwise i 'd just put everything into something simple an s&p500 tracker for example spy or voo are two examples that has very low management fees   then when your 401(k gets up and running that may have fewer options and thus you may end up in something more conservative do n't feel like you have to balance each account separately when they 're just starting think of them as one whole balancing act for the first year or two   once they 're each over $ 10k or so then you can balance them individually which you do want to do to allow you to get better returns

update here is a message the seller just sent me does this make sense   i spoke with my bank again and they explained it a little better for me i guess how it works is they will print out something for you that is called an affidavit in lieu of title that states they are no longer the holder and to release it to you you then take that to the dol and they get it put in your name he says that 's how they do it all the time when we get to the bank the teller just verifies the check and i deposit it and they release the funds to pay off the account and that 's when you would get the paperwork you would be there for the whole process so nothing is sketchy sorry it 's such a pain i did n't understand how that worked we 've never sold a car with a loan on it before

not sure why the downvote seems like a fair question to me who owns a house and in what proportions can be totally separate from who is named on the mortgage   there are two ways to do this one way would be for you loan them the money   first under a separate contract which you should have a solicitor draw up then they buy the house themselves the contract would state the terms for repayment of the loan which could be e.g. no repayment due until the sale of the house at which point the original amount is returned plus interest equivalent to the growth in value of the house between purchase and sale or whatever you 'd need to be clear about what happened if the house lost value or they ended up in a negative equity situation the other option is where you are directly a party to the purchase of the house and are named as part owners on the deeds again the solicitor who is handling the house purchase for them would help with the paperwork in either case you would need to clear this arrangement with the mortgage company to make sure they were ok with it   to answer your specific questions in order yes they would still be eligible for the help to buy isas assuming that is what you are referring to even though you would not be i 'm not sure what penalty you are referring to you 'd have to pay tax on any income or capital gain you made from the deal no one can say whether this is a good deal for you without knowing a great deal more about your individual circumstances and even then any such advice you would get on here is worth as much as you pay for it if in doubt consult an ifa

whether your card will work i believe depends on the institution that issued it you 'll just have to try what i can tell you is that the process of using a debit card or credit card in the us is fairly straight forward if your card has a chip you 'll insert your card chip end first into the bottom slot of the reader assuming the reader has one this technology is still being distributed accepted so you may encounter some areas where they do n't have this or they have an insert or sign that says something along the lines of no chip reader swipe instead if your card does n't have a chip which looks like the bottom end of a cellular phone 's sim card you just swipe your card in the reader there will may be on screen prompts which will explain any additional input necessary from you depending on how they process your card as a debit card or credit card they can process a debit card as if it 's a standard credit card you may or may not be asked to enter your debit card 's pin if they process it as debit you 'll have to enter your pin if they process it as if it were a credit card it will still go through but you 'll be asked to sign the receipt   important for you to note you need to find out whether your card issuer will charge you foreign transaction fees when you use your indian debit card in the us   is the card carrying a different currency than the us

shareholder 's equity consists of two main things the initial capitalization of the company when the shares were first sold plus extra share issues and retained earnings which is the amount of money the company has made over and above capitalization which has not been re distributed back to shareholders so yes it is the firm 's total equity the initial capitalization is the equity that was put into the company when it was founded plus subsequent increases in equity due to share issues and retained earnings is the increase in equity that has occurred since then which has not yet been re distributed to shareholders though it belongs to them as the residual claimants both accounts are credited when they increase because they represent an increase in cash that is debited so in order to make credits = debits they must be credits it does n't mean that the company has that much cash on hand as the cash will likely be re invested shareholder 's equity is neither an asset nor a liability it is used to purchase assets and to reduce liabilities and is simply a measure of assets minus liabilities that is necessary to make the accounting equation balance since the book value of stocks does n't change that often because it represents the price the company sold it for not the current value on the stock market and would therefore only change when there were new share issues almost all changes in total assets or in total liabilities are reflected in retained earnings

if for every buyer there 's a seller does n't that also mean that there were $ in outflows in the same time period yes for every buyer there is a seller the inflows are not being talked in that respect about there being $ in inflows to us equity markets since the election what does that mean lets say the index was at x. after a month the index is at   so lets say there are only 10 companies listed so if the index has moved x to then share price s1 has moved to so if you sum all such shares trades that have increased in value you will get what in inflow in the same period there could be some shares that have lost value i.e. the price or another share was s2 and has moved to the sum of all such shares trades that have decreased in value you will get outflow the terms are gross outflow gross inflow in net terms for a period it can only be inflow or outflow depending on the difference between inflow and outflow the stats are done day to day and aggregated for the time period required   so generally if the index has increased it means there is more inflow and less outflow at times this analysis is also done on segments fi 's inflow is more compared to outflow or compared to inflow of or institutional investors or foreign participants etc

your question is actually quite broad so will try to split it into it 's key parts yes standard bank isas pay very poor rates of interest at the moment they are however basically risk free and should track inflation   any investment in the 6 7 return range at the moment will be linked to stock stock always carries large risks ~50 swings in capital are pretty standard in the short run in the long run it generally beats every other asset class by miles if you ca n’t handle those types of short terms swings you should n’t get involved if you do want to invest in stock there is a hefty ignorance tax waiting at every corner in terms of how brokers construct their fees in a nutshell there is a different best value broker in the uk for virtually every band of capital and they make their money through people signing up when they are in range x and not moving their money when they reach band y or just having a large marketing budget and screwing you from the start at ~1 a year is def in this category there is n't much of an obvious way around this if you are adamant you do n't want to learn about it the way the market is constructed is just a total predatory for the complete novice there are middle ground style investments between the two extremes you are looking at bonds bond funds and mixes of bonds and small amounts of stock such as the vanguard income or conservative growth funds outlined here can return more than savings accounts with less risk than stocks but again its a very diverse field that 's hard to give specific advice about without knowing more about what your risk tolerance timelines and aims are if you do go down this or the pure stock fund route it will need to be purchased via a broker in an isa wrapper the broker charges a platform fee the fund charges a fund fee in both cases you want these as low as possible the telegraph has a good heat map for the best value isa platform providers by capital range here fund fees are always in the key investor document under ongoing charges

question is what do we need to do as far as the irs is concerned i    mean we 'll get the money from them and pay it back less than two    months later you 're probably worried about the gift tax since you 're a couple the maximum exclusion amount is calculated like this the reason the pg multiplier stands separate is that gift splitting does require form 709 filed even if no tax is due unless they actually write separate checks for their respective portions so the math shows that you and your wife can get at least $ 28 k from anyone without the need of gift tax to be paid or gift tax return to be filed you can get up to $ 56 k from your parents but the gift splitting may need to be documented on form 709 since you 're in fact talking about a loan you 're going to repay you 'll need to document it with a note and everything and document the repayment if interest is being paid your parents must declare it on their tax return for the year obviously in this case if the loan is properly documented repaid and the interest is declared the irs wo n't even bother claiming it was a gift even if there 's no real interest it should n't be an issue the irs might assign some deemed interest at their rates that would be considered a gift but assuming no other gift transactions between you exist for the year the amount would be miniscule and way below the $ 14 k exclusion level of course as with any tax concern you get here what you paid for for a proper advice talk to a tax adviser ea cpa licensed in your state

i 'm not following what 's the meaning of open a mutual fund you do n't open a mutual fund you invest in it there 's a minimum required investment $ 2000 could be some funds have lower limits you do n't have to go with the fidelity one necessarily but in general it has nothing to do with your roth ira account you can invest in mutual funds with any trading account not just roth ira or any other specific kind if you invest in etf 's   you can invest in funds just as well subject to the minimums set as to the plan itself buying and selling etf 's will cost you commission ~2 3 of your investment over several months you may get positive returns and may get negative returns but keep in mind that you start with the 2 3 loss on day 1 within a short period of time especially in the current economic climate which is very unstable just out of recession election year etc etc i would think that keeping the cash in a savings account would be a better choice while with etf you do n't have any guarantees other than -3 then with savings accounts you can at least have a guaranteed return of ~1 apy i.e. wo n't earn much over the course of your internship but you 'll keep your money safe for your long term investment for the long term the fluctuations of month to month do n't matter much so investing now for the next 50 years you should n't care about the stock market going 10 in april so keep your 1000 in savings account and if you want to invest 5000 in your roth ira invest it then assuming of course that you 're completely positive about not needing this money in the next several decades

well that will depend on the time frame you are looking at it you ca n't compare the rsi on a five minute chart to the rsi on a daily chart the minute chart would represent the momentum of very small trends whilst the daily chart would represent the momentum of much larger trends on the daily chart the shares might be experiencing a strong uptrend with a rising rsi during each day the price might move up at the open then come down some then back up a bit more and repeat this several times during the day before closing higher during the day the rsi might have moved slightly higher   but during a single day on the 5 minute chart the price may have gone through several up and down trends with the rsi going into oversold and overbought several times what you should be looking at to strengthen the signal from the rsi is to watch for when the rsi is in the overbought at the same time the price is reaching a peak or when the rsi is in the oversold at the same time the price is reaching a these could represent potential turning points in price the time frame to use would depend on the type of trading you are attempting to undertake if you prefer day trading being in and out of a trade in minutes to hours you might look at time frames of minutes to hours if you prefer longer term position trend or swing trading you would probably stick to daily charts if you prefer longer term active investing you might stick to a combination of daily weekly and monthly charts

boa used to do this too probably still do i opened an account at boa and got low one month and then a friend of mine cashed a $ 50 check that i 'd given him months prior that he said he would never cash because your money is no good here that freaking $ 50 check cost me hundreds of dollars they charged me the overdraft fee a bounced check fee and then ran the fucking thing through again to see if it would cash when they knew it would n't so i ended up with all the fees doubled    i closed my account after that and 2 months later i got a notice that my account had a negative balance of more than $ 100 because they had charged me the monthly fee for the checking account after i closed it and since the account was empty

when you can your option depends on your trading style in the american options trading style the most popular you 're allowed to your options and make profit if any whenever you want before the expiration date thus the decision of   exercising your option and make a profit out of it does not rely only on the asset price the reason is you already paid for the premium to get the option so if taken into account the underlying price and your premium your investment is profitable then you can your contract anytime

how would they make money from it    they sell you the software for $ 100 us example could as easily be 100 euros or 10,000 japanese yen   you use it to make recommendations on your blog   your blog becomes rich from advertising   they sold $ 100 worth of software   if they spent $ 1 million in labor developing it they 're way behind    another problem is that the software would stop working and need adjusted periodically   this is easy to do on a server but annoying on a pc   and who pays for the adjustments    put both those things together and it 's a lot easier to do on a server   another advantage is that a server can get a better data feed as well   pay a premium for the detailed information rather than relying on public sources   and people are used to renting server access where they expect to buy software once    another issue is that they are unlikely to beat the market this way   yes have done so   but that 's the latest ai constantly adjusted   this is going to be a previous generation ai   it 's more likely to match the market   and we already have a way to match the market   an index fund    if someone had a brilliant ai the best use would probably be to sell it to a fund manager   the fund manager could then use the ai to find opportunities for its existing investors   note that a $ 10 billion fund with a 10 return that gives a .1 commission would be paying $ 1 million   and that has no marketing or packaging overhead   think $ 10 billion is a lot   fidelity has $ 2 trillion

no   mark to market valuation relies on using a competitive market of public traders to determine the share price from free market trading among independent traders who are not also insiders    any professional valuation would see through the promotional nature of the share offer it is pretty obvious that the purchaser of a share could not turn around and sell their share for $ 10 unless the free hosting that is worth most of the $ 10 follows it and that 's more of hybrid of stock and bond than pure stock   it is also pretty obvious that selling a few shares for $ 10 does not mean one could sell 10,000,000 shares for $ 10 because of the well known decreasing marginal value effect from economics while this question seems hypothetical as a practical matter offering to sell share of unregistered securities in a startup for $ 10 to the general public   is likely to run afoul of state or federal securities laws of the honesty of the business or any included promotional offers    see for more information about the sec regulations for raising capital for small businesses

my understanding i am not a lawyer or tax expert is that you are not allowed to work for free but you can pay yourself minimum wage for the hours worked there are probably national insurance implications as well but i do n't know the main thing is though that if hmrc think that you 've set up this system as a tax avoidance scheme then they 're allowed to tax you as though all the income had been yours in the first place if you are considering such a setup i would strongly advise you to hire a qualified small business accountant who will be familiar with the rules and will be able to advise you on what is and is not possible sensible falling outside the rules even inadvertently leaves you liable to a lot of hassle and potentially fines etc

unfortunately i missed most of segment and i did n't get to understand the why to begin with cramer is an and his business is pushing stocks if you put money into mutual funds which most 401k plans limit your investments to then you are not purchasing his product also many 401k plans have limited selections of funds and many of those funds are not good performers while his stock picking track record is much better than mine his is n't that great   he does point out that there are a lot of fees mostly hidden in 401k accounts if you read your company 's 5500 filing schedule a you can determine just how much your plan administrators are paying themselves if paying excessive fees is your concern then you should be rolling over your 401k into your ira when you quit or the employer match vests which ever is later   finally cramer thinks that most of his audience will max out their ira contributions and have only a little bit left for their 401k i 'm most definately not most people as i 'm maxing out both my 401k and ira contributions

generally speaking an interest free loan will be tied to a specific purchase and the lender will be paid something by the vendor the only other likely scenario is an introductory offer to try to win longer term more profitable business such as an initial interest free period on a credit card banks could n't make money if all their loans were interest free unless they were getting paid by the vendors of whatever was being purchased with the money that was lent

my answer would be yes in addition i 'm not sure that anything requires you to roll your current 401(k into a new one if you do n't like the investment options   keeping existing funds in your current 401(k if you like their investment options might make sense for you though they obviously would n't be adding funds once you 're no longer an employee as for the terms of the potential new 401(k the matching percentage and vesting schedule match what i 've seen at past employers   my current employer offers the same terms but there 's no vesting schedule

well if you only own the option you are only limited to loosing the premium with futures at least with the brokers i talked to most of the time you need to sign a margin contract just to trade futures i do n't want to go into debt and i do n't think i would do too well to be fairly honest i am a college student and want to limit my risk and so just trading the option would help me get access to the commodity markets without having to get margin like many brokers want me to do i am not trying to do any hedging or anything which i am aware you can do all i want to do is do an inflation trade and i believe commodities are the best way to me honest if i had my way i would just buy and hold and that is the strategy i want to emulate closest even though i know i ca n't hold it forever basically i want to avoid debt but still trade commodities

with a 401k you will be taxed when you withdraw the money upon retirement just like an ira but conventional wisdom had it that you 're likely to be in a lower tax bracket at that time that may not necessarily be the case though in which case a roth ira would be a better option because you 're paying for it with after tax dollars and distributions are untaxed if you wanted to hedge your bets you could have both an ira/401k and a roth ira   an ira has income limits above which the contributions are no longer tax deductible i do n't believe a 401k has the same limitations for completion 's sake a roth ira has income limits above which you ca n't contribute to one and like you said the employer match is free money

the problem here can be boiled down to that fact you are attempting to obtain a loan without collateral   there are times it can be done but you have to have a really good relationship with a banker   your question suggests that avenue has been exhausted you are looking for an investor but you are offering something very speculative   suppose an investor gives you 20 k what recourse does he have if you do not pay the terms of the loan   from what income will this be paid from   what event will trigger the capability to make a balloon payment     now if you can find a really handy guy that really needs a place to live could you swap rent for repairs   maybe   perhaps you buy the materials and he does the roof in exchange for 6 months worth of rent or whatever if you approached me with this investment the thing that would raise a red flag is why do n't you have 20 k to do this yourself   if you do n't how will you be able to make payments   for example of the items you mentioned that is a weekend worth of work and some pretty inexpensive materials   why does money need to be borrowed for this a weekend worth of demo and $ 500 worth of material and another weekend to build something for a rental   why does money need to be borrowed for this 2 k   why does money need to be borrowed for this this can be expensive but most roofing companies offer financing   also doing some of the work yourself can save a ton of money   an old roof is typically about 1/3 of the roofing cost and is technically simple but physically difficult so besides the new roof you could have a lot of your list solved for less than 3 k and three weekends worth of work   you are attempting to change this into a rental not the

unless you 're running a self employed business with a significant turnover more than £ 150k you are entitled to use cash basis accounting for your tax return which means you would put the date of transactions as the payment date rather than the billing date or the date a debt is incurred for payments which have a lag e.g. a cheque that needs to be paid in or a bank transfer that takes a few days you might also need to choose between multiple payment dates e.g. when you initiated the payment or when it took effect you can pick one as long as you 're consistent you can choose how you record when money is received or     paid eg the date the money enters your account or the date a cheque    is written but you must use the same method each tax year

well what you are asking is emi which comes to in your case   the formula you are applying is of compounding a value which is completely different   in emi person keeps paying money every month or any other period as specified this amount is firstly allocated towards the interest for the period and the balance for principal amount so in effect principal keeps decreasing and subsequently interest also since interest is getting paid every time it becomes due compounding actually do not happen at all   in the case of compounding interest gets applied at certain interval but do not get paid so in effect every time when interest gets applied it applies on complete principal outstanding as well as interest unpaid hence this complete amount gets payable at the end in this case total amount payable is obviously high because of 2 reasons 1 since principal gets unpaid during whole period you are paying interest on complete amount for complete period   2 you will be paying interest on interest compounding of interest since you are not paying it as it is becoming due hence both are different you need to find emi calculator or emi formula to achieve your purpose edit the formula for calculating emi assuming a loan of rs 1 at 9 per annum in 15 years the emi calculation using the formula will be emi = × × 1 + 180 ÷ 1 + 180 1 = 750 × ÷ = 750 × =

traditional brokers there are tons of players in this market especially in usa you have traditional brokers brokers tied to your bank and a bunch of startups the easiest is probably a broker tied to your bank because you probably do n't have to wait to fund your brokerage account and can start trading immediately often the older traditional brokers do n't have very intuitive interfaces it 's the startups who do a better job at this but honestly it does n't really matter because you can use reporting services that are different from the services you use to execute your trades meaning that you only use the interface of your broker to execute trades buy or sell and use third party services to monitor your holdings monitoring services google finance yahoo finance morningstar are services allowing you to monitor your holdings but you ca n't execute trades with them start ups then there are a bunch of startups that offer investment services besides the traditional brokers start up > robinhood the most ambitious one is robinhood which offers the same service as a traditional broker but completely free most of the traditional brokers charge a flat fee and/or percentage when buying selling and with an intuitive interface they 're mobile first but announced they will be launching their service on the web soon start up > acorns another popular mobile first start up is acorns they offer a lazy investing service which rounds your everyday purchases and uses the change to invest it 's great when investing is not on your mind but you still want to invest without realizing it start ups > robo advisors robo advisors auto invest your money across a bunch of funds picked based on your risk profile because the robo advisers are fairly new they often have the most intuitive interfaces these robo advisors often do n't allow you to pick individual holdings so these services are best when you want to passively invest meaning you do n't want to look at it very often and let them do the investing for you there are tons of robo advisor start ups betterment wealthfront personal capital also bigger parties jumped on this trend with their offerings schwab intelligent portfolios ally managed portfolio vanguard personal advisor etc summary it 's fun to pick individual stocks but if you start out it can be overwhelming robinhood is probably the best start they have reduced functionality but gets you going with an attractive interface but soon you 'll realize it 's extremely hard to beat the market meaning that hand picking stocks statistically gives you a worse return than just buying into the general stock market like s&p500 so you can decide to just buy one fund with a traditional broker that covers the general stock market or you can decide to try out one of the many robo advisors they have n't been around that long so it 's hard to tell how effective these are and whether they beat the market if you 're young and you believe in start ups who often try to challenge the traditional players try out one of the robo advisors if you want to play a bit and are addicted to your smartphone try out robinhood if you are addicted to your phone but do n't want to check up on your investments all the time go for acorns of course you can combine all these lastly there are tons of cryptocurrencies which might give you a large return tons of startups offer intuitive interfaces to trade cryptocurrencies like coinbase gemini but beware there is a lot of risk involved in trading cryptocurrencies it 's completely unregulated etc but definitely check them out oh and you can also invest by giving out loans through lendingclub prosper etc who can you trust above gives you an overview of your options intermingled with some reasoning but regarding your question who can i trust in terms of advice it 's up to yourself most traditional broker services do n't give you any advice at all you 're on your own robo advisors do n't give you advice either but let their proprietary algorithm do the job are these reliable nobody can tell they have n't been around long enough and they need to go through a bear market a crash to see how they respond during rough times some robo advisors offer you personal consultancy i believe and does this limited to a few hours per year but obviously they 'll try to promote their robo advisor services

my recommendation would be to pay off your student loan debt as soon as possible you mention that the difference between your student loan and the historical long term return on the stock market is one half percent   the problem is the 7 return that you are counting on from the stock market is not guaranteed   you might get 7 over the next few years but you also might do much worse   the 6.4 interest that you will save by aggressively paying off your debt is guaranteed you are concerned about the opportunity cost of paying your debt early   however this cost is only temporary   by drawing out your debt payments you have a long term opportunity cost   by this i mean that 4 years from now you could still have 6 years of debt payments hanging over your head or you could be debt free with all of your income available to save spend or invest as you see fit in my opinion debt just to try to come out 0.5 ahead is not worth the hassle or risk

first make sure you are contacting the bank directly use an old invoice you have on hand with a phone number direct to the bank and call them   do not use the provided number or you may wind up being pulled into a scam it is entirely possible that the bank is also confused at this point so you should not rely on the number provided at all second once you can confirm that your account is being closed find out when it is being closed so you know when you need to act on it it 's possible you still have access to your account and do not need to launch into a panic just yet    third get the bank to explain exactly why they are closing your account make it clear that if they can not explain you will be forced to transfer to a new account and close business with them permanently this is not a threat this is a matter of fact because finally if you can not keep your account open find a different bank and open up a new account   frankly if your current bank is closing your account and only managed to get a letter out to you a month late you should probably find a new bank   if instead they simply can not figure out if your bank account is closed or not this is also a bad sign and you may want a new bank account anyway    but please go through these steps in order because you need to verify with your bank what is going on    keep 's answer in mind as well in case you need to get your money out of your account quickly

the only thing that is important here is the documentation you and your daughter signed if that documentation states that you were a co signer and that your daughter was the primary on the loan and then if the loan is not being reported in your daughter 's name you have a cause for action if however the documentation says the loan is entirely in your name the mistake is yours even in that case though your daughter may be able to take over the loan or she may be able to take out a loan from a separate institution and use that to pay off the current loan obviously this may be difficult if she does not have a credit history which is what got you here in the first place

at its heart i think the best spirit of donation is helping others less fortunate than yourself but as long as the us remains solvent the chief benefit of paying down the national debt is like paying off a credit card lowering the future interest payments the u.s. taxpayer has to make since the wealthy pay a disproportionately large portion of taxes per capita your hard earned money would be disproportionately benefitting the wealthy so i 'd recommend you do one or both of the following instead target your donations to a charity whose average beneficiary is less fortunate than yourself take political action with an aim towards balancing the federal budget since the us national debt is principally financed in the form of 30 year treasuries the u.s. will be completely out of debt if it can maintain a balanced budget for 30 years see below

gt;however the caveat i will add is that if you go into debt for your education you should certainly be thinking about the economic value your education can provide you   i agree but we 're not going to have that discussion when many parents do n't understand debt accurately and the ones that do are the ones whose kids are n't as likely to need big loans    gt;at the end of the day though these findings are all moot unless we can have a conversation about the hyperinflation in college costs directly related to free aka subsidized education    the hyperinflation is n't because college costs are subsidized federal loans still have caps it 's because student loans ca n't be discharged in bankruptcy in the vast majority of cases that means that private loans are available which means the federal loan caps are effectively useless    free college would have its challenges and we 'd need to make private loans in bankruptcy which would in turn make banks lend to only credit worthy students co signers using appropriate risk models but then we 'd also be able to make other adjustments    there are some things that we could probably be doing now but others might be too easily corruptible without the market correction of private loans only to those who are credit qualified   we could put more stringent requirements on grade point averages for example if you do n't hit that you do n't get your free college you can continue going if you go get private loans not able to qualify time to do something else then work and save for college trade school enter the workforce permanently etc this would n't work as well if private loans were still easily and non because there could be shady dealings to make more people not eligible for the free assistance with some type of crazy obstacles etc   we could do things like cap the costs for particular programs if you want to study mechanical engineering you can get up to x amount but if you 're studying early french you can only get up to y amount yes we could do that now but i do n't love the idea of putting those type of restrictions when it 's the student paying it seems a bit of an    there are lots of ways we could be addressing things but we are n't

yes and no first off commodity prices reflect the cost of a good about 3 steps back in the retail supply chain the agreed upon price for the raw between farmers and manufacturers your grocer may carry bags of whole grain wheat but that 's certainly not all he carries that contains it same for corn rice and other staple grains as well as for fruits and vegetables yes you can buy by the ton on the cme meats various sugars etc so a long term sustained change in prices of a commodity will eventually affect the real cost to you to buy things they 're made from however in the short term the retail supply chain will generally act as a buffer between these prices and the ones you see on the store shelf consumers do n't like price increases especially of necessities like food when food costs go up consumers can and will very quickly change their spending habits buying cheaper options to get their needed calories that makes manufacturers nervous consumers not buying their product is a worse scenario than consumers buying their product at a reduced gain or even at a loss so manufacturers and suppliers and retailers will all absorb as much as they can of the cost of a commodities increase before beginning to pass it on to consumers on the flip side while consumers like price drops they do n't notice them as much as price increases so the supply chain will also absorb a fall in commodity prices by price reductions in the consumer goods as long as they can get away with it which is usually longer than the price reduction actually lasts the net effect is that processed food prices typically follow the gentle upward climb of long term inflation and only rarely do you see drastic price increases or decreases where this model breaks down a little bit is in highly perishable especially seasonal or wild managed foods fruits and vegetables seafood etc the limited time in which the stuff can be sold makes the process of getting a fish out of the ocean and a fruit off the tree and into your grocery store much more market driven the producers suppliers and grocers are all in constant contact over what 's available and how much they can get for what price the prices therefore are typically a lower markup unlike highly processed grain based foods there 's not much added value to be marked up between the apple farmer picking the fruit and the grocer putting it on display but also much more volatile if there 's a bumper crop of fruit the farmer has to unload it all or it goes to waste while similarly if an early freeze decimated the apple crop the suppliers ca n't just get some of last year 's bumper crop out of storage they fight with everyone else for what little made it to market farmers will sometimes intentionally let excess crop spoil in order to maintain a minimum price for what they sell the rest can at least be and used for fertilizer saving them some money on maintenance but there 's no silver bullet for a shortage this is why a lot of these foods especially seafood are considered luxury items they 're not stable enough for everyone to get as much as they want whenever they want unlike staple grains

if you get an inr 1000 discount for paying up front versus paying over six months you can consider that inr 1000 interest your annualized rate comes out to about if you can earn better than on that money by using it elsewhere in the mean time then you should pay over six months if not you should pay the whole price up front you may also elect to pay the interest if you do not have the full amount now but the use of the phone for the next six months will earn you more than the inr 1000 premium that you pay to defer the full purchase price

as others have explained defined contribution is when you or your employer contributes a specified amount and you reap all the investment returns   defined benefit is when your employer promises to pay you a specified amount benefit and is responsible for making the necessary investments to provide for it    is one better than the other we can argue this either way    defined benefit would seem to be more predictable and assured   the problem being of course that it is entirely reliant upon the employer to have saved enough money to pay that amount   if the employer fails in that responsibility then the only fallback is government guarantees   and of course the government has limitations on what it can guarantee   for example from wikipedia    the maximum pension benefit guaranteed by pbgc is set by law and adjusted yearly for plans that end in 2016 workers who retire at age 65 can receive up to $ per month or $ per year under pbgc 's insurance program for single employer plans benefit payments starting at ages other than 65 are adjusted which means the maximum guaranteed benefit is lower for those who retire early or when there is a benefit for a survivor and higher for those who retire after age 65 additionally the pbgc will not fully guarantee benefit improvements that were adopted within the five year period prior to a plan 's termination or benefits that are not payable over a retiree 's lifetime other limitations also apply to supplemental benefits in excess of normal retirement benefits benefit increases within the last five years before a plan 's termination and benefits earned after a plan sponsor 's bankruptcy by contrast people tend to control their own defined contribution accounts   so they control how much gets invested and where   defined contribution accounts are always 100 funded    defined benefit pension plans are often underfunded   they expect the employer to step forward and subsidize them when they run short   this allows the defined benefits to both be cheaper during the employment period and more generous in retirement   but it also means that employers have to subsidize the plans later when they no longer get a benefit from the relationship with the employee    if you want someone else to make promises to you and are n't worried that they wo n't keep them you probably prefer defined benefit    if you want to have personal control over the money you probably prefer defined contribution    my personal opinion is that defined benefit plans are a curse   they encourage risky behavior and false promises   defined contribution plans are more honest about what they provide and better match the production of employment with its compensation   others see defined benefit plans as the gold standard of pensions

you absolutely should consider expenses why do they matter when the sticker price already includes them   because you can be much more certain about what the expense ratio will be in the future than you can about what the fund performance will be in the future the sticker price mixes generalized economic growth i.e. gains you could have gotten from other funds with gains specific to the fund but the expense ratio is completely fund specific   in other words when looking at the sticker price performance of a fund it 's difficult to determine how that performance will extend into the future   but the expense ratio will definitely carry into the future   it is rare for funds to drastically change their expense ratios but common for funds to change their performance suppose you find a fund that has returned a net of 8 over some time period and has a 1 expense ratio and another fund that has returned a net of 10 but has a 2 expense ratio   so the first fund returned = 8 and the second returned   there are decent odds that over some future time period the first fund will return while the second fund will return   in order for the second fund to be better than the first it has to reliably outperform it by 1 this is harder than it may sound   simply put there is a lot of noise in the fund performance but the expense ratio is all signal of course if you find a fund that will reliably return 20 after expenses of 3 it would probably make sense to choose that over one that returns 10 after expenses of 1   but will reliably return is not the same as has returned over the past n years and the difference between the two phrases becomes greater and greater the smaller n is   when you find a fund that seems to have performed well over some time period you should be cautious there is a good chance that the future holds some regression to the mean and the fund will not continue to be so stellar you may want to take a look at this question which asked about morningstar fund ratings which are essentially a measure of past performance   my answer references a study done by morningstar comparing its own star ratings vs. fund expenses as a predictor of overall results   i 'll repeat here the take home message how often did it pay to heed expense ratios every time how often did it pay to heed the star rating most of the time with a few exceptions how often did the star rating beat expenses as a predictor slightly less than half the time taking into account funds that expired during the time period in other words morningstar 's own study showed that its own star ratings that is past fund performance are not as good at predicting success as simply looking at the expense ratios of the funds

it sounds like you are interested in investing in the stock market but you do n't want to take too much risk investing in an index eft will provide some diversification and can be less risky than investing in individual stocks however with potentially lower returns if you want to invest your money the first thing you should do is learn about managing your risk you are still young and you should spend your time now to increase your education and knowledge there are plenty of good books to start with and you should prepare an investment plan which incorporates a risk management strategy $ 1000 is a little low to start investing in the stock market so whilst you are building your education and preparing your plan you can continue building up more funds for when you are ready to start investing   place your funds in an high interest savings account for now and whilst you are learning you can practice your strategies using virtual accounts in fact the asx has a share market game which is held   2 or 3 times per year the asx website also has some good learning materials for and they hold regular seminars it is another good source for improving your education in the subject   remember first get educated then plan and practice and then invest

lets talk about price gouging laws intended to protect victims in a disaster that actually serve to make it more difficult to service the needy   allowing producers to charge a higher price for items that are in high demand water gas etc sends signals to other producers that profits are available this in turn gives them incentive   to make extraordinary efforts to service victims   no one is going to drive 200 miles to sell water if the price is limited by law there will be less water available for all   if huge profits are available to those entrepreneurs who take the risk to help people then more people will engage in the helping and more resources will be available for all the prices will eventually come down as supply is restored and as more competitors enter the area   tl;dr i would rather have expensive water in an emergency than no water

no no not at all i 'm saying that bezos as head of amazon should work to improve workers conditions using his influence as founder chairman ceo of amazon which is a longer winded way of saying amazon should improve workers conditions    i think it 's great that he 's looking to give some of his money away to charity i think it 's rather hypocritical to do that whilst being accused of low employee welfare conditions mind you but it 's certainly better than nothing    if i 'm still not coming across correctly let me slip into hyperbole and extremes let 's say a victorian factory owner employs children in dangerous and work 14 hours a day and they get fired if they are ill but with the money he makes from the factory he gives some of it to a children 's hospital i mean that 's great but hey what about instituting change at the factory too if you really care about society   i think that last paragraph from my point actually but i 've written it out so i 'll leave it there

in my experience financial advisors do not normally assist with budgeting and personal everyday finance there certainly are people who do that but you would normally only consult them when you have financial difficulties especially debt the more common find of financial advisor is mostly focussed on advising you about savings and investments a lot work for banks and investment companies they will usually advise you for free the downside being that they will only recommend their company 's products this may or may not be a bad thing depending on the company others will charge you a commission on purchases and their advice will be more neutral this question will also be interesting are all financial advisors compensated in the same way

no you have to reimburse the current mortgage you have and a new one for your new house a mortgage is a loan from a financial institution that accepts to give you money if you pay it back the total amount adding interests interests are the price you pay to the financial institution for it to give you money for a while in the mortgage you have an legal agreement with the financial institution on how to reimburse the total amount that is given to you for a while breaking that agreement is breaking the law the fact of the matter is that when 30 of your mortgage is reimbursed the financial institution own your house legally for real at 70 your live in the house own by the financial institution at 70 it is the same exact logic for a car loan the mortgage goes with a specific house at a legal address that you live in as a primary residence

it helps to put the numbers in terms of an asset say a bottle of wine costs 10 dollars but the price rises to 20 dollars a year later the price has risen 100 and your dollars have lost value whereas your ten used to be worth 100 of the price of bottle of wine they now are worth 50 of the risen price of a bottle of wine so they 've lost around 50 of their value divide the old price by the new inflated price to measure proportionally how much the old price is of the new price 10 divided by 20 is 1/2 or .50 or 50 you can then subtract the old price from the new in proportional terms to find how much value you 've lost 1 minus 1/2 or 1.00 minus .50 or 100 minus 50

the easiest and least expensive way of doing this similar to the answer from randy is to write a check and deposit it into the canadian institution since this transfer is between accounts you own the easiest thing to do is to do a deposit by mail contact your current institution on where you would need to mail your deposit to you can then write yourself a check on the us bank and mail it to the canadian bank be sure to write for deposit only along with your account number and branch number for canada on the back this is the slowest but cheapest method an alternative option is to use wire transfers but they can be very costly you 'll usually incur a fee when sending and when receiving i only recommend them when you need the money in the account fast they are usually settled within an hour

does that mean that 30 of my monthly payment goes to interest no it 's much worse then that the apr is the annual percentage rate an apr of 30 on $ 23,000 in debt that means you 'll be charged $ in interest for the year you 'll actually owe slightly less since you are reducing your principal slightly over the course of the year if your monthly payment is $ 800 $ 575 of that will be going to interest that means that over 70 of your monthly payment is going just to interest this deal makes no sense at all you 'd be better off simply transferring all of your balances on to the credit card with the highest interest rate you 'd be paying almost $ 200 a month for the convenience of writing one check rather than three

i agree that best is subjective and will not give investment advice however the tax deductible part can be dealt with quite swiftly if you need tax deductibility right now at the expense of later put it into an rsp account if you do n't need tax deductibility right now put it into a tfsa assuming you have room in either of these vehicles i would suggest using just an rsp or tfsa cash savings account for now at ing direct three reasons you get the immediate benefit of having put it somewhere and in the case of the rsp an immediate tax deductibility you do n't have to worry about rushing into a specific investment and can give yourself time to figure out your goals and portfolio composition read about the couch potato portfolio for a starting point you can transfer your money from them for free and still keep it registered in whichever plan it is in the last point is the most important for my suggestion the ability to quickly park the cash in a registered account and to move it for free using the appropriate form at a later date most places have a sneaky transfer out fee ing may not be the only place that does n't but i have n't looked into many other places about this you might find something else that works the same way and please do n't ever use gic and high return in the same sentence

if you do n't think you 're necessarily going to stay in this area for five years consider another option renting five years is often quoted as the minimum length of time for buying over renting as the costs of the house purchase and the mortgage are significant and if you 're buying a new house every 5 years you 're putting several thousand dollars of fees up front each time   if you do n't assume that house prices will increase as they wo n't necessarily then you can consider these costs say $ for a $ 500k house an extra 1 or so of interest that first year   if you are there 5 years then you 're paying 0.2 extra more or less that 's reasonable but if you 're there only 2 years you 're adding 0.5 to your rate which is pretty significant you wo n't necessarily come out ahead here versus renting renting for a year or two gives you enough time to find out if you do like the area and if you do you buy then with more knowledge of the area and a chance to make a purchase at the right time for you you pay off your loans or at least a chunk of them now save some of the rest and then rethink in a couple of years   if you then do n't qualify for a doctor 's mortgage anymore you just save up the rest of the 20 before making the purchase

every economy wants growth and for growth to come you need investments so you must provide some motive for people to risk their money every investment has inherently a degree of risk or if you want uncertainty about the outcome as a result the tax on capital gains is lower than on other types of income because the risk is almost zero the tax is considered in the calculation of the net interest rate and you can see this as the interest which the investors demand in order to invest their money

to add on to the other answers in asking why funds have different price points one might be asking why stocks are n't normalized so a unit price of $ in one stock can be directly compared to the same price in another stock   while this might not make sense with aapl vs. goog it would be like comparing apples to oranges pun intended not to mention how would two different companies ever come to such an agreement it does seem like it would make more sense when tracking an index   and in fact less agreement between different funds would be required as some natural price points exist such as dividing by 100 like some s&p funds do however there are a couple of reasons why two different funds might price their shares of the same underlying index differently demand if there are a lot of people wanting the issue more shares might be issued at a lower price   or there might be a lot of demand centered on a certain price range pricing shares that are priced higher will find fewer buyers because it makes it harder to buy round lots 100 shares at $ 100/share is $ 10,000 while at $ 10/share it 's only $ 1000   while not everyone buys stock in lots it 's important if you do anything with standardized options on the stock because they are always acting on lots   in addition even if you do n't buy round lots a higher price makes it harder to buy in for a specific amount because each unit share has a greater chance to be further away from your target amount conversely shares that are priced too low will also find fewer buyers because some holders have minimum price requirements due to low price e.g. penny stocks to be more speculative and volatile so different funds tracking the same index might pick different price points to satisfy demand that is not being filled by other funds selling at a different price point

it 's not a ponzi scheme and it does create value i think you are confusing creating value and producing something the stock market does create value but not in the same way as toyota creates value by making a car the stock market does not produce anything the main way money enters the stock market is through investors investing and taking money out    the only other cash flow is in through dividends and out when businesses go public     the stock market goes up only when more people invest in it although the stock market keeps tabs on businesses the profits of businesses do not actually flow into the stock market earnings are the in flow that you are missing here business profits do flow back into the stock market through earnings and dividends think about a private company if it has $ 100,000 in profits for the year then the company keeps $ 100,000 but if that same company is publicly traded with   100,000 shares outstanding then all else being equal each of those shares went up by $ 1 when you buy stock it is claimed that you own a small portion of the company this statement has no backing as you can not exchange your stock for the company 's assets you ca n't go to an apple store and try to pay with a stock certificate but that does n't mean the certificate does n't have value using your agriculture example you would n't be able to pay with a basket of tomatoes either you would n't even be able to pay with a lump of gold we used to do that it was called the barter system   companies also do buy shares back from the market using company cash although they usually do it through clearing houses that are capable of moving blocks of 1,000 shares at a time

i 'm not sure what point you think i was making it looks like you think i 'm supporting the idea that qe causes inflation which it does n't at least not when it is being used as it has been what it does seem to have done is depress interest rates and create a speculative market that does n't match up with economic reality it has also created a ridiculous profit loop for investment banks selling bonds to the fed   you ca n't talk about qe without mentioning that banks are now incentivized to hold onto reserves because they can collect interest so the banks screwed up were heavily subsidized under the pretense of it being best for the taxpayer and were then rewarded for sitting on all of that money    if i support any viewpoint it is this the government agreed to give the banks a thin veneer of solvency by granting them enormous sums in a short period obviously if that much currency went straight into the market it would be a disaster so it put a mechanism in place to reward them for holding onto it all qe did was massively increase the debt burden of the government which will be passed on to taxpayers in the form of taxes fines fewer benefits worsening infrastructure and more restrictions qe may have not caused inflation but it certainly did n't help the vast majority of americans who will simply see their standard of living decline at a quicker pace i 'm sure this will get blamed on immigrants or something instead of the reality that our government is rewarding banks for not lending to individuals why would they an individual might not pay them back but the government always will by simply extracting more out of those very individuals

say the rate is 6 and the payment is $ 500/mo if the bank credits on the day received the .5 per month is $ 2.50 for the whole month in other words pulling in the payment by the full 30 days will save you about $ 2.50 the whole loan may be costing $ but you can only impact the amount one payment at a time   to be clear you need to find out exactly how they credit you some loans do not accept partial payments separate from the normal payment if a $ 500 payment is due that 's the time to prepay principal but they might not accept say $ 200 each week   as a side note mortgages typically do n't credit the way you 'd hope i have a standard 30 year mortgage and whether i send the payment a full 15 days early or 14 days late the next month shows a balance that i can pull from an amortization table assuming all payments are on the 1st of the month if i were you i 'd make a full payment 2 weeks early then check your balance and see what the impact was just to be sure

it depends primarily on how the canadian economy is designed i.e export oriented or import oriented if you look at this it shows more or less equal amount of exports and imports for the specific case of canada the exports would become costlier because of a costlier dollar but at the same time imports would become cheaper this is only a generalization not specific which would require a more detailed but investors have a different dilemma canadian investors would find   it cheaper to invest abroad so may channel their investments abroad because they may find it costlier to invest in canada while foreign investors would find it costlier to invest in canada and may wait for later or invest else   then government may try to boost up investment and start lowering the interest rates if it sees the rising dollar as detrimental for the canadian economy and investments flowing abroad instead of canada but what would be the final outcome of the whole is little difficult to predict because something is arriving and something is departing and above all goverment is doing something or is going to do but the basic gist is canadian exporters will be sad and canadian importers will be happy but vice versa for foreign investors intending to invest in canada

i do n't believe there exists a tax advantage for paying employees a bonus instead of increased salary it 's all expense to the employer it 's all income to you and it 's taxed the same bonus checks might have more withheld but your end of year tax burden does n't change it does benefit your employer to delay a significant portion of your pay until the end of the year delaying payment provides buffer in case of delays in getting paid by the client your employer could even put the extra money to work earning more money over the year   it would depend on your contract but are you due your bonus if you were to leave your job before year end if not that 's a great reason to delay payment because it makes you less likely to leave mid year and should you not work out they can keep the difference

note my sister works for one of the largest clinical development testing and companies so i know some of the key issues but not all this answer does not constitute advice on any particular stock or other instrument this is mostly well researched opinion the problem with biotech companies and a few other areas of technology is that a lot of money is spent and debt incurred on ensuring that products are effective and safe to go to market at any stage these tests can fail and the product is essentially worthless at this stage the developers will have learnt a lot about the drug and how it is as as it is and so the next iteration of the potential drug will be better and hopefully less likely to cause complications and harmful side effects the process of gaining approval for this second iteration is just as expensive if not more so than the last this means that they are spending a lot of money on the drug and for small biotech companies concentrating on one or few drugs will have little to no income generation to offset this if the money runs out before they get the product out they are bankrupt even if the drug is perfect a second issue is that they are not the only firm looking for a cure they might have a very good drug that works very well but another company may have a better one in the pipeline that will either take their monopoly position or take all of their business based on the relative cost and efficacy the longer it takes them to get through testing the more likely it is that this will happen and the more likely it is that the competing drug will be first to market and receive all of the free publicity that goes with that in this case the risk is that they have a product eventually but no market for it and so will again run out of money another consideration is what the cure is actually worth prevention and awareness is already reducing the number of wealthy western people who have hiv and so the market size is falling where the most profit can be made in order to get any return on your investment a profit will be required where hiv rates are rising is in poor countries in africa asia and south america where the price at which people could afford to buy a cure is likely to be lower than even the break even price for the firm in this case you have a monopoly and a drug that works but no one can afford to buy it for a price that you can accept and still make a profit biotech is a very risky but potentially lucrative area because there are just so many risks at every stage price volatility occurs on and questionable statements from the company who are always trying to be positive so that their funding does n't dry up and even relatively small trades can move the market a large amount as few people want to sell an investment with so much potential there are also some charged political positions with regard to hiv and aids so a shift in political power could also derail a biotech firm that is researching this kind of drug

credit is not free money the idea is you will repay all of it within a reasonable amount of time it is abundantly clear you either do n't really understand this concept or completely failed at planning for it or even at keeping up with how much you owe you are blaming the bank for letting you go over the limit the reason most banks will authorize that for credit customers is they do n't want to people in some sort of an emergency situation i 'd recommend you cut back on your spending and work on paying the balance down if you have been charged any over the limit fees you can attempt to negotiate getting those credited most banks will compromise on that the first time i do n't really recommend it but if there are some circumstances surrounding this that are temporary and you are very confident about being able to manage money better in the future chances are you might be able to get approved for another card if you otherwise have had some good credit history and this situation is very recent it may not even show up on your credit report yet and another bank might happily approve you they may even offer a low or zero interest for some time balance transfer deal which you should use to get the other card within the limit if that ends up working it 's very important that you keep in mind having dodged the bullet once does n't mean you will ever be able to do it again get your budget in order and pay things off

i strongly recommend that you talk to an accountant right away because you could save some money by making a tax payment by january 15 2014 you will receive forms 1099-misc from the various entities with whom you are doing business as a contractor detailing how much money they paid you a copy will go to the irs also you file a schedule c with your form 1040 in which you detail how much you received on the 1099-misc forms as well as any other income that your contracting business received e.g. amounts less than $ 600 for which a 1099-misc does not need to be issued or tips say if you are a taxi driver running your own cab and you can deduct various expenses that you incurred in generating this income including tools books or gasoline etc that you bought for doing the job you will need to file a schedule se that will compute how much you owe in social security and medicare taxes on the net income on schedule c. you will pay at twice the rate that employees pay because you get to pay not only the employee 's share but also the employer 's share at least you will not have to pay income tax on the employer 's share your net income on schedule c will transfer onto form 1040 where you will compute how much income tax you owe and then add on the social security tax etc to compute a final amount of tax to be paid you will have to pay a penalty for not making tax payments every quarter during 2013 plus   interest on the tax paid late   send the irs a check for the total if you talk to an accountant right away he she will likely be able to come up with a rough estimate of what you might owe and sending in that amount by january 15 will save some money the accountant can also help you set up for the 2014 tax year during which you could make quarterly payments of estimated tax for 2014 and avoid the penalties and interest referred to above

this is rob bennett the fellow who developed the valuation informed indexing strategy and the fellow who is discussed in the comment above the facts stated in that comment are accurate i went to a zero stock allocation in the summer of 1996 because of my belief in robert shiller 's research showing that valuations affect long term returns the conclusion stated that i have said that i do not myself follow the strategy is of course silly if i believe in it why would n't i follow it it 's true that this is a long term strategy that 's by design i see that as a benefit not a bad thing it 's certainly true that vii presumes that the efficient market theory is invalid if i thought that the market were efficient i would endorse buy and hold all of the conventional investing advice of recent decades follows logically from a belief in the efficient market theory the only problem i have with that advice is that shiller 's research the efficient market theory there is no one stock allocation that everyone following a vii strategy should adopt any more than there is any one stock allocation that everyone following a buy and hold strategy should adopt my personal circumstances have called for a zero stock allocation but i generally recommend that the typical middle class investor go with a 20 percent stock allocation even at times when stock prices are insanely high you have to make adjustments for your personal financial circumstances it is certainly fair to say that it is strange that stock prices have remained insanely high for so long what people are missing is that we have never before had claims that buy and hold strategies are supported by academic research those claims caused the biggest bull market in history and it will take some time for the widespread belief in such claims to diminish we are in the process of seeing that happen today   the good news is that once there is a consensus that buy and hold can never work we will likely have the greatest period of economic growth in u.s. history the power of academic research has been used to support buy and hold for decades now because of the widespread belief that the market is efficient turn that around and investors will possess a stronger belief in the need to practice long term market timing than they have ever possessed before in that sort of environment both bull markets and bear markets become logical emotional extremes in one direction emotional extremes in the other direction the stock market has been more emotional in the past 16 years than it has ever been in any earlier time this is evidenced by the wild p numbers that have applied for that entire time period now that we are seeing the losses that follow from investing in highly emotional ways we may see rational strategies becoming exceptionally popular for an exceptionally long period of time i certainly hope so the comment above that this will not work for individual stocks is correct this works only for those investing in indexes the academic research shows that there has never yet in 140 years of data been a time when valuation informed indexing has not provided far higher long term returns at greatly diminished risk but vii is not a strategy designed for stock pickers there is no reason to believe that it would work for stock pickers thanks much for giving this new investing strategy some thought and consideration and for inviting comments that help investors to understand both points of view about it rob

how would you respond to these cases limited card options if someone has a bad credit record the cards available may only be those with an annual fee   not everyone will have your credit record and thus access to the cards you have some annual fees may be waived in some cases thus someone may have a card with a fee that could be waived if enough transactions are done on the card   thus if someone gives enough business to the credit card company they will waive the fee on the point of the rewards if the card is from a specific retailer there could be a 10 discount for using that card and if the person purchases more than a couple thousand dollars worth from that store this is a savings of $ 200 from the retail prices compared to what would happen in other cases that more than offsets the annual fee   if someone likes to be a handyman and visits home depot often there may be programs to give rewards in this case credit cards can be useful for doing on line purchases flight reservations rental cars and a few other purchases that to with cash or debit can be difficult if not close to impossible some airline cards have a fee but presumably the perks provide a benefit that outweigh that fee over the year i 'm thinking of the citibank cards tied to american airlines first year free then an $ 85 fee

yes he can retract the offer it was a cash only offer and if you 're financing it 's no longer cash unless of course you get the financing through your local bank credit union and they hand you a check like on a personal loan then it 's still cash however the salesman can still retract the offer unless it 's in writing because you have n't signed anything yet the price of financing will always be higher because the dealer does n't get all their money today also if you finance you are not paying just the cost of the vehicle you are paying interest so your final cost will be higher unless you were one of the lucky souls who got 0 financing employee pricing and therefore are actually saving money by having a payment

in the netherlands its cheaper in some cases to have a mortgage then to own a house    example if you own a house you pay more taxes because you own something expensive you have to pay < owners tax so if you instead of owning the house   keep the mortgage low and only pay the mortgage interest the interest will be much lower then the tax you would have to pay the sweet spot for lowest interest and not having to pay the owners tax is different for any mortgage but by grandparents use this method and they pay a really small amount for a rather large house

the general rule is to spend as little as possible on transportation as it is an expense many people can get by without a car at all but you say you can not so what you need is the cheapest car that is sufficiently reliable for your needs i suggest you do not need three cars you do n't need to loan cars to your children if they need a car they can get a job and buy one or borrow your reliable vehicle if but only if you are not using it i would suggest then selling two of your vehicles and holding on to one for your daily commute pick the car you judge to be the most reliable however not all decisions are made purely rationally my vehicle is a 2012 subaru forester awd is very nice in my climate but i could have picked up a second hand vehicle for a lot less money similarly you may choose to hold on to a second or even a third vehicle because you judge it a reasonable use of your money it 's an unnecessary expense but so is coffee and you can have my coffee when you it from my cold dead fingers more generally there 's a rule of 28/36 roughly speaking that says that a household should spend a maximum of 28 of its gross income on housing expenses mortage heating etc etc and no more than 36 on total debt the aforementioned housing plus also car loans credit cards and other loan repayments if you are spending significantly more than that it 's time to seriously consider selling one or two of your cars plus cutting back elsewhere if you are significantly below that the fact that you may be underwater on your home may be a far less pressing matter

generally banks will report your loan to at least one if not all three credit bureaus although that is not required by law the interest you 're paying in addition to your insurance is n't justifiable for building credit i would recommend paying the car off and then perhaps applying for a secure credit card if you are worried about being rejected of course since you have very little credit applying for an unsecured card and getting rejected wo n't hurt you in the long run if you are rejected you can always go for a secured credit card the second time   as i mentioned in my comments it 's better to show 6 months of on time payments than to have no payment history at all so if your goal is to secure an apartment near campus i 'm sure you 're already a step ahead of the other students

should i use the profit to pay down student loans or just roll it into my next house in order to have a lower mortgage amount calculate the amount of interest in each scenario where the two scenarios are use extra cash to pay down student loans take out a full mortgage use extra cash to make a big down payment on the next house keep paying down student loans at normal rate in both scenarios the student loan rate will   stay the same however in the second scenario you may get a lower interest rate from making a larger down payment so then calculate the total interest resulting from each scenario student loan student loan balance = student loan interest   new mortgage mortgage balance = mortgage interest scenario 1 interest = student loan interest student loan loan balance = student loan interest   new mortgage rate with large down mortgage balance after large down payment = mortgage interest scenario 2 interest = student loan interest whichever scenario 's interest is lower will save money

here 's another rational reason discount this typically works only in smaller stores where you 're talking directly to the owners but it is sometimes possible to negotiate a few percent off the price when paying by check since otherwise they 'd have to give a few percent to the credit card company occasionally the sales reps at larger stores have the authority to cut this deal but it 's far less common not worth worrying about on small items but if you 're making a large purchase a bedroom suite for example it can pay for lunch and sometimes the store 's willing to give you more discount than that simply because with checks they do n't have to worry about chargebacks or some of the other that can occur in credit card processing another reason nobody 's very likely to steal you check number and try to write themselves a second check or otherwise use it without authorization it 's just too easy to steal credit card info these days to make printing checks worth the effort but in the end the real answer is that there 's no rational reason not to use checks so it takes you a few seconds more to complete the transaction what were you going to do with those seconds that makes them valuable especially if they 're seconds that the store is spending your purchase so there 's no lost time and the effort really is n't all that different from signing the credit card authorization quoting dean there are two kinds of fool one says this is old and therefore good the other says this is new and therefore better

you should hire a lawyer the fact that they told you your personal information shows that they actually had it and are not which is a good thing the fact that they mislead you means that their intentions are not pure which is not surprising coming from a collection agency of course when dealing with collections or any matter of significance for that matter do n't rely on their recording of the call because they can always conveniently lose it make sure to write down every single detail discussed including the date and time of the call and the id name of the person on the other side if possible make your own recording notifying them of it of course it 's too late to record the calls now but do try to as much information as possible to provide to your lawyer to deal with it in the end of the day they will either provide you with the recording and then you might be surprised to hear that what they said was not in fact what you thought they said and it was just your wishful thinking it is very possible to be indeed the case or claim we lost it and then it will be a problem to either of you to prove who said what but they 'll have the better hand having better lawyers in convincing the court that you 're the one trying to avoid paying your debts that is why proper representation at all stages is important as to the bankruptcy it wo n't help for student loans student loans is one of the very few types of debts you ca n't really run away from you have to solve this the sooner the better get a professional advice for the future and for the other readers you should have gotten the professional advice before defaulting on these loans and certainly after the first call

that 's because the one guy in portland who knows thai food has gone down the rabbit hole and knows what thai food is on a very deep level he 's friends with biggest thai on the planet he knows far more about thai fold than the average thai person in thailand   i have n't eaten at his restaurants but i assume they 're good i also assume he has problems still due to ingredients and the of his customers    everywhere else in america including the rest of portland the people have trouble securing good ingredients or have forgotten what thai food even tastes like thai town i took thai friends to multiple places in thai town all the best reviewed ones by americans and they were basically disgusted    thai food is one of those types of food that can taste pretty good even when it 's the lowest quality most formed dish on the market in america families tend to form restaurants where they serve a million different types of dishes which becomes a logistical nightmare when there are n't good markets that have what you need    in thailand many of the best places specialize in very few dishes on an expert level in thailand for every one place that specializes in something like beef noodles that is utterly amazing there are ten beef noodles places that taste okay and a tourist is likely to assume whatever beef noodles they have is as good as it gets unless they 're lucky enough to upon the mind blowing beef noodles    in america most of the thai restaurants serve a million different types of dishes they all remind me of the restaurants you see in the more tourist heavy parts of where there are a million pictures on the wall with the advertised prices and a ton of different dishes none of which are exceptional   in thailand if a place is serving a lot of different dishes most of those restaurants will be marginal or they 'll have a lot of different dishes from a specific region e san for example or serving a particular style of food which they are experts in duck restaurants in thailand often have a lot of other chinese dishes that accompany the duck that 's hard to do for every one of those in thailand all will taste decent 1/10 will be mind blowing    in the us you do n't even have beef places or duck rice places you have thai restaurants made by people who left thailand long ago only to return to eat at the same restaurants tourists walk into

see the accepted answer for this question   what effect will credit card churning for frequent flyer miles have on my credit score this does not directly answer how often that you asked but it states that the answerer opens 5 15 accounts per year   so the answer to your question is as often as you want as long as you manage your account ages the reason for this is that there are two factors in opening a new account that affect your credit card score   one is average age of accounts the other is credit inquiries   that answerer with fico in high sees about a 5 swing based on new cards and closing old ones you 'll have to manage average age of accounts   i assume this is done by keeping some older ones open to prop up the average and by closing the churn accounts finally if you choose to engage in churning and you intend to apply for a large loan and want a good credit score simply pause the account open close part of the churn a couple of months ahead of time   your score should recover from the temporary hits of the inquiries    the churning communities really do have how to guides which discuss the details of this   key phrase credit card churning

you can not roll over your 401k money in an employer 's 401k plan into an ira of any kind while you are still employed by that employer the only way you can start on the conversion before you retire as craig w suggests is to change employers and start rolling over money in the previous employer 's 401k into your roth ira while possibly contributing to the 401k plan of your new employer since the amount rolled over is extra taxable income that is in addition to your wages from your   new job you may end up paying more tax or at higher rates than you expect

yield can be thought of as the interest rate you would receive from that investment in the form of a dividend for stocks or interest payments on a bond   the yield takes into account the anticipated amount to be received per share unit per year and the current price of the investment    of course the yield is not a guaranteed return like a savings account   if the investment yield is 4 when you buy it can drop in value such that you actually lose money during your hold period despite receiving income from the dividend or interest payments

what littleadv said is correct   his worth is based on the presumed worth of the total company value which is much greater than all investment dollars combined because of valuation in other words his worth is based on the potential return for his share of ownership at a rate based on the latest valuation of the company he is worth $ 17.5 billion today but the total funding for facebook is only $ 2.4 billion i do n't understand this in private companies valuations typically come from either speculation analysts or from investments   investment valuations are the better gauge because actual money traded hands for a percentage ownership however just as with public companies on the stock market there are at least two caveats just because someone else sold their shares at a given rate does n't mean that rate in both cases it 's possible the value may be much lower or much higher   some high value purchases surprise for how high they are such as microsoft 's acquisition of skype for $ 8.5 billion the formula for one owner 's worth based on a given acquisition is valuation = acquisition amount acquisition percent worth = owner 's percent × valuation according to wikipedia zuckerberg owns 24   in january goldman 's invested $ 500 million at a $ 50 billion valuation that is the latest investment and puts zuckerberg 's worth at $ 12 billion however some speculation places a facebook ipo at a much higher valuation such as as $ 100 billion   i do n't know what your reference is for $ 17 billion but it puts their valuation at $ billion between the january goldman valuation and current ipo speculation for instance originally invested $ 10,000 which at his estimated 5 ownership would now be worth $ 3 5 billion

this comment might sound like a circle jerk but i think it 's important to say indeed innovation is what creates more productivity which is fueled by debt but debt is fueled by real savings which comes from under consuming which is easier when your productivity is higher the government can stimulate innovation yes but only at the expense of someone else    what 's really scary is the federal reserve has been manufacturing all the savings for nearly a decade now so there 's a complete mismatch between credit and savings and the overall economy the actual price of money itself is manufactured too so just about all asset prices are inherently flawed in my view    i think it 's important to piggy back your point about innovation and how productivity ca n't really go down because inventions and new methods of producing goods do n't we come up with the engine or a new drug for example it 's now here forever ideally it 's work that we do n't have to do all over again   what brings on a crash or feeling like we 're going backwards in terms of progress comes when we somehow manage to go through a boom bust like in 2008 but then take on all this debt normally we can pay off debt but when the government manufactures it and credit is created out of nothing that 's when you get into problems like not being able to pay it back because it was n't truly real or representative of real savings i feel like i 'm ranting now but i think this stuff is super important and i think you understand it

as i understand it if the borrower puts a down payment of 20 and the bank puts down 80 then the bank and the borrower own the home jointly as   tenants in common with a split of the asset amongst them the   borrower moves into the home and pays the bank 80 of the fair rental   value of the home each month   material added changed in edit for the purposes of illustration suppose that the borrower and the bank agree that the fair rental per month is 0.5 of the purchase cost the   borrower pays 80 of that amount i.e. 0.4 of the purchase cost   to the bank on a monthly basis   the borrower is not required to do   so but may choose to pay more money than this 0.4 of the purchase cost each month or pay some amount in a lump sum if he does so he will own a larger percentage of the house and so future monthly payments will be a smaller fraction of the agreed upon fair rental per month so there is an incentive to pay off the bank if and when the house is sold the sale price is divided between borrower and bank according to the percentage of ownership as of the date of sale so the bank gets to share in the profits if any on the other hand if the house is sold for less than the original purchase price then the bank also suffers in the loss it is not a case of a mortgage being paid off from the proceeds and the home owner gets whatever is left or even suffering a loss when the dust has settled the bank gets only its percentage of the sale price even if this amount is less than what it put up in the first place minus any additional payments made by the borrower i have no idea how other costs of home ownership property taxes insurance repair and maintenance or improvements additions etc are handled ditto what happens on schedule a if   such a loan is made to a us taxpayer

mrchrister 's answer is just plain wrong your history of carrying debt or paying interest has nothing to do with your credit score the biggest factors are payment history debt to available credit ratio and length of credit history if you have active credit accounts for 5 years have 10 15k in limits on credit cards and put gas and groceries on a credit card that is paid in full each month you 'll have a top notch credit rating there is no way to tell from a credit report whether you carry a balance for pay in full anyone who gets into debt to improve a credit score is ignorant of the process if you have bad credit here 's how you improve it

there are many situations where injecting a certain amount of cash at the right time may reap rewards far in excess of the value of the cash injected for example if someone who needs a car to get to work gets in a wreck and that person does not have ready money to make it may have no choice but to secure very expensive financing   receipt of $ 1000 in ready money to repair the car may thus save the person from having to take out a loan that would cost $ 1200 or more to repay while the insurance business has sufficient overhead that it is unlikely that insurance would generally have a positive net expectation even considering such factors it is at least theoretically possible that insurance could have a positive expected value for both the insurer and the insured and in some cases it may have positive expected values for both parties in practice as well

this is a speculative question and there 's no correct answer but there are definitely some highly likely outcomes let 's assume that the united states defaults on it 's debt it can be guaranteed that it will lose its aaa rating although we do n't know what it will drop to we know it will be aa or lower   a triple a rating implies that the issuer will never default so it can offer lower rates since there is a guarantee of safety there people will demand a higher yield for the lower perceived security so treasury yield will go up   the us dollar or at least forex rates will almost certainly fall since us treasuries will no longer be a safe haven the dollar will no longer be the safe currency it once was and so the dollar will fall the us stock market and international markets will also have a strong fall because so many institutions financial or otherwise invest in treasuries so when treasuries tumble and the us loses triple a investments will be hurt and the tendency is for investors to overreact so it is almost guaranteed that the market will drop sharply financial stocks and companies that invest in treasuries will be hurt the most a notable exception is nations themselves for example china holds over $ 1 trillion in treasuries and a us default will hurt their value but the yuan will also appreciate with respect to the dollar thus other nations will benefit and be hurt from a us default now many people expect a double dip recession worse than the crisis if the us defaults i count myself a member of this crowd nonetheless we can not say with certainty whether or not there will be another recession or even a depression we can only say that a recession is a strong possibility so basically let 's pray that washington gets its act together and raises the ceiling or else we 're in for bad times and lastly a funny quote i could end the deficit in 5 minutes    you just pass a law that says that    anytime there is a deficit of more    than 3 of gdp all sitting members of    congress are ineligible for       warren buffett

i can say from personal experience that as an employee i would prefer a system like this for determining pay scale i had a situation happen to me that was similar to the driver analogy in the article i had been at a software company for a little while and they were always hiring with a chronic shortage of talent finally they hired some new guys but still had open positions one of the new guys who came on was making a full $ 15k more in salary than me for doing the exact same and no he was n't a lead sr or anything like that no matter how i tried to not let this get to me it was hard not to let it affect my morale and i finally ended up leaving the company    so yeah i 'm sure guys like would say it 's my fault for not negotiating a better salary but since that 's impossible due to the bureaucracy in most jobs the fact is that the best way to negotiate a better salary is usually to just look elsewhere

it depends on how much diversification you think you need and what your mutual fund options are for instance picking an index fund already provides a fair amount of diversification especially if you select a total market type of index readily available from fidelity and vanguard and many other fund families are you looking to balance domestic vs. international investments you may want to add an international index fund to the mix feel that a particular sector has tremendous potential add a sector fund this investment mix is up to you or your investment advisor however depending on your roth ira mutual fund choices some of these funds may have minimum investment requirement $ 3k to open a fund 's account for instance in that case you 'd have no choice but to put your entire investment into one fund and wait for subsequent years where you 'd be able to invest in other funds after providing additional contributions and/or any growth from your initial investment one thing to look at is whether you have an option of putting some of your contributions into a money market account within the roth ira you can then reallocate funds from that account into another fund after you can meet the minimum investment requirement however in my opinion if you start out by investing in a solid low cost index fund from a reputable mutual fund company you 've already picked up most of the diversification you need a single fund is enough

i strongly suggest you read up the option greeks you can be right about a stocks price movement and still not make money b c other factors come into play from time or volatility for a free option hedge you can look at collars buying puts and selling calls to offset the debit you pay for the transaction ex aapl is 115 you buy the 110 puts and sell the 120 calls this gives you a collar around he current price your hedged below 110 and can still participate in upside move to 120 also look into time value time decays exponentially in the last 30 days if you are long this hurts you if you are this is good be sure to take this into account delta relation of the option to the underlying stock move on a .01 1 scale .50 is normal deep in the money options have higher deltas it is possible other factors can offset this delta move this is why people will lose money on earnings plays even though they are right   ex say you buy an aapl call at 120 earnings comes out and the stock goes to 121 even though you are in the money your contract may still have less value than what you paid because of volatility collapse the market place knows earnings move a stock and that is factored into the price of the options expected volatility as mentioned watch out for dividend dates always be aware of dividend dates and earnings dates and if your contract is going to cover one of these events interest rates have an effect as well but since the fed has near 0 rates there is little impact at the present though this could certainly change if the fed starts raising rates research the black scholes pricing model whenever you trade always think about what the other guys is thinking sometimes we forget their is someone else on the other side of my trade that thinks essentially the exact opposite of me its a zero sum game as far as choosing strikes you can look at calculating the at the money straddle to see if the options are cheap stock price implied volatility for 30 60 90 days depending on your holding period sq root of days to expiration 19 which is sq root of days yr add and subtract this number to the current stock price to give you an approximate 1 standard deviation of expected price movement keeping with our example aapl at 115 lets say your formula spits out a 6 therefore price range is expected to be 109 to 121 for the time period helpful for selling options i would sell the   call or the 108 puts hope this helps start small and get a feel for things

i 'm going to give a simpler answer than some of the others although somewhat more limited the complicated loan parameters you describe benefit the lender   i 'll focus on this part of your question you should be able to pay back whenever what 's the point of an arbitrary timeline here you refers to the borrower   sure yes it would be great for the borrower to be able to do whatever they want whenever they want increasing or decreasing the loan balance by paying or not paying arbitrary amounts at their whim   but it does n't benefit the lender to let the borrower do this   adding various kinds of restrictions and extra conditions to the loan reduces the lender 's uncertainty about when they 'll be receiving money and also gives them a greater range of legal recourse to get it sooner since they can pursue the borrower right away if they violate any of the conditions rather than having the wait until they die without having paid their debt then you say and if you want you can set a legal deadline but the mere deadline in the contract does n't affect how much interest is paid the interest is only affected by how much money is borrowed and how long has passed i think in many cases that is in fact how it works or at least it is more how it works than you seem to think   for instance you can take out a 30-year loan but pay it off in less than 30 years and the amount you pay will be less if you pay it off sooner   however in some cases the lender will charge you a penalty for doing so   the reason is the same as above if you pay off the loan sooner you are paying less interest which is worse for the lender   again it would be nice for the borrower if they could just pay it off sooner with no penalty but the lender has no reason to let them do so i think there are in fact other explanations for these more complicated loan terms that do benefit the borrower   for instance an amortization schedule with clearly defined monthly payments and proportions going to interest and principal also reduces the borrower 's uncertainty and makes them less likely to do risky things like skip lots of payments intending to make it up later   it gives them a clear number to budget from   but even aside from all that i think the clearest answer to your question is what i said above in general it benefits the lender to attach conditions and parameters to loans in order to have many opportunities to penalize the borrower for making it hard for the lender to predict their cash flow

gift taxes kick in at around $ 13 k per giver per recipient per year that means that a straight up gift of $ 200 k as cash or a house will incur a tax it is possible however that if the father has a spouse he and the spouse could each give the mother and each child the full gift limit for a total of about $ 78 k per year and that money could be used by all 3 of them to buy the house jointly over a couple of years i think the children would have to be on the title since part of the gift money would be theirs and one is an adult as far as lending the money my in laws are our mortgage lenders and when we structured the loan it had to be at a market rate which could be the lowest advertised rate we found for a fixed rate mortgage independent of what we might actually qualify for or we could not deduct interest payments forgiving the loan could also be considered a gift so they would need to keep an audit trail showing that payments were made and her father would need to declare the interest income on his taxes if he bought the house as a second home and let her and her children live there rent free it might work but i 'm not sure it would in that case be an asset of his estate when he dies i do n't know anything about structuring it as a trust free rent could conceivably also be construed as a gift subject to the limits stated above disclaimer not a tax professional

and specifically regarding prices of housing what factors drive prices in that regard i mean the houses are roughly the same but almost 3 times as expensive rent like so many things is tied to supply and demand on the demand side rent is tied to income people tend to buy as much house as they can afford given that mortgage interest is deductible and public schools financed through property tax performs better in valuable neighborhoods raise the minimum wage and economists expect rents to go up accordingly when employers and pensions offer cola adjustments it feeds into a price loop during the past ten years there was also some animal spirits irrational behavior present people feared that if they did n't buy now home prices would outpace their growth in income so even though it did n't make sense at the time they bought because it would make even less sense later if you assume prices only go up there 's also the whole california has nicer weather angle to explain why people move to sf or la on the supply side it 's all about housing stock in your old town you could find vacant lots or farmland in less than 5 minute 's drive from anywhere there 's far less room for growth in say the sf bay area or nyc there 's also building codes that restrict the growth in housing stock i 'm told co is one such place you would think that high prices would discourage people from moving or working there but between the university and the defense contractors they seem to have an iron grip on the market have you ever seen a cartoon where a character gets a huge bill at a restaurant and their eyes shoot out of their eye and they faint yeah that 's how i felt looking at some of the places around here remember restaurants have to cover the same rent problem you do and they have higher minimum wages and taxes etc moreover food has to be imported from miles away to feed the city likely even from out of state in california there 's also food regulations that in effect raise the prices if people are footing those higher bills i would n't be surprised if they 're racking up debt in the process and dodging the collectors calling about their lexus or taking out home equity loans to cover their lifestyle

these have the potential to become end of the world scenarios so i 'll keep this very clear if you start to feel that any particular investment may suddenly become worthless then it is wise to liquidate that asset and transfer your wealth somewhere else if your wealth happens to be invested in cash then transferring that wealth into something else is still valid   digging a hole in the ground is n't useful and running for the border probably wo n't be necessary consider countries that have suffered actual currency collapse and debt default   take zimbabwe for example   even as inflation went into the millions of percent the zimbabwe stock exchange soared as investors were prepared to spend ever more of their devaluing currency to buy stable stocks in a small number of locally listed companies even if the euro were to suffer a critical fall european companies would probably be ok if you did n't panic and dig in the back garden over the fall of dotcom there is no need to panic over the decline of certain currencies   just diversify your risk and buy non cash or euro assets update a few ideas re diversification the problem for greece is n't really a euro problem it is local local property local companies these can be affected by default because no one believes in the entirety of the greek economy not just the currency it happens to be using so diversification really means buying things that are outside greece

my experience is in economics so it may differ from an accounting or personal finance perspective somewhat that being said i find it perfectly acceptable to use a term like cagr when the rate is positive or negative economists talk about negative growth rates all the time and it 's universally assumed that growth rates can be positive or ideally the actual magnitude and sign of the value should be specified by the value itself the term whether it 's growth rate some modified version of it like cagr or any label in a table or on a graph should describe the calculation or source used obtain the value i should n't need the name to indicate the sign of the number if the number is present the name is only there to help me understand the value unfortunately i do n't know of any specific term that represents the geometric averaging nature of cagr and also eliminates the minor potential for semantic confusion however i think the minor problem of semantics needs to be balanced against the tradeoff of using a different term that is n't as common if one were to exist cagr is a standard well known term that a allows someone who is familiar with the term to instantly understand the procedure you 're using and b allow someone who is n't familiar with it to quickly search and find an explanation since searching for cagr will numerous simple explanations of how it 's calculated 1 this is different from the concept of economic growth which is usually assumed to be positive in informal discussions in economic modeling many of the first steps in creating a model are symbolic anyway so growth rate change in output and economic growth are used interchangeably to describe changes in gdp because the values either are n't known irrelevant until later in the project or pulled from data that describes it using one or several of the previously stated terms

if this matters to you a lot i agree you should leave my primary bank account raised chequing account and transaction fees i left when i was closing my account the teller asked for the reason they needed to fill out a form and i explained it was the monthly fees eventually if a bank gets enough of these they will change i want to get back those features for the same price it cost when i opened it they are in their rights to cancel features or raise prices just as you are in your rights to withdraw if they do n't give you a deal the reason why i mention this is that this approach is comical in some instances a grocery store may raise the price of carrots typically you either deal with it or change stores prices rise occasionally thus they will lose a lot of money from my savings from my understanding a bank makes a large chunk of their money from fees very little is from the floating kitty they can have because of your savings if you have an investment account with your bank not recommended or your mortgage that would matter more i 've had friends who have left banks and moved their mortgages because of the bank not giving them a better rate does the manager have any pressure into keeping the account to the point of giving away free products to keep the or they do n't really care depends i 've probably say no one data point is an anecdote it is expected in a client base of thousands that a few will leave for seemingly random reasons only if mass amounts of clients leave or complain will the manager or company care a note some banks waive monthly account or service fees if you keep a minimal account balance i have one friend who keeps x thousand in his bank account to save the account fee he budgets a month ahead of time and savings account rates are 0 so this costs him nothing

you get to keep the money if and only if you confirm with both parties the loan and the mattress companies that you received a refund twice and both parties agree that they know that with no and they both agree to let you keep it   in writing   and even then it might be depending on amounts generally speaking you should not consider the money yours   it was refunded in error after all   and it would have made more sense to confirm your communication before you deposited it and you maybe should n't have moved it into savings either that looks kinda like keeping the money unavailable   planning to keep it or even just keep it till the shoe drops looks an awful lot like fraud   as in the crime   taking or keeping money that does n't belong to you when you know it does n't belong to you is stealing    since you know you got the payment in error it is your responsibility to make at minimum a reasonable effort to make sure the money goes where it was intended to go and by reasonable effort i mean roughly what kind of effort the companies should put in in your view if the error had worked out the other way with neither paying you back    at what point if any should they consider the money theirs in the reversed situation depending on the amount involved and the companies attitudes it is possible not necessarily likely but possible that each company will hear your story and respond confirmed in writing that they have no problem letting you keep the payment from their company   in the companies view this might be about how much it would cost to recoup the amount and is thus more likely for very small amounts or else writing off the cost for customer service or pr if both companies do this you have the money free and clear   but i would not depend on this companies have just as much reason to want money as you do especially when belongs to them

that of arbitrage free pricing sounds a bit like the relative vs. fundamental approaches to asset pricing that cochrane outlines in his text asset pricing also makes this distinction with regard to term structure models in volatility and    on one extreme you have capm style models in which asset prices are completely determined by investors risk preferences on the other extreme you would have something like a sabr libor market model where you take everything up to and including the volatility surface as given    what 's interesting to me is the way in which these different classes of models get used in various parts of the financial industry so buy side firms tend to rely a lot more on equilibrium style models since they ultimately care about things like how the equity risk premium or the bond risk premium affect asset prices in contrast derivatives quants working at a big sell side bank who are pricing exotics do n't care about what the fundamental value of their underlying assets is they just take that as given and price the exotic accordingly

i was asking myself the exact same thing   and i have come to the conclusion that most of your money should be invested in index etfs and maybe some bond etfs too   if inflation is about 2 and the interest you make in a savings account is less than 1   your actually loosing money in a savings account   keep a few thousand bucks in your savings account and the majority invested and working for you

if you budget for cloths and save up the money you may be able to take advantage of sales when they are on    however only buy what you will use you need to ask yourself what value you put on cloths compared to other things you can spend the money on    also would you rather have money in the bank you need it rather than lots of cloths in the wardrobe

i think this is off topic but here is a stab so these are cashless   it could be a way to smooth out the harsh reality of capitalism i my product i have more capacity than i can sell and i can trade those good to other capitalists who similarly poorly planned production or capacity therefore the market for a system like is limited to businesses that do not plan well   business that plan production or capacity to levels they can already sell for cash do not need a private system to offload goods alternatives to such a system include i do n't know how many businesses are really in this over production over capacity state   if my assumption that it is n't many is wrong my answer is garbage this is a bartering system with a brokerage   i think we have historically found that common currencies create more trade and economic activity because the value of the note in your pocket which is the same type of note in my pocket is common and understood   exchange rates typically slow down trade   there are many other reasons to have different currency or notes on a global sale but the exchange certainly is a hurdle to clear this brokerage is essentially adding a new currency in a grand metaphor   and that new currency is only spendable on their brokerage which is of limited use to society as a whole assuming that society as a whole is n't a participating member of that brokerage i ca n't really think of why this type of exchange is better than the current system we have now   i would n't invest in this as a business or invest in this as a person looking for opportunity

one thing you did n't mention is whether the 401(k offers a match if it does this is a slam dunk the $ $ right is $ that will be doubled on deposit it 's typical for the first 5 of one 's salary to capture the match so this is right there   in 15 years you 'll still owe $ but 15 $ is $ in your 401(k even without taking any growth into account the likely value of that 401(k is closer to $ 210 k using 8 over that 15 years at 6 it drops to only $ k but as i stated the value of the match is so great that i 'd jump right on that if you do n't get a match of any kind i need to edit completely rip my answer it into whether you feel that 15 years really 30 the market will exceed the 4 cost of that money odds are it will the worst 15 year period this past century 2000 2014 still had a cagr of 4.2

thanks for the info things are starting to make more sense now for some reason i 've always neglected learning about investments now that i m in a position to invest and am still fairly young i 'm motivated to start learning    as for help with td ameritrade i was looking into index funds as another commenter mentioned that i should on their site and am a little overwhelmed with the options first i 'm looking at mutual funds going to symbol lookup and using type = i 'm assuming that 's the same thing as an index fund but since the language is slightly different i 'm not 100 sure however at that point i need some kind of search for a symbol in order to see any results makes sense but i do nt know where to start looking for good index funds     so my first question is if i find a good mutual fund is it correct to simply go to buy mutual funds and find it from there and if so my second question is how do i find a good mutual fund    my goal is to have my money in something that will likely grow faster than a savings account i do n't mind a little volatility i can afford to lose my investment i 'd plan on leaving my money in the fund for a several years at least    my last question is when investing in these types of funds or please point me in another direction if you think index funds are n't the place for me to start should i be reinvesting in the funds or having them pay out dividends i would assume that reinvesting is the smart choice but i can imagine situations that might change that in order to mitigate risk and as i 've said a few times in this thread including the title i 'm a complete amateur so my assumptions are n't necessarily worth that much    thanks for the help i really appreciate all the info so far

if illinois can not go bankruptcy this is missing a few very important words under current law    the united states changed the law so as to allow puerto rico to go into a form of bankruptcy   so you can not rely on a lack of legal support for bankruptcy to protect any bond investments you might make in illinois   it is entirely possible for the federal government to add a law enabling a state to discharge its debts through a bankruptcy process   that 's why the bonds have been downgraded   they are still fine now but that could change at any time    i do n't want to dive too deep into the politics on this stack but i could quite easily see a bargain between us president donald trump and democrats in congress where he agreed to special privileges for pension debts owed to former employees in exchange for full discharge of all other debts   that would lead to a complete loss of value for the bonds that you are considering   there still seem to be other options now but they seem to be getting closer and closer to that

simply put you can not beat the market if by being informed and following all relevant news you can arrive at the conclusion that company a will likely outperform company b in the future then having a stocks should be better than having b stocks or any e.g. index based mix of them but as the whole market has access to the very same information and will arrive at the same conclusion provided it is logically sound everybody will want a stocks which thus become expensive to the point where the expected return is average again   your only options of winning this race are to be the very first to have the important information insider trade or to arrive at different logical conclusions than the rest of the world which boils down do making decisions that are not logically sound good luck with that or assuming that almost everybody else is not logically sound go figure

this is way too long for a comment so i am posting this as an answer my bet is that you 're buying a new piano it is the only instrument that makes sense the rest of this answer are going to assume this but this should apply well if you 're going after a or for example for those readers that do not know a piano is a very delicate and expensive music instrument my piano is literally more expensive than my car there are a lot of similarities in sales negotiation between buying a piano and buying a car you may be surprised to know that the cost for the dealer to acquire a piano is only around half the listed price therefore the salesperson has a lot of room to negotiate a sale price to you this explains why he was able to make a good offer for the model you are not intending to buy you are best by comparing the final sale price with other similar models in your region or the exact model around your region which you have already did those indicate the standard price in your negotiation you described the dealer had the exact model you desire only in different appearance i assume you want a black color while they have a white or wood pattern one in their showroom note every piano is different even with the exact same model there will be very slight differences in the tune and touch since some processes are hand finished if you 're buying a treat each of them as an individual hand crafted art play the exact instrument you will be buying before closing the deal if they do not have your desired model in the showroom ask for a visit to their inventory facility again play the exact instrument not a showroom model some dishonest dealers will have their showroom regulated and tuned differently than the standard from shipping if you get an extremely good offer proceed with caution there may be defects in that particular instrument look for rust or layers on the strings look for in the hammers listen to clicking when playing the keys these are signs that the instrument has been around for quite a while and they can not sell it you can also copy down the serial number and look up the manufacturing date online before you close the deal ask for after sale services how many free will they provide will they polish your piano after delivery these are bargain chips you can use for final adjustment of the price

a couple options that i know of interactive brokers offers a paper trading mode to its account holders that allows you to start with a pretend stack of money and place simulated trades to test trading ideas they also provide an api that allows you to interface with their platform for retrieving quotes placing orders and the such as you noted however it 's not free you must hold a funded brokerage account in order to qualify for access to their platform in order to maintain an account there are minimums for required equity and monthly activity measured in dollars that you spend on commissions so you wo n't get access to their platform without having a decent amount of skin in the game ib 's native api is java based is an unofficial wrapper that makes the interface available in python i 've not used ib at all myself but i 've heard good things about their api and its accessibility via edit ib now supports python via their published api so using is no longer needed unless you wish to use python the officially supported api is based on python 3 td ameritrade also offers an api that is usable by its brokerage clients they do not offer any such paper trading mode so you would need to execute transactions based on quotes at the corresponding trade times and then keep track of your simulated account history yourself the api supports quote retrieval price history and trade execution among other functions tda might be more attractive than ib if you 're looking for a low cost link into market data as i believe their minimum equity levels are lower to get access you 'll need to sign up for an api developer account which i believe requires an nda i do n't believe there is an official python implementation of the api but if you 're a capable python writer you should n't have trouble up to the published interfaces some caveats as when doing any strategy backtesting you 'll want to be sure to be pessimistic when doing so so your optimism does n't make your trades look more successful than they would be in the real world at a minimum you 'll want to ensure that your simulations transact at the posted bid ask prices not necessarily the last trade 's price as well as any commissions and fees associated with the trade a more robust scheme would also take into account the depth of the order book also known as level 2 quotes which can cause additional slippage in the prices at which you buy sell your security an even more robust scheme would take into account the potential latency of trade execution looking at all prices over some time period that covers the maximum expected latency and simulating the trade at the worst possible price

live with your beloved poor for a year   hahaha there is a housing project directly across the street from me as i write this you keep making assumptions   yes there absolutely is a culture of laziness and irresponsibility there are a lot of reasons that the poor remain poor and this is only one of them other reasons include the drug war which disproportionately targets minorities and creates a vast unemployable population due to their criminal records the school systems are shit how can you raise yourself out of poverty without a decent education unions have declined meaning working class people no longer have a living wage and must rely on food stamps and other government programs just to survive there are a lot of reasons the poor stay poor blaming it all on bad choices is rather short sighted there are public sector private sector and cultural factors contributing to wealth inequality i will admit to all of these but the libertarian ideology only allows for one   plus what are you going to do about it does society have any responsibility to help people who are trapped in a cycle of poverty and bad choices to better themselves what about the newborn child who has made no bad choices but to be born poor fuck 'em   gt;any actual of reality   make one you state no facts only that if there were some facts they would agree with you not a proper argument   gt;the rich are rich for a reason and the poor are poor for a reason   the rich are rich for many reasons personal achievement inheritance luck connections and simply reaping the fruits of a prosperous society there just as many reasons the poor are poor to take any one reason and say that is the only reason is just like taking the idea of property rights and saying that is the only right worth consideration   down inside you do n't think you 've earned it so you want to sacrifice all the rest of us on the of your limp weakness   i do n't attempt to you though i could probably do a much better job having once held the beliefs you are espousing the thing is i learned from my experience and from the world around me i see how the system is rigged in both the public sector and private sector i know it is possible to make it rich in this country if you have the skill and motivation but i also know that it is much easier to stay rich if you are born rich and far too much depends on who you know rather than what you know and nobody would be rich if we did n't have a functioning society with a large middle class that can afford to buy the goods that entrepreneurs invent   as a business owner i want to live in a society where the majority of people can afford the crap that i 'm peddling call me a commie

yes quite easily in fact   you left a lot of numbers out so lets start with some assumptions if you are at the median of middle income families in the us that might mean $ 15 of that is an investment of $ per month if you invest that amount monthly and assume a 6 return then you will have a million dollars at approximately 57 years old 6 is a very conservative number and as ben miller points out the s&p 500 has historically returned closer to 11 if you assumed an aggressive 9 return and continued with that $ for 40 years until you turn 65 that becomes $ 4 million start with a much more conservative $ 9/hr for $ per year 40 hours 52 weeks no overtime if that person saved 14 of his her income or about $ per month from 25 to 65 years old with the same 9 they would still achieve $ 1 million for retirement is it much harder for a poor person certainly but hopefully these numbers illustrate that it is better to save and invest even a small amount if that 's all that can be done high income earners have the most to gain if they save and the most to lose if they do n't let 's just assume an even $ salary and modest 401(k match of 3 even married filing jointly a good portion of that salary is going to be taxed at the 25 rate if single you 'll be hitting the 28 income tax rate   if you can max out the $ 18,000 2017 contribution limit and get an additional $ 3,000 from an employer match for a total monthly contribution of $ 40 years of contributions would become $ million with the 9 rate of return   if you withdrew that money at 4 per year you would have a residual income of $ 300k throughout your retirement

no there are additional factors involved note that the shares on issue of a company can change for various reasons such as conversion redemption of convertible securities vesting of restricted employee shares conversion of employee options employee stock purchase programs share placements buybacks mergers rights issues etc so it is always worthwhile checking sec announcements for the company if you want an exact figure   there may also be multiple classes of shares and preferred securities that have different levels of dividends present for they filed a 10q on 22 april 2015 and noted they had shares outstanding of their common stock   they also noted for the three months ended march 31 2014 that dividends were paid to both common stockholders and preferred stockholders and that there were series a preferred stock 3 million and series b preferred stock 10 million plus a statement in february 2015 our board of directors authorized a share repurchase program of up to $ million of our outstanding common stock shares repurchased under these programs are accounted for as treasury stock carried at cost and reflected as a reduction to equity therefore the exact amount of dividend paid out will not be known until the next quarterly report which will state the exact amount of dividend paid out to common and preferred shareholders for the quarter

slippage is tied to volatility so when volatility increases the spread will also increase there is no perfect formula to figure out slippage but from observations it might make sense to look at the bar size in relation to previous bars to determine slippage assuming fixed periods this is because when there is a sudden spike in price it 's usually due to stop order triggering or a news event and those will increase the volatility dramatically in seconds
