a lot of stores especially smaller ones wo n't accept card payments under $ 10.00 they pay a fee for taking cards and for small transactions it is not worth it
# 551845
etiquette or not it is hurting the seller the transaction fees have usually minimums so if the actual transaction is below the minimum they 'll pay larger fee on the transaction relatively as an example assume minimum fee for a debit card swipe is 20 cents or 2 of the transaction for a transaction of $ 10 and above the fee will be 2 of the transaction but for $ the fee becomes 12 of the transaction 6 times more expensive for the seller basically the sale was most likely at a loss for them they usually have very low margins especially for a dollar store so take that into account as well
# 108012
etiquette does n't really come into the picture here the business offers a service and i choose to accept it personally i use my debit card as much as possible for every transaction i record it in my checkbook then when i do reconciling i know exactly how much i paid for various categories of stuff good for budgeting most often my purchases are over $ 10 but when they are n't i have no qualms about using the card
# 560557
generally i consider it bad etiquette to inconvenience others    i would recommend cash for small purchases try to offer as close to the required amount as possible   do n't pay with several dollars worth of change if you can avoid it you should n't need to carry a lot of cash   when you do do n't make it obvious
# 384145
intellectually and logically it should n't bother me for a second to charge something for a buck   it 's a losing proposition for the merchant but their immediate business costs should be of little concern to me   they 're making a choice to sell that item to me at that price and by accepting that means of payment right   but the more i charge as opposed to paying cash the more cash back i get in my old ish age i 've gotten a little and will pay cash more often for smaller amounts because i understand the business costs but it 's not a matter of caring what other people think accepting credit cards or not is a business decision   it 's usually a good one   but with that decision come the rules which up until about a year ago meant that merchants could n't set a minimum charge amount   now that 's not the case merchant account providers can no longer demand that their merchant clients accept all charges though they are allowed to set a minimum amount that is no lower than $ 10.00 in the end it 's a matter of how much you 're willing to pay in order to influence people 's thinking of you because the business financial benefits of doing one or the other are pretty clear
# 488127
i would like to offer a different perspective here   the standard fee for a credit card transaction is typically on the order of 30 cents + 2.5 of the amount the actual numbers vary but this is the ballpark this makes small charges frequently unprofitable for small merchants because of this they will often have minimum purchase requirements for credit debit card payments the situation changes for large retailers think wal mart target safeway home depot i can not find a citation for this right now but large retailers are able to negotiate volume discounts from credit card companies a guy who used to work in finance at home depot told me this once their transaction fees are much lower than 30 cents + 2.5 but you get the same reward points on your credit card debit card regardless of where you swipe it so my personal philosophy is large chain swipe away without guilt for any amount small merchant use cash unless it 's hundreds of dollars and then they may give you a cash discount in that case and make sure to carry enough cash for such situations when i was a student that was about $ 20 enough for coffee or lunch at a small place
# 7603
personally i think it 's a bad practice because ultimately using cards for such minuscule transactions raises costs for everyone especially at merchants whose average transaction is small how does carrying cash improve your personal security if someone is going to mug you they do not know in advance whether you have money or not
# 213236
i do n't carry cash at all unless i know i 'm going somewhere which requires it this includes going to the corner shop for some milk or going to other countries for a week cards are easier for me if a merchant wants my business they will take my money through whatever means they can i do n't think etiquette comes into it
# 438748
it 's fine   some people including myself charge any amount no matter how small i think charging small amounts is encouraged by no longer having to sign for small amounts not sure if this is state by state though    somewhere the transfering of digital money is being paid for either in the merchant fees an atm fee or my time in going to a bank or atm where i will not be charged a fee
# 183839
until the card act credit card rules required that merchants had no minimum purchase requirement to use a card new rules permit a minimum but it must be clearly posted   update stores can now refuse small credit card charges is an excellent article which clarifies the rules it appears that these rules apply to credit not debit cards so to be clear the minimum do not apply to the op as he referenced using a debit card   superiority hm i 'd be a bit embarrassed to charge such small amounts although when cash in my wallet is very low i may have little choice note and disclaimer i am 48 30 years ago when i started using cards there were no pos machines credit card transactions had a big device that got a card imprint and the merchant looked up to see if your card was stolen in a big book they got weekly monthly times have changed and debit cards may be faster especially if with cash you give the cashier $ for a $ transaction but the guy entered $ 5 already this often takes a manager to clear up

as a landlord for 14 years with 10 properties i can give a few pointers be able and skilled enough to perform the majority of maintenance because this is your biggest expense otherwise   it will shock you how much maintenance rental units require do n't invest in real estate where the locality state favors the tenant e.g. new york city in disputes   a great state is florida where you can have someone evicted very quickly require a minimum credit score of 620 for all tenants over 21   this seems to be the magic number that keeps most of the nightmare tenants out makes sure they have a job nearby that pays at least three times their annual rent every renewal adjust your tenant 's rent to be approximately 5 less than going rates in your area   use zillow as a guide   keeping just below market rates keeps tenants from moving to cheaper options do not rent to anyone under 30 and single   trust me trust me trust me   you ca n't legally do this officially but do it while offering another acceptable reason for rejection there 's always something you could say that 's legitimate bad credit or chose another tenant etc charge a 5 late fee starting 10 days after the rent is due   20 days late file for eviction to let the tenant know you mean business do n't sink yourself too much in debt put enough money down so that you start profitable   i made the mistake of burying myself and i have n't barely been able to breathe for the entire 14 years   it 's just now finally coming into profitability do n't get adjustable rate or balloon loans under any circumstances   fixed 30 only   you can pay it down in 20 years and get the same benefits as if you got a fixed 20 but you will want the option of paying less some months so get the 30 and treat it like a 20 do n't even try to find your own tenants   use a realtor and take the 10 cost hit   they actually save you money because they can show your place to a lot more prospective tenants and it will be rented much sooner   empty place = empty wallet   also block out the part of the realtor 's agreement to lease where it states they keep getting the 10 every year thereafter   most realtors will go along with this just to get the first year but if they do n't find another realtor buy all in the same community if you can then you can use the same vendor list the same lease agreement the same realtor the same documentation spreadsheets etc   much much easier to have everything a clone   they say do n't put all your eggs in one basket but the reality is running a bunch of properties is a lot of work and the more similar they are the more you can duplicate your work for free   that 's worth a lot more day to day than the remote chance your entire community goes up in flames

seems to me you do n't have a ton of great choices but of them keep going as you are   if when the car becomes unusable without significant expenses stop using it   buy another junker and use that to get by until your loan is paid off   from now until then put aside a few hundred or whatever you can if more each month towards the anticipated purchase   when you do buy this junker pay in cash no loan   just get something that will take you to work and that includes bike if that 's a possibility   when you can sell the no longer usable car to finish paying off the loan start aggressively paying off the current loan with the eye of getting it down to where you 're not underwater anymore   then sell the car and dispose of the loan and buy a better replacement   scrimp and save and cut everything eat cheaply and never out cut your personal expenses everywhere you can   if you get another $ 250 a month towards principal you can probably be no longer underwater in about a year get a personal loan today for the amount that you 're underwater and immediately sell the car   this gets you out of the loan and car the quickest and if you think the car will devalue significantly between now and when you might be not underwater anymore this might be the best option   but it 's the most expensive likely you 'll pay 12 to 20 on the difference   now 12 of $ 5000 is less than 5 of 15000 so it might actually be a good financial deal but you 'll probably have to shop around to get 12 15 with a 660 though it 's probably possible   you 'll still be without a car at this point though so you 'd have to buy another one or live without for a while and you 'd still have a payment of some sort but perhaps a more manageable one $ 5000 12 5 years means something a bit over $ 100 a month for example i recommend that if you can get by without a car for a while option 2 is your best bet   all of these will require some financial care for a while and probably cutting back on expenses for a year or two but realistically you should n't expect anything else   get a budgeting app if it will help see how to do this as far as getting out of the loan without paying it i do n't recommend that at all   your credit will be ruined for at least seven years and 660 is not bad at all really and then would take   yet more years to recover   you will likely be sued for the balance plus collection costs beyond repossession   the consequences would be far far worse than just paying it off and i mean that financially as well as ethically

according the fscs if the bank fails fscs would refund the maximum under our rules currently £ 75,000 per person   any credit balance over and above this would be offset against the mortgage by the insolvency practitioner responsible for the winding up of the bank fscs would play no part in that process unless the savings were larger than the debts but then it would n't make sense to have them in a zero interest offset account so the money would not be completely lost as such whether that would count as an overpayment is an open question but perhaps a moot point anyway if the bank went under finally arguably a pension or other investment might also be better for such amounts

this will work as intended but there 's another point to consider in the us the tax rate on proceeds from stock sales is higher for short term holdings which are defined as held for less than one year both rates vary based on your income bracket numbers are for fiscal year 2014 filing as single the difference between short and long term capital gains tax in the us is a minimum of ten percentage points and works out to 15 percentage points on average this is substantial if you wo n't be reporting much income the year you move to the us say because you only worked for a portion of the year it is decidedly to your advantage to wait and sell the stocks in the us to get that sweet 0 rate at a minimum you should hold the position for a year if you sell and rebuy from a tax optimization perspective two caveats

credit cards are meant to be used so generally it does n't hurt your credit score to use them   to top it off you even get an interest grace period so you do n't have to rush home and pay balances as soon as they 're charged    in general you accrue charges during your statement period we 'll call it september 1 through september 30   the statement due date is something like 20 days after the close of the statement period so we 'll call it october 20   as long as you pay your entire statement balance by the due date you will never pay interest   you charge your laptop on september 3 it shows up on your statement as $ 1,300 you pay $ 1,300 on october 18 you pay no interest however if you pay $ 1,000 on october 18 leaving a $ 300 balance to be carried in to the next statement period a carried balance you will pay interest   generally interest is calculated based on your average daily balance during the statement period which is now be the october 1 to october 31 period   you 'll notice that you did n't pay anything until the october 18 that means the entire $ 1,300 will be included in your average daily balance up to the 18th of the month   add to that anything else you charge on the card now will be included in your average daily balance for interest charge calculation purposes the moral of the story is use your card and pay your entire statement balance before the due date    now how much will this impact your credit score   it 's tough to say   utilization is not a bad thing until it 's a big number   i 've read that 70 utilization and over is really the point at which lenders will raise an and under 30 is considered excellent if you have one card and $ 1,300 is a significant portion of your available limit then yes you should probably pay it down quickly   spend six or so months using the card and paying it then call your bank and ask for a credit line increase

i think this is a good question with no single right answer   for a conservative investor possible responses to low rates would be probably the best response is somewhere in the middle consider riskier investments for a part of your portfolio but still hold on to some cash and in any case do not expect great results in a bad economy for a more detailed analysis let 's consider the three main asset classes of cash bonds and stocks and how they might preform in a low interest rate environment by stocks i really mean mutual funds that invest in a diversified mixture of stocks rather than individual stocks which would be even riskier   you can use mutual funds for bonds too although diversification is not important for government bonds cash advantages safe in the short term   available on short notice for emergencies disadvantages low returns and possibly inflation although you retain the flexibility to move to other investments if inflation increases bonds advantages somewhat higher returns than cash   disadvantages returns are still rather low and more vulnerable to inflation   also the market price will drop temporarily if rates rise stocks advantages better at preserving your purchasing power against inflation in the long term 20 years or more say   returns are likely to be higher than stocks or bonds on average   disadvantages   price can fluctuate a lot in the short to medium term   also expected returns are still less than they would be in better economic times although the low rates may change the question a little the most important thing for an investor is still to be familiar with these basic asset classes   note that the best risk adjusted reward might be attained by some mixture of the three

is it a gift or a loan either way ask the same lawyer who will do the closing to record a mortgage on the property your mother holds it   you are required to pay her market interest 4 or so should pass irs scrutiny   if it 's truly a loan decide on the payoff time and calculate the payments she 'll have a bit of interest income which will be taxable to her and you might have a write off if you itemize which is unlikely   if it 's a gift since you mentioned gift concerns she can forgive the interest and principal each year to total $ 13 k or file the popular form 709 to declare the whole gift against her $ 1 m unified lifetime gift exclusion which negates the whole mortgage lien thing

there is only one way to create stable income using options write covered calls    this means you must own some stocks which offer an active and liquid option market fb would be good t would be useless in other words you need to own some unstable stocks tickers that have sometimes scary volatility and of course these are not great stocks for a retiree but let 's assume you own 500 shares of fb which you bought in june of 2015 for $ 75     today you could have been paid $ for selling five $ 105 calls your reasoning is   so the rule is only sell covered calls at a price you would be happy to accept     if you follow the rule you 'll generate more or less stable income do not venture off this narrow path into the rest of option land there be dragons      you can select strike prices that are far out of the money to minimize the chance of being exercised and sweeten the deal by collecting an even higher price if the stock flies that high     if you are thinking about doing this study the subject thoroughly until you know the terminology backwards and forwards do n't worry about the greeks since market makers manipulate implied volatility so wildly that it everything else

paying off a loan early is n't a bad thing   having a credit card for 6 months and then closing it is probably unneeded pay it off and then keep it as an emergency card    the key is debt available credit ratio   look at this article for example which explains the different elements the only one you 're affecting here is the second your debt load   if you 're not planning on asking for another loan in the next six months none of this really matters assuming you are paying it off for sure in six months your debt will be gone and your credit score recovered from any hit it takes and if you get a $ 1500 credit card and only put $ 300 on it it might actually improve your credit but having an open $ 1500 credit card with a 0 balance will probably improve your credit rating unless you have a really high amount of available credit   it will improve your debt credit ratio ie total $ you owe divided by total $ you could put on your ccs revolving credit this is all aside from the is it a good idea to borrow money for a 3 month vacation before starting working which the answer is well not exactly   that 's not from a credit perspective just from a living within your means perspective   if you have a firm job that will easily pay off the vacation it 's probably not a bad thing but definitely a certain number of people will take this and end up in spending bad habits that last their life   be aware of that and if you 're just loaning yourself money from the future make sure you understand the terms of that loan and are certain you can pay it off

the title question suggests an answer balance   there are countless stories of who saved their money but led miserable lives   keep in mind you are looking at debt while still earning an income lower than you 'll see after you get your phd do n't add more debt while working towards the phd but do n't think that this is the time to aggressively pay it off either   i 'd look at it this way when you get a full time job money itself will be cheaper it will cost you fewer hours to earn the same number of euros when i was in college the us minimum wage was just over $ but i had an engineering degree and back then a starting salary of over $ 20/hr while still in school my time was precious and the $ 10,000 i borrowed for spending money was 3300 hours that i did n't need to work but it was paid back with just 500 work hours   your question also goes to the future a home purchase there are 2 approaches first pay off the student loan then save for the down payment for many anti debt people this is ideal but if your goal is to be in the house sooner save now for the down payment and only pay the minimum on the loan once you are in the house you can decide to pay the student loan faster but 1.5 i 'd just pay the mortgage faster   i do n't know the cost of housing where you will choose to live but in general i 'd suggest finding the house that you can afford on a 15 year mortgage but take out a 30 this will give you flexibility in your budget life happens and it 's tough to plan for every possible outcome i 'd prefer to have room in the budget for the first years in the house and for potential marriage and the kids that may follow it 's far easier to pay extra on loans than to get lower payments when you realize the budget is too tight   happy to update edit to address any comments you may have

in order to short a stock you have to borrow the number of shares that you 're shorting from someone else who holds the shares so that you can deliver the shares you 're shorting if it becomes necessary to do so usually there 's also naked short selling where you do n't have to do this but it 's banned in a number of jurisdictions including the us if a stock has poor liquidity or is in high demand for shorting then it may well be impossible to find anyone from whom it can be borrowed which is what has happened in this instance

in regards to purchasing full coverage on your car even if you can afford to replace it consider the hassle you have to deal with an accident that is not just the cost   as an example my sister 's car was stolen and wrecked   it was her problem to go recover the car on the other side of the state such that she would not be paying the storage fees imposed by the sheriff of the other county   had she had insurance they would have taken care of it call another story is that i rented a car and side swiped in the parking lot by a hit and run   i was responsible for the minor damage   i started down the path of paying out of pocket because it was small enough that i did not want to submit a claim   the rental car agency started to pile on extra fees such that it was worth it to turn in a claim   my insurance company was savvy enough to be able to dispute the extra charges   after i submitted it to the insurance company i basically did nothing   they took care of everything so in summary when you buy full coverage on your car it is not just a financial decision   it is also about not having to deal with a hassle

yes you could sell what you have and bet against others that the stock price will continue to fall within a period of time shorting   if you 're right your value goes up even though the stock price goes down this is a pretty darn risky bet to make   if you 're wrong there 's no limit to how much money you can owe   at least with stocks they can only fall to zero   when you short and the price goes up and up and up before the deadline you owe it and just as with stocks someone else has to agree to take the bet   if a stock is pretty obviously tanking its unlikely that someone would oppose your bet it 's probably pretty clear that i barely know what i 'm talking about but i was surprised not to see this listed among the answers

to avoid i state up front that this answer is applicable to the us europeans asians canadians etc may well have quite different systems and rules you have nothing to worry about if you pay off your credit card statement   in full on the day it is due in timely fashion on the other hand if you routinely carry a balance from month to month or have taken out cash advances then making whatever payment you want to make that month asap will save you more in finance charges than you could ever earn on the money in your savings account but if you pay off each month 's balance in full then read the fine print about when the payment is due very carefully it might say that payments received before 5 pm will be posted the same day or it might say before 3 pm or before 7 pm est or noon pst etc etc etc as joetaxpayer says if you can pay on line with a guaranteed day for the transaction and you do it before any deadline imposed by the credit card company you are fine   my bank allows me to write electronic checks on its website but a paper check is mailed to the credit card company the bank claims that if i specify the due date they will mail the check enough in advance that the credit card company will get it by the due date but do you really trust the usps to deliver your check by noon or whatever besides the bank will put a hold on that money the day that check is cut i have n't bothered to check if the money being held still earns interest or not   in any case the bank all responsibility for the after effects late payment fees finance charges on all purchases etc if that paper check is not received on time and so your credit card account goes to late payment status   oh and my bank also wants a monthly fee for its billpay service any number   of such electronic checks allowed each month the billpay service does include payment electronically to local merchants and utilities that have accounts at the bank and have signed up to receive payments electronically all my credit card companies allow me to use their website to authorize them to collect the payment that i specify from my bank account(s i can choose the day the amount and which of my bank accounts they will collect the money from but i must do this every month very conveniently they show a calendar for choosing the date with the due date marked prominently and as mhoran_psprep 's comment points out the payment can be scheduled well in advance of the date that the payment will actually be made that is i do n't need to worry about being without internet access because of travel and thus being unable to login to the credit card website to make the payment on   the date it is due i can also sign up for autopay which takes amount minimum payment due payment in full whatever i choose   on the date due and this will happen month after month after month   with no further action necessary on my part   with either choice   it is up to the card company to collect money from my account on the day specified and if they mess up they can not charge late payment fees or finance charge on new purchases etc   also unlike   my bank there are no fees for this service it is also worth noting that many people do not like the idea of the credit card company withdrawing money from their bank account and so this option is not to everyone 's taste

paying off your mortgage early being good is a myth   it is great for the chronic to have their mortgage paid off so when they rack up credit card bills and get behind well they still a place to stay but for those who are more logical with their money paying off your mortgage early in current conditions makes no sense   you can get a 30 year loan well below 4   discounting taxes for your average family you would have a rate floating below 3    so reasons that paying off your mortgage should be almost last given current low long term interest rates the first thing you should do is take care of any high interest debt   i would say that anything more than 7 8 including all credit card debt should be focus 1 putting money into your retirement savings is 1   you will earn way more than 3 over the long run   you can earn a higher return in the market   even with a very conservative portfolio you can clear 5 6 which will still clear more than 3 after taxes for those who say you ca n't be sure about the market well if the market did bad for 30 years in a row no one will have money and the house will also be worthless if a disaster happens to your house and you own it your money is gone   in many cases you would be able to declare bankruptcy and let the bank take the property as is    there are just too many examples but if you are paying off your house early you lose the flexible liquid money that you now have tied up in the house now the reasons for paying down your mortgage are really easy too you do n't trust your spending habits you want to move up in houses and you want to make sure that you have at least 20 down on future house to skip pmi

this equation fails to account for a society 's willingness to create value   if you steal from those who create value and give to those who do not you destroy the engine that creates value in the economy   this redistribution idea is not a new concept and it has already massively failed       gt the government had supplies from the for little or nothing in exchange this led peasants to drastically reduce their crop production according to the official position which is still maintained by some modern marxists the rich peasants kulaks withheld their surplus grain to preserve their   statistics indicate that most of the grain and the other food supplies passed through the   black   the believed peasants were actively trying to undermine the war effort   the black book of communism   asserts that ordered the seizure of the food peasants had grown for their own subsistence and their seed grain in retaliation for this sabotage leading to widespread     gt in july 1929 it remained official soviet policy that the should not be and should be enlisted into the   collective farms   joseph stalin   disagreed with this saying now we have the opportunity to carry out a offensive against the kulaks break their resistance eliminate them as a class and replace their production with the production of     and     gt on 30 january 1930 the     approved the dissolving of kulaks as a class three separate categories for the kulaks were designated the first consisted of kulaks to be sent to the   the second was for kulaks to be to distant parts of the ussr such as the north     and   and the third to other parts of their   gt as part of being forced onto collective farms the were required to their farm animals to government authorities many peasants chose to slaughter their livestock rather than give them to collective farms in the first two months of 1930 peasants killed millions of cattle horses pigs sheep and goats with the meat and being consumed and for instance the soviet party congress reported in 1934 that million head of cattle had been lost and million   in response to the widespread slaughter the     issued to prosecute the malicious slaughtering of livestock   gt stalin requested severe measures to put an end to the resistance in 1930 stalin declared   gt in order to the kulaks as a class the resistance of this class must be in open battle and it must be deprived of the productive sources of its existence and development that is a turn towards the policy of eliminating the kulaks as a class

my credentials i used to work on mortgages about 5 years ago i was n't a loan officer the salesman or mortgage processor the grunt who does the real work but i reviewed their work fairly closely so i 'm not an absolute authority but i have first hand knowledge contrary to the accepted answer yes the bank is obligated to offer you a loan if you meet their qualifications this may sound odd and as though it 's forcing a bank to give money when it does n't want to but there is good reason back in the 1950 's through 1980 's banks tended to deny loans to african americans who were able to buy nicer homes because the loan officer did n't quite feel like they were capable of paying off an expensive house even if they had the exact same history and income as a white person who did get approved after several rounds of trying to fix this problem the government finally that the bank must have a set written criteria by which it will approve or decline loans and the interest rates provided it can change that criteria but those changes must apply to all new customers banks are allowed a bit of discretion to approve loans that they may normally decline but must have a written reason usually it 's due to some relationship with the customer 's business this condition adds a lot of extra rules or that customer has a massive family and all 11 other siblings have gotten loans from the same loan officer random rare stuff that can be easily documented if when the government asks the bank has no discretion to decline a loan at will i 've seen olds sign a 30-year mortgage and the bank was because it showed that they did n't discriminate against the elderly the customer could be a and the bank ca n't turn them down if their paperwork credit and income is good the most the loan officer could do is process the loan slowly and hope the gets arrested before the bank spends any more money the regulations for employees new to the workforce are a bit less wonderful but the bank will want 30 + days of income history 30 days not 4 weeks if you have it but if you are a fresh new employee they can do the loan using your written and signed job offer as proof of income however i discourage you from using this method to buy a house you are much much better off renting for a while and learning the local area before you shop for a house it 's too easy to buy a house without knowing the city then discover that you have a slow drive to work and are in the worst part of town and you may not like the company as much or you may not be a good fit it 's not uncommon to leave a company within a year or two you do n't want a house that anchors you to one place while you need the freedom to explore career options and consider this banks love selling mortgages but they hate holding them they want to collect that $ 10,000 closing fee they could n't care less about the 4 interest trickling in over 30 years once they sign the mortgage they try to sell it to investors who want to buy high grade debt within a month that sale gives them all the money back so they can use it to sell another mortgage and collect another $ 10,000 if the bank has its way it has your mortgage before you send the first payment to them as a result it 's a horrible idea to buy a house unless you expect to live there at least 5 or 10 years because the closing costs are so high

an emergency fund is about managing risk what would you do if your furnace water heater and cars all broke down at the same time being in michigan i can imagine that you would n't want to take cold showers heat the entire house by wood fire and walk to work every day so how do you manage this risk what would happen if you lost your job and could n't find one for a few months by only having $ 5k in the bank in an emergency fund you are putting your family at risk if these sorts of things happened you would be in trouble you would have to borrow money either hurting equity in the home that you have worked hard to build up or by some other means you and your spouse should sit down and decide what a good emergency fund looks like for your family a reserve of 3 6 months of expenses is a good emergency fund this could cover your family in the event of a lost job while you look for a new one it would also cover you when murphy strikes and things break down all at the same time once you and your spouse have determined how much you want to set aside you two must determine how you will get there maybe you put in some extra hours at work maybe you lower the retirement contributions temporarily maybe you try to pay off the car as quickly as possible then put what you were paying on the car into the emergency fund it will likely take a mix of things to get you there you do n't have to get it done in a day a month or even a year but once you have that emergency fund fully funded you will feel better what may be a catastrophe now will be a minor annoyance with a fully funded emergency fund finally i 'd recommend going to your bank and setting up a separate account for this emergency fund a separate account specifically labeled as your emergency fund this way you will think twice before spending it on a non emergency

so you want to buy a car but have no money saved up that 's going to be hard i 'd suggest you get a part time job save up and buy a used car even with the minimum wage pay in the u.s. if you are in the u.s. you could save up and buy a car in less than a month this route would be the quickest way for you to get a car but it would also teach you the responsibility of having one since it appears you have never owned a car before   now the car will most definitely not be fancy or look like the cars that your peer 's parents bought but at least it will get you from point a to point b.   i 'd look on craigslist or your local neighborhood for cars that have not moved in a while or have for sale signs bring a mechanically inclined friend with you and contact the owner and explain them your situation there are nice people out there that would give you deep discounts based on the fact that you are a student trying to get by now you have to get registration and insurance there are many insurance companies that give discounts to students as well who have good and driving records if you happen to get a car for a good deal take good car of it once you graduate and further your career you can resell it for a profit   i also would not suggest you get any loans for a car given your situation

focusing on options many people and companies use them to mitigate   when used as a hedge the objective is not to win big it is to create a more predictable outcome option traders win big by structuring trades with a high probability of success in this way they take 100 and turn it into 1000 with 100 small trades with a target profit of $   although options are a zero sum game a general theory among options traders is the stock market only has a 54 56 probability of skewed from 50 50 win loss because the market tends to go up over a long time frame using option trading strategies strategically you have more control over pop and you can set yourself up to win whether the security goes up down sideways    a quick and dirty measure of pop is an options delta   if the delta on a call option is 19 there is roughly a 19 chance your option will be in the money at expiration or a 19 chance of hitting a home run and your money   if the delta is 68 there is a 68 chance of a profitable trade or getting on base there are more variables to this equation but   i hope this clearly explains the essence

it is legal   they 're probably going to give you a 1099-misc which is required of businesses for many cash payments over $ 600 in value to all sorts of counterparties   probably box 3 of 1099-misc as is typical in cash for keys situations where one is paid to early    a 1099-misc is not necessarily pure income but in this case you do have money coming in   this money is n't a return of your security deposit or a gift the payment could possibly be construed by you as a payment to make you whole but the accounting for this would be on you   this is not a typical situation for irs reporting    however if you are uncomfortable with potentially explaining to the irs how you implemented advice from strangers over the internet the safest course is to report it all as income   look at it this way you did enter into a mutual contract where you were paid consideration to release your leasehold interests in the property

the problem is you are trying to qualify for a loan that has a 25 down payment using money you do n't have which defeats the purpose of having a down payment the best thing to do is have your parents buy the house for you you then rent the house from them where your rent is equal to the mortgage + x. your parents then put x into savings account for you and then once you have 25 in that account they gift it to you and you purchase the house from them using that 25 as the downpayment for the mortgage

taxing divident earnings hurts bank shareholders customers and impacts the equities market for the worse because it   a lowers the incentive to hold an equity instrument over long and intermediate periods incentivizes short term holdings creating a more traded stock market with more pronounced crises occurring more frequently   b the resulting dead weight loss of long term equities investment the capital available to banks and investment firms limiting the services they can offer their customers decreasing product yield and increasing borrowing costs   c the banks having lost business in long term equities trading then of course make less money and return less money to their shareholders   no such things as a free lunch my dude

a $ 1 note and four quarters are both real money but how and when they become real money is different the important thing is that the fed 's stockpile of cash that it gets from the bureau of engraving and printing is n't real money i.e. yet that cash is only used for fulfilling withdrawals from reserve accounts you ca n't use it to buy a car or a house or to pay janet yellen 's salary no one not even janet can use even a single dollar to buy a diet coke in other words it 's not really an asset or a liability or anything but a stack of paper in the fed 's vaults that looks astonishingly like money but is n't the upside to this is that when the makes a delivery of fresh bills to the fed or when the fed destroys old bills that are n't usable anymore the fed 's balance sheet does n't change that 's good those are practical considerations not financial ones the downside is that there 's nothing on the asset side of the sheet to explain how the fed 's liability to a bank is reduced when the bank makes a cash withdrawal from its reserve account so the fed balances it 's balance sheet by recording an increase in a different liability the cash in circulation kinda like transferring the balance on a credit card you 're paying down one liability by increasing another one it looks a bit silly but less silly than recording the destruction of old bills as an expense of the face value of the bills coins on the other hand become money as soon as the treasury gets them from the mint if they wanted to they could pay their employees salaries by ordering coins from the mint for cheap giving them to their employees at face value and reaping fat profits as a result in fact that 's pretty much exactly what they do when someone wants quarters the treasury mints them at less than face value and then sells them at face value in practice the fed does all of this buying and then distributes the coins according to demand the important thing is that this bunch of coins is not like the fed 's stockpile of bills it 's already real money and therefore shows up as an asset not much if the fed bought coins at the cheaper price from the mint instead them like they stockpile bills then distributed them as usual the extra profit just goes to the treasury anyway like all the fed 's profit does however as things are the fed 's purchases of coins are recorded on the fed 's balance sheet at face value which is kinda silly

why is that with all the successful investors including myself on a not infrequent basis going for individual companies directly would n't it make more sense to suggest that new investors learn how to analyse companies and then make their best guess after taking into account those factors i have a different perspective here than the other answers   i recently started investing in a roth ira for retirement i do not have interest in micromanaging individual company research i do n't find this enjoyable at all but i know i want to save for retirement could i learn all the details probably as an engineer software person i suspect i could but i really do n't want to but here 's the thing for anyone else in a similar situation to me the net return on investing into a mutual fund type arrangement even if it returns only 4 is still likely considerably higher than the return on trying to invest in stocks which likely results in $ 0 invested and a return of 0 i suspect the overwhelming majority of people in the world are more similar to me than you in that they have minimal interest in spending hours managing their money for us mutual funds or etfs are perfect for this

to some extent i suppose most people are okay with paying some taxes but as they teach in intro to economics decisions are made on the margin few are honestly expecting to get away with paying no taxes at all they are instead concerned about how much they spend on taxes and how effectively the classic defense of taxes says roads and national defense and education and fire safety are all important this is not really the problem that people have with taxes people have problems with gigantic ongoing infrastructure that cost many times what they were projected to cost a la boston 's big dig while the city streets are n't properly paved people do n't have big problems with a city run garbage service they have problems with the who get six figure salaries plus a guaranteed union protected job for life and a defined benefit pension plan which they do n't contribute a penny to and likewise for their health plans people do n't have a big problem with paying for schools they have a big problem with paying more than twice the national average for schools and still ending up with miserable schools new jersey people have a problem when the government issues bonds invests the money in the stock market for the public employee pension plan projects a 10 annual return contractually guarantees it to the employees and then puts the taxpayers on the hook when the dow ends up at 11,000 instead of california and people have a problem with the attitude that when they do n't pay taxes they 're basically stealing that money or that tax cuts are morally equivalent to a handout and the that they 're terrible people for trying to keep some of their money from the government

not only is this a marketing gimmick as an article but the principle survey question it cites appears to be pretty stupid i say appears to be rather than is because nowhere can i find the actual wording of the question   compare the following questions   what would make you happier a better boss or a pay raise   what would make you happier exchanging your current boss for the best boss you 've ever had or a 50 increase in pay   in the first case the question apparently asked in the actual survey the is left to interpret the relative sizes of the proposed improvements to their job there 's no reason to believe they 're considering changes of commensurate size and in fact there may be systematic bias toward a more significant envisioned improvement in their boss   frankly i would expect this bias since a person 's attitude toward their boss is often colored by the dictator subject nature of their relationship let 's be honest we are predisposed to dislike people who have authority over us when survey respondents are a better boss they may very well be thinking about a boss who does n't exercise that authority but that 's not a very realistic alternative since such a boss would not be effective from the company 's standpoint   in the second question the has more concrete alternatives to consider their alternative boss is at least now confined by realism this alternative boss had to have at least existed furthermore the pay rise is well specified   finally any survey question on this matter suffers from the cheap talk nature of surveys if actually faced with this choice in the real world would people put their money where their mouth is i would hazard to guess that as long as the pay increase was of a reasonable size more than a few people who indicated better boss would ultimately take pay raise given the actual choice

thinking about the business overall your profit would be since this is a sole proprietorship the taxes are going to depend on your marginal tax rate if you file jointly your income will determine what your marginal tax rate is   if you file separately there likely would n't be any tax on that income since it 's less than the standard deduction but you lose benefits of filing jointly combined exemptions etc so think about how much she would charge what expenses are involved before taxes what the taxes would be on that profit and what the opportunity costs are is it worth time away from the kids hobbies etc for that hobby how much should a hobby business make to make it worth the effort of charging for such services that would fall in the expense section   are you talking about the actual costs tax prep etc or just the hassle of collecting accounting etc   certainly those are a consideration but it 's harder to quantify that   if you can come up with some sort of cost then certainly it would fit in the overall value equation i 'm not sure using additional social security benefits as a gauge is helpful since you would n't see those benefits until you 're of retirement age according to ss and a lot can happen between now and then

from investopedia   beating the market is a difficult phrase to analyze it can be used    to refer to two different situations 1 an investor portfolio manager fund or other investment specialist    produces a better return than the market average the market average    can be calculated in many ways but usually a benchmark such as the    s&p 500 or the dow jones industrial average index is a good    representation of the market average if your returns exceed the    percentage return of the chosen benchmark you have beaten the market    congrats to learn more read benchmark your returns with indexes 2 a company 's earnings sales or some other valuation metric is    superior to that of other companies in its industry matching the market i would presume will be generating returns equivalent to the index you are comparing your portfolio with if for a sector industry then it would be the returns generated by the sector industry as an index is more or less a of the market as a whole people tend to use an index

if it 's feasible try to get one card down to zero balance and preferably one of your cash back cards   then keep that at zero every month pay it off in full and use it for your purchases as you describe above the idea would be to get it so that you are not paying interest on your month to month purchases   this not only reduces the 20 or whatever that you 're paying on that balance but also the 20 or whatever you 're paying on those purchases remember a card you carry a balance on charges you interest on those purchases from the current month if this is n't feasible if these are all very high balance cards then i suppose the way you 're currently doing it would be okay though i think you 're overthinking things to some extent but with 80 interest if that 's a significant pile of money you may need to as clearly that needs to be tackled first   i think it 's mostly better for you to pay your day to day stuff out of pocket and not use your cards the way you are suggesting but with the 80 you may need to the reason i say it 's better not to use your card the way you suggest is that it is difficult to do properly and never get it wrong i.e. never go over a balance and it 's also leaving you in the habit of using credit   it does n't help you budget necessarily either   instead set up a fully developed budget that includes all of those minimum payments and pay them   certainly once you have the > 50 debt handled i would switch to this method not using credit cards at all

it depends on how you place your stop order and the type of stop orders available from your broker if you place a stop market order and the following day the stock opens below your stop your stock will be stopped out at or around the opening price meaning you can potentially end up with quite a large gap if you place a stop limit order say you place your stop at $ 10.00 with a limit price of $ 9.90 and if the price opens below $ 9.90 say at $ 9.50 your limit sell order of $ 9.90 will be placed onto the market but it will not be executed until the price goes back up to $ 9.90 or above the third option is to place a guaranteed stop loss and as specified you are guaranteed your stop price even if the price gaps down below your stop price you will be paying an extra fee for the guaranteed stop loss order and they are usually mainly available with cfd brokers so if you are in the usa you might be out of luck

everyone is telling you how to manage your finances good for them that 's not an answer to your question the real answer solves how to get your money to travel the bank likely might extend you a loan especially if you have assets greater than the amount borrowed   however a better solution or alternative if the bank 's rate are too high or they simply wo n't give it to you is to go to a p2p lending platform these are in the uk and us if i remember correctly there was a canadian platform called or the point here is this go borrow money at a lower rate than your credit card there are other alternatives than p2p you can google these just make sure the rate is lower than your credit card pay the card off and go on vacation just make sure you can pay it all off eventually otherwise you 'll be swimming in debt you ca nt pay

the main point to consider is that your payments toward your own home replace your rent any house or apartment you buy will have changes in value the value is generally going slowly up but there is a lot of noise and you may be in a low phase at any time and for a long time so seeing it as an investment is not any better than buying share or funds and it has a much worse liquidity (= you can not as easily make it to cash when you want to and not in parts either however if you buy for example a one room apartment for with a 2 mortgage and pay 2 interest = 1600 plus 1 principal = 800 for a total of 2400 per year = 200 per month you are paying less than your current rent plus you own it after 30 years even if it would be worth nothing after 30 years you made a lot of money by paying half only every month and it probably is not worthless you need to be careful not to compare apples with oranges if you buy a house for instead your payments would be higher than your rent was but you would be living in your house not in a room for most people that is worth a lot you need to put your own value to that if you do n't care to have a lot more space and freedom the extra value is zero if you like it put a price to it with current interest rates it is probably a good idea for most people to buy a house that they can easily afford instead of paying rent the usual rules should be considered do n't yourself leave some security etc generally it is rather difficult to buy an affordable house instead of renting today and not saving a lot of money in the process so i would say go for it

honestly the best way to manage this risk is to manage your savings appropriately many experts recommend that maintain a reasonably liquid account with 6 your minimum monthly expenses for just this occurrence i know easier said than done right as for insurance i can only speak for what is the case in the us here most mortgages will require you to get pmi insurance until you have at least 20 equity in your house however that insurance only protects the bank from losing money if you ca n't pay it does n't save you from foreclosure or ruining your credit   really the type of insurance you are talking about is unemployment insurance which all states in the us make available to workers via deductions from their paycheck   the best advice i suppose is to keep your expenses low enough to cover them with an unemployment check until you have accumulated enough savings to get through a rough patch that may mean buying a less expensive home or just waiting until you have saved a bigger down payment if you did n't plan ahead and you are already in the house another option might be to extend your mortgage for example from a 20 to a 30 year to reduce your payments to a manageable level a more risky option might be to convert to a variable rate loan temporarily which typically carries a lower interest rate however it might be hard to secure a new loan if you do n't currently have an income

an economy produces goods and services and people use money to pay for those goods and services   money has value because people believe that they can buy and sell goods and services with it in that economy how much the value of money is is determined by how much money there is in comparison to goods and services supply and demand in most economies it is the job of the federal national reserve bank to ensure that prices stay stable ie the relationship of goods and services to how much money there is is stable as this is necessary for a well running economy   the federal reserve bank does so by making more printing decreasing interest rates or less increasing interest rates available to the economy to determine how much money needs to be in the economy to keep prices stable is incredibly hard as many factors have an impact if the reserve bank gets it wrong and there is more money compared to goods and services than previous prices will rise to compensate this is inflation if it 's the other way round is deflation since it is commonly regarded that deflation is much more destabilizing to an economy than inflation the reserve banks tend to err on the side of inflation

i 'm sorry i should have said i was saying that sarcastically but those are the arguments which i suspect are being made   did not answer my question where 's my advocate in the negotiations   its doubtful that they would be among the hundreds thousands of lobbyists unless you are a corporation and you have one   should i believe the negotiators have my best interests at heart   i do n't think the negotiators have your or the country 's best interests at heart i think they barely even play lip service to it any more    's the point of negotiating a treaty that does n't have the people 's interests at heart      well look at all the things that are in ttip for example here in the us by government agencies tasked with enforcement of existing laws and recommending new ones the chemical industry has succeeded for the last 25 years or so at preventing a lot of needed regulation of a lot of demonstrably dangerous substances particularly a class of chemicals called tag    meanwhile europe has put into place much more stringent regulations based on the principle which requires that chemical industry prove some chemicals are safe to get them approved while the us the key issue is overcoming lobbyists and even chemicals which are clearly dangerous have to go through a lot of hoops before they are regulated and even when its shown to be extremely likely they are dangerous it is very difficult when lobbyists are there often regulators are political from the industries they are supposed to regulate there is no denying that having different regulations is complicated but what they are promoting as a solution is not a good approach    they are pushing for what they call regulatory which is basically the forcing of all environmental and chemical laws in a bunch of countries into the same publications it would overrule a lot of state laws involving things like fracking and food safety    instead of raising our standards to the european level they want to bring theirs down and get rid of the imo quite prudent principle which i think is incredibly stupid but people are not aware of this   i think has clearly been a high level decision some kind of agreement between the 5 media corporations that control virtually all us media to never cover some issues   to not cover those issues at all but in europe they have a similar problem just not quite as bad but there people make more of an effort to find out what s really happening also there are fewer   the us is known for massive levels of astroturfing in its online world   for example in the uk there is a lot of protesting because of the implicit goal of the ftas is to privatize public services although they deny it its right there in agreements like files framing public services as bad some kind of theft from companies and any small privatization into a permanent entitlement for that company to that market so its permanent even if its unsuccessful that s been disastrous to their john on ttip and nhs they are trying to us   how did it get this way in part its due to the failure of americans to seek out facts something people really have to do because there are forces spending a lot of effort into hiding them and trying to exploit positions of trust to create a dangerous false security   its a direct result of so much money in politics the so called stakeholders spend a lot of money and energy into getting candidates into office so then they expect something in return    this is related

there 's currently not much reason to keep around a long term non deductible traditional ira in my opinion a roth ira is almost strictly better think about it a non deductible traditional ira vs. a roth ira of the same amount in both cases contributions are after tax so no tax deduction but when you withdraw for the roth ira you do n't have to pay tax and for the non deductible traditional ira you have to pay tax on the earnings a roth ira can be contributed to at pretty much any income level thanks to the backdoor roth ira process which uses a temporary non deductible traditional ira in the process so there is not much reason for a long term non deductible traditional ira as for your question a non deductible traditional ira vs. a taxable account well a non deductible traditional ira is contributed to with after tax money and taxed on the earnings only on withdrawal so the taxation is almost identical to things like stocks and homes where the gain is not realized until the thing is sold however compared to things like savings accounts and bonds where you get taxed on the interest yearly it is much better every time you get taxed on gains like this it is taxing gains earned from after tax money so if you think of an amount of money as being equivalent to the amount of money it grows to over time time value of money then it is taxing money that is or grown from money that is already taxed so it is better to have this only happen at the end at withdrawal than every year

i think he means that if he liquidated his shares of amazon the stock would fall depending on how much he actually owns which i have no idea it could cause the stock price to plummet   in a more extreme scenario a person that owns 40 of a company can not liquidate their shares without the stock falling to ridiculously low levels

currently many countries and non government bodies hold dollars to facilitate trade if the dollar is no longer used in their trade then they no longer have a reason to hold those dollars if every other country starts to dump their dollar holdings into the world currency markets the number of dollars floating around in those market would shoot up the massive supply increase of dollars we 're assuming these other countries are holding massive amounts of dollars would lead to a large drop in value of the dollar lots more dollars chasing the same amount of goods every purchase will become much more expensive for anyone still buying with dollars including the american government trying to buy expensive military equipment unless the us government also switches to using something else to purchase military supplies

to begin with bear in mind that over the time horizon you are talking about the practical impact of inflation will be quite limited inflation for 2017 is forecast at 2.7 and since you are talking about a bit less than all of 2017 and on average you 'll be withdrawing your money halfway through the overall impact will be < 1.3 of your savings you should consider whether the effort and risk involved in an alternative is worth a few hundred pounds if you still want to beat inflation the best suggestion i have is to look at peer to peer lending that comes with some risk but i think over the course of 1 year it 's quite limited for example zopa is currently offering 3.1 on their access product and are offering 2.9 on the everyday product both of these are advertised as instant access albeit with some caveats these are n't fscs guaranteed bank deposits and they do come with some risk firstly although both and zopa have a significant level of provision against bad debt it 's always possible that this wo n't be enough and you 'll lose some of your money i think this is quite unlikely over a one year time horizon as there 's no sign of trouble yet secondly there 's liquidity risk although the products are advertised as instant access they are actually backed by longer duration loans made to people who want to borrow money for you to be able to cash out someone else has to be there ready to take your place again this is very likely to be possible in practice but there 's no absolute guarantee

not as you suggest since you are sole prop you are taxed on a cash basis within reason you can prepay vendors so temp to hire through an agency might appear more attractive than direct hire but there needs to be a justification other than avoidance of taxes so pre paying 100k on would look fishy as fuck plus your quality of candidate will suffer if you need anything other than low skill labor   look at your other fully deductible expenses anything you can prepay prepay for example i set my liability insurance renewal january 15 to provide optionality but it just shifts one year into another means if you are in the same marginal bracket next year   the irs has also relaxed depreciation on office technology computers are now fully deductible rather than being capitalized   500k revenue you should have a cpa and legal counsel simply incorporating is n't tax magic the purpose is to limit liability not a tax shelter but shitty things happen once you have employees do n't create the potential for a disgruntled employee lawsuit put your shelter at risk of court judgment   that said assuming you are n't dumping a hypothetical on the internet congrats for all the headaches having employees is the ultimate leverage it 's like a xerox machine for your labor including loss of fidelity with each copy

you are not the economy the economy is just the aggregate of what is going on with everyone else you should make the decision based on your own situation now and projected into the future as best you can loan rates are at historical lows so it is a great time to take a loan if you actually need one for some reason however i would n't go looking for a loan just because the rates are low for the same reason it does n't make sense to buy maternity clothes if you are a single guy just because they are on sale

make sure that when you have the loan you still contribute enough to get the company match for example   an inability to maximize the match might need to be figured into the opportunity cost of the loan some companies will suspend your contributions for a specific number of months for a hardship withdraw   make sure you understand where the money comes from for the loan can you count the money that the company matched but you are not vested with when determining the maximum amount of the loan   if the money is in what is now a closed fund can you replenish the funds back into that fund if use it to fund the loan know what the repayment time period is of the loan

the logic the interest rate on the mortgage was so low it did n't make sense not to buy is one reason the housing bubble happened the logic was that it made the house affordable even at high prices once the prices collapsed people still had affordable payments but were unable to sell because they were upside down on the mortgage if you can refinance to a 15-year mortgage or from a adjustable mortgage to a fixed rate mortgage it can make sense you can save on the monthly payment and on the total cost of the mortgage but do n't buy to take advantage of rates or to save on taxes or to build a guaranteed equity these can be false economies or things that ca n't be of course if nobody spends money the economy will stay poor as to hidden details only purchase housing you want to own for the long haul if you expect to flip it in a few years you might not be able to you might end up stuck as a long distance landlord

the failure of the facebook ipo has everything to do with public access to markets it certainly was overvalued at issue and there were a host of other problems as well but the main issue that has caused the problem is that there were too many armchair analysts in on it less investors got in on facebook at $ 38 + because they liked facebook and everyone they knew liked facebook by and large they could n't read a balance sheet or describe how the firm made money as such as soon as it began to decline they sold without regard for the loss very few if any professionals actually it at launch and more than one pro shorted the position and cleaned up i find it humorous that while most people would never think of trying to buy a house a realtor they are perfectly happy buying thier own stocks without professional advice say what you want about the finance industry but for the vast majority of people having an advisor is a far smarter option

if your plan permits loans deposit enough through the year to maximize the match and then take a loan from the plan use the loan portion to pay your student loan essentially you have refinanced your debt at a presumably lower rate and recieved the match you pay yourself back with interest through your payroll the rates are typically the prime rate + 1 the loans are subject to a lesser of 50 vested account balance or $ 50,000 provision

as a self employed handyman i can tell you this   any work that is done be it professional part time hobby or whatever else has to answer to two primary criteria   as you asked it has to be worthwhile in financial terms and more importantly in personal terms   in the long term charging low rates will her   not worth it someone once said i have no with he who charges cheaply because who better then he knows the value of his services   obviously one has to remain reasonable   then there is an factor in working for yourself   i call it losses since they are extremely difficult to calculate as noted above here already   in the first place they are extremely difficult to detect anyway   micro management will not tell you the losses you can only do it at the end of a period on a balance sheet   then you have to calculate a fair price in terms of lessons given and monies received the trick is to gain a fair assessment of worth to her without her needing to go into the books just as a simple gut feel   she needs to really feel good about it to maintain motivation for the future   otherwise i did it it does not work the other consideration is that when money changes hands it places a benchmark on the tuition and the relationship   one   it locks her into delivering professional work as she already is one   two   the students will be locked into giving fair and excellent commitment in being taught a simple calculation goes like this use the time span of a month as it is easier to break down available time per week   also remember that there will be extra hours spent in consultation with parents   this is a cost it has be calculated difficult at the start but keep track of it   one other thing   i do not give discounts of extend favours but i keep my prices reasonable i was told i am some 25 more expensive than the latest quotes but i kept on getting work with a high execution to quotation rate   floating prices are   impossible to track manage and justify   people talk to each other whether you like it or not   do proper reasonable calculations and be up front to all about how you work   in contract on paper   it just may be necessary to scale prices from beginner to advanced classes ok $ 50 seems a fair price i do n't live in the states but about three four big mac 's would compare about right   you are not selling time you are selling expertise decide how much she wants out of it per month forget retirement you live now   this income will also cover other invisible extraneous work determine how much time will be spent in giving lessons   you can only charge for visible work done basic hourly rate = monthly income lesson hours then there 's a catch   research has shown that owners of one man and small businesses spend about 55 of their time in getting new business   so now charged hourly rate = basic hourly rate divided by 45 this could you but these are hard commercial facts   things could appear to be extremely expensive   you will however have a solid base from which to decide as you go further   the accounting is a good place to start but she you both rather have to feel good about the rewards and the counter performances great success to you both

the basic idea is that the average person ca n't deduct health care costs unless they 're really onerous but a business can and as a self employed person you can deduct those costs from the businesses earnings as long as the business is really generating enough profit to cover the health insurance costs that 's why most people get their health insurance from their employer actually the relevant irs rules say you may be able to deduct premiums paid for medical and dental insurance and qualified long term care insurance for you your spouse and your dependents if you are a self employed individual with a net profit reported on schedule c form 1040 for 2010 thanks to the small business jobs act of 2010 you can even deduct the premium from your income before deducting the self employment tax source i 'm sure that when you get your tax returns and instructions for 2010 this will all be spelled out

i 'm assuming that when you say convert to s corp tax treatment you 're not talking about actually changing your llc to a corporation there are two distinct pieces of the puzzle here first there 's your organizational form your state which is where the business is legally formed and recognized creates the llc or corporation s corp does n't come into play here your company is either an llc or a corporation there are a handful of other organizational types your state might have e.g. limited partnership etc none of these are immediately relevant to this discussion second there 's the tax treatment you receive by the irs if your company was created by the state as an llc note that the irs does n't recognize llcs as a distinct organizational type you elect to be taxed as an individual for single member llcs a partnership for multiple member llcs or as a corporation the former two elections are pass through there 's no additional level of taxation on corporate profits everything just passes through to the owners the latter election introduces a tax on corporate profits when you elect pass through treatment a single member llc files on schedule c a multiple member llc will prepare a form k-1 which you will include on your 1040 if your company was created by the state as a corporation not an llc you could still elect pass through taxation if your company qualifies under the rules in subchapter s i.e. an s corp states do not recognize s corp as part of the organizational process that 's just a tax distinction used by the irs and possibly your state 's tax authorities in your case if you are a single member llc and assuming there are no other reasons to organize as a corporation talking about s corp tax treatment does n't make any sense you 'll just file your schedule c in my experience it 's fairly simple note that this is based on my experience of and multiple member llcs in just two states your state may have different rules that affect state level taxation and the rules may change from year to year i 've found that hiring a good cpa to prepare the forms saves a good bit of stress and time that can be better applied to the business

based on my understanding of your query well you need to understand atm and itm options the   delta and gamma factor specifically usually delta of atm is around 0.5 while itm option is above than that say 0.6 or 0.8 or 0.9 and deep itm is very close to 1 for every movement of 1 buck the itm will move say 1.6 atm 0.5 and otm 0.3 approx say a abc stock price is rs 300 so if you check option chart you try to see which one is closer suppose you find of 320 300 280 so   320 is itm 300 is atm and 280 is otm for call options so will the delta value e.g 0.55 0.35 so suppose if stock price rise by 7 i.e rs then will rise simultaneously say atm is it will start rising by 0.55 i.e. the moment the share price move from to your atm will turn to itm now the part if you buy otm and the share price rise by 15 your otm will now become itm and your profit will roll around 100 to 120 approx hope it answers your query

if you think you can manage the risk and the spread is ultimately worth it to you there 's nothing stopping you i know in the u.s. in ca specifically you need to have $ 85,000 annual income or net worth over some threshold to be able to loan more than $ 2,500 via peer to peer loan investing   i 've had an account at prosper since around 2010 it does pretty well   it 's made my taxes a bit more complicated each year but it 's been profitable for me   i would n't lever up on it though my prosper experience my experience with prosper has generally been positive   my real motivation for starting the account was generating a dataset that i could analyze here 's some of that analysis i started the account by trickling $ 100 in to buy four $ 25 loans   any payments received from these loans were used to buy more $ 25 loans   i 've kept my risk to an average of about a- aa a b c d e hr are the grades though the interest rates have reduced over time   at this point i have a few hundred loans outstanding in various stages of completion   in calendar 2015 i had a monthly average of 0.75 of my loans charged off and about 3 of loans at some stage of delinquency    i receive about 5.5 of my principle value in receipts on average each month including loan pay offs and charge offs   interest and other non principle payments comprise just shy of 20 of my monthly receipts   prosper 's 1 maintenance fee translates to about 8 of my monthly non principle receipts   it 's all a pretty fine line it would n't take many defaults to turn my annual return negative though in 5 years it has n't happened yet   considering only monthly charge offs against monthly non principle receipts i had two net negative months in 2015   i made about a net 4.5 annual return on my average monthly outstanding principle for calendar 2015   when i log in to my prosper account it claims my return   is closer to 7.5 i 'm not sure how that number is calculated the key is diversifying your risk just like a bank would   i do n't know how the other services function at a nuts and bolts level   with prosper i choose which loans to fund which means i determine my risk level   i assume the other services function similarly    regarding collection of charged off loans   i do n't know how much real effort is by prosper   i 've had a few notes sold for about 10 of the outstanding balance and i do n't know who they were sold to   comically i have loan that 's made more payments in collections than when it was in good standing   there is definitely more to this than handing over $ 15,000 and receiving 6 on it

you might find some of the answers here helpful the question is different but has some similar concerns such as a changing economic environment what approach should i take to best protect my wealth against currency    devaluation poor growth prospects i want to avoid selling off any    more of my local index funds in a panic as i want to hold long term    does my portfolio balance make sense good question i ca n't even get us banks to answer questions like this such as what happens if they try to nationalize all bank accounts like in the soviet union   response it 'll never happen the question was what if i think that your portfolio carries a lot of risk but also offsets what you 're worried about   outside of government confiscation of foreign accounts if your foreign investments are held through a local brokerage you should be good   what to do about government confiscation   even the us government in 1933 confiscated physical gold and they made it illegal to own so even physical resources can be confiscated during hard times quite a large portion of my foreign investments have been bought at an    expensive time when our currency is already around historic lows    which does concern me in the event that it strengthens in future what    strategy should i take in the future if when my local currency starts    the strengthen do i hold my foreign investments through it and just    trust in cost averaging long term or try sell them off to avoid the    devaluation are these foreign investments a hedge   if so then you should n't worry if your currency does strengthen they serve the purpose of hedging the local environment   if these investments are not a hedge then timing will matter and you 'll want to sell and buy your currency before it does strengthen   the risk on this latter point is that your timing will be wrong

can they reject a hundred dollar bill as a payment of debt no a creditor can not refuse payment in cash whatever denomination you use however when you 're buying stuff you do n't owe anything to the business owner there 's no debt so the above rule does n't apply as long as there 's no debt in existence the matter of payment is decided between two parties based on the mutual agreement the demand not to use large bills is reasonable in places like or taxi cab that are frequently robbed or at a small retailer that does n't want to invest into forgery detection and fraud prevention so the answer to this question is it the case where this practice of accepting small bills and    rejecting large bills is perfectly legal is yes you can find the full explanation on including code references

there are n't only two factors at play here there is more to success than hours worked and lucky circumstances i do n't claim to know the other factors but i would like to give you an example   currently i 'm listening to bach 's and in c minor it is truly an inspiring piece bach was and still is a great success his genius has been very few times over the past 250 + years still there are many composers who put in just as much work as bach yet are not as good both bach and such composers put conscious effort into the placements of their notes so luck is not a factor both bach and composers also put in a comparable number of hours yet bach is just better clearly there must be some other factor deciding who is successful and who is not

if i invest in index funds or other long term stocks that pay dividend which i reinvest they do n't need to be worth more per share for me to make a profit right that is if i sell part of the stocks it 's good if they 're worth more than i bought them at but the real money comes from the quantity of stocks that you get by reinvesting your dividends right i would say it is more the other way around   it is nice to get dividends and reinvest them but overall the main gain comes from the stocks going up in value the idea with index funds however is that you do n't rely on any particular stock going up in value instead you just rely on the aggregate of all the funds in the index going up   by buying lots of stocks bundled in an index fund you avoid being too reliant on any one company 's performance can i invest small amounts part of paycheck into index funds on a monthly basis like € 500 without taking major transaction fees likely to be index fund specific general answers or specific answers using popular stocks welcomed yes you can   at least in the us whether you can do this automatically from your paycheck depends on whether you employer has that set up   i do n't know that work in the netherlands   however at the least you can almost certainly set up an auto invest program that takes $ x out of your bank account every month and buys shares of some index fund(s is this plan market crash proof my parents keep saying that look at 2008 and think about what such a thing would do to your plan and i just see that it will be a setback but ultimately irrelevant unless it happens when i need the money and even then i 'm wondering whether i 'll really need all of my money in one go does n't the index fund go back up eventually does a crash even matter if you plan on holding stocks for 10 or more years crashes always matter because as you say there 's always the possibility that the crash will occur at a time you need the money   in general it is historically true that the market recovers after crashes so yes if you have the financial and psychological fortitude to not pull your money out during the crash and to ride it out your net worth will probably go back up after a rough   no one can predict the future so it 's possible for some unprecedented crisis to cause an unprecedented crash   however the interconnectedness of stock markets and financial systems around the world is now so great that were such a no return crash to occur it would probably be accompanied by the total collapse of the whole economic system   in other words if the stock market dies suddenly once and for all the entire way of life of developed countries will probably die with it   as long as you live in such a society you ca n't really avoid gambling that it will continue to exist so gambling on there not being a market crash is n't much more of a gamble does what i 'm planning have similarities with some financial concept or product to allow me to research better by looking at the risks of that concept product maybe like a mortgage investment plan without the bank eating your money in between i 'm not sure what you mean by what you 're planning   the main financial products relevant to what you 're describing are index funds which you already mentioned and index etfs which are basically similar with regard to the questions you 're asking here   as far as concepts the philosophy of buying low fee index funds holding them for a long time and not selling during crashes is essentially that espoused by jack bogle not quite the inventor of the index fund but more or less its spiritual father and the community of bogleheads that has formed around his ideas   there is a bogleheads wiki with lots of information about the details of this approach to investing   if this strategy appeals to you you may find it useful to read through some of the pages on that site

the limit on sep ira is 25 not 20   if you 're self employed filing on schedule c then it 's taken on net earning which in your example would be 25 of $ 90,000 joetaxpayer is correct as regards the 401(k limits   the elective deferrals are per person that 's a cap in sum across multiple plans and across both traditional and roth if you have those   in general it 's actually across other retirement plan types too see below if you 're self employed and set up a 401(k for your own business the elective deferral is still aggregated with any other 401(k plans in which you participate that year but you can still make the employer contribution on your own plan this irs page is current a pretty good one on this topic   key quotes that are relevant the business owner wears two hats in a 401(k plan employee and employer contributions can be made to the plan in both capacities the owner can contribute both deferrals up to 100 of compensation earned income in the case of a self employed individual up to the annual contribution limit   $ 18,000 in 2015 and 2016 or $ 24,000 in 2015 and 2016 if age 50 or over plus nonelective contributions up to   25 of compensation as defined by the plan or for self employed individuals see discussion below it continues with this example the amount you can defer including pre tax and roth contributions to all your plans not including 457(b plans is $ 18,000 in 2015 and 2016 although a plan 's terms may place lower limits on contributions the total amount allowed under the tax law does n’t depend on how many plans you belong to or who sponsors those plans example ben age 51 earned $ 50,000 in w-2 wages from his s corporation in 2015 he deferred $ 18,000 in regular elective deferrals plus $ 6,000 in catch up contributions to the 401(k plan his business contributed 25 of his compensation to the plan $ 12,500 total contributions to the plan for 2015 were $ this is the maximum that can be contributed to the plan for ben for 2015 a business owner who is also employed by a second company and participating in its 401(k plan should bear in mind that his limits on elective deferrals are by person not by plan he must consider the limit for all elective deferrals he makes during a year notice in the example that ben contributed more that than his elective limit in total his was $ 24,000 in the example because he was old enough for the $ 6,000 catch up in addition to the $ 18,000 that applies to everyone else   he did this by declaring an employer contribution of $ 12,500 which was limited by his compensation but not by any of his elective contributions beyond the 401(k keep in mind that elective contributions are capped across different types of retirement plans as well so if you have a sep ira and a solo 401(k your total contributions across those plans are also capped   that 's also mentioned in the example now to the extent that you 're considering different types of plans that 's a whole question in itself one that might be worth consulting a dedicated tax advisor   a few things to consider not extensive list as for payroll self employment tax looks like you will end up paying medicare including the new additional medicare tax that came with the aca but not ss if you have wages as well as self employment    earnings the tax on your wages is paid first    but this rule only applies if your total earnings    are more than $ 118,500 for example if you    will have $ 30,000 in wages and $ 40,000 in    income in 2016 you will pay the    appropriate social security taxes on both your    wages and business earnings in 2016 however    if your wages are $ and you have $    in net earnings from a business you do n’t pay    dual social security taxes on earnings more    than $ 118,500 your employer will withhold    7.65 percent in social security and medicare    taxes on your $ in earnings you must    pay 15.3 percent in social security and medicare    taxes on your first $ in self employment    earnings and 2.9 percent in medicare tax on the    remaining $ 200 in net earnings other good irs resources

gt;if banks did not have a big brother to bail them out of loans that went bust whenever they wanted they would be a lot more careful in who they loaned money to     that 's what they became an avenue to offload risk   the reason those banks were making bad loans was the high demand for trading in mortgage backed securities not because freddie and fannie were there they wanted to make those loans anyway so there 'd be more paper to trade if you could transfer half of the risk of a loan you already knew was shitty to another entity but still keep all the profits and fuck around with the derivatives then of course you 'll take full advantage    the intention behind them was to help that margin of people that fell just below the banks historically very high standards for home lending banks seek high profits fannie and freddie were to operate at break even or slim profit but serve a population toward upward economic benefits everyone when the banks lending standards dropped precipitously due to repeal of glass steagall creation of new exotic financial instruments and appalling lack of regulatory enforcement everything kind of went to shit   in my view they 're much more a casualty that 's become a scapegoat than a causal force

good question it seems to me that there is no minimum order size for shares trading on the lse please note i could n't find an definite answer but according to the international order book document see from the lse page 7 question 7 would respondents support a revision of the minimum order     size of 50 units    whilst there was    limited support for a low value based    minimum order size the   majority of    respondents requested its complete    removal   this was   incorporated into    the september 2010 quarterly review as    per service   announcement    and as from 20 september 2010 the    minimum   order size in all    securities has been 1 unit even though not all trading on the lse is performed on this system it would be very if the international stocks can be traded in any size while domestic stocks will have an minimum size further consider looking to the times and sales of various stocks here you can find an example those trades also suggest that there is no minimum order size for example i just saw an executed trade with an size of 13 at last look at the interactive brokers no relationship with exchange list at here you can click on various stock names and in the window that opens look for size parameters and the size increment i could only find stocks with an size increment of 1 i.e. you can trade anything with a minimum of 1 stock and more needs to be in steps of 1 stock even though i could n't find official information on the lse site like a for beginners or such it does seem to me that you can trade any size you want on lse   please note that mutual funds and illiquid otc stocks which do n't have an continuous market can have different rules so double check with your broker

it 's unclear what you 're asking when i originally read your question it seemed that you had closed out one options position and opened another when i read your question the second time it seemed that you were writing a second option while the first was still open in the second case you have one covered and one naked position the covered call will expire worthless the naked call will expire in the money how your broker will resolve that is a question best left for them but my expectation is that they will assign the non worthless calls whereas if both options expired in the money you would be assigned and you would have to come up with the additional shares and again that depends on how your broker works in general for both cases your net is the premiums you received plus the difference between strike price and the price that you paid for the stock minus any cost to close out the position so whether you make a profit is very much dependent on how much you received for your premiums scenario 1 close first call write second scenario 2 write covered + naked one expires worthless scenario 3 write covered + naked both expire in the money disclaimer the sec does not consider me a financial investment advisor so this is not financial investment advice

you might try to refinance some of those loans it sounds like you are serious about minimizing interest expense if you think you will be able to pay those loans in full within   five years you might also try a loan that is fixed for five years before becoming variable   if you do not think you can repay the loans in full before that time you should probably stick with the fixed rates that you have it may even be profitable to refinance those loans through another lender at the exact same fixed rate because it gets around their repayment tricks that effectively increase your interest on those two smaller loans

if you 're not rich investing money will produce very small return and is a waste of your resources if you want to save until you die then go for it that 's what investment companies want you to do i suggest invest your money in building a network of friends who will be future asset for you a group of friends helping each other have a much higher prospect of success it has been proven that approximately 70 of jobs have been obtained through networking either through family or friends this is the vast majority i will reiterate invest on friends and family not on strangers who want to tie down your money so they can have fun for the moment while you wait to have fun when you 're almost dead added source for those who are questioning the most well known fact within organizations i 'm baffled by the level of ignorance linkedin recruitment blog companies want to hire from within first only when there are no    appropriate internal candidates will they rely on referrals from    employees who get a bonus for a successful   hire and people who will    approach them through informational meetings the latter category of    you have the benefit of getting known before the job is    officially posted for those who believe loaning money to friends and family is a way of losing money > this is a risk well worth taking > and the risk is much lower than loaning your money to strangers > and the reward is much higher than loaning your money to strangers

this is a technical term referring to the double entry book keeping of trades by brokers suppose a client executes a buy order with their broker   the broker 's accounting for this trade will be recorded as two different deals one deal showing the client as buyer and the broker as seller and a second deal showing the broker as buyer and the clearing house as seller   the net result of these two deals is that the broker has no net position while the client has a net buy and the clearing house has a net sell with respect to this broker 's account as accounted for internally by the broker and the same methods apply for a client sell order the client broker deal record i.e. the client side of the trade is called the client side booking while the broker clearing house deal record is called the street side booking

there are a few ways you can go about paying this off quickly and safely you could start paying $ monthly ie double what you 're paying now you 'll pay less interest in the long run because they can only charge you for the amount outstanding remember 6.8 of $ 12k is more than 6.8 of $ 6k however your plan sounds more sensible say you get to $ 6k paid off and $ 6k saved you 're able to pay off what 's left and that 's almost $ 200 a month you 'll have extra although what i like about this is if you become ill lose your job or whatever then you 're still able make the $ payments plus you 'll have money saved for day to day expenses food water gas electricity etc long enough to see yourself through ps they may charge you a settlement fee because if you pay early then they miss out on money but check your contract with them first hope this helps

allowances are calculated as your total deductions divided by the tax year 's personal exemptions as mentioned above it is a multiplier for 2015 the standard deduction for a married couple filing jointly is $ 12,600 and each of you gets 1 personal exemption $ 4,000 in 2015 that 's a total of $ 12,600 + or $ divide this by the personal exemption and you get roughly 5 allowances now say your employer offers health insurance and a 401(k plan your total health insurance or cafeteria contributions are $ 2,000 for the year and your total 401(k plan contributions are $ 6,000 for the year this would give an additional $ 2,000 + $ 6,000 = $ 8,000 divided by $ 4,000 = 2 allowances thus you would file with 7 allowances note that tax credits are not included in the allowance calculation that is because they do not affect your taxable income but rather directly reduce your taxes due

trading at the start of a session is by far higher than at any other time of the day this is mostly due to markets incorporating news into the prices of stocks in other words there are a lot of factors that can affect a stock 24 hours a day but the market trades for only 6.5 hours a day so a lot of news accumulates during the time when people can not trade on that news then when markets finally open people are able to finally trade on that news and there is a lot of price discovery going on between market participants in the last minutes of trading volumes increase as well this can often be attributed to certain kinds of traders closing out their position before the end of the day for example if you do n't want to take the risk a large price movement at the start of the next day affecting you you would need to completely close your position

but bad with money also means not hoarding money it means putting it back into the real economy buying goods and services they may not necessarily need but that provide livelihoods for others   but i think you 're right   people in america feel poor when they compare themselves to the super rich but in reality we do spend on stuff we do n't need and have far more income per labor unit then in some other countries     if a person shares housing with others buys their clothes from the goodwill and grows their own food in their garden and does n't waste electricity water and spend money on entertainment and stuff they do n't need it really is possible to get by on very little    still this is n't a recipe for peace and prosperity of a society

in the case of bank failures you are protected by fdic insurance   at the time i wrote this you are insured up to $ 250,000   in my lifetime it has been as high as $ 1,000,000 and as low as $ 100,000   i attached a link which is updated by fdic in the case of fraud it depends if you read this story and are horrified i was too you know that the banking system is not as safe as the other answers imply in february 2005 joe lopez a businessman from florida filed a suit    against bank of america after unknown hackers stole $ 90,000 from his    bank of america account the money had been transferred to an investigation showed that mr. lopez ’s computer was infected with a    malicious program backdoor which records every    and sends this information to malicious users via the internet this    is how the hackers got hold of joe lopez ’s user name and password    since mr. lopez often used the internet to manage his bank of america    account however the court did not rule in favor of the plaintiff saying that    mr. lopez had neglected to take basic precautions when managing his    bank account on the internet a signature for the malicious code that    was found on his system had been added to nearly all antivirus product    databases back in 2003 ouch    but let 's think about the story for a second he had his money stolen because of online banking and he did n't have the latest antivirus software   how safe is banking if you do n't do online banking   in the case of this story it would have prevented but you 're still susceptible to someone stealing your card or account information   so in the bank 's defense how does a bank not know that someone did n't wire money to a friend which is a loss for good then get some of that money back from his friend while also getting money back from the bank which had to face the loss   yes it sucks but it 's not total madness as for disputing charges from personal experience it also depends   i do n't use cards whatsoever so i 've never had to worry but both of my parents have experienced banking fraud where a fake charge on their card was not reversed   neither of my parents are rich and ca n't afford lawyers so crying lawsuit is not an option for everyone   how often does this occur   i suspect it 's rare that banks do n't reverse the charges in fraudulent cases though you will still lose time for filing and possibly filling out paperwork   the way to prevent this as much as i hate to be the bearer of bad news there is no absolutely safe place to keep your money   even if you bought metals and buried them in the ground a with a metal detector might run across it one day   you can take steps to protect yourself but there is no absolute guarantee that these will work out account closures i added this today because i saw this question and have only seen heard about this three times   provided that you get the cashier 's check back safely you should be okay but why was this person 's account closed and look at how much funds he had   from his question in the two years i banked with boa i never had an overdraft or any    negative marks on my account so the only thing that would stick out    was a check that i deposited for $ that my mom left me after she    passed naturally people are n't going to like some of my answers especially this but imagine you 're in an immediate need for cash and you experience this issue   what can you do   let 's say that rent is on the line and it 's $ 25 for every day that you 're late   other steps to protect yourself some banks allow you to use a keyword or phrase   if you 're careful with how you do this and are clever it will reduce the risk that someone steals your money

you said your mother in law lives with you does she pay rent or are you splitting the cost of housing that would also have to figured into the equation   if you had a business you would now have to declare the expense on your business taxes this would also then be income for her which she would have to account for on her taxes remember there are both state and federal taxes involved regarding expenses like diapers if the mil had the business she could deduct them as a business expense if you have the business it would greatly complicate the taxes your business would be essentially covering your personal expenses if your mil was not a business the cost of diapers would be paid by you regardless of the working situation of you and your spouse to claim the tax credit you must report the name address and taxpayer identification number    either the social security number or the employer identification    number of the care provider on your return if the care provider is a    tax exempt organization you need only report the name and address on    your return you can use form pdf dependent care provider 's    identification and certification to request this information from the    care provider if you do not provide information regarding the care    provider you may still be eligible for the credit if you can show    that you exercised due diligence in attempting to provide the required    information the irs will be looking for an income tax form from your mil that claims the income   getting too cute with the babysitting situation by starting a business just for the purpose of saving money on taxes could invite an audit also it is not as if you just claim 3000 and you are good to go you can only claim a percentage of the expenses based on the household agi the more the make the more you have to have in expenses to get the full 3000 credit which mil cause more taxes for your mil plus the whole issue with having to pay social security and other taxes on a household employee it might be best to skip the risk of the audit claiming your mil as a dependent might just be easier

you need an accountant and/or a lawyer who is familiar with the us tax code and the rules in south korea assuming from your tag as the interest will be money generated in the us you could be required to withhold some of the interest and remit it to the irs i believe 30 withholding rate since south korea is a treaty country your friend can complete and sign a form w8-ben and give it to you so you may withhold a lower amount your friend would need to file a return if too much was withheld they may also get taxed in south korea there are probably rules in south korea about minimum interest that must be charged similar to applicable federal rates for the us so check with your accountant or lawyer for this if you craft it correctly you will be able to have a loan as a mortgage with the house properly secured which then would allow you to deduct mortgage interest rates from your return as far as i am aware there is no maximum amount for loans

we played as kids when it was the most popular blog baseball the small and big kids dream game in the world way ahead of soccer and basketball was still a poor third we played it in the school yard using a tennis ball and became the highlight of every school boy ’s day   we knew and followed the basic rules of the game although we did not use or we played barefoot because we went to school barefoot we were children and we had the time of our life   the rules of baseball are not really that complicated almost anyone who can run swing a bat or throw a ball can join the fun later on we kids found out that there was such a thing as which was for girls but using a bigger ball that was thrown from the hip level instead of overhead   watching real baseball and games during athletic meets gave us a better understanding and appreciation of the game how we would have wanted to have all the uniform gears and field to play with but all we could afford was an old tennis ball and a homemade 2 in x 3 in lumber for a bat and bases made of stones or wood scraps   baseball as officially required has the following rules   1 basic features of the baseball game and field dimensions   baseball is played on a diamond shaped field with the base corner designated as the home base a player with a bat or a batter tries to hit the ball as far away from any of the opposing fielding team in order to reach all three bases and finally make it back to the home base if a player makes it to a base or two after he bats he must wait for his own team mates to hit the ball and give him the opening to move on around the bases   strategy and team play are important in maximizing the team ’s chance to score sometimes a team may sacrifice a batter just for a player to steal a base or score a run one point can spell the difference between winning and losing and such brilliant plays come in handy   2 team composition   each team has 9 players to fill up the following positions in the field when the opposing team is on the bat first base second base third base short stop right left and substitute players may also be included   3 regulations   the team on the bat is given three attempts to hit the ball thrown by a within the boundaries of the baseball field marked by the two lines made by the base first base and the home base third base a missed ball is called a strike and three strikes puts batter out of the field a team that gets three outs gets to field next while the other team bats   4 playing the ball   a flying ball that falls outside of the field boundaries is called a foul ball and gives a batter another chance to hit are unlimited a ball that is hit and falls inside the two lines is either caught in the air to put the batter out or if it rolls on the ground must be retrieved and often thrown to the first base player who will tag the batter with the ball to put him out failing to tag the batter who steps on or touches the base puts the batter safe on first base or wherever the batter may be as other move on around the diamond   a player who makes it safely back to home base scores a point if it is a meaning the ball is hit out of the filed or steals straight home if the defending team the ball two points are gained while a single point is given to a player who eventually goes round all the bases through one or more   5 other game features   when a team is struck out it take the field and lets the other team bat and attempt to score a foul ball which is caught will also count as an out multiple outs can be made such as when bases are loaded all three bases have and the batter on the plate hits a good ball and makes it to first base and the ball is retrieved and thrown back before the player running to second base reaches it then to home base before the player on third base scores a run and finally to third base to tag the player running to it three outs in one play   it is during such fast plays when the ball changes hands so rapidly and players are for bases that the excitement runs high it is cause for celebration for the scoring team and a big for the other who must probably feel like they were hit on the head with a bat several times for losing the big opportunity to score big and ending up with nothing   6 who wins   the team that makes the most runs after nine or rounds wins the game sometimes though the game will stop at the top of the 9th or before the other team is supposed to go to final bat if that team is already ahead in points as the lagging team will not be able to catch up anyway   some of the most memorable games end at the bottom of the when a team tries to catch up we might have heard of the familiar radio voice saying it ’s the bottom of the and bases are full and the new york are behind by four and has the bat the count is two strikes and three balls the winds up and throws the ball swings hard and the ball flies out of the stadium for a and a win or something to that effect   that imagined scene a dream every child and adult lover of baseball hopes to accomplish once in a lifetime you want to see and hear the whole stadium explode with people jumping and shouting as you take your sweet time running through the bases smiling waving your cap and finally kissing the home base   when a great player makes a good play everybody wins in baseball you have to be the eternal child to enjoy it and there are so many people out there who still enjoy it to this day

the currency market more often referred as forex or fx is the decentralized market through which the currencies are exchanged to trade currencies you have to go through a broker or an ecn there are a lot 's of them you can find a small list of brokers here on forex factory they will allow you to take very simple position on currencies for example you can buy eur usd by doing so you will make money if the eur usd rate goes up ie euro getting stronger against the us dollar and lose money if the eur usd rate goes down ie us dollar getting stronger against the euro in reality when you are doing such transaction the broker borrows usd sell it to buy eur and place it into an euro account they will charge you the interest rate on the borrowed currency usd and gives you the interest and the bought currency eur so if you bought a currency with high interest rate against one with low interest rate you will gain the interest rate differential but if you sold you will lose the differential the fees from the brokers are likely to be included in the prices at which you buy and sell currencies and in the interest rates that they will charge give you they are also likely to gives you big leverage to invest far more than the money that you deposited in their accounts now about how to make money out of this market that 's speculation there are no sure gains about it and telling you what you should do is purely subjective but the forex market as any market is directed by the law of supply and demand amongst what impacts supply and demands there are also and i do n't want to judge your friends but from experience peoples are likely to tell you about their winning transaction and not about their loosing ones

the strategy could conceivably work if you had sufficient quantity of shares to fill all of the outstanding buy orders and fill your lower buy orders   but in this case you are forcing the market down by selling and reinforcing the notion that there is a sell off by filling ever lower buy orders   there is the potential to trigger some stop loss orders if you can pressure it low enough   there is a lot of risk here that someone sees what you are doing and decides to jump in and buy forcing the price back up   could this work sure   but it is very risky and if you fail to create the panic selling then you risk losing big   i also suspect that this would violate sec rules and several laws   and if the price drops too far then trading on the stock would be halted and is likely to return at the appropriate price bottom line i can not see a scenario where you do not trigger the stop net a profit and end up with as many or more stock that you had in the first place

i think it 's easiest to illustrate it with an example if you 've already read any of the definitions out there then you know what it means but just do n't understand what it means   so we have an ice cream shop we started it as partners and now you and i each own 50 of the company it 's doing so well that we decide to take it public   that means that we will be giving up some of our ownership in return for a chance to own a smaller portion of a bigger thing with the money that we raise from selling stocks we 're going to open up two more stores   so without getting into too much of the nitty gritty accounting that would turn this into a valuation question let 's say we are going to put 30 of the company up for sale with these stocks leaving you and me with 35 each we file with the sec saying we 're splitting up the company ownership with 100,000 shares and so you and i each have 35,000 shares and we sell 30,000 to investors   then and this depends on the state in the us where you 're registering your publicly traded corporation those shares must be assigned a par value that a shareholder can redeem the shares at many corporations will use $ 1 or 10 cents or something nominal   and we go and find investors who will actually pay us $ 5 per share for our ice cream shop business we receive $ 150,000 in new capital but when we record that in our accounting $ 5 in total capital per share was contributed by investors to the business and is recorded as shareholder 's equity $ 1 per share totalling $ 30,000 goes towards actual shares outstanding and $ 4 per share totalling $ 120,000 goes towards capital surplus   these amounts will not change unless we issue new stocks the share prices on the open market can fluctuate but we rarely would adjust these edit i could n't see the table before dumbcoder has already pointed out the equation capital surplus = stock par value + premium per share number of shares based on my example it 's easy to deduce what happened in the case you 've given in the table in 2009 your company xyz had outstanding common stock issued for $ that 's probably a in thousands and b at a par value of $ 1 per share on those assumptions we can say that the company has shares outstanding for year end 2009   then if we guess that 's the outstanding shares we can also calculate the implicit average premium per share ÷ = = $ note that this is the average premium per share because we do n't know when the different stocks were issued at and it may be that the premiums that investors paid were different frankly we do n't care   so clearly since common stock in 2010 is up to $ it means that the company released more stock someone else can chime in on whether that means it was specifically a stock split or some other mechanism it does n't matter for understanding this you just need to know that the company put more stock into the marketplace = = more shares to be exact with the mechanics of rounding to the thousands i would guess this was a stock split   now what you can also see is that the capital surplus also increased = = the shares were issued into the market at an average premium of ÷ = = $ so investors probably paid or were given by the company an average of $ at this split   then in 2011 the company had another small adjustment to its shares outstanding the common stock went up and there was a corresponding increase in its capital surplus   without details around the actual stock volumes it 's hard to get more exact you 're also only giving us a portion of the balance sheet for your company so it 's hard to go into too much more detail hopefully this answers your question though

after a bit of rooting around the hmrc sites i found this page which says this one key difference is that products are classed as electronically supplied services for vat and customs duties these services are for vat purposes the place of supply of these services is the country in which the customer lives if you supply electronic services to a business customer in another european union eu country the customer accounts for any vat due in that country you should not charge uk vat if you supply electronic services to a consumer charity or government body in another eu country you have to account for uk vat if you supply electronic services to anyone in a country outside the eu you do n't pay any vat if as a uk business you buy electronic services from a company outside the uk you have to account for vat if i read this correctly i as the supplier of the website need to account for vat only if the sponsor is a consumer charity or government body in another eu country it is not covered in this site but i assume i must also account for vat for a customer based in the uk   so in answer to the original question a customer from canada which is currently outside the eu would account for the vat themselves and i would simply charge the gross amount

hitting the 25 marginal rate does not mean all of your earnings are taxed at 25 only those that exceed the top of the 15 bracket you can deduct any expenses for upgrading or repairing your apartments those are subtracted from the earnings before tax is calculated as income so you will probably stay in a lower marginal rate property tax will hit you annually and capital gains tax will hit you when you sell them at the end if you already have experience with this business in your home country then this sounds like a good option for you the only caution that i would give you is to find an accountant to help you with your taxes and pay for a consultation before you get started so that you know what to track that will help him her minimize your tax bill

this is not hypothetical this is an accurate story i am a long term investor i have a bunch of money that i 'd like to invest and i plan on spreading it out over five or six mutual funds and etfs roughly according to the canadian couch potato model portfolio that is passive mutual funds and etfs rather than specific stocks i am concerned that if i invest the full amount and the stock market crashes 30 next month i will have paid more than i had to as i am investing for the long term i expect to more than regain my investment but i still would n't be thrilled with paying 30 more than i had to instead i am investing my money in three stages i invested the first third earlier this month i 'll invest the next third in a few months and the final third a few months after that if the stock market climbs as i expect is more likely the case i will have lost out on some potential upside however if the stock market crashes next month i will end up paying a lower average cost as two of my three purchases will occur after the crash on average as a long term investor i expect the stock market to go up in the short term i expect much more fluctuation statistically speaking i 'd do better to invest all the money at once as most of the time the trend is upward however i am willing to trade some potential upside for a somewhat reduced risk of downside over the course of the next few months if we were talking a price difference of 1 as mentioned in the question i would n't care i expect to see average annual returns far above this but stock market crashes can cause the loss of 20 to 30 or more and those are numbers i care about i 'd much rather buy in at 30 less than the current price after all

the mathematics make it easier to understand why this is the case using very bad shorthand d1 and are inputs into n and n can be expressed as the probability of the expected value or the most probable value which in this case is the discounted expected stock price at expiration d1 has two which is volatility in the numerator and one in the denominator   cancelling leaves one on top   calculating when it 's infinity gives an n of 1 for s and 0 for k so the call is worth s and the put   at 0 for it 's the opposite more concise is that any mathematical moment be it variance which mostly influences volatility mean which determines drift or which mostly influences skew are all thus costs so the higher they are the higher the price of an option economically speaking uncertainties are costs   since costs raise prices and volatility is an uncertainty volatility raises prices it should be noted that bs assumes that prices are distributed   they are not   the closest distribution currently is the gamma distribution

i 'm another programmer i guess we all just like complicated things or got here via obligatory tedious but accurate point investing is not personal finance in fact it 's maybe one of the less important parts of it see this answer where to start with personal finance   obligatory warning for software developer type minds getting into investing because it 's complicated and therefore fun is a really awful idea from a financial perspective   or see behavioral finance research on how analytical professional creative type people are often terrible at investing while even tempered practical people are better the thing with investing is that inaction is better than action tried and true is better than creative and simple is better than complicated so if you 're like me and many programmers and like creative complicated action not good for the wallet you 've been warned that said stuff i read in general i hate reading too much financial information because i think it makes me take ill advised actions the actions i most need to take have to do with my career and my spending patterns so i try to focus on reading about software development for example or i answer questions on this site which at least might help someone out and i enjoy writing for basic financial news and research i prefer especially if you get the premium version the writing has more depth it 's often from qualified financial analysts and with the paid version you get data and analysis on thousands of funds and stocks instead of a small number as with motley fool newsletters i do n't follow morningstar regularly anymore instead i use it for research when i need to pick funds in a 401k or whatever another caveat on morningstar is that the star ratings on funds are dumb look at the analyst picks and the analyst instead i just flipped through my rss reader and i have 20 30 finance related blogs in there collecting posts it looks like the only one i regularly read is which is sort of random but i find david very thoughtful and interesting he 's also a conservative without being a partisan hack and posts frequently i read the weekly market comment at as well most weeks it says the market is overvalued so that 's predictable but the interesting part is the rationale and the other ideas he talks about i read a lot of software related blogs and there 's some bleed into finance especially from the vc world blogs like or or whatever anyway i spend most of my reading time on career related stuff and i think this is also the correct decision from a financial perspective if you were a doctor you 'd be better off reading about too i read finance related books fairly often i guess there are other threads listing ideas on that front i prefer books about principles rather than a of daily financial news and questionable ideas other than that i keep up with headlines just reading the paper every day including business related topics is good enough if there 's some big event in the financial markets it 'll show up in the regular paper take a class i initially learned about finance by reading a pile of books and alongside that taking the cfp course and the first cfa course both are probably equivalent to about a college semester worth of work but you can plow through them in a couple months each if you focus you can just do the class and take the exam if you like without having to go on and actually get the work experience and the certifications i did n't go on to do that this sounds like a crazy thing to do and it kind of is but i think it 's also sort of crazy to expect to be competent on a topic without taking some courses or otherwise getting pretty deep into the material if you 're a normal person and do n't have time to take finance courses you 're likely better off either keeping it super simple or else outsourcing if you can find the right advisor what exactly can a financial advisor do for me and is it worth the money   when it 's inevitably complex e.g. as you approach retirement then an advisor is best my mom is retiring soon and i found her a professional for example i like having a lot of knowledge myself because it 's just the only way i could feel comfortable so for sure i understand other people wanting to have it too but what i 'd share from the other side is that once you have it the conclusion is that you do n't have enough knowledge or time to do anything fancy anyway and that the simple answers are fine check out investing for fun is n't investing for profit many people recommend motley fool i see two on this question already the site is n't evil but the problem in my opinion is that it promotes an attitude toward and a style of investing that is n't objectively justifiable for practical reasons essentially i do n't think optimizing for making money and optimizing for having fun very well if investing is your chosen hobby rather than fishing or then motley fool can be fun with their tone and discussion forums but other people in forums are just going to make you go wrong money wise see behavioral finance research again talking to others is n't compatible with ice in your decision making also motley fool tends to make it sound like active investing is easier than it is there 's a reason the chartered financial analyst curriculum is a few reams of paper plus 4 years of work experience rather than reading blogs practical investing just buy the target date fund can be super easy but once you go beyond that it 's not i do n't really agree with the anyone can do it and it 's not work premise any more than i think that about or or computer programming after 15 years i 'm a programming expert after some courses and a lot of reading i 'm not someone who could professionally run an actively managed portfolio i think most of us need to have the fun part separate from the serious cash part maybe literally distinct accounts that you keep at separate brokerages or just do something else for fun besides investing morningstar has this problem too and and bloomberg i mean they are all interested in making you think about investing a lot more than you ought to they all have an incentive to convince you that the latest headlines make a difference when they do n't bottom line i do n't think personal finance changes very quickly the details of specific mutual funds change and there 's always some new twist in the tax code but the big picture is pretty stable i think going in depth say read the chartered financial analyst curriculum materials would teach you a lot more than reading blogs frequently the most important things to work on are income career and spending to maximize income minus spending that 's where time investment will pay off i know it 's annoying to argue the premise of the question rather than answering but i did try to mention a couple things to read somewhere in there

assuming a good credit score with no issues like bankruptcy they look at 2 ratios housing related debts and non housing debts for you the housing debts are principal and interest $ property taxes $ home insurance $ and hoa fee $ add these up $ you want this to be below 28 of your gross though some lenders use 33 for you year is or the 20 down payment saves you the pmi payments note that the deductions for interest and taxes already hidden in the ratio limits so do n't try to reduce the monthly impact by a expected deduction many lenders will require you to give them the money from taxes and insurance each month they will forward the funds to the government of insurance policy when the bills are due the 2nd ratio is for the non housing debts which you claim to be zero that should be less than 10 if they insist on keeping you below 28 you might need a lower rate or bigger down payment your current income and budget have allowed you to accumulate significant savings though you retirement balances seem low the savings and cd balances show that you could increase your spending each month without severely impacting your financial health should you buy ca n't be answered because that is an individual choice   keep in mind that home ownership also includes additional responsibilities that a renter can ask a landlord to fix and pay for that is the stuff that is impossible to predict

you should check the details of those balance transfers they typically have a 3 to 5 one time fee which means you pay nearly a year 's interest right away and then every time you transfer the total on again also this fee gets added to the credit card total and it is possibly considered paid last after you paid off the completed transferred balance so it cost interest for the whole time and that interest is different maybe 19.99 or worse it is probably a better idea to refinance for 5 years at < 3 and they pay off as fast as possible

comedy answer the mcdonalds corporation thinks about $ 600 or 30 the real answer is whatever you can part with and still have money left over for the rest of your budget   do n't consider your savings consider your monthly income this type of question is exactly why you need a budget   a budget is n't just a tool for getting out of debt it is a tool to help you understand your money and show you how much to spend on stuff so based on your costs utilities food shopping auto expenses savings etc how much is left from your monthly income   that would be what you can afford in rent also please notice that i still suggest you save money each month you have a great habit going and to lose it now would be a shame in my opinion   maybe while you are planning a budget you can start to roughly plan for buying a house or having a new car fund or having a pile of money for starting a family along with an emergency fund and a fully funded retirement    you do n't have to save 2/3 but save a dime of every dollar at least two dimes is better   in the future you will probably find it easier to spend more money rather than less and you will never get back the chance to save

i admit in the long term there are a good number of to work out but in the end i want to see some system where people in general can seize the means to their own well being without stepping on one another   the management you talked about is another reason why i prefer worker co ops to be the optimum form of issuing business because its not just a few people in charge it 's a whole social group acting in     when you discuss the mom and pop store having no suppliers it would be good to promote some way of each money supply to have a share of each industry within it   there are always some people in every trade looking for their next job   they just have to find a supply where there trade is in demand   the process is self feeding   next off or course the mechanism of the system would work in a way that firm 's ca n't just pay themselves with their own debt they have to issue it to their creditors first and even then it 's practically impossible to accept your own debt as payment   you would have to take some from a competitor at best     what i 've been trying to do is find some system where no one institution or no one alliance holds the keys to the definition of value   if you have five to eight dictators fighting at once as opposed to one financial dictator who can oversee all like the fed scenario you just described it 's more possible for people who are freer relatively to survive freely between the borders of these of influence as they can play each dictator off the other   at least from your dialogue i can see you 're one of those who gets what i 'm trying to aim for     here 's another idea i 've explored with it that 's similar but may make the environment slightly different so let me know what you think   what i call the revolving tax window where the government accepts different both in quantity and specific of notes in intervals of every business quarter so that the demand for specific notes changes four times a year   from january until the end of march they could accept taxes in notes from firms a f h and t and for april into june it could be just b and s and so on   the options for note issuing could be set on a list of firms registered with the sec or whoever    the combination for the quarter could be picked at random by a algorithm so no firm could make a plan to be a market dictator and a sense of is maintained in the economy     obviously the more firms are properly registered on this list the more combinations of monetary combinations you have and the more power is distributed from too much control by anybody     what you can do is choose whether or not you want there to be less or more notes in the next quarter because just like fiscal policy and conventional monetary policy the extremes have trade offs but different ones to few currencies the economy may be stimulated but you get market dictators via monetary oligopoly even if temporary   too many you avoid market dictators who will be more focused on getting a real return by investing in competing ventures based on what will actually return investment but the economy may not be as stimulated   what do you think of this structural alternative   one of the sources i 've been building my economic policy on has been debt the first 5,000 years by david if anyone 's familiar

i feel that getting money sooner than later is always advantageous if i offered you the choice between getting which option would you take i would take the last option and for the same reason from a purely numbers point of view i would argue that getting paid biweekly is preferable assuming the the annual salary is pro rated fairly and barring any compulsive spending habits your calculations suggest to me that they are trying to answer the question looking at a single year or month or some other fixed amount of time in a vacuum is there any financial benefit to being paid bi weekly over monthly the analysis seems to be focusing on comparing the two pay schedules on a month by month basis noting when one is paid bi weekly some months you get paid more times than the other however one could also compare the two pay schedules on a fortnight by fortnight basis and note that when one is paid monthly many you do n't get paid at all and some you get paid a lot or one could compare the two pay schedules on an hour by hour basis too but in the long run the money adds up to be the same amount i prefer getting it as soon as i can

you can take out the contributions to your roth tax and penalty free   that 's the good thing anything above the amount you contributed that you withdraw early will cost you ordinary income tax which is higher than capital gains tax plus a 10 percent penalty on that amount so if you have $ 15,000 in the account and $ 5,000 is gains and you withdraw $ 11,000 then you owe tax and penalty on $ 1,000   the penalty is 10 and your taxes high taxes are added to that   pretty bad deal if you kept it in a normal account and paid capital gains tax you just pay 15 or whatever on your gains and you get to offset income tax with your losses via tax loss harvesting so back to your question your idea works even better than you suggested if you only withdraw up to the amount that you contributed you pay no tax   take out any of the gains and you will be penalized more than you would if you just paid capital gains on them   leave those in until you are old enough to take them out penalty and tax free to me contributing to a roth making a bunch of gains on it and withdrawing only the contribution part whenever you want seems to make good sense

i 've thought that it was strange but the price that gets quoted on a stock exchange is just the price of the last transaction the irony of this definition of price is that there may not actually be any more shares available on the market at that price it 's also strange to me that the price is n't adjusted at all for the size of the transaction a transaction of just 1 share will post a new price even if just seconds earlier 100,000 shares traded for a different price ok unrealistic example but you get my point i 've always believed this is an odd way to describe the price anyway my here is supposed to illustrate the point that the fluctuations you see in price do n't really reflect changing valuations by the stock owning public each post in the exchange maintains a book of orders with unmatched buy orders on one side and unmatched sell orders on the other side if you go to your broker and tell him fill my order for 50,000 shares at market price then the broker wo n't fill you 50,000 shares at .20 instead he 'll buy the 50 .22 then 80 then 100 .30 etc because your order is so large compared to the unmatched orders your market order will get matched a bunch of the unmatched orders on the sell side and each match will notch the posted price up a bit if instead you asked the broker open a limit order to buy 50000 shares at .20 then the exchange will add your order to the book in this case your order likely wo n't get filled at all since nobody at the moment wants to sell at .20 and historically speaking it 's unlikely that such a seller will suddenly appear filling large orders is actually a common problem for institutional investors written by a professor i had in school

i think you can do it as long as those money do n't come from illegal activities money laundering etc the only taxes you should pay are on the interest generated by those money while sitting in the uk bank account since i suppose you already paid taxes on those money in greece while you were earning those money about being audited in my own experience banks do n't ask you much where your money are coming from when you bring money to them they are very willing to help and happy it 's a story when you ask to borrow money when i opened a bank account in us i did not even have an ssn but they did n't care much they just took my passport and used the passport number for registering the account obviously on the interest generated by the money in the us bank account i had to pay taxes but it was easy because i simply let the irs via the bank to the 27 on the interest generated not on the capital deposited i did n't put a huge amount of money there i had to live there for 1 year or some more maybe if i deposited a huge amount of money someone would have come to ask me how did i make all those money but those money were legally generated by me working in italy before so i did n't have anything to be afraid about btw in italy i was thinking to move money to a german bank in germany the risk of default is a nightmare something of new now in compared to the past where each state had its own currency according to muro history says that in case of default it happened that some government prevented people from withdrawing money form bank accounts yes historically governments have    shut down banks to prevent people from    withdrawing their money in times of    crisis see argentina circa 2001 or us    during great depression the    government prevented people from    withdrawing their money and people    could do nothing while their money    rapidly lost value but in case greece prevents people from money those money are still in euro so i 'm wondering what would be the effect i mean would it be fair that a greek guy can not withdraw is euro money an italian guy can withdraw the same currency money in italy

this is the kind of scenario addressed by reddit 's /r personalfinance prime directive or i have $ x what should i do with it it follows a fairly linear for personal spending beginning with a budget and essential costs the gist of the is to cover your most immediate costs and risks first while also maximizing your benefits it sounds like you would fall somewhere around steps 1 and 3 step 2 wo n't apply since this is not pretax income if you do n't already have at least $ 1000 reserved in an emergency fund that 's a great place to start after that you 'll want to use the rest to pay down your debt your credit card debt is very high interest and should be treated as a financial emergency besides the balance of your gift you may want to throw whatever other funds you have saved beyond one month 's expenses at this problem as far as which card since you have multiple debts you 're faced with the classic choice of which payoff method to use snowball lowest balance first or avalanche highest interest rate first avalanche is more financially optimal but less immediately personally since your 26 apr debt is so large and so high interest i would recommend focusing every available penny on that card until it is paid off and then never use it again again per the that means using everything left over after steps 0 2 are fulfilled

for the period 1950 to 2009 if you adjust the s&p 500 for inflation and account for dividends the average annual return comes out to exactly source currently inflation is around 2   so your 2 apy is a 0 real return where the stock market return is 7   i.e. on average stocks have a return that is higher by 7    if you mix in bonds 70 stocks to 30 bonds your real returns will drop to around 5.5 but you are safer in individual years bonds often have good years when stocks have bad years    we 're making a bit of a false dichotomy here   we 're talking about returns on stocks in retirement accounts versus returns on cds in regular accounts   you can buy stocks in regular accounts and it is legally possible to have a cd in a retirement account   so you can get bankruptcy protection and tax advantages with a cd

largely it comes down to the complexity of your return likely relatively simple if it 's your first time filing and your comfort level with using software more complex returns would include filing business claims handling stocks and investments special return forms etc   one benefit to most of the software options out there such as turbotax hr block and tax are that they are free to use and you only pay when you 're ready to file you could give them a shot to see how easy difficult they are and if you feel overwhelmed then contact a cpa whose time wo n't be free also remember that those hr block seasonal places that open up are not cpa 's but are temps hired and trained to use the software that you would find online you did n't indicate they were an option but i like to point that out to those who might not know otherwise   my opinion would be to use one of the online options because of cost and their ease of use they also allow you to take your time and save your progress so you can start using it and go ask questions do research on your own time

anything where the initial step of someone trying to get you into anything financial is to send you an e mail there are valid situations in which e mails may be used to introduce you to a financial product or offer such as if you have signed up for an electronic newsletter that includes such information but in that particular case the e mail is n't the first step rather whatever caused you to sign up for the newsletter was even in a valid legitimate scenario you should obviously still perform due diligence and research the offer before committing any of your money but the odds that someone is contacting you out of the blue via e mail with a legitimate financial offer are tiny the odds that a lawyer a banker or someone similar in a remote country would initially contact you via e mail are yet smaller i 'd call those odds non zero but unlikely enough that it is probably more likely that you would win the grand prize in the state lottery four times in a row keep in mind that responding in any way to spam e mails will simply confirm to the sender that your e mail address is valid and is being read that is likely to cause you to receive more spam not less no matter the content of your response hence it is better to flag the e mail as spam or junk if your e mail provider offers that feature or just delete it if they do n't the same general principles as above also apply to social media messaging and similar venues but the exact details are highly likely to differ somewhat

two principles in comparing different scenarios   1 keep the two scenarios as equal as possible in amount and timing of payments   and 2 find the financial comparison at one particular point so your car loan $ 10,000 for 35 months at 8 compounded monthly means you 're paying $ suppose you make the switch and keep on paying the same mortgage and $ for the 35 months see 1 above those extra payments continued for 35 months at your mortgage rate of will pay off a mortgage of $ which will more than pay off the $ 10,000 you added to the mortgage   in other words making the switch will benefit you to the tune of as of the day of the switch   you could ask the mortgage company to give you the $ 10,000 and the $ and all your payments and amortization would stay the same see 2 above of course this is pretty much what joe taxpayer said

much of this is incorrect aetna owns for starters and it 's your employer who decides which banks and brokers to offer not an hsa is a checking account with an investment account option after a minimum balance is met a majority of u.s. employers only offer an hsa option but do n't contribute a penny so you 're lucky you get anything   the easy solution is just keep the money that is sent to your hsa checking account in your checking account and once a year roll it over into a different bank 's hsa the vast majority of banks offer hsas that have no ties to a particular broker i.e. citibank pnc chase i have all my hsa funds in hsa bank which is online but services lots of employers not true that most payroll deductions or employer contributions go to a single hsa custodian bank   they might offer a single bank that either contracts with an investment provider or lets you invest anywhere but most employers making contributions are large or mid market employers offering multiple banks and that trend is growing fast because of defined contribution private exchanges and vendor product basically nobody likes having a second bank account for their hsa when their home bank offers one

most online high yield savings accounts are paying just above 1   that would be 1.05 for american express personal savings or 1.15 for currently depending on the length of the season you might want to work in some cd 's   six months cds can be had at 1.2 and 9 month at 1.25   so if you know you wo n't need some of your earnings for 9 months you could earn 1.25 on your money however i would proceed with caution on anything other than the high yield savings account   with your one friend having such a low emergency fund there is very little room for error   perhaps until that amount is built up into something significant it is just best to stick with the online savings of course one solution would be to find a way to create income during the off season   that will go a long way into helping one build wealth

i contacted stephen the author of home business tax deductions to let him know that this question was missing from his book he was kind enough to send a reply my original phrasing of the question if your car is used for both business and personal use and you deduct via the actual expense method do trips to the mechanic gas station and auto parts store to service or repair the car count as business miles personal miles or part business part personal miles what about driving the newly purchased car home from the dealership and his response good question i can find nothing about this in irs publication or elsewhere however common sense would tell us that the cost of driving to make car repairs should be deductible if you use your car for business it is a business expense just like transporting any other piece of business equipment for repairs is a business expense this should be so whether you use the standard mileage rate or actual expense method you should probably reduce the amount of your deduction by the percentage of personal use of the car during the year the same goes for driving a car home from the dealer

generally s&p 500 will be used as the benchmark for us investors because it represents how 's the us market performs as a whole if you 've outperformed the s&p 500 during the last couple years great however at the end of day you would want to look at the total growth percent that your portfolio has achieved as compared with that of s&p 500   anyway your portfolio might actually ride along with the bull market during the 2009 2010 period more so for the small caps
