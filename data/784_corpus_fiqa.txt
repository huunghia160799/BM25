you do n't even need to formally loan the llc any money you pay for the setup costs out of pocket and then once the llc is formed you reimburse yourself just like with an expense report essentially you submit an expense report to the llc for the startup costs and the llc pays out a check to you categorized for the startup expenses

if you have a single member llc there is no need to separate expenses in this way since it is simply treated as part of the owner 's normal tax returns   this is the way i 've been operating owner of single member llc    if a single member llc does not elect to be treated as a corporation the llc is a disregarded entity and the llc 's activities should be reflected on its owner 's federal tax return if the owner is an individual the activities of the llc will generally be reflected on form 1040 schedule c profit or loss from business sole proprietorship pdf form 1040 schedule e supplemental income or loss pdf form 1040 schedule f profit or loss from farming pdf an individual owner of a single member llc that operates a trade or business is subject to the tax on net earnings from self employment in the same manner as a sole proprietorship    if the single member llc is owned by a corporation or partnership the llc should be reflected on its owner 's federal tax return as a division of the corporation or partnership

an llc is a pass through entity in the usa so profits and losses flow through to the individual 's taxes   thus an llc has a separate tin but the pass through property greatly simplifies tax filings as compared to the complicated filings required by c corps

how do i account for this in the bookkeeping here is an example below   this is how you would accurately contributions made by an owner for a business if you would want to remove money from your company or pay yourself back this would be called withdrawals it would be the inverse of the first journal entry with cash on the credit side and withdrawals on the debited side as it is an expense   you and your business are not the same thing you are two different entities this is why you are taxed as two different entities when you the owner make contributions it is considered to be the cash of the business from here you will make these expenses against the business and not yourself   good luck

if you are using software like quickbooks or even just using spreadsheets or tracking this without software use two equity accounts something like capital contributions and capital distributions when you write a personal check to the company the money goes into the company 's checking account and also increases the capital contribution account in accordance with double entry accounting practices when the company has enough retained earnings to pay you back you use the capital distributions equity account and just write yourself a check you can also make general journal entries every year to zero out or balance your two capital accounts with retained earnings which i think is an automatically generated equity account in quickbooks if this sounds too complex you could also just use a single capital contributions and distributions equity account for your contributions and distributions

typically you give a loan to the company from yourself as a private person and when the company makes money the company pays it back to you then the company pays for all the expenses with the money from the loan   even if you do n't want a business account yet you can probably ask your bank for a second account mine in the uk did that without any problems

hey i 'm   sure its been asked before and i 've read around a bit online but wondering your guys opinion    you could say i was sort of a late in terms of maturity awareness well regardless i 've found myself extremely interested in stocks and options and would love to get a cfa some day like most other people on this sub only problem is i 'm not nearly qualified on paper for a career in finance at this point    i work in a back office support center of one of the largest insurance companies in the world i began interning there a little over a year ago made myself familiar with all their products taught myself tons of concepts etc i got bloomberg certified not that that s an accomplishment or anything so i think i have a decent understanding of concepts valuation but i do n't have any formal modeling experience though i have played around in excel a bit i studied abroad spring semester of last year and interned at a strategic communications firm that worked closely with private companies which i thoroughly researched along with legislation policy etc    i 'm wondering what if any options i have to transition to a career in finance i 'd assume mba so far based on my reading but i 'm wondering if anyone thinks i could make a half decent case for say an entry level equity research role i 'm based out of the greater new york area though which probably does n't help my odds    i know i have a lot left to learn still but i think i am actually interested for the right reasons i love the markets i think i know how to research analyze decently and could do the job but i know i 'm not a compelling candidate on paper    any ideas for breaking in or should i just sit tight for a few years get my mba and try to transition then

you are asking what if do you have some anticipated answers having volume smaller than open interest is the norm as far as i can tell having only one trading day and no previous open interest only affects someone trying to sell a contract they are holding   meaning that if you only have one day to sell your contract then you need to offer it at market or at the bid price or even lower than the bid price if you can not sell your contract then you have to let it expire worthless or you have to exercise it those are your three options let it expire sell it perhaps at a loss and exercise it   edit be careful about holding an in the money option many brokers will automatically exercise an in the money contract if you hold it till expiration date

if the job looks good i would n't let having to relocate stop you some companies will help you with relocation expenses like paying travel expenses the movers the security deposit on an apartment etc it does n't hurt to ask if they help with moving expenses if they say no fine i would n't expect a company to decide not to hire you   for asking such a question i would certainly not buy immediately upon moving buying a house is a serious long term commitment what if after a few months you discover that this job is not what you thought it was what if you discover that you hate the area for whatever reason etc or even if you are absolutely sure that wo n't happen it 's very hard to buy a house long distance how many trips can you make to look at different houses learn about neighborhoods get a feel for market prices etc a few years ago i moved just a couple of hundred miles to a neighboring state and i rented an apartment for about 2 years before buying a house for all these reasons assuming the company wo n't help with moving expenses do you have the cash to make the move if you 're tight it does n't have to be all that expensive if you 're six months out of college you probably do n't have a lot of stuff when i got my first job out of college i fit everything i owned in the back seat of my and tied my one piece of furniture to the roof if you ca n't fit all your stuff in your car rent a truck and a tow bar to pull your car behind get a cheap apartment you 'll probably have to pay the first month 's rent plus a security deposit you can usually furnish your first apartment from garage sales and the like very cheaply if you do n't have the cash do you have credit cards or can your parents loan you some money they might be willing to loan you money to get you out of their house

before answering specific question you are liable to pay tax as per your bracket on the income generated i work with my partner and currently we transfer all earning on my personal bank account can this create any issue for me if you are paying your partner from your account you would need to maintain proper paperwork to show the portion of money transferred is not income to you alternatively create a join current account move funds there and then move it to your respective accounts which sort off account should be talk and by whose name can be any account savings current if you are doing more withdrawls open current else open savings it does not matter on who s name the account is paperwork to show income matters from tax point of view what should we take care while transfering money from freelance site to bank nothing specific is there any other alternative to bank there is paypal etc however ultimately it flows into a bank account what are other things to be kept in mind keep proper record of actual income of each of you along with expenses there are certain expenses you can claim from income for example laptop internet mobile phone etc consult a ca he will be able to guide and it does not cost much

congratulations on saving up $ 75,000   that requires discipline and   there are a lot of factors that would go into making your decision    first and foremost is the security of the income stream you have now   being leveraged during times of hardship is not a pleasant experience   unexpected job losses can and do happen   only you can determine how secure your and your spouse 's situation is    second i would consider the job market in the location that you live   if you live in a small town it will be hard to find income levels like you have now   rental properties are additional ties to an area   are you happy in the area in which you live   if you were laid off are there opportunities in the same area   being a long distance landlord is again not a pleasant experience   i can throw being forced to sell to relocate at a reduced price into this same bucket third you need to have 3 to 6 months of expenses saved for emergencies   this is in addition to having no consumer debt credit cards car loans student loans   $ 75,000 feels like a lot   life can throw you curve balls   you need to be prepared for them because of the fundamental nature of murphy 's law   if you were to be a landlord you should err closer to the six month end of the scale   i own two rentals and can speak to people being late a given month heating and air problems plumbing issues washers and dryers breaking weather related issues and even a tenant leaving behind for of trash   over 20 years i guess i have seen it all   a rental agency will only act as a minor buffer    fourth your family situation is important   i personally save 10 of my income for my child 's education   if you have n't started doing so or have different feelings on what you might contribute think about it before any financial move fifth any mortgage payment you are making should be 25 or less than your take home pay for a 15 year fixed rate mortgage   anything less than 20 down and you start burning up money on pmi insurance   house poor is a term for people that make high incomes but have too much being spent for housing   it is the cause of a lot of financial stress sixth you need to save for retirement   the absolute minimum i recommend is 15 of your income   even if the match is 6 you should invest the full 15 making it 21   social security is a scary thing and depending on it is not wise   i think your income still qualifies you for contributions to a roth ira   if you are n't personally contributing 15 do so before making a move there is an old joke that homeless people who have a 0 net worth often are richer than people driving fancy cars and living in fancy houses   ultimately no one can tell you the right answer   every situation is unique   you have a complex to your financial life that no else one knows

and the fact that if notes trade up high enough they tend to get taken out with lower yielding notes pending the call schedule so in theory there is more limited upside in high yield whereas equity could theoretically trade to infinity   the positives for high yield is that they generate monthly cash flow via coupon payments and have less down side relative to equities naturally this lower down side comes at the expense of lower up side as well

firstly the agent does n't work for you he works for himself   it 's in his interest not to get you a house at the lowest cost but to sell you a house the higher the price the higher his commission is or the higher the probability that the seller will sell it meaning less work for him it depends on the market what price you should give if i were you i would do my own research about this area and not just trust the agent 's assessment of it being a seller 's market not sure where we are talking about but as you know house prices have fallen a lot in the last few years and the economy is n't doing that well it also depends on yourself every house is different and there 's an emotional attachment to buying property how much do you really want this house would it matter if you did n't get it are you prepared to keep looking if this is your dream house then maybe it is worth offering a bit more to ensure that you get it if not and you are prepared to wait then yeah i would shoot a little lower and see what they say one thing i will say though is generally even if you give them a low offer unless they 're getting lots of other offers or they have to sell urgently alot of the times the seller will come back and try to negotiate with you anyway after all it 's business and they 're there to get the highest price

that sounds about right however and this is just a quibble it 's not 90 m notional of swap or at least i 've not heard it expressed quite that way for a total return instrument generally i hear the word exposure in this case the of shares purchased at a specific index level so 90 mm exposure in s&amp;p 500 at today 's closing price is = a swap on 37 shares   if you want to maintain the 90 mm exposure month to month you will structure the instrument with a variable notional at each reset the swap 's of shares will vary inversely with the index level to maintain the 90 mm exposure   you rightly point out that the financing is based on the 90 mm figure   as a final note the dealer may also guarantee some profit by quoting a spread between the swap 's initial index levels depending on whether the portfolio wants to go long or short the index

most likely this will not work they way you think first things first to get a loan the bank needs to accept your collateral note that this is not directly related to the question what you plan to do with the loan example you have a portfolio of stocks and bonds worth usd 2 million the bank decides to give you a loan of usd 1 million against that collateral the bank does n't care if you will use the loan to invest in foreign re or use it up in a casino it has your collateral as safety so from the way you describe it i take it you do n't have the necessary local collateral but you wish to use your foreign investments as such in this case it really does n't matter where you live or where you incorporate a company the bank will only give you the loan if it accepts the foreign collateral from professional experience with this exact question i can tell you there are very few banks that will lend against foreign property and there are even less banks if any that will lend against foreign projects to sum it up just forget banks you might find a private lender to help you out but it will cost you dearly the best option you have is to find a strategic partner who can cough up the money you need but since he is taking the bigger risk he will also take the bigger profit share

you need to find out exactly   how the two accounts are titled if an account   is an ugma uniform gifts to minors act account that is in your name with your mother father as custodian then you are entitled to all the money in the account when you become an adult if the account is indeed a ugma account   the bank is supposed to not let the custodian operate the account once the   child becomes an adult but this does not always happen   there was a   question earlier on money se which i can not find at this time in which   the 25-year old person asking the question claimed that   his father was still buying and selling shares in his ugma brokerage   account and the irs was asking why the profits and losses from these transactions were not being reported on the 25-year old 's tax return money in an ugma account is not supposed to be used for payment of household expenses food etc which is the parent 's responsibility during the minority but this can well be abused as to whether money was taken out and then restored or possibly not restored as you seem to suspect it is possible to sue the custodian for improper handling of the ugma account and recover the funds but whether one wants to sue a parent over what might be a relatively small sum is another matter consider whether most of what is recovered might go to pay legal fees or other costs of the recovery process and will likely ruin a family relationship if the accounts are titled as joint accounts then either party can empty the account without informing the other but doing so would need information about the account number etc which you may not have for tax purposes there is also the issue of whose social security   number is listed on the account yours or your parent 's see also this answer   for a view of what happens from the other side

ianal but as you note when you open a new account they give you temporary checks that are usually blank in the upper left i 've used such checks and the bank has honored them therefore i conclude that there must not be any legal requirement for anything to appear there nor does the bank require it businesses are often reluctant to accept such temporary checks for the obvious reason that anyone could go to the bank open an account with $ 10 write checks for thousands of dollars and disappear at least if they 've waited long enough to get the permanent checks in there 's some reason to believe that they plan to stick around   in any case it 's not clear what you are trying to accomplish you want to hand write either your business name or your personal name depending on whether the check is for personal or business purposes i do n't see what that gains you could always use a personal check for business purposes if you 're afraid someone will say hey that does n't look very professional what kind of fly by night company is this that uses personal checks surely a hand written company name would look even less professional why not just open a business account and have your personal checks printed with your personal name and your business checks with your business name i do n't know where you live but i have a business account on which i pay zero fees the only cost is getting checks printed there 's the small hassle of having to make one trip to the bank to open the account well the biggest hassle i have is that the bank wo n't let me transfer money between my personal and business accounts over the internet so i have to either go to the bank to move money back and forth or i have to write a check from one account to the other and deposit through an atm

normally you do n't pay capital gains tax until you actually realize a capital gain   however there are some exceptions the exception that affected is the expatriation tax or exit tax   if you leave a country and are no longer a tax resident your former country taxes you on your unrealized capital gains from the period that you were a tax resident of that country   there are several countries that have an expatriation tax including the united states   left the u.s. before the facebook ipo was perhaps already planning on leaving the u.s. he is originally from brazil and has investments in asia so leaving before the ipo limited the amount of capital gains tax he had to pay upon his exit   source wall street journal so how much did he really save another situation that might be considered an exception and affects a lot of us is capital gain distributions inside a mutual fund   when mutual fund managers sell investments inside the fund and realize gains they have to distribute those gains among all the mutual fund investors   this often takes the form of additional shares of the mutual fund that you are given and you have to pay capital gains tax on these distributions   as a result you can invest in a mutual fund leave your money there and not sell but have to pay capital gains tax anyway   in fact you could owe capital gains tax on the distributions even if the value of your mutual fund investment has gone down

i 'm no expert on this topic but i 'll share my reasoning   one of the main themes of capitalism is profit over everything since the industrial revolution and the invention of the lightbulb two things have been happening 1 income inequality grows farther and farther apart 2 workers work more and more hours for the same or less pay so fast forward to today 's times and 8 people own 50 of the worlds wealth because capitalism and free market tactics allow those people to and insane amount of wealth   2008 united basically made bribes legal in america    so because of capitalism corporations are able to heavily influence the government so i think capitalism is a bigger problem than government

the statistic you cited comes from the federal reserve board 's survey of consumer finances a survey that they do every three years most recently in 2013   this was reported in the september 2014 issue of the federal reserve bulletin   they list the percentage of americans with any type of debt as in 2013 down slightly from in 2010 the bulletin also has a table with a breakdown of the types of debt that people have and primary residence mortgages are at the top of the list   so the answer is yes the 75 statistic includes americans with home mortgages the bigger question is are you really in debt if you have a home mortgage   the answer to that is also yes   when you take out a mortgage you really do own the house   you decide who lives there you decide what changes you are going to make to it and you are responsible for the upkeep   but the mortgage debt you have is secured by the house   this means that if you refuse to pay the bank is allowed to take possession of the house   they do n't even get the whole house though they will sell it to recoup their losses and give you back whatever equity you had in the house after the loan is satisfied is it good debt   many people think that if you are borrowing money to purchase an appreciating asset the debt is acceptable   with this definition a car loan is bad credit card debt is very bad and a home mortgage might be okay   even dave ramsey radio host and champion of the debt free lifestyle is not opposed to home mortgages   home mortgages allow people to purchase a home that they would otherwise be unable to afford interestingly according to the bulletin credit card balances were only included as debt for the survey purposes if there was a balance after the most recent bill was paid not including purchases made after the bill   so people that do not carry a balance on their credit card were not considered in debt in this statistic

excellent questions and i appreciate that     the fact is that we do need employees in the workforce in all sectors blue collar white collar   the problem is the shift in the economy and how companies are responding to it   the corp execs only look at the bottom line especially when they are a public have to impress wall street as their first priority   so what happens when profits and growth dip   they immediately start looking for ways to cut the budget and it 's usually by firing lay offs and/or offshore outsourcing   it 's happening daily unfortunately     if you live in the u.s. there 's no reason to be living in poverty people are dying to get in this country because of the freedom and opportunities we have   it 's all about mindset and how you view the world     here 's my advice i do n't know you or your background but i can feel the frustration and where your mindset is   first remove the negative self talk from your language   saying that you 're broke and have no money will force the universe to leave you in that state   start reading books on how to improve yourself first   change starts with us not outside forces   this is real shit my friend not just some hype talk     next if you need a rat race job to make ends meet then do it even if you have a college degree   drop the ego and do what you got ta do     find something that you and you love to do and figure out how to make cash doing it   there are so many options out there you just have to be willing to find them and open up your mind     i 'll leave you with that for now if you 'd like to connect on social media and learn more about this topic let me know and i 'll give you my details     have an awesome day   william

yes you should budget some amount of your emergency fund for healthcare expenses   how much you budget is really dependent on your particular anticipated costs   be aware that health insurance likely costs significantly more than your employer charges you for access to its plan since healthcare reform mandated guaranteed issue individual coverage you will have the ability to buy individual coverage for you and if applicable your family   when buying individual coverage you have essentially two choices your decision hinges on whether or not you 'd qualify for a premium subsidy   if your agi is below 400 of the poverty line you 'll be able to receive subsidized coverage at a state or federal health insurance exchange   if the subsidy is not meaningful to you or you would n't qualify you can buy an off exchange plan offered either directly through a carrier or an insurance agent some insurance agents are also licensed to sell exchange plans though it 's somewhat rare   in order to receive subsidized coverage you must buy through a state or federal exchange or an agent licensed to sell exchange products specifically if your employer was large enough to be required to offer its plan via cobra or you live in a state that extends the cobra requirement to smaller businesses you can choose that as well   bear in mind this option is likely to be expensive relative to individual plans   it 's becoming a less relevant solution with the advent of guaranteed issue individual coverage   cobra is not a special type of insurance it 's a mandate that your employer allow you to remain on its plan but pay the full gross premium plus an up to 2 10 for administrative fee popular there is no such thing as obamacare or aca coverage   obamacare the insurance market   the aca outlines certain minimum coverage requirements generally referred to as minimum essential coverage   while employers and plans are not required to meet all of these coverage requirements there is a penalty associated with non compliance   the single exception to this is grandfathered plans which can still sidestep a few of the requirements   the penalty is harsh enough that it 's not worth the cost of offering a non compliant plan whether you buy coverage through a state or federal exchange through an insurance agent or via your employer 's cobra program you will have aca coverage unless on the off chance your employer 's plan does n't check the minimum essential coverage box   so generally all plans available to you will have $ 0 preventive coverage pregnancy benefits cancer treatment benefits etc another thing to consider is your entire family does n't need to be on the same plan   if your family is healthy with the exception of one child you can purchase $ 0 deductible coverage for the one child and higher deductible more catastrophic plan for the remainder of your family in fact you could choose cobra for one child and purchase individual coverage for the remainder of the family   the things to consider when you face a lay off i tried to mitigate my use of all and always because there are some narrow exceptions to these requirements such as the hobby lobby decision allowing closely held organizations with highly religious owners the ability to remove certain benefits   understand that these exceptions are rare and not available to individual plans

from the details you have given it looks like you have unit linked insurance policy in such policies a part of the premium goes towards the insurance the balance is invested into mutual funds stock market it is generally not advisable to have unit linked policy compared to pure term policy generally the amount of fees charged for unit linked policy is high and hence the returns to the end user are low i.e. if you buy a term insurance for the same sum insured and invest on your own the balance in any mutual fund you will end up making more that what you are getting now typically these policies have 3 years lock in period as you have purchased this in 2008 you can cancel the policy without any penalties this will save you future premium and you can buy a term insurance and invest the difference yourself note the unit linked policy is useful for people who do not invest on their own and this is a good way to be forced into saving than nothing else

see also the question how many stocks i can exercise per stock warrant and my comments there clearly at the prices you quote it does not seem sensible to exercise your warrants at the moment since you can still by units 1 stock + 1/3 warrant and bare stock at below the $ 11.50 it would cost you to exercise your warrant   so when would exercising a warrant become a sensible thing to do obviously if the price of the bare stock which you say is currently $ were to sufficiently exceed $ 11.50 then it would clearly be worth exercising a warrant and immediately selling the stock you receive sufficiently exceed to account for any dealing costs in selling the newly acquired stock however looking more closely $ 11.50 is n't the correct cut off price consider three of the units you bought at $ each for $ you received three shares of stock and one warrant for an additional $ 11.50 $ in total you can have a total of four shares of stock at the equivalent of $ each so if the price of the bare stock rises above $ then it could become sensible to exercise one warrant and sell four shares of stock again allowing a margin for the cost of selling the stock the trading price of the original unit 1 stock + 1/3 warrant should n't i believe directly affect your decision to exercise warrants although it would be a factor in deciding whether to resell the units you 've already got as you say if they are now trading at $ then having bought them at $ you would make a profit if sold unless i 'm missing something or the figures you quote are incorrect the current price of the unit 1 stock + 1/3 warrant $ seems overpriced compared to the price of the bare stock $ reversing the above calculation if bare stock is trading at $ then four shares would cost $ deducting the $ 11.50 cost of exercising this would value three combined units at $ or $ each which is considerably below the market price you quote one reason the unit 1 stock + 1/3 warrant is trading at $ instead of $ could be that the market believes the price of the bare share currently $ will eventually move towards or above $ 11.50 if that happens the option of exercising warrants at $ 11.50 becomes more and more attractive the premium presumably reflects this potential future benefit finally surely i am misunderstand the stock ipo 's intent presumably the main intent of social capital was to raise as much money as possible through this ipo to fund their future activities the positive view is that they expect this future activity to be profitable and therefore the price of ordinary stock to go up at least as far as ideally way beyond the $ 11.50 exercise price and the offering of warrants will be seen as a thank you to those investors who took the risk of taking part in the ipo a completely cynical view would be that they do n't really care what happens to the stock price but that offering free stuff or what looks like free stuff will simply attract more punters to the ipo in reality the truth is probably somewhere between those two extremes

please clarify your question what do you mean by loan in greece if you are referring to taking a mortgage loan to purchase residential property in greece there are two factors to consider if the loan originates from a greek bank then odds are likely that the bank will be nationalized by the government if greece defaults if the loan is external i.e. from j.p. morgan or some foreign bank then the default will certainly affect any bank that trades maintains euros but banks that are registered outside of greece wo n't be nationalized so what does mean for your loan you will still be expected to pay it according to the terms of the contract i 'd recommend against an adjustable rate contract since rates will certainly rise in a default situation as for property that 's a different story there have been reports of violence in greece already and if the country defaults imposes austerity measures etc odds are there will be more violence that can harm your property furthermore there is a remote possibility that the government can attempt to acquire your private property unlikely but possible you could sue in this scenario on property rights violations but things will be very messy from that point on if greece does n't default but just exits the euro zone the situation will be similar the drachma will be weak and confidence will be poor and unrest is a likely outcome these are not statements of facts but rather my opinion because i can not peek into the future nonetheless i would advise against taking a mortgage for property in greece at this point in time

i will answer the question from the back who can not afford luxury cars those whose parents paid for their college education can not afford luxury cars but buy them anyway why i have what may seem a rather shocking proposition related to the point of not saving for kids college parents do not owe children a college education why should they did your parents fund your college or did you get it through a mix of pell grants loans and work if they did then you owe them $ back for it adjusted for inflation if they did not well then why do you feel your children deserve more than you deserved when you were a child you do not owe your children a college education they owe it to themselves gifts do not set one up for success they set one up for dependence    i will add one more hypothesis financial discipline is best learned through one 's own experiences when an 18 + year old adult gets a very large amount of money as a gift every year for several years in the form of paid tuition does that teach them frugality and responsibility my proposition is that those who get a free ride on their parents backs are not well served in terms of becoming disciplined they become the subjects of the question in this post those why buy cars and houses they can not afford and pay for vacations with credit cards we reap what we as a society   of course college is only one case in point but a very illustrative one the bigger point is that financial discipline can only be developed when there are opportunities to develop it such opportunities arise under one important condition financial independence   what does buying children cars for their high school graduation buying them 4 years of college tuition and buying them who knows what else study abroad trips airfare apartment leases textbooks etc etc teach does it teach independence or dependence   it can certainly at least that 's what you hope for teach them to appreciate when others do super nice things for them but does free money instill financial responsibility   try to ask kids whose parents paid for their college why they did it because my parents want me to succeed is probably the best you can hope for now ask them but do your parents owe you a college education why yes i guess they do why well i guess because they told me they do they said they owe it to me to set me up for success in life now think about this do people who become financially successful achieve that success because someone owed something to them or because they recognized that nobody owes them anything and took it upon themselves to create that success for themselves these are not very comfortable topics to consider especially for those of you who have either already sunk many tens of thousands of dollars into your childrens college education or for those who have been living very frugally and for the past 10 15 years driven by the goal of doing so but i want to open this can of worms because i believe fundamentally it may be creating more problems than it is solving i am sure there are some historical and cultural explanations for the assumption that has at some point formed in the american society that parents owe their children a college education   but as with most social conventions it is merely an idea a shared belief it has become so ingrained in conversations at work parties and family that it seems that many of those who are advocates of the idea of paying for their childrens education no longer even understand why they feel that way they simply go with the flow of social expectations unwilling or unable to question either the premises behind these expectations or the long term consequences and results of such expectations   with this comment i want to point to the connection between the free financial gifts that parents give to their adult children and the level of financial discipline of these young adults their spending habits sense of entitlement and sense of responsibility over their financial decisions the statistics of the u.s. savings rate average credit card debt foreclosures and bankruptcy indeed tell a troubling story   my point is that these trends do n't just happen because of lots of tv advertising and the proverbial jones 's these trends happen because of a lack of financial education discipline and experience with balancing one 's own checkbook perhaps we need to think more deeply about the consequences of our socially motivated decisions as parents and what is really in our children 's best interests not while they are in college but while they live the rest of their lives after college finally to all the 18 + adult children who are from the traumatic experience of not having their parents pay for their college while some of their friends parents totally did i have this perspective to offer   like you are now your parents are adults their money is theirs to spend because it was theirs to earn you are under no obligation to pay for your parents retirement not that you were going to similarly your parents have no obligation to pay for your college they can spend their money on absolutely whatever they want be it a cottage vacations a or slots in the casino how they spend their money is their concern only and has nothing to do with your adult needs such as college education   if your parents their finances and go bankrupt it is their obligation to get themselves back in the black not yours if you have the means and may be so inclined you may help them if you do not or are not fair enough regardless of what you do they will still love you as their child no less   similarly if your parents have the means and are so inclined they may help you if they do not or are not fair enough regardless of what they do you are to love them as your parents no less   your task as an adult is to focus on how you will meet your own financial needs not to dwell on which of your needs were not met by people whose finances should well be completely separate from yours at this point in life for an adult to harbor an expectation of receiving something of value for free is misguided it unjustified illusory entitlement it is the expectation of someone who is clueless as to the value of money measured by the effort and time needed to earn it when adults want to acquire stuff or services they have to pay for these things with their own money that 's how adults live when adults want to get a massage or take a ride in a cab are they by their parents obligation to pay for these services no they realize that it 's their own responsibility to take care of these needs they either need to earn the money to pay for these things or buy them on credit and pay off the debt later   education is a type of service just like a massage or a cab ride it is a service that you decide you need to get in order to do xyz become smarter get a better paying job join a profession etc therefore as with any other service the primary responsibility for paying for this service is yours   you have 3 options or their combination work now so that you can earn the money to pay for this service later work part time while you are receiving this service acquire the service on credit and work later to pay it off that 's it this is called the real world the better you can deal with it the more successful you will become in it good luck

absolute scam   any time anyone asks you to open a bank account so they can send you money and then you have to send some portion of it back to them it 's a guarantee that it 's a scam what happens is that your dad will deposit the check and transfer it to this woman then the check will bounce or turn out to be fake altogether and your dad will be on the hook for the money to the bank these schemes are dependent on the fact that people want hope and believe in quick easy money and it works as long as the con artists are able to get the mark the person who deposits the check and sends them the money to send the money before the check always drawn on some obscure foreign bank has a chance to clear this is another variation of a long running type of bank scam and if you get involved you 'll regret it   i hope you can keep your dad from getting involved because it will create a financial mess and affect his credit as well the basic premise of this scam is this   in the interests of providing good customer service most banks will make some or all of a deposit available right away even though the check has n't cleared   the scammer has you withdraw the money either a cashier 's check have you send a wire transfer etc immediately and send it to them eventually the check is returned because it is   the bank charges the check back against your account often imposing pretty substantial penalties and fees so you as the account holder are left without the money you sent the scammer and all of the fees this is the easy version of events   you could end up in legal trouble depending on the nature of the scam and what they determine your involvement to be   it will certainly badly affect your banking history chexsystems tracks how we all treat bank accounts much like the credit agencies do with our credit so you may have trouble opening bank accounts   so there are many consequences to this to think about and it 's why you just say no do n't walk away from this run

if you expect a significant increase in future income then you should wait until that future income is assured and then buy based on that decision buying more house than you can afford is what caused you to have to sell you do n't want to do that again instead of buying more house now buy the right house for what you have now    better yet though you might rent instead of buying until the future income comes onboard   then you can get the best of both worlds you get to buy the house you can afford in a year or two but also do n't overspend your income

you have a large number of possible choices to make and a lot of it does depend upon what interests you when you are older the first thing to note is the difference between isas and pension contribution schemes tax wise which is of course the taxation point when you contribute to your pensions scheme it is done before taxation which is why when you draw from your pension scheme you have to pay income tax conversely your isa is something you contribute to after you have already paid income tax so besides the 10 tax on dividends if you hold any assets which may them it is tax free when you draw on it regardless of how much you have accrued over the years   now when it comes to the question what is the best way to save the answer is almost certainly going to be filling your pension to the point where you 're going to retire just on the edge of the limit and then putting the rest into isas this way you will not be paying the higher rates of tax associated with breaking the lifetime limit but also get maximum contributions into your various schemes there is an exception to this of course which is the return on investment if you do not have access to a sipp self invested personal pension you may be able to receive a far higher return on investment when using a stocks shares isa in which case the fact that you have to pay taxes prior to funding it may not make a significant difference the other issue you have as others have mentioned is rent   while now you may be enjoying london it is in my opinion quite likely that will change when you get older london has a very high cost of living even compared to the home counties and many of its benefits are not relevant to someone who is retired when you retire it is quite possible that you will see it fit to take a large sum out of your various savings and purchase a house which means that regardless of how much you are drawing out you will be able to have somewhere to live renting is fine when you are working but when you have a certain amount of admittedly growing funds that have to last you indefinitely who knows if it will last you

the broker would give you a margin call and get you to deposit more funds into your account they would n't wait for the stock price to reach $ 30 but would take this action much earlier more over it is very unrealistic for any stock to go up 275 over a few hours and if the stock was this volatile the broker would be asking for a higher margin to start with what i am really worried about is that if there were any situation like this you are not considering what you would do as part of your risk management strategy before writing the option you should already have an exit point at which you would buy back the option to limit your losses

your broker ameritrade offers a variety of exchange traded funds etfs that you can buy and sell with zero commission   an etf is like a mutual fund but you buy and sell shares the same way you buy and sell shares of stocks   from your point of view the relevance of this is that you can buy and sell as many or as few shares as you like even down to a single share   note that to get the commission free trades on the available etfs you have to sign up for it in your account profile   be sure to do that before you enter any buy orders you 'll want to start by looking at the ameritrade 's list of commission free etfs   notice that they are divided into different categories   stocks bonds international and commodities   which categories you pick from will depend on your personal investing goals time horizon risk tolerance and so on   there are lots of questions and answers on this site that talk about asset allocation   you should read them as it is the most important decision you will make with your portfolio the other thing you want to be aware of is the expense ratio for each fund   these expenses reduce the fund 's return they are included in the calculation of the net asset value of the shares so lower is definitely better   personally i would n't even consider paying more than about 0.10 commonly read 10 basis points or 10 bp for a broad based domestic stock fund   for a sectoral fund you might put up with as much as 20 bp in expenses   bond funds tend to be a little more expensive so maybe allow as much as 25 bp and likewise for international funds   i 've never invested in commodity funds so i 'll let someone else on appropriate expense ratios for those once you 've decided what funds you want and have signed up for commission free trades all you have to do is enter the trade orders   the website where you manage your account has tutorials on how to do that   after that you should be all set good luck with your investing

i think it depends a lot on your idea of how you should relate to your neighbors personally i think that i should be allowed to do just about whatever i want with my property and i grant my neighbor the same right if my neighbor wants to paint his house purple with orange stripes and fill his front lawn with pink i think that 's his right if i do n't like it i do n't have to look at his house i would draw the line at things that i can not avoid by simply looking the other way like running jet engines in his back yard at 2 in the morning as i could not avoid the noise or dumping toxic waste on the street as it will cause health problems etc others think it is their business what their neighbor does with his property and want to be able to control it they want someone who has the authority to force everyone in the neighborhood to paint their house in colors deemed acceptable to meet certain requirements for yard work and that 's what home owners associations are for to require that everyone in the neighborhood maintain their property according to a standard set by the hoa which should theoretically represent the wishes of the majority of course the price you pay for giving you the right to tell your neighbor what kind of fence he is allowed to have is that now your neighbors can tell you what kind of fence you can have advocates of often say that they are necessary to protect property values personally i think this is something of a circular argument i must have the right to prevent my neighbor from doing something that in my opinion makes his house ugly not because i necessarily have no choice but to stare out my window at his house all day and be by it but because someday i may want to sell my house to someone who will have no choice but to stare out the window at his house all day and be by it and so will not want to buy my house of course if we all just minded our own business this would n't be an issue okay this was pretty much an anti hoa post but i did try to state the other side of it

advice from a long time flipper you negotiate price based on four factors and none of these are set in stone how much you love the house   is this house a 100 out of 100 for you or a 85 or a 75   how much have you compromised what is the likelihood that you will find a house that will make you just as happy or at least close   you might have a house that is a 95 out of 100 but there are five other houses that you rated between 93 95    what is your timeframe   know that playing takes longer and can knock you out of the game sometimes and takes a little while to find a new game what is the relative housing market   zillow and other such sites are crap   yes the give you a generalized feel for a community but their estimates are off sometimes by 30 40   other factors like street noise updates to and so on are huge factors   you will have to really navigate the area and look for very comparable houses that have recently sold   then use average housing movements to extrapolate your future houses cost as a buyer you have two jobs   buy the house you want and manage your agent   your agent wants you to buy a house as soon as possible and to increase their reputation   those are their only two factors of working    by you offering closer to the asking price they are able to get their sales as quick as possible   also other agents will love working with them   in fact your agent is selling you on the home and the price   agents hardly worry about you paying too much as most buyers the deal they get on their home   admitting that you paid too much for your house is more of an admission of ignorance of yourself compared to agent if you decide to low ball the owner your agent spends more time with you and possibly reduces their reputation with the selling agent   so it is common for agents to tell you that you should not offer a low price as you will insult the owner my advice   unless the home is truly one of a kind for the market offering anything within 20 of the asking price is definitely within range   i have offered 40 less   if a house is asking too much and has been on the market for 8 months there is no way i am going in with an offer of even 15 lower   that leaves you no room    what you do first think about how much you think this house could sell for in the next 3 months   in your example let 's say 80 k based on conservative comps   then take the most you would actually pay for it   let 's say   70 k is about as high of an opening offer i would go    do not tell your agent your true breaking points   if you tell your agent that you would go to 75 k on the house   then that is what their negotiations will start at   remember they want the sale to happen as soon as possible   very likely the other agent especially if they know each other will ask if how flexible you are going to be   then next thing you know your agent calls you back and says would you be willing to go 77 k or the owner is firm at do not give up your position   you should never forecast to your agent what your next bid or offer would be for the house   never get into scenarios or future counters    so you offer   if your agent asks you how firm that is   very firm   if your agent does n't want to take the offer to them thank you for being my agent but i am going to be working with someone that represents what i want    if the owner says you are done too me   well that 's how it goes   if the owner stays firm at asking or lowers then you can come up if you feel comfortable doing so   but understand what your goal is   is it to get a house or to get a good deal on a house   mine was always to get a good deal on a house   so i might offer 72 k next   if they did n't budge i am out   if they moved down i went from there    easy summary the fact is if they are n't willing to negotiate with you enough it always ends the same   you give them your take it or leave it offer   you tell your agent that if he she comes back with one penny over it comes from their commission god i have said this 100 times in my life and it is the best negotiation tactic you have with your agent   the owner says yes or no and it is over

gt;and a lot of people that have communist party wealth are afraid that there will be an uprising against them so they are preparing escape plans   my guess would be more along these lines albeit maybe a bit less dramatic   there were a lot of dubious things that party members did over the past hundred years to stash away cash for themselves   siphoning off public resources investing with them and as long as the investments made money keeping the results for example played a significant role in some of the complaints that farmers had about local officials   if they keep money in china and there 's some sort of fallout or charges that go through my guess is that it 's a lot easier to seize a corrupt official 's resources   on the other hand if you just bought a bunch of land in the us that 's a lot less easily and harder to immediately get ahold of for chinese officials   there 's also the more legit possibility that china quite arguably has a real estate bubble in investable real estate and the result is that if you want to invest in land and reduce your risk to a bubble deflating you want to do so overseas

i am failing to see why would a person get an ira instead of just putting the same amount of money into a mutual fund like vanguard or something like that well this is n't a meaningful distinction the mutual fund may or may not be in an ira similarly the mutual fund may or may not be in a 401(k however so i 'm going to treat your question as if it 's why would a person get a mutual fund like vanguard or something like that in an ira instead of just putting the same amount of money into the same mutual fund in a 401(k same mutual fund same amount of money narrowing your question to the difference between the two types of accounts as stated in your question 's title others have answered that to the extent that you really have no choice other than pick which type of account to use for a given bundle of money other than nobody having mentioned the employer match even if there were no other difference at all in tax treatment it 's pretty typical that 401(k contributions will be matched by free money from the employer no ira can compete with that but that 's not the only choice either many of us contribute to both the 401(k and the ira why because we can i 'm not suggesting that just anybody can but if you max out the employer matching in the 401(k or if you max out the tax advantaged contribution limit in the 401(k and you still have more money that you want to save in a tax advantaged retirement account this year you can do so the ira is available it 's not instead of the 401(k

if this is a one to one share exchange with added cash to make up the difference in value you 're getting 1 share of xyz plus $ 19.20 in cash for each share of abc    they calculated the per share price they 're offering $ 36 and subtracted the value of xyz share at the time of the offer $ to get the cash part $ 19.20    the value of xyz after is subject to investor reaction   nobody can accurately predict stock values   if you see the price dropping owners of xyz are selling because they feel that they no longer wish to own xyz   if xyz is rising investors feel like the merger is a positive move and they are buying or the company is buying back shares bottom line is the cash is a sure thing the stock is not   you called it a merger but it 's actually a takeover   my advice is to evaluate both stocks see if you wish to continue owning xyz and determine whether you 'd rather sell abc or take the offer   the value of abc afterwards if you decline the offer is something that i can not advise you on

yeah best buy is a complete joke electronics are one of the things i usually plan out and buy online anyway they 're generally expensive so saving 5 can be a lot so when the one thing i always immediately need breaks a phone charger guess who always has none in stock or hardly any selection    electronics are generally low margin and best buy was basically built on the notion that most consumers are ignorant particularly about tech and what fair prices are a 6 hdmi should not be over $ 10 a usb cable charger should nt be more than $ 10 now that everyone can price check instantly on their phone they 're fucked good imo perhaps it will allow some smaller local electronics stores to thrive

having convinced myself that there is no point of paying someone 's    else mortgage somewhat rhetorical this many years later but i expect some other kid the obsession with propping up the housing market might be repeating the nonsense about paying someone else 's mortgage and read this will you be buying your own farm to grow your own food or are you happy with people using the money you spend on food for a mortgage how about clothes will you be weaving your own clothes because you do n't want money you spend on clothes to pay someone else 's mortgage what 's special about the money you pay for rent that you get annoyed at how someone else spends it do n't get a mortgage just because you do n't like the idea of how other people might spend the money that 's no longer yours after you pay them with it as an aside at your age with your income and no debt you could be sensibly investing a lot of money if you did that for five years you 'd be in a much better position that you would be tying yourself to whatever current scheme the uk is using to desperately prop up house prices

the answer is discounted cash flows companies that do n't pay dividends are ostensibly reinvesting their cash at returns higher than shareholders could obtain elsewhere   they are reinvesting in productive capacity with the aim of using this greater productive capacity to generate even more cash in the future this is n't just true for companies but for almost any cash generating project with a project you can purchase some type of productive assets you may perform some kind of transformation on the good or not with the intent of selling a product service or in fact the productive mechanism you have built this productive mechanism is typically called a company what is the value of such a productive mechanism yes it 's capacity to continue producing cash into the future under literally any scenario discounted cash flow is how cash flows at distinct intervals are valued   a company that does not pay dividends now is capable of paying them in the future   berkshire hathaway   does not pay a dividend currently but it 's cash flows have been reinvested over the years such that it 's current cash paying capacity has multiplied many thousands of times over the decades this is why companies that have never paid dividends trade at higher prices microsoft did not pay dividends for many years because the cash was better used developing the company to pay cash flows to investors in later years a companies value is the sum of it 's risk adjusted cash flows in the future even when it has never paid shareholders a dime if you had a piece of paper that obligated an entity such as the government to absolutely pay you $ 1,000 20 years from now this $ 1,000 cash flows present value could be estimated using discounted cash flow it might be around $ 400 for example   but let 's say you want to trade this promise to pay before the 20 years is up   would it be worth anything   of course it would   it would in fact typically go up in value barring heavy inflation until it was worth very close to $ 1,000 moments before it 's value is redeemed imagine that this promise to pay is much like a non dividend paying stock   throughout its life it has never paid anyone anything but over the years it 's value goes up   it is because the discounted cash flow of the $ 1,000 payout can be estimated at almost anytime prior to it 's payout

i think this is a good question with no single right answer   for a conservative investor possible responses to low rates would be probably the best response is somewhere in the middle consider riskier investments for a part of your portfolio but still hold on to some cash and in any case do not expect great results in a bad economy for a more detailed analysis let 's consider the three main asset classes of cash bonds and stocks and how they might preform in a low interest rate environment by stocks i really mean mutual funds that invest in a diversified mixture of stocks rather than individual stocks which would be even riskier   you can use mutual funds for bonds too although diversification is not important for government bonds cash advantages safe in the short term   available on short notice for emergencies disadvantages low returns and possibly inflation although you retain the flexibility to move to other investments if inflation increases bonds advantages somewhat higher returns than cash   disadvantages returns are still rather low and more vulnerable to inflation   also the market price will drop temporarily if rates rise stocks advantages better at preserving your purchasing power against inflation in the long term 20 years or more say   returns are likely to be higher than stocks or bonds on average   disadvantages   price can fluctuate a lot in the short to medium term   also expected returns are still less than they would be in better economic times although the low rates may change the question a little the most important thing for an investor is still to be familiar with these basic asset classes   note that the best risk adjusted reward might be attained by some mixture of the three

take some of the commentary on home buying forums with a grain of salt i too have read some of the commentary on these forums such as myfico or zillow and rarely is the right advice given or proper followup done typical 401k withdrawals for home purchase would not be considered a hardship however most employer 401k plans will allow you to take a loan for 401k as long as you provide suitable documentation statement real estate contract good faith estimate or some other form of suitable documentation as described by the plan administrator   for instance i just took a 401k loan to pay for closing costs and i had to provide only the real estate contract could i not follow through with the contract sure but what if i am found out for fraud then the plan administrator would probably end up turning the distribution into a taxable distribution i would n't go to jail in this hypothetical situation i am only stealing from myself but the law states that certain loan situations are not liable for tax as long as that situation still exists in the home loan situation my employer allows for a low interest 10 year loan my employer also allows for a pre approved loan for any purpose this would be a low interest 5 year loan   there is also the option to not do a loan at all but normally that is only allowed after you have exhausted all your loan options and the government makes it intentionally harsh 30 penalty at least to discourage people from dumping their tax free haven 401k accounts that all being said many plans offer no prepayment penalty so like my employer has for us i can pay it all back in full whenever i want or make micropayments every month otherwise it comes out of my pay stub biweekly so if it were to fall through i could just put it all back like it never happened though with my plan there is a cooling off period of 7 days before i can take another loan keep in mind that if you leave your employer then the full amount becomes a taxable distribution unless you pay it back within a certain period of time after leaving the employer   whether this fits your financial situation is up to you but a loan is definitely preferred over a partial or full withdrawal since you are paying yourself back for your rightly earned retirement which is just as important

funds earned and spent before opening a dedicated business account should be classified according to their origination for example if your business received income where did that money go   if you took the money personally it would be considered either a distribution or a loan to you   it is up to you which of the two options you choose on the flip side if your business had an expense that you paid personally that would be considered either a contribution of capital or a loan from you if you choose to record these transactions as loans you can offset them together so you do n't need two separate accounts loan to you and loan from you when the bank account was opened the initial deposit came from where   if it came from your personal funds then it is either a contribution of capital or a loan from you from the sound of your question you deposited what remained after the preceding income expenses   this would in effect return the loan account back to zero if choosing that route the above would also be how to record any expenses you may pay personally for the business if any in the future because these transactions were not through a dedicated business bank account you ca n't record them in quickbooks as checks and deposits   instead you can use journal entries   for any income received you would debit your capital loan account and credit your income account   for any expenses you would debit the appropriate expense account and credit your distribution loan account also if setting up a loan account you should choose either current asset or current liability type   the capital contribution and distribution account should be equity type hope this helps

i expected a word or two on the price elasticity of demand here your question needs slight revision in its current form rising prices actually do not mean increased profitability for a company the quantity they sell also pays a huge part and actually is correlated to the price at which they sell the goods and other factors such as the price at which their competitor sells the goods etc but we will ignore it for simplicity   the net profit of sales for any firm is equal to   qty x sale price cogs taxes other expenses where cogs means cost of goods sold means sales general and admin costs e.g. cleaning the inventory storage area daily so that the goods stay fresh etc other expenses include any miscellaneous other costs that the firm incurs to make the sale now if everything in that equation remains same cogs taxes and other expenditures rising prices will only translate into a higher profit if the quantity does not fall by the same margin prices may also rise simply as a response to risking cogs or other expenditures latter may be observed in inflationary environments in such a case the supplying firm can end up losing its profit margin if the quantity falls by more than the price rise

most companies that have employee discounts have policies to prevent exactly this sometimes they will say that you can only use the company discount for products that you intend to use yourself they 'll specifically ban buying things for friends of course enforcing such a rule can be difficult but a car is a big enough purchase that if they have such a rule they 're likely to pay attention other times they try to discourage letting friends use your discount by having rules that make it awkward like i used to work for a furniture company that said you had to pick up the furniture personally at the office where you worked so if you wanted to buy a for your brother who lived in another state you 'd have to pay to ship it and probably wipe out most of the savings from the employee discount my daughter 's employer says you have to show your employee id when you make the purchase and then they deduct it from your next paycheck so you 'd have to get your friend to pay you back maybe loan them your id if they want to pick it out which would get awkward etc assuming the company does n't care if you buy with an employee discount and re sell or their rules are lax enough that you can get away with it i 'm not aware of any law that would stop you in general there are n't any laws against you re selling things you 've bought people have garage sales and sell used cars and the like all the time there are specific exceptions like you ca n't re sell prescription drugs

right but there were tangible reasons that made sense that was fueled by a cycle of predatory loans and consumers being dumb enough to think that just because they got approved for a $ 500 k house with a 500 credit score meant they should definitely take out massive loans and buy it this was piled on by the derivative market specifically credit default swaps which certain people recognized as creating a liquidity issue they did n't know when the crash was going to occur they just knew that the asset bubble fueled by massive debt with this debt being falsely rated as aaa when most of it was junk left banks in a position of complete insolvency when the mortgage defaults reached a certain point when people realized the extent of the debt e.g. knowing with common sense that people with a 550 credit score should n't have 7 properties and be allowed to be that over leveraged let alone be rated aaa and the amount of derivatives that would have to be paid out on top of having no cash flow due to mortgage defaults they recognized that a bubble bursting would wreak havoc on the economy        that had a lot of moving parts simply saying overvalued record highs crash coming soon when how is fucking stupid nobody knows what evidence did op offer not that he would n't still get laughed out because this topic is fucking annoying with thousands of people crying overvalued but he did n't even mention p e ratio or anything he literally came in and basically said when is it all gon na fall apart nobody knows the answer

when interest rates rise the price of bonds fall because bonds have a fixed coupon rate and since the interest rate has risen the bond 's rate is now lower than what you can get on the market so it 's price falls because it 's now less valuable bonds diversify your portfolio as they are considered safer than stocks and less volatile however they also provide less potential for gains although diversification is a good idea for the individual investor it is far too complicated and incurs too much transaction costs not to mention that rebalancing would have to be done on a regular basis in your case where you have mutual funds already it is probably a good idea to keep investing in mutual funds with a theme which you understand the industry 's role in the economy today rather than investing in some special bonds which you can not relate to the benefit of having a mutual fund is to have a professional manage your money and that includes diversification as well so that you do n't have to do that

there are a few factors at work here supply and demand being the main one the office for national statistics has some good information supply has historically struggled to compete with demand in the uk and this situation has been since the 1980s when margaret thatcher was prime minister   she set up a variety of schemes to encourage people to own their own home such as tax relief and since then home ownership in the uk has increased dramatically the then conservative government also set up the right to buy scheme in 1980 that allowed council tenants to purchase their council houses at a discounted rate   the effect of this was to increase the number of home owners whilst reducing the amount of housing available for councils to rent to new tenants   anecdotal evidence i ca n't find a documented source to back this up suggests that councils did not build sufficient new homes to replace those purchased by their ex tenants the population of the uk has also increased by around 10 million since 1980 around 20 and this has pushed up demand for housing   house building in the uk has not kept pace with these factors that has led to a shortage of supply that has pushed up prices there 's another factor at play here as well   if you go back to the 1970s around 53 of women would go out to work but in 2013 this figure increased to 67 as it became more common for households to have double incomes   this extra supply of cash also pushed up house prices your question regards a debt based monetary system is not entirely clear but there are limitations put onto how much money people can borrow that are potentially limiting how much house prices can rise by   today most lenders are more conservative in how much they will lend but this was n't the case in the mid 2000s when house prices rose very quickly    lenders are more cautious today after the crash of the late 2000s but things are to relax again and they are starting to lend more which could in turn lead to further house price rises in line with what was seen in the 2000s recessions have with house prices falling back or at least being stable   in the 1980s house prices from 1980 to 1988 but then fell back a little as the recession hit before starting to rise again in 1997   this rise was sustained until 2008 during which time prices again   based on this you could assume prices will again as we come out of the recession as long as this is sustained for 8 years or so however as the potential for more households to become double income is reduced high female employment already and wages are unlikely to raise that quickly this may not be realistic unless the mortgage lenders become extremely lax to the point of reckless to answer your other question about the affordability of housing this will be based on the level of wages in the uk and how strict or lax the lenders are also taking into effect the availability of housing for purchase   if wages rise house prices will rise if lenders are willing to lend more money house prices will rise and if demand continues to supply prices will rise none of the major uk political parties are likely to solve the problems of population growth and not enough houses being built so it is likely prices will rise but you could argue that they are not far off a peak based on current wages and lenders attitudes   if the uk economy continues to recover from the recession it is possible they will fuel another housing boom by lending ever increasing salary multiples as happened in the 2000s unless there is government intervention ie regulation of the lenders

ultimately money derives its value from being spend on a good or service investing it is an act of denying your present self a good or service so that your future self can obtain hopefully more goods or services investing is a sensible and responsible default position but you clearly have passed the point at which the opportunity cost of the dollar not spent today is greater than its benefit in the future not all dollars are the same remember that money is a temporary store of value but you have to spend it to realize that value in your search learn about the psychology of money what are you saving it for how much do you want left over when you die if you die tomorrow will you regret not having spend a little more i 'm sorry to get morbid on you but saving for the future requires answering the question how long and it 's never forever this may be tangential but it shaped my behaviour towards money nonetheless frank on the psychology of time i would hazard a guess and say that you land in the future oriented camp

assuming your only income is withdrawals from the 401k the thing that determines the tax rate on your 401k withdrawals is how much money you draw out of the 401k in a single tax year   the money counts as income when you take it out   if you withdraw $ 100,000 from the 401k in a single year you 'll be in a higher tax bracket than if you withdraw only $ 30,000 in that year but your earnings in previous years are irrelevant

willis group holdings set to join the s&p 500 fossil group to join s&p midcap 400 health to join s&p smallcap 600 notes in part for the s p case willis group holdings plc nyse will replace fossil group inc.    nasd in the s&p 500 and fossil group will replace towers    watson co. nasd in the s&p midcap 400 after the close of    trading on monday january 4 willis group is merging with towers    watson in a deal expected to be completed on or about that date    pending final conditions post merger willis group holdings will    change its name to willis towers watson plc and trade under the ticker    symbol fossil has a market capitalization that is more    representative of the midcap market space as of jan. 8 fossil is about $ in market cap and willis is $ for those wondering apple with a market cap of $ is of the index making the entire index worth approximately $ so fossil is worth of the overall index for those wanting some numbers here thus if a company acquires another and becomes bigger than there can be replacements made in those indices that have an artificial number of small members alternatively a member may be removed for lack of representation where it is just so small compared to other companies that may be a better fit as some indices could be viewed as actively managed in a sense in contrast there are indices like those from russell known for the russell 2000 small cap index q why do n't you the indexes more often than once a year a maintaining representative indexes must be weighed against the    costs associated with making frequent changes to index constituents    namely buying and selling stocks the russell indexes are annually because our research    has shown that this strikes a reasonable balance between accuracy and    cost we originally our indexes quarterly then    semi annually but found these options to be suboptimal our extensive    research demonstrates that annual accurately represents    the capitalization segments and minimizes the turnover required to    reflect the segments as they change thus there can be different scenarios   then there can be the effect on index funds when price weighted indices like the dow jones industrial average has a member that does a stock split that causes some rebalancing too on the djia divisor the dow jones industrial average djia is a price weighted index that    is calculated by dividing the sum of the prices of the 30 component    stocks dow jones industrial average components by a number called    the djia divisor or dow divisor the index divisor is updated    periodically and adjusted to offset the effect of stock splits bonus    issues or any change in the component stocks included in the djia    this is done in order to keep the index value consistent

while jb king says some useful things i think there is another fundamental reason why stock markets go down after disasters either natural or man made   there is a real impact on the markets in the case of something like 9/11 due to closed airport higher security costs closer inspections on trade goods tighter restrictions on visas real payments for the rebuilding of destroyed buildings and insurance payouts for killed people and eventually the cost of a war but almost as important is the uncertainty and risk nobody knew what was going to happen in the days and weeks after an attack like that is there going to be another one a week later or every week for the next year will air travel become essentially impractical will international trade be severely restricted all those would have a huge massive effect on the economy you may argue that those things are very unlikely even after something like 9/11 but even a small increase in the likelihood of a catastrophic economic crash is enough to start people selling there is another thing that drives the market down even if most people are sure that there wo n't be a catastrophic economic crash they know that other people think there might be and so will sell that will drive the market down if they know the market is going down then sensible traders will start to sell even if they think there is zero risk of a crash this makes the effect worse eventually prices will drop so far that the people who do n't think there is a crash will start to buy so they can make a profit on the recovery but that usually does n't happen until there has been a substantial drop

gt that is in large part do to insane healthcare costs passed on to the consumers by the aca healthcare spending has increased on average 1.5 annually since 2009 where as the highest growth in spending from 1991 until 2006 was 1.3   health care costs have actually been on the rise for decades now it was only noticed by the majority party i.e. the gop who had held the majority for 16 of the years prior to 2009 when the aca was enacted suddenly health care costs started to explode the truth is that health care costs have been on a steady rise in the time period from 1972 to 1982 costs rose on average 14 per causes of rising healthcare keep in mind this was prior to the expansion of medicare from 1983 1992 costs grew at a rate of 9 per year 3 times faster than inflation from 1993 to 2010 cost rose at a rate of 6.4 per year the aca of course was passed in 2009 but did n't start to take effect until 2011 since 2010 health care costs has risen about 4 per year that is a 2 drop in a short amount of time compared to the previous years however the numbers are already so big just like the national debt that the gop who had as much part to play in the health care costs as they did in the debt had tons of numbers they could use to make it seem like health care costs have exploded    in reality what happened is that people who never had health insurance before were forced to get it and started to realize how expensive it is when it actually covers what it was intended to cover preventative care as well as emergent care the gop has been on a steady march to undermine the new law as much as possible since it passed because it made some of their biggest donors and health care insurance providers uncomfortable the fact that they had to share their cost information and that the health care exchange required them to do a line item by line item comparison with other companies out there    so here we are the aca is going to be cut and millions of people are going back to be uninsured or what you are going to see is the rate of costs growth start to increase again after decades of slowly decreasing rates why because of the renewed ability of insurance providers to hide the costs to hide costs increases it will also cause hospitals to greatly overcharge the uninsured as they were doing before but there will be many more of them the goal being that the uninsured are unlikely to pay for the very large medical bills so knowing this hospitals artificially inflate the bill in the hopes of getting a larger portion of that unpaid bill liquidated through medicare    uninsured populations also lead to more unhealthy people you would think that not having health insurance would make people want to remain more healthy however studies show the opposite to be articles business in actuality people stress more about their health and avoid periodic checkups both of which lead to bad health results    trying to blame the cost increases in health care on government meddling or say it is a problem brought on by the aca is weird since there are so many examples of government sites s healthcare ranked dead last compared health care programs out there which are so much more efficient less costly and have resulted in much healthier populations    gt i do nt have health insurance and an er visit with costs me less out of pocket than 90 of the country why is that    i am going to call bs number one that is a huge claim to make without supporting evidence number two you would have to demonstrate how much that same visit would cost to those with health insurance    gt do you think it has to do with the fact that with the aca hospitals know they are getting paid with 0 questioning on pricing so charge whatever they want and with me they think shit this guy might not ever pay us lets just give him a decent price and get some money from him because all we can do is send his bill to collections    actually no the exact opposite they now because you are uninsured that you are unlikely to pay so they overcharge you for the same services because they know that they will only be reimbursed a percentage of the costs if it goes to medicare for non payment    gt the swiss do everything better   you keep referring back to switzerland do n't get me wrong they are a very good country and have the number 2 ranked health care system in the world however i do n't think they are the low tax haven that you think they are they have an average corporate tax rate of wiki whereas the us has it at 32 their highest income tax bracket is whereas the us is at 39 their sales tax goes at high as 8 where ours go as high as 11 their average effective rate is around 11 while ours is around 18 including social security puts switzerland at 17 and the us at 24    so they are definitely a lower tax rate country but in no way are they a no tax rate country then again switzerland has no military to speak of while the us spends more on military then the next 7 countries put together    gt this is the dumbest statement you ve made this entire time    i have been very patient i have stuck with this conversation in spite of the put downs and remarks i have a little too but you can go back to most of my remarks and see that i have been more i have given you some leeway because of your age and i am almost twice as old as you    so you gave me your background i will give you mine i am closer to 50 then i would prefer i left the house at 17 enlisted in the navy and spent the next 15 years serving in the military i ended my career in a select community i have been out for ten years this july i am now owner of a company that does r&amp;d and works with the government a lot of my knowledge about inventions and how commercial works with government comes from my own personal experiences i have seen the best and worst of government as well as seen the same on the commercial side of the house anyone comes to this game with the that government ca n't get anything done as well as commercial quickly learns that is not true anyone comes thinking that commercial equals efficient learns that is not always true too    gt take apple for instance where is all the government funding they recieved to be one of the most innovative companies in human history or microsoft   as i said previously that you thought was a dumb comment commercial is very good at taking existing systems and finding ways to make them efficient and better apple and microsoft is the same they both made their mark in history by expanding on and creating innovation with existing technologies that had their foundation in government r&amp;d projects including the digital wiki as well as computers like the and the issues and the advancements into tech ibm invent the personal computer answer which lead to the first efficient and cost effective personal computers the touchscreen was actually first invented in by engineers at wiki and of course we know that the internet started as a government funded project called news ask history who invented the internet    i think you would be surprised how much many if not most of the things we take for granted today have a foundation in government funded r&amp;d. my company is a commercial company and we do a great job creating our own products and innovation and yet still our best selling product is a design of a national laboratory that we license from them commercial industry is great at manufacturing and producing something the government is not as good at and so often they will license out

one piece of documentation that might help here is a confirmation of your benefit selections through your employer for each year since the expenses in question were incurred assuming you have a job with eligibility for benefits   if you can prove which accounts you maintained through your your spouse 's if applicable then it is relatively simple to go back through the records for those specific accounts and see if a specific expense was ever reimbursed   obviously you ca n't prove through documentation that you did n't have accounts that do n't exist this seems like it would be more important for the accounts elected by a significant other since i believe reimbursements from an account in your name would typically be reported to the irs on your behalf anyway also keep in mind that the irs wo n't care about each line item individually   their focus will be on whether for any given snapshot in time your total reimbursed amount exceeded your total eligible expenses

you have to read some appeals court cases see as well as sec enforcement actions on to get an understanding of how the sec operates there are court created guidelines for how insider trading would be proven there is no clear line but it is the emergency asset freezing your assets if you nailed a lucrative trade you really want to avoid and this is often times enforced reported by the brokers themselves since the sec does not have the resources to monitor every account 's trading activities there are some thin lines such as having your lawyer file a lawsuit and as soon as it is filed it is technically public so you short the recipient 's stock or having someone in a court room updating you on case developments as soon as possible so you can make trades although this may just be actually public depending on the court but the rules create the opportunities also consider that the united states is the most strict country in this regard there are tons of capital markets and the ideals or views of illegal insider trading compared to having reached a level of society where you are privileged to obtain this information vary across the board contains charts of countries where an existing insider trading prohibition is actually enforced finally consider some markets that do n't include equities as trading on an information advantage is only applicable to things the sec regulates and there are plenty of things that agency does n't regulate so trying to reverse engineer the sec may not be the most optimal use of energy

since you mention your expenses are very low i 'm going to assume that social security will cover your expenses once you qualify for it   since you have no savings currently the first and most important job for this money is to make sure that you can live comfortably until social security kicks in   social security could start for you as early as 62 so you need to set aside at least two years worth of money plus another chunk as a safety measure also if you do n't have health insurance please look to get a plan through your local aca exchange as not having health insurance is by far the most common way someone your age ends up bankrupt   insurance will eat up a good chunk of the money but will be much cheaper after the first year if you continue to have no income now if your expenses are low enough you can look to use this money to delay when you start taking social security as long as possible as the longer you delay social security the more money you get   the aarp has a calculator where you can see how much more per year you will get from social security if you delay taking it as long as you can   this is a great way to insure you live as comfortably as possible even if you live to 120   assuming you are reasonably healthy this is a very secure and very meaningful way to invest this windfall once you have set aside the money for your expenses emergencies health care and delaying social security in a combination of checking and high yielding savings accounts it can be in your interest to invest any remaining amount   common solid low risk investments for a 10 + year time frame would be either while is correct that it is possible for even the best bond fund to lose money it is rather unlikely that you will end up losing money over a period of 10 years   the nice thing about the bond fund is that most funds find the right one do n't charge a fee if you need to need to take your money out early   cds guarantee that you wo n't lose your money but if you have to take the money out in an emergency the fees will eat up way more money than a bond fund would normally lose   also a good bond fund will generally yield a bit more than a cd investing in stock is generally much too risky for this sort of time frame without large savings to back it up

on average you should be saving at least 10 15 of your income in order to be financially secure when you retire   different people will tell you different things but really this can be split between short term savings cash long term savings 401ks iras stocks bonds and paying down debt that $ 5k is a good start on an emergency fund but you probably want a little more   as justkt said 6 months worth is what you want to aim for   put this in a money market account where you 'll earn a little more interest but wo n't be penalized from withdrawing it when its needed you may have to live off it after all beyond that i would split things up if possible have payroll deductions going to a broker sharebuilder is a good one to start with if you ca n't spare much change as well as an ira at a bank set up a separate checking account just for rent and utilities put a month 's worth of cash in there and have another payroll deduction that covers your living expenses + maybe 5 put in there automatically   then set up automatic bill payments so you do n't even have to think about it   check it once a month to make sure there are n't any surprises pay off your credit cards every month   these are by far the most expensive forms of credit that most people have   you should n't be financing large purchases with them you 'll get better rates by taking a personal loan from a bank set specific goals for savings and set up automatic payroll deductions to work towards them   especially for buying a house most responsible lenders will ask for 20 down   in today 's market that means you need to write a check for $ 40k or $ 50k   while it 's tempting to finance up to 100 of the property value it 's also risky considering how volatile markets can be   you do n't want to end up owing more on the property than it 's worth two years down the road if you find yourself at the end of the month with an extra $ 50 or so consider your savings goals or your current debt instead of blowing it on a toy   especially if you have long term debt high balance credit cards vehicle or property loans applying that money directly to principal can save you months or years paying it back and hundreds or thousands of dollars of interest all depending on the details of the loan of course above all have fun with it   think of your personal net worth as you do your gamer score on the xbox and look for ways to maximize it with a minimum of effort or investment on your part   investing in yourself and your future can be incredibly rewarding emotionally

it depends on the rules in the specific places you stay   specific places being countries or states    some states may consider pension payments to be taxable income others may not   some may consider presence for x days to constitute residency x days may be 60 days in a calendar year whether or not those days are continuous    it does n't matter so much where your mailbox or mail handling service is located it matters you may owe taxes in more than one place   some states will allow you to offset other states taxes against theirs   some states in the us are really harsh on income taxes   it 's my understanding that if you own real estate in new york all of your income no matter the source is taxable income in new york whether or not you were ever in the state that year ultimately you ca n't just put up your hand and say that 's my tax domicile so i 'm exempt from all your taxes   there is no umbrella us regulation on this topic the states determine who they consider to be residents and how those residents are to be taxed while it 's possible you may be considered a resident of multiple states and owe income taxes in multiple states it 's equally possible that you wo n't meet the residency criteria for any state regardless of whether or not that state has an income tax   the issue you face as addressed in 's answer oklahoma will consider you a resident of ok until you have established residency somewhere else

is this legal why not but you might have trouble deducting losses on your taxes especially if you sell to someone related to you in some way which is indeed what you 're doing see the added portion below regarding dealing with related person which a sibling is the state of maryland has a transfer tax of 1.5 for each the buyer and seller would this be computed on the appraised or sale value you should check with the state in california property taxes are assessed based on sale value but if the sale value is bogus the assessors have the right to recalculate since you 're selling to family the assessors will likely to intervene and set a more close to fair market value on the transaction but again check the local law will this pose any problem if the buyer needs financing likely banks will be suspicious since you 're giving a discount to your sibling it will likely not cause a problem for financing if it was an unrelated person getting such a discount it would likely to have raised some questions would i be able to deduct a capital loss on my tax return as i said it may be a problem if the transaction is between related people likely not otherwise not sure check with a professional tax adviser ea or cpa licensed in maryland you mentioned in the comment that the buyer is a sibling irs publication has a list of what is considered related person and that includes siblings so the short answer is no you will not be able to deduct the loss the tax treatment is not trivial in this case and i suggest to have a professional tax adviser guide you on how to proceed here 's the definition of related person from the irs pub members of a family including only brothers sisters half brothers half sisters spouse ancestors parents grandparents    etc and lineal descendants children grandchildren etc an individual and a corporation if the individual directly or indirectly owns more than 50 in value of the outstanding stock of the    corporation two corporations that are members of the same controlled group as defined in section of the internal revenue code a trust fiduciary and a corporation if the trust or the grantor of the trust directly or indirectly owns more than 50 in value of the    outstanding stock of the corporation a grantor and fiduciary and the fiduciary and beneficiary of any trust fiduciaries of two different trusts and the fiduciary and beneficiary of two different trusts if the same person is the grantor    of both trusts a tax exempt educational or charitable organization and a person who directly or indirectly controls the organization or a member of    that person 's family a corporation and a partnership if the same persons own more than 50 in value of the outstanding stock of the corporation and more than    50 of the capital interest or profits interest in the partnership two s corporations if the same persons own more than 50 in value of the outstanding stock of each corporation two corporations one of which is an s corporation if the same persons own more than 50 in value of the outstanding stock of each    corporation an executor and a beneficiary of an estate unless the sale or exchange is in satisfaction of a bequest two partnerships if the same persons directly or indirectly own more than 50 of the capital interests or profits interests in both    partnerships a person and a partnership if the person directly or indirectly owns more than 50 of the capital interest or profits interest in the    partnership

it is my understanding that banks pay less than the going rate on savings accounts and require that the person who takes out a loan pay more than the going rate that is how the bank gets its money   usually the going rate is affected by the current inflation rate but that has not been true for the last few weeks so that means that typically the money you have in the bank is gradually losing purchasing power as the bank typically pays you less than the inflation rate   so if you want your money to keep pace with inflation or do a bit better then you should buy bonds

the answer is mathematics let 's say you have $ 100 capital to invest with with a mortgage with a unit trust assuming you do n't put in borrowed money 5 growth on the property is $ 25 but a $ 25 profit on a unit trust requires 25 growth well that 's assuming zero interest and zero fees let 's say interest is 3 but so are trust fees a property now requires 8 growth for $ 25 profit in a year where a unit trust now requires 29 growth for $ 25 profit which one is more likely the above calculations do n't take in to consideration all associated costs and is obviously exaggerated but it shows the answer is not black and white but is instead just mathematics on a bunch of variables debt is n't a bad thing so do n't be afraid of using debt with debt you can borrow more to invest having a fully paid off house is not a good investment if some of that equity could be earning you more else where if the math makes sense

here 's my attempt without talking about apples or anything   essentially the money supply is determined by the central bank since they are the issuers of money you can read on your us dollars that they are issued by the federal reserve an excellent measure of the money supply is ngdp since this is the number of dollars traded every year that sort of how many dollars are available to be captured by working trade etc unfortunately in 2008 the us fed decided to adopt an ultra tight monetary policy resulting in a severe drop off in ngdp relative to previous trend the worst since the great depression graphs here   it does not look like it will ever recover to the previous trend so the money supply is much smaller than people would have expected before 2008 in theory the nominal value of money should n't matter in the long run however since people before 2008 signed contracts read 30-year mortgages anticipating a much higher aggregate money supply this has triggered a shortfall in demand ever since which has left our economy in the tank

yes the effective and market rates are interchangeable the present value formula will help make it possible to determine the effective interest rate since the bond 's par value duration and par interest rate is known the coupon payment can be extracted now knowing the price the bond sold in the market the duration and the coupon payment the effective market interest rate can be extracted   this involves solving large a less accurate way of determining the interest rate is using a yield shorthand to extract the market interest rate with good precision and acceptable accuracy the annual coupon derived can be divided by the market price of the bond

if the stock has dropped from $ 10 to $ 2 and now is range trading between $ 2 and $ 3 and you were not able to sell your shares earlier then i would no be holding on to them now as soon as the price hit $ 3 sell them after you have sold them and you noticed the stock still range trading one strategy you could apply is to go long after the price bounces off the $ 2 support placing a stop just below $ 2 then as the price moves up you trail your stop up with the price as it starts getting close to $ 3 tighten your stop if it keeps range trading and bounces off the resistance at $ 3 and you get stopped out you can either go short and reverse the process or wait for it to bounce off the support at $ 2 again one word of warning though the longer a stock range trades the bigger the outbreak out of the rage either up or down will be that is the reason why you should first wait for confirmation that the price has bounced off support resistance before opening a position and secondly why you should use a stop loss to get you out instead of just selling when it hits $ 3 because if it breaks through $ 3 you can continue profiting as it moves up

this has never really adequately explained it for me and i 've tried reading up on it all over the place for a long time i thought that in a trade the market maker pockets the spread for that trade but that 's not the case   the only sensible explanation i 've found which i 'm not going to give in full is that the market maker will provide liquidity by buying and selling trades they have no actual view on short or long and if the spread is higher that contributes directly to the amount they make over time when they open and close positions they 've made   it would be great to see a single definitive example somewhere that shows how a market maker makes money

what you are looking here is the cost of capital because that is what you are effectively giving up in order to invest in those loans in a discounted cash flow it would be the i in the denominator for instance instead of purchasing those loans you could have lent your money at the risk free rate not 100 true but typical assumption and therefore you are taking a slight risk in those loans for a higher return   there are several ways to compute that number the one most often used would be the rate if the bank were to lend that money in this way it would be the fed funds rate plus some additional risk premium

companies already have to protect themselves against employees trading the company 's shares with insider information they typically do that in a number of ways taken together this tends to mostly mitigate the risk of employees trading with insider information though it 's probably not perfect in practice the company itself 's knowledge of insider information is the same as that of its senior management so it makes sense for a company to be allowed to trade under the same conditions as its senior management from if the company is repurchasing outside of a rule 1 trading plan    it should limit its purchases to open window periods when officers and    directors are able to buy and sell securities of the company in    addition the company also can choose to disclose any material    non public information prior to any share repurchase if it is in    possession of material non public information at a time when it is    seeking to make a share repurchase outside of a rule 1 trading    plan as mentioned in the quote a company can also set up a trading plan in advance at a time when it does n't have inside information to be executed in the future then even if the company comes into possession of inside information it wo n't be using this knowledge to direct trades

you definitely have an argument for getting them to reverse the late fee especially if it has n't happened very often if you are late every month they may be less likely to forgive as for why this happens it 's not actually about business days but instead it 's based on when they know that you paid in general there are 2 ways for a company to mark a bill as paid late fees some systems automatically assign late fees at the start of the day after the due date if money has not been received in your case if your bill was due on the 24th the late fee was probably assessed at midnight of the 25th and the payment arrived after that during the day of the 25th you may have been able to initiate the payment on the company 's website at on the 24th and not have received a late fee or whatever their cutoff time is suggestion as a rule of thumb for utility bills whose due date and amount can vary slightly from month to month you 're usually better off setting up your payments on the company website to pull from your bank account instead of setting up your bank account to push the payment to the company this will ensure that you always get the bill paid on time and for the correct amount if you still would rather push the payment from your bank account then consider setting up the payment to arrive about 5 days early to account for holidays and weekends

the other answers have offered some great advice but here is an alternative that has n't been mentioned yet i 'm assuming that you have an adequately sized emergency fund in savings and that your cars are your only non mortgage debt since you still have car debt you probably do n't have anything saved for buying a new car when your current cars are at the end of life consider paying off your car loans early then begin saving for your next car having cash in the bank for a car is very freeing and it changes your mindset when it comes time to purchase a car as it is easy to waste a lot of money on something that depreciates rapidly when you are n't paying for it immediately   this approach might be counterintuitive if your car loan interest rate is less than your mortgage rate but you will probably need another car before you need another house and paying cash for a car is worth doing

there are some useful answers here but i do n't think any of them are quite sufficient   yes there are some risks involved in cfd trading but i will try and give you information so you can make your own decision firstly cyprus is part of the eu which gives it a level of credibility   i 'm not saying it 's the safest or most well regulated market in the world but that in itself would not particularly scare me away   the far more important issue here is the risk of using cfds and of etoro themselves a contract for difference is really just a specialization of an equity swap   it is in no way like owning a real stock   when you purchase shares of a company you own a real asset and are usually entitled to dividends and voting rights   with a cfd what you own is one side of a swap contract   you have a legal agreement between yourself and etoro to swap the return earned on the underlying stock for whatever fees etoro decide to charge   as already mentioned cfds are not available to us citizens equity swaps have many benefits in financial markets   they can allow access to restricted markets by entering into swaps with banks that have the necessary licenses to trade in places like china   many synthetic etfs use them in europe as a way to minimize tracking error as the return is guaranteed by the swap counterparty for a charge they also come with one risk counterparty credit risk   when trading with etoro for as long as your position is open you are at risk of etoro going bankrupt   if etoro failed you do not actually own any stocks you only own swap contracts which are going to be worthless if etoro ceased to exist cfds also have an ongoing cost to maintain the open position   this makes them less suitable for buy and hold strategies as those ongoing costs will eat into your returns   it 's also not clear whether you would receive any dividends paid by the stock which make up a significant proportion of returns for buy and hold investors   etoro 's website is fairly non etoro intends to offer a financial compensation representing the dividends which will be allocated on stocks to the extent such dividends shall be available to etoro all of these points expose what cfds are really for speculating on the stock market or as i like to call it gambling   if you want to invest in stocks for the long term cfds are a bad idea they have high ongoing costs and the counterparty risk becomes significant   wait until you have enough money and then buy the real thing   alternatively consider mutual funds which will allow you to purchase partial shares and will ensure your investment is better diversified across a large number of stocks   if however you want to gamble and only keep your position open for a short time these issues may not be of concern to you there 's nothing wrong with gambling it can be fun many people gamble in casinos or on football matches but bear in mind that 's what cfds are for   cfds were in fact originally created for the uk market as a way to avoid paying capital gains tax when making short term speculative trades   however if you are going to gamble make sure you 're not putting any more than 1 of your net worth at risk 0.1 may be a better target there are a few other ways to take a position on stocks using less money than the share price fortunately etoro do not allow leveraged purchase of stocks so you 're reasonably safe on this point   they claim this is because of their responsible trading policy although i find that somewhat questionable coming from a broker that offers leverage on fx pairs one final word on etoro 's social trading feature   a few years ago i was in a casino playing blackjack   i know nothing about blackjack but through sheer luck of the draw i managed to my money in a very small amount of time   seeing this a person behind me started following me by putting his chips down on my seat   needless to say i lost everything but amazingly the person behind me got quite annoyed and started criticizing my strategy   the idea of following other people 's trades just because they 've been lucky in the past sounds entirely foolish to me   remember the warning on every mutual fund past performance does not guarantee future returns

a good quick filter to see if a property is worth looking at is if the total rent for the property for the year is equal to 10 of the price of the property   for example if the property is valued at $ 400,000 then the rent collected should be $ 40,000 for the entire year   which is $ per month if the property does not bring in at least 10 per year then it is not likely all the payments can be covered on the property   it 's more likely to be sinking money into it to keep it afloat you would be exactly right as you have to figure in insurance utilities taxes maintenance repair mortgage payments new roof new furnace etc paint etc also as a good rule of thumb expect a vacancy rate of at least 10 or 1 month per year as a precaution if you have money sitting around look into real estate investment trusts   iirc the average dividend was north of 10 last year   that is all money that comes back to you   i 'm not sure what the tax implications are in australia however in canada dividends are taxed very   no mortgage property tax tenants to find or maintenance either

like most forms of insurance health insurance is regulated at the state level so what is available to you will depend greatly upon which state you live in you can probably find a list of insurance companies from your state 's official website many states now provide insurance of last resort for individuals who ca n't get insurance through private insurance companies you can try looking into professional and trade associations some offer group insurance plans comparable with cobra coverage meaning you 'd get a group discount and benefits but without the benefit of an employer paying 30 80 of your premiums as a software developer you may qualify for membership in the or which both offer several forms of insurance to members the also offers insurance though they do n't provide much information about it on the public portions of their website these organization offer other benefits besides insurance so you may want to take that in to consideration the national federation of independent business also offers insurance to members you may find other associations in your specific area credit unions and the local chamber of commerce are all possible avenues of finding lower cost insurance options if you are religious there are even some faith based non insurance organizations that provide medical cost sharing services they depend upon the generosity and sense of fairness and obligation of their members to share the burden of medical expenses so their definitely not for everyone

the basic problem here is that you need to have money to invest before you can make a profit from it   now if you have say $ 500 k or more you can put that in mutual funds and live modestly off the profits   if you do n't have that $ 500 k to start out with you 're either looking at a long time frame to accumulate it say by working a job for 30 + years and contributing the max to your 401k or are playing the market trying to get it   the last is essentially gambling though with somewhat better odds than casinos or horse racing and puts you up against the gambler 's ruin problem you also i think have a very mistaken idea about the a typical investor 's lifestyle   take for instance the best known one warren buffet   no offence to him but from everything i 've read he lives a pretty boring life   spends all day reading financial reports and what sort of life is that as for flying places being exciting ever tried it   i have with scientific conferences but i expect are much the same and it is boring   flying at 30,000 ft is boring and if it 's a commercial flight unpleasant as well   a conference room in london paris or is exactly the same as a conference room in iowa   even the cities outside the conference rooms are much of a these days you can eat at mcdonalds in paris or shanghai   only way to find interest is to take time from your work to get outside the conference rooms commercial districts and then you 're losing money

you should speak to a good tax adviser the less documentation you have the more problems irs are going to cause you generally you can deduct business losses in the year they occurred which is 2011 but you have to show that that was a valid business not just a way to reduce your tax bill with personal expenses thus lack of documentation reduces your ability to prove that you 're entitled to the deduction the burden of proof is generally on you you can not deduct it from 2012 taxes but you can still amend 2011 keep in mind though that amended returns have higher chance of audit and a significant business loss on a business that only existed that year is a major red flag which will raise the probability of an audit to very high percentage theoretically if the business was real and just failed you can definitely deduct this but practically lack of documentation may cause too big a problem and a tax adviser might suggest you giving it up if he does n't think you have a real chance to convince the irs definitely do n't do that without a professional advice it is worth fighting for its quite a loss but do n't do it on your own as you will definitely lose

the advice you were given in the other question was do n't do it the math is not the issue the interest structure is not the issue but there is a significant chance that you could lose money on the deal if you invested your money in a nasdaq heavy position in january 2000 you are still waiting to break even in november of 2013 invest in almost anything in august 2001 and you will be down for a long time invest just before the housing collapse in 2007 and only now returning back to where you were if you take money on a monthly basis and invest it you will be better off   if want to get the loan then set up a stream of money into a bank account to make sure that when payments are due you have the cash to do so when the two years are up you will have cash to repay the loan and no need to sell the investments also if you are a bad judge of investments you wo n't have a problem repaying the loan using a loan to purchase stock reduces your gains and increases your losses use the power of dollar cost averaging by making periodic purchases

i do n't have any experience in this but this is my academic understanding of business pricing   the lowest amount a seller would accept is the liquidation value for a b&b what would the value of the land the house the furnishings accounts payable etc be if it had to be sold today minus any liabilities   the amount the seller would like to pay for is going to be a multiple of its annual earnings one example of this is the discounted cash flow analysis you determine the ebitda the earnings a company generated before interest   depreciation taxation and amortization   once you have this amount you can project it out in perpetuity or you use an industry multiplier   perpetuity   you project this value out in discounted by the going interest rate in other words if you project the business will earn $ the business should grow at a 5 rate and the going interest rate is 8 using a growing perpetuity formula one value of a business would be 100,000 .08 = $ 2,000,000   this is a very high number and the seller would love to get it   it 's more common to do a multiple of the you can do some research into the valuation of the particular industry to figure out the multiplier for the industry for example this article suggests that the 2011 ebitda multiplier for hospitality industries is it 's valuing large hotel chains but it 's a start so the value of this b&b would be around $ here is an online sme valuation tool to help with the multiple based valuation also from my research it looks like many small business use seller discretionary earnings   instead of ebitda i do n't know much about it but it seems to serve a similar purpose as ebitda   a potential buyer should request the financial statements of the business for the last few years to determine the value of the business and then can negotiate with the owner a price you would probably want to enlist a broker to help you with the transaction

your question asks how but if may be your issue most companies will not permit an external transfer while still employed or under a certain age 55 or so   if yours is one of the rare companies that permits a transfer you simply open an ira with the broker of your choice schwab fidelity etrade or a dozen others that broker will give you the paperwork you need to fill out and they initiate the transfer   i assume you want an ira in which you can invest in stocks or funds of your choosing a traditional ira the term self directed has another meaning often associated with the account that permits real estate purchases inside the account the brokers i listed do not handle that those custodians have a different business model and are typically smaller firms with fewer offices not country wide

michael gave a good answer describing the transaction but i wanted to follow up on your questions about the lender first the lender does charge interest on the borrowed securities the amount of interest can vary based on a number of factors such as who is borrowing how much are they borrowing and what stock are they trying to borrow   occasionally when you are trying to short a stock you will get an error that it is hard to borrow this could be for a few reasons such as there are already a large amount of people who have shorted your broker 's shares or your broker never acquired the shares to begin with which usually only happens on very small stocks in both cases the broker lender does nt have enough shares and may be unwilling to get more in that way they are discriminating on what they lend if a company is about to go bankrupt and a lender does nt have any more shares to lend out it is unlikely they will purchase more as they stand to lose a lot and gain very little   it might seem like lending is a risky business but think of it as occurring over decades and not months general motors had been around for 100 years before it went bankrupt so any lender who had owned and been lending out gm shares for a fraction of that time likely still profited   also this is all very simplified joetaxpayer alluded to this in the comments but in actuality who is lending stock or even who owns stock is much more complicated and probably does nt need to be explained here i just wanted to show in this over simplified explanation that lending is not as risky as it may first seem

why would i want to approve an increase in the number of authorized shares because you trust management to use those shares wisely what it comes down to is management is asking for money while it may not be cash they 're asking for it has the same effect before you approve this you have to evaluate the request similarly to how a bank would evaluate a loan request and ask if you approve of their reasons for needing the money and if you think that it will be used to increase the value of the company making your shares more valuable in the process

ianal but i had heard and would appreciate someone more qualified commenting on this that one reason these things were often found unenforceable is that there is no consideration   the contract is to bind you for your work each day but once you stop working they you have a continued obligation that your time at the company   claiming that your day to day compensation covers this is as if to say some part of that compensation is not for your work but to pay you for not going elsewhere   it would be nice to see at minimum a requirement to separate these two concepts into separate contracts as bundling them creates a blur and most importantly does n't allow you to negotiate or walk away from the terms of one part without the other   at the heart of any market which the job market purports to be is a sense that a fair price is reached when both parties can walk away from a bad deal this is not so in the case of employment because as said a hungry man is not a free man so someone who needs to eat or feed a family has a need to take an offer that is already their acceptance of work and this quasi duress is compounded when a company can attach additional pressures that work that person 's ability to fairly negotiate possible improvements of what may already have been a bad situation   i 'm of the impression that duress itself has been argued to be a reason to hold a contract invalid   but more and generally any time two parties are bargaining i 'm not sure the legal definition but intuitively i 'd say where one party has the ability to force a contract change and the other party is not then those terms have to be suspect   also for the special case the pay is anything near minimum wage i would suggest asking the question of whether the part of the compensation that is salary not keeping you from working for the competition is the wage paid consistent with minimum wage or does it have to draw from the pool of money that is not about wage but is about incentivizing you to not move   and finally if they stop paying you and each day you 've been paid a little to work and a little to incentivize you to leave then are you getting a continued revenue stream to continue to incentivize you not to work for the competition if not there would seem again not to be consideration   as i said i 'm not an expert in this i just follow such matters sometimes in the news but i do n't see these issues getting discussed here and i hope we 'll see some useful responses from the crowd here and also the smart folks at reddit can help through their discussions to form some useful political and legal to help individuals overcome what is really a moral outrage on this matter   capitalism is an often cruel engine   i worked at a company where one of the bosses said to me after contributing really great things that added structurally in fundamental ways to the company do n't tell me what you 've done tell me what you 've done lately capitalism makes people scrap every day to prove their worth so it 's morally an outrage to see it also trying even as it beats down the price of someone and tells them they are n't entitled to better to tell them that they may not go somewhere else that thinks they are better that is not competition and it is not fair     indentured servitude not slavery is more technically correct and yet it is a push to treat people like capital so slavery is not inappropriate   the topic is non competes but really it 's about businesses not wanting to have to compete for employees that is about businesses not wanting capitalism to prevail in hiring   sorry for the length

you need to report the interest expense assuming the loans were for your business you need to report interest expense only interest principle is not an expense just as the loan proceeds are not income the interest expense goes to the appropriate line on your schedule c or e depending on whether you used the loan for the online business or the rental people whom you borrowed from must also report the interest as income to them on their schedule b. you can not deduct the interest expense if they do n't report it as interest income if you did n't take the loans for your business then the interest is not deductible you do n't need to report anything people who lent you money still have to report the interest you paid to them as income on schedule b. if you paid no interest free loan or below above market interest to a related party family member then the imputed interest is considered income to them and gift to you they need to report it on their schedule b and depending on amounts on a gift tax return for $ 1 k to $ 10 k loans there probably will be no need in gift tax returns the exemption is for $ 14 k per year per person if the imputed interest rules may apply to you better talk to a licensed tax adviser on how to proceed

not only are absolute incomes adjusted for inflation not increasing but purchasing power is also decreasing decades ago the salary of one middle class worker can raise a family nowadays you ca n't even buy a home with two salaries especially in large metro areas there are numerous factors why this is happening   1 globalization why pay an american more when something can be done or made in vietnam for a fraction of the cost prices of non renewable resources will increase as third world countries modernize and their populations demand the same luxuries that we have   2 automation automation has eliminated many jobs further driving income inequality there are people with very high salaries since automation are making them much more productive and then there are jobs that have been completely eliminated because of automation i know of factories that laid off a large fraction of their operators because the machines are now automated but they did a hire few more engineers and technicians to increase productivity   3 scarcity of land everyone wants to live in areas where the jobs are but you can only build so much housing in one area so house prices go up faster than wages people with good jobs in industries where jobs are clustered in one place biotech software semiconductors finance etc actually can afford less real estate than one would think based on their income just because of their location   these issues will become even more relevant as technology continues to develop and globalization continues

the prices we pay for goods and services are n't set by our levels of income why should the compensation we owe the community in taxes   lvt and with their capitalisation into selling prices are economically one and the same thing the only difference is who collects   if lvt is an income tax then so is rent or mortgage repayments in fact paying for anything is an income tax   the lvt is merely the way by which we equally share the value derived from scarce natural resources if we do n't do that then inequality and dysfunction are baked into our economies and societies   lvt does n't tax the wealth people create from land but taxes the wealth creating potential of land it is the of taxing incomes capital and transactions that causes losses whereas the lvt has none     this is because it is set by market not levels of income as the amount an individual or firm is prepared to pay for exclusive use of that location so if you can not pay the lvt then someone else will   that is not only fair but the optimally efficient way of allocating resources   this is how a capitalist free market based economy is supposed to work those that opposed the lvt are nothing but blue socialists

selling short is simply by definition the selling then later re buying of stock you do n't initially own say you tally your entire portfolio balance the quantity of each stock you own and your cash assets let 's call this your initial position we define profit as any increase in assets relative to this initial position if you know a particular stock will go down you can realize a profit by selling some of that stock waiting for the price to go down then buying it back in the end you will have returned to your initial position except you will have more cash if you sell 10 shares of a stock valued at £ 1.50 then buy them back at £ 1.00 you will make a £ 5.00 profit while having otherwise returned to your previous position if you do the same but you initially owned 1000 shares sold just 10 of those then bought 10 back that 's still a profit of £ 5.00 selling short is doing the same thing but with an initial and ending balance of 0 shares if you initially own 0 shares sell 10 then buy 10 back you return to your initial position 0 shares plus a profit of £ 5.00 and in practice you must also pay a borrowing fee to do this the advantage of selling short is it can be done with any stock not just those currently owned

corporate taxes   mises daily wednesday july 09 2008 by sterling t.     lower corporate taxes are associated with economic growth this can be shown a and empirically   a   corporate taxes reduce the profits of business owners this is true because net income is reduced by the tax rate for example firm x with a $ 100 investment earning a 7 return has an income before taxes of $ 7 with a 10 corporate tax rate net income after taxes is $ firm x now has earned a 6.3 return in contrast a corporate tax rate of 40 reduces net income after taxes by $ 2.80 to $ or a 4.2 after tax return this rise in taxes on the margin reduces the profit seeking incentive to take business risks why risk starting a biotech company when inflation protected t bill 's will give you the same return entrepreneurs and venture capitalists less willing to take risk means less innovation and fewer innovative ideas being economically viable this results in less economic growth conversely higher returns on invested capital encourage investment and savings all of this leads to more capital savings more innovation better technology and higher wages   further the above example of firm x is true if the firm does not have the pricing ability to transfer the tax to its customers if the ability does exist an increase in the corporate tax rate is really a tax on customers of the firm in this case consumers now have less to spend and save and the end result is the same   finally a firm unable to pass on a tax increase or bear the reduced profit will either attempt to cut costs by reducing wages among other costs or be forced to go out of business   the main point is this by definition corporations do not pay taxes people pay taxes a corporate tax is either a tax on shareholders of the firm customers of the firm or employees of the firm less corporate tax means more innovation capital savings and spending by these groups also known as economic growth   empirically   after theory and logic tell us what is true can confirm our result   thankfully professors young lee university and gordon uc san diego have done the work for us in a 2005 journal article they concluded   this paper finds that the corporate tax rate is significantly negatively correlated with economic growth in a cross section data set of 70 countries during controlling for many other of economic growth   more specifically they continue the estimates suggest that cutting the corporate tax rate by 10 percentage points can increase the annual growth rate by around   using these figures andrew of the tax foundation   by cutting the u.s. 's combined federal and average state corporate tax rate from roughly 40 percent to 30 percent we could boost u.s. economic growth by around 1.1 percent per year enough to double our nation 's wealth every 63   even better a cut from the actual corporate tax rate of 35 to a rate of 10 would double our nation 's wealth every 30 years   life savers moved production to canada industries and tyco international moved to has announced a move to dubai in a economy is it really a puzzle that firms prefer to operate in lower taxing less regulated environments   these are examples of what can be seen as reminds us however it is imperative to also account for what can not be seen what would the wealth of our nation be today if the corporate tax rate had always been 10 or less what creature comforts would have been what new technologies brought to market what diseases cured   due to a history of high corporate taxes these answers are not known and we are worse off because of it   sterling t. is a ph.d. candidate in the department of agricultural and applied economics at texas tech university

you need to look at all your investment as a whole the 401 k ira and any taxable account need to be a part of the diversification and re balancing the fact you have regular deposits into the 401 k needs to also be a part of your strategy   regardless of how much specific investments have gone up this year you need to first determine how you want to be invested in large cap stock small cap stock bond international emerging markets then you need to see where you are today compared to those investment percentages you then move the money in the retirement accounts to get to your desired percentage and set the 401 k deposits to be consistent with your goals many times the deposits are allocated the same way the balances are but that is more complex if one of the sectors you are investing in exists completely outside the 401k.   when you re balance in the future you will be selling sectors that grew the most and buying those that grew the least compared to their planned percentages if all the moves are within the 401 k and ira then capital gains are not a concern do n't think of the different accounts as separate baskets but think of them as a whole investment strategy

gt;i appreciate the detailed responses truthfully however i feel like at least half of your points are either just for its sake alone display a deep lack of understanding of unions collective bargaining and the histories of both or ignore and cling to an and ultimately self defeating ideology   i feel the same way about your arguments but i still try to respond to the content of your arguments rather than my assumptions about them   gt;the law forces the two parties to sit at a table the law forces the two parties to discuss a few core things like wages    the law should not force any party to sit at any table that violates a party 's contract liberty   gt;the idea is since these worker employer disputes exist naturally making them at least sit at a table together and talking is helpful in avoiding ego and fueled disruptions where no one benefits   that 's nice that you think you know what 's better for other people than they do for themselves but that does n't give you a right to force them to any table a right to contract freedom means the right to dismiss any offer or refuse to even negotiate with a party   gt;if this you see this as a violation of one 's liberty i really do n't know what to say to that   then i guess we have fundamentally different ideas about what is freedom and what is not you seem to think that forcing someone to negotiate with a party against their will is not a violation of any of their rights   gt;i'm not saying i do n't believe you but citation needed   sorry i do n't have time to dig up citations now if i have time later i 'd be happy to do so all i could find now is an inverse correlation between the state of a country 's credit market and the rate of child labor     is an abundance of indirect empirical evidence discussed below concerning   the role of credit constraints and educational   however and   2002 test the hypothesis directly   they estimate a basic model of child labor determination for a panel of countries for the years 1950 60 1970 1980 and 1995     gt;&gt;the credit constraint variable is by the share in gdp of private credit issued by 10 deposit money banks   they find that a one standard deviation increase in the share of credit in gdp is associated with a 10 percent standard deviation decrease in child labor they conclude that families with access to credit are considerably less likely to put   children to work during a period of economic volatility than parents without access to credit   educating children first lead to an increase in productivity also what if the owners of the means of production only a few in an given area have incomes 100x greater than the workers    if there are efficient financial markets that allow parents to borrow money against the expected future increase in earnings from their children being educated then yes   in less developed economies these markets have not developed and the choice is often between death and child labor    gt;they seem to be producing enough wealth to support themselves only they 're not the beneficiaries    studies have shown that by and large parents act towards their children and only put them to work if it is in the children 's best interest e.g. page 32     together the evidence so far presented it   appears that the data are consistent with a model where the returns from child   labor do not accrue to the parents parents redistribute entirely these returns to their children in the form of lower labor supply and higher schooling plus possibly increased consumption 47   laws against child labor therefore will generally do more harm than good   gt;what 's the solution here   the solution is to let the process of economic development run its course until child labor is not necessary   gt;this is typical anti union propaganda and it 's funny you pull it out since it ignores your own ideology what interest would a union have in destroying the very industry it needs to exist answer none   a union is not a self interested party a union represents self interested parties who are not directly affected by the destruction of their industry 30 years into the future since they would have retired by then   many of the laws and union backed agreements that ended up destroying many of america 's industries took decades to have their full effect it was n't a case of a law being passed and the next year the industry going bankrupt   gt;i have no idea how one could come to this conclusion i can only assume it stems from the same old idea that employers are always paying out the most that they can afford   why should employers pay out the most they can afford and why should laws be passed to force employers to do so   the only reason people invest is to profit if all profits had to be paid to employees there would be no incentive to invest and therefore no increase in capital productivity   gt;i happen to have first hand knowledge that it 's false however when my workplace unionized recently one of around a dozen locations nationally and the only one to organize the company responded by increasing wages and benefits to all locations have any locations closed no has anyone been laid off no is the company still mad profitable yes   a general effect happens gradually over a course of decades and happens in the aggregate not in every case it will not be apparent in the short run and will not be manifested in every case in other words that unionization did not result in immediate bankruptcy of your industry does not prove that unionization does not have a

i 've been listening to dave ramsey a lot lately and he encourages encourage might be too light of a word for him this priority list for budgeting i would strongly advise you to tackle this list before you start to think about any sizable fun spending   if you do n't have 1 set that aside first the options you mentioned new roof you should ask yourself what is the potential cost of not getting a new roof if you can save up for it a little at a time while putting most of the rest of your money to paying off debt that 's what i would do   unless of course there is damage or risk of damage to your house by not doing it now then you need to do the same measurement of doing the roof now against the goal of saving three to six months of expenses   especially in your case with your mortgage underwater you want to be sure you are prepared should anything happen for example losing a job and potentially being forced to move for a new job cars student loan refer to 3 above in other words yes

there is no reason why this can not be done but you can tell your friend that these actions are officially shady in the eyes of the us government any bank transactions with a value of $ 10,000 or more are automatically reported to the government as a way to prevent money laundering tax evasion and other criminal shenanigans structuring bank deposits to avoid this monetary limit is a crime in and of itself

if the money is a gift the lender will make everybody acknowledge that the money is a gift they will not care if the gift triggers tax forms for the giver signing the gift forms specifying it is a gift when it is n't a gift is fraud and there are penalties attached to that if it is a loan that will not erase the pmi requirement because the lender for the main part of the mortgage will want to protect their investment related to other impacts

i have the same problem the people above are right to an extent you have to be more disciplined but there is no reason why you ca n't get there in stages if you try to do too much too fast you 'll just give up you need to find a system that removes some of the passive barriers affecting you   you need to think what in particular is overwhelming you for me it was sitting down at the end of the month to write it all down writing it all down at the end of the week or even each day did n't work either because it was too much and i had forgotten what stuff was i 'm like you   the bank account is a record so why do i have to it or worse hand write it out what i ended up doing was divide my expenses into four categories food to include all medical shelter transportation spending with the first three being needs and the last being wants   eating out is spending i have four checking accounts with four debit cards i saved up some money i put a paycheck 's worth of money in each because i did n't know how much i spent each month in each category but knew i did n't spend an entire paycheck in any one category per month voila   no more work at the store you just put things in the basket by category at target you pay for the food and toothpaste with the medical card and the dvd with the spending card the cashiers do n't care that you pay separately and if you are buying so much crap that separating items by category is a problem why the heck are you buying so much crap at the end of the month you will now have a record of how much you spend on transportation housing electricity would be paid online from this account for example medical and fun that 's all anyone needs to help you get started you can then see if your housing is 35 or less or whatever percentage you feel is right the person trying to help the author above is right a target charge does n't indicate whether you bought some oil for the car or cold medicine or a lock for the cabinet door that broke but when you pay for each of these things under the right account you do know how the money is allocated   doing it this way requires little discipline before you put the item in the basket you just ask yourself is this a want or a need which is something you should be doing anyway if it 's a need is it for my car house or body the house is what i use if i ca n't figure it out like paying for the renewal of my professional license   that 's it you have to stand at the register for longer but so what   if you are spending all your salary and you stop when you have no more money assuming you 've run through all of your savings which you will soon if you do n't change then you have no more money to spend so if you are honest when you put things in the vs want you are going to run out of spending money real quick your spending money account will be empty but you will still have food money set your debit card up so that it denies your charge if you do nt have enough money   once you realize how much you truly spend for needs in each category yoy will only put that much in each account therefore you ca n't use the house card to just borrow from it till next month if you do you wo n't be able to pay your bills if you have so little discipline that you knowingly spend your bill money then there is a deeper issue going on than just finding the right budgeting cash flow system for you   something is seriously wrong and you need to seek professional help when someone is trying to help you the first step is to determine what category you are spending too much in then when you realize it 's the house category for example you will need to figure out why you are spending so much in that category a bank statement wo nt tell you that so you can do what we did on every receipt you walk out of the write down what each purchase is on the receipt then you can hand over the receipts to whoever is helping you   most items are easily recognizable on the receipt so you wo nt have to write everything down   you should be doing this for insurance purposes anyway    again if your receipt is so long that this is onerous probably everything you just spent is not a need and maybe you need to turn right around and return stuff maybe you need to go to the store more often so there are only a few purchases on each receipt groceries are groceries   you do n't need to detail that out for ikea when you have to purchase pieces to a set we get a separate receipts for each   so the brackets and shelving for the bedroom will be on one receipt and the brackets and shelving for the other room will be on another receipt even at the store i ca nt figure out what all the little pieces are but really if you are making a decent enough salary then you are probably spending too much on wants and are calling the items needs   so really your problem is correctly identifying needs from wants define a need you make up your own definition of need dwell on it   let it become meaningful for you   oranges are a need chocolate is not no really it 's not lol   so when you are putting the stuff in the basket you do nt even have to think about whether it 's a need or not after a while   wants go in the child seat if at all possible to keep the number of items smaller   when you are ready to check out add up the items roughly in the want pile ask yourself if you really want all that stuff then put some stuff back at this point ask yourself is the 8 hours i will have to work to pay for this worth it am i really going to use it will using the item make me happy or is it the actual buying of the item that makes me feel powerful where will i put it how much time will i need to maintain it then put some stuff back get some good goals a kayaking trip or whatever ask yourself if the item is worth delaying the trip how will i feel later will i have buyers remorse if so put it back these are controls you can put into place that do n't take a lot of discipline writing the items down on the receipt is a more advanced step you can take later   if you are with friends go first so that you can write down the items while they are checking out if you are private and do n't want to share your method with your friends go to the bathroom and in the stall write it down while they wait writing the items on the receipt while in the store is sort of a trigger mechanism for remembering to do so   that pulling out of the card triggers your memory to get out your pen or ask the cashier for one the side benefit is catching someone using a cloned copy of your card   in the medical account if you see an exxon charge you know it 's not yours   also while that one account is shut down you have three others to rely on in the meantime   my spouse hated for the right card they all look the same color code your cards we have blue cross blue shield so it feels natural to have the food medical account with a blue sticker just buy a little circle sticker and place it on the edge so half is on the front and half is on the back nowhere near the strip i 've never been given a hard time about it our car is red so the car card is red etc   if you think four cards is a lot to carry ask yourself if you would rather carry four cards or keep track of every little thing   good luck i know you will find a system that works for you if you keep trying

personally i buy newer luxury cars for two reasons    1 status symbol newer cars have the latest looks performance and features like heated side mirrors and sensors that adjust control speed when in heavy traffic etc    2 older cars have more wear and tear no one has spent any significant amount of time in the car before and therefore you know the history of what the car has been through like buying a new pair of pants   you know that no one has pissed in them after i have pissed in and up my now older luxury car i sell it off and get a new one   cars wear out and as they get older they need parts replaced   my brother 's mazda for example just blew the head after buying the car new and driving 130k miles over a four year period   part of the luxury for owning a new car is the luxury of time not having your car spend any significant amount of time in a garage being worked on unless you buy a land of course

the actual physical act of obtaining the sequence data is n't the cause of the delay   the current estimates of 8 10 weeks for tumor genome sequencing are mainly due to the data processing     pooling data and processing power would actually be a huge advantage in this   after you have all the sequencing data you need to identify changes in the tumor and then determine what exactly they mean the really difficult part   if centers around the world pool their data and correlate it to clinical information the data set expands exponentially which helps everyone   otherwise each center will have their own data set which will probably get published eventually but there will be a huge delay before this information gets to the appropriate people where it can help   data pooling of this sort is already done in a lot of other cases newborn screening etc

the investments he 's chosen are well diversified   you can argue the   details but it 's a low fee low risk plan that 's simple to implement which makes it better than what of people do   starting saving early is also a great idea   now for the bad news   $ 1 mm is not enough to retire on   it ca n't generate $ 80k year without significant risk and even if it could those investment gains would be taxable   the general rule of thumb is that you should have 25x your annual expenses saved when you retire a bit more if you want to retire early at 50   do n't forget that inflation means $ 1 mm in 24 years will not have the same purchasing power it does today

borrow money from the central bank wrong premise they can not borrow as much as they want and they can not borrow without collateral i.e. government debt instruments they hold or any other instrument with value   and banks do n’t have unlimited collateral to borrow against   secondly central banks are n’t in the business of lending unlimited money the more money they lend out the more is the money supply which inflation which will eventually lead them to stop lending at any point of time they want a certain amount of money movement so they can control inflation and interest rates within an agreed limit and as limited by their economy no sane central bank would want to by printing money at will e g helicopter money so the only other way for banks is to accept deposits from private individuals you can also argue that banks make money by connecting lenders and borrowers and make their profit by being the middleman without using their assets so you can say they are making a profit with the minimum usage of their capital albeit they have the central bank looking over their shoulder to police their behaviour while some banks do charge fees for keeping deposits yes but many provide certain extra services for which they charge that is how they differentiate between no fee accounts and fee paying accounts

speaking from experience yes this was 9 years ago though and may have changed due to stricter laws i lived in london and was moving to nyc and wanted to have a functioning bank account upon arrival i banked in london with hsbc and asked them if they could set me up they connected me with the right people in the us and after many forms i had a fully functional us bank account with a foreign address and without having a social security number and i was am just your average person you will most likely not be able to get a credit card through them because of lack of credit history unless you are ridiculously rich or go for a secured credit card but a debit card should be possible my advice is to talk to your local bank and see if they can help you although it will help if they operate in the us good luck i have heard from various expats that american express may be willing to issue cards in the states based on their existing relation with clients in other countries but i digress if you have an amex in switzerland or sweden i would recommend talking to them

so how often do investors really lose money the short answer is every day let 's first examine your assumptions if the price of the share gets lower the investor can just wait until    it gets higher what are the chances that it wo n't forever or for    years there are many stocks whose price goes down and then down further and then to zero the most apparent example is of course enron the stock went from about $ 90 per share to zero in about 18 months for it to have been sold at $ 90 obviously someone had to buy it almost no matter where they sold it they lost money if they did n't sell it when the stock was worthless they lost money there are more modern examples of companies that are declining in a rapidly changing market for example sears holdings is getting beat down by amazon and many other on line retailers i suspect that if you buy it today and wait for it to go higher you will be disappointed the more common way to lose money is to either not have a plan or not stick to the plan disciplined investors typically plan to buy quality stocks at a fair price and hold them long enough for increasing sales and profits to bring the stock price up if later he hears a bit of bad news about his stock and decides to sell out of panic or fear and become a trader instead of keeping to the plan to remain a disciplined investor he is likely to lose money he will lose because no one can predict accurately that a stock is going down and will never recover nor can he predict accurately when a stock is going up and will never falter the chance of bankruptcy especially for huge companies like apple is    really low as i see it but i may be wrong thousands of people lost billions of dollars thinking that about enron too i too believe apple is a fine stock with excellent prospects but technology changes and markets change twenty or thirty years from now it may be a different case

based on what you 've said i think buying a rental is risky for you it looks like you heard that renting a house is profitable and zillow supported that idea vague advice + a website designed for selling + large amounts of money = risky at the very least that does n't mean that rental property is super risky it just means that you have n't invested any time into learning the risks and how you can manage them once you learn that your risk reduces dramatically in general though i feel that rental property has a good risk reward ratio if you 're willing to put in the time and energy to learn the business then i 'd encourage you to buy property if you 're not willing to do that then rentals will always be a crap shoot one thing about investing in rental property is you have the ability to have more impact on your investment than you do dropping money in the stock market which is good and bad

comission is a must when doing sales that is the best and only good incentive to sell more how much you want to give all depends on margins the salary level that is accepted in your state country and what sellers you have young or old   salary costs at 30 35 of total order value is normal including salary tax and all tax oriented costs around that employee    there are 2 ways of doing it only high commission and fixed salary + lower commission even if you use fixed salary + commission you can have restrictions so they have to sell above a certain level to get that commission that means that you do n't take any risks    an example of a salary model that i found was popular the numbers are just made up according to what is normal to have in sweden it 's a step model if you sell for   step 1 0 $ 3000 you get high commission 20 of everything you sell   step 2 $ 3000 $ 4000 you get fixed salary of $ 1000 + 10 commission   step 3 $ 4000 $ 6000 you get fixed salary of $ 1700 + 15 commission   and so on   your weakest points are when going to a higher step you have to change the steps so it works with your salary statistics so you have most people under a step to motivate them to go to the next instead of having them exactly above one step as you can see with a step model you just put a on the commission model but make it more attractive what the seller think is that they have a fixed salary if a seller is happy he she is selling a lot     i have also had a criteria saying that if you can keep at 1 step for more than 3 months you will start there each month then it 's up to the team leader to warn if that seller is good or just lucky

the catch is in the premium amount you pay in a pure term insurance there is no survival benefit you get paid only for the event i.e. when you die during the policy term the sum assured is paid to your nominee the money back on the other hand charges a huge premium typically 5x more than the pure term part of it is for the risk cover the balance is then invested in safe instruments and at the end if you survive you would get that money typical calculations would show that if you had yourself invested the difference in premium even in cd 's you would get much more money back the reason this product is available in the market is more of people can not part with money when they do n't get anything back to these vast majority it looks like insurance company is taking all their money and does n't give them back if they survive hence to make it seem better to these vast majority there is money back hence people all over the world buy these policy much more than a pure term policy

i can answer this question for my jurisdiction florida usa because i lived through it my dad alice passed away in 2008 just as the housing crisis was starting to heat up what happened to the mortgage my dad had a will in place   it was an old will from the 1980 's but never the less a will   we had to provide paperwork to the court that my mom had already passed away and my oldest brother was living out of state he would have been the executor otherwise   with the proper paperwork i became the executor and the property passed in to probate   at this point the estate was responsible for the house and the mortgage on it meaning me as i was the executor we decided to sell the house so we hired a realtor and set an asking price about $ 40k over what was owed on it   as we waited for it to sell i had to make monthly mortgage payments and payments to the hoa otherwise the hoa could put a lien on the property making it more difficult to sell should we find a buyer is it automatically transferred in most jurisdictions i would say not automatic   i definitely had get an estate lawyer and file the proper legal paperwork with the local county courthouse   some states have an easier probate process summary administration in florida that the requirements for small estates is bob expected to pay it off all at once no the mortgage holder was happy for me to make payments out of other estate assets in lieu of my dad   the were earning interest after all   this is probably true in most cases can the house be foreclosed on yes   in our case being 2008 we had a hard time selling the property   the asking price quickly went from $ 40k over what was owed to $ 20k over to $ 10k over then to being equal to the mortgage value   finally i approached the bank about options   they suggested a deed in lieu of foreclosure process   it was easier for us and the bank had to pay less lawyers and such   otherwise a deed in lieu is effectively the same as a foreclosure   at that point we stopped making payments   eventually me and all my siblings the heirs had to sign the proper paperwork giving the house over to the bank in our case the bank did not pursue us or rather the estate for the difference between final auction sale price and the mortgage balance it was an fha loan so the us government wound up picking up the difference   from what i understand this could have happened and we would have wound up with basically nothing out of the estate can the lender force the sale i ca n't give a definite answer on this but it probably depends   if you do n't pay   yes they sure can it 's usually part of the standard mortgage contract   i see 2 other options
