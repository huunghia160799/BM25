you are suggesting that a 1 return per month is huge there are those who suggest that one should assume a rule of thumb here that you should assume expenses of half the rent 6 per year in this case with a mortgage cost of 4.5 on a rental you have a forecast profit of that 's $ 4500 on a $ 300 k house if you buy 20 of these you 'll have a decent income and a frequently ringing phone there 's no free lunch rental property can be a full time business and very lucrative but it 's rarely a slam dunk   in response to op 's comment first while i do claim to know finance fairly well i do n't consider myself at expert level when it comes to real estate   in the us the ratio varies quite a bit from area to area the 1 rent you observe may turn out to be great actual repair costs low long term tenants rising home prices etc improve the to 2 on the 20 down and you have a 10 return ignoring appreciation and principal paydown and this example of leverage is how investors seem to get such high returns the flip side is bad luck with tenants an eviction can mean no rent for a few months and damage that needs fixing a house has a number of long term replacement costs that good numbers often ignore roof exterior painting all appliances heat ac etc that 's how that 50 of rent to costs rule comes into play

the way to resolve your dilemma is to consult the price to rent ratio of the property according to the price to rent ratio is a measure of the relative affordability of renting and buying in a given housing market it is calculated as the ratio of home prices to annual rental rates so for example in a real estate market where on average a home worth $ 200,000 could rent for $ 1000 a month the price rent ratio is that ’s determined using the formula $ 200,000 ÷ 12 x $ 1,000 also goes on to give a table comparing different cities price to rent ratio and then claim that the average price to rent ratio is currently if your price to rent ratio is lower than then yes your rents are more expensive than the average house claims that a high price to rent ratio is an argument in favor of tenants renting properties while a low price to rent ratio favors people buying either to live in the property or to just rent it out to other people so let 's apply the price to rent ratio formula towards the properties you just quoted there 's a specific house i could buy for 190 perhaps even less that rents for exactly 2000 month 12 = there 's a house for sale asking 400 been on the market 2 yrs could probably get for 350 which rents for 2800   12 = 12 = one can quite easily today buy a house for that would rent out for 1700 2100 month   lower bound 12 = upper bound 12 = even so the rental returns here seem ridiculously high to me based on other markets i 've noticed considering how the average price to rent ratio is and your price to rent ratio ranges from to you are indeed correct they are indeed ridiculously high qualification i was involved in real estate and used the price to rent ratio to determine how long it would take to recover a person 's investment in the property keep in mind that it 's not the only thing i care about and obviously the price to rent ratio tends to expenses involved in actually owning properties and trying to deal with periods of vacancy there 's also the problem of taking into account demand as well according to detroit mi has the lowest price to rent ratio with which should suggest that people should buy properties immediately in this city but that 's probably more of a sign of people not wanting to move to detroit and bid up the prices of properties edit i should also say that just because the properties are ridiculously expensive right now does n't mean you should expect your rents to decrease rather if rents keep staying at their current level i 'd predict that the property values will slowly increase in the future thereby raising the price to rent ratio to non ridiculous mode

i would not claim to be a personal expert in rental property i do have friends and family and acquaintances who run rental units for additional income and/or make a full time living at the rental business   as joetaxpayer points out rentals are a cash eating business you need to have enough liquid funds to endure uncertainty with maintenance and vacancy costs often a leveraged rental will show high roi or cagr but that must be balanced by your overall risk and liquidity position i have been told that a good rule of thumb is to buy in cash with a target roi of 10 of course ymmv and might not be realistic for your market it may require you to do some serious bargain hunting which seems reasonable based on the stagnant market you described some examples the main point here is assessing the risk associated with financing real estate the roi or cagr of a financed property looks great but consider the net income a few expensive maintenance events or vacancies will quickly get you to a negative cash flow multiply this by a few rentals and your risk exposure is multiplied too   note that i did not factor in appreciation based on op information cash purchase with some very rough estimates based on op example net income = rent tax = $ per year finance purchase rough estimate with 20 down net income = rent tax = $ 7500 per year

the first issue is if the stock has returned 8 since you purchased it that could be either very good 8 in two days or very bad 8 over 20 years   even just measured over the past year it could be relatively very good up 8 and the market is down 5 or very bad up 8 and the market is up 16 either way the good rule of thumb is that you should n't choose your positions using the returns of the stock in the past but only on your view of the future returns of the stock   for instance if the stock has gone up 8 in two months but you think it has another 8 to go in the next two months you probably should n't take your earnings as for the $ 5k at first glance that is not an unreasonable amount   if you use a discount broker the fees should n't be so large that you will eat up any return on a $ 5k amount   also from what you describe it is not such a large amount that mistakes will put your retirement in danger

put simply the advice to never sell a home in ca is based on   note that 2 is unusual   property taxes that do not change as the home value rises came about because of a voter ballot measure   ca prop 13   so in california selling your home will expose the buyer of your home to more property taxes than you had to pay    this has some odd consequences this is all fairly unique   i know property taxes in change as the home increases in value

i used to be a trader at a desk that sold delta one derivatives on listed indices think swaps etfs there is a lot to do    sell stocks according to redemptions or new orders manage the currency exposure indices rebalance their composition everyday based on stock corporate actions dividends and index reviews you need to be aware of each and everyone and rebalance your portfolio to account for it manage your inventory to get the best repo rates possible trade single stock swaps with foreign counterparties to get access to better tax rates on dividends when you have a big order where certain stock orders may not get filled you have to create a strategy for managing that risk sometimes you hedge your positions using futures that expire every three months in which case you need to figure out the best times to roll your expiring futures i could go on and on   basically since the profit margins are so low the market so competitive for such vanilla products and the volumes so high you have to really make your processes super efficient and error proof trust me there is a lot to be done

you can charge a fee to accept checks although i think the better solution might be to offer a small discount for early payment of your invoices   as some people here have suggested why not add a small bit to your fees to begin with to cover your inconvenience in the case they choose to pay by check    i often will give clients a small discount of 1.5 for paying my invoices within 10 days which does motivate some to pay sooner depending on the client and the amount of the invoice   if you 've already added a small amount to your fees in the first place then providing the discount is good public relations that does n't actually cost you anything you can always add a convenience fee for accepting checks but this is a more negative approach as though you 're penalizing the client for paying by check rather than electronically   some people do see it this way despite any efforts you make to explain otherwise as to your question about adding fees for accepting credit cards be very careful   there are sometimes state or local laws on this and you could find yourself in trouble very quickly if you run afoul of one   here 's a good article to read on the subject adding fees for accepting credit cards from site i hope this is helpful good luck

apparently only in america do people understand the difference between positive and negative rights   a negative right requires others to abstain from interfering with your actions   these are natural rights such as freedom of speech religion freedom from unreasonable search and etc   the constitution is full of negative rights that are by the creator i.e the government does not grant them to you but rather the government can not strip them from you because you already have them   positive rights require others to provide you with either a good or service such as healthcare   these rights always require government coercion such as forced taxation to implement   they also do n't exist without that government coercion   these rights are granted by government and can be taken away by government as well   americans are much more supportive of negative rights   true freedom means freedom from government coercion   thus calls for healthcare as a right are rejected by huge numbers of americans   healthcare is not a right in the same sense that freedom of speech is because it is not a negative right

i have an answer and a few comments back to the basics   insurance is purchased to provide protection in case of a loss it sounds as though you are doing well from a financial perspective if you have $ 0 of financial obligations loans mortgages credit cards etc and you are comfortable with the amount that would be passed on to your heirs then you do not need life insurance life insurance is protection for your heirs so that they can pay off debts and pay for necessities if you are the bread winner and your assets wo n't be enough that 's all life insurance should never be viewed as an investment vehicle some policies allow you to invest in funds of your choosing but the fees charged by the insurance company are usually high higher than you might find elsewhere to answer your other question i think ny life is a great life insurance company they are a mutual company which is better in my opinion than a stock company because they are okay with holding extra capital this means they are more likely to have the money to pay all of their claims in a specific period which shows in their ratings whereas public companies will yield a lower return to their stock holders if they are just sitting on additional capital and not paying it back to their stock holders

no this is not solid advice it 's a prediction with very little factual basis since us interest rates are kept just as low and debt levels are just as high as in the eurozone the usd may rise or fall against the eur stay the same or move back and forth nobody can say with any certainty however it is not nearly as risky as normal forex speculation since that is usually very short term and highly leveraged you 're unlikely to lose more than 20 30 of your capital by just buying and holding usd of course the potential gains are also limited

at this level it 's not so much about handling money in the way we think of it in the first world    it 's more like you have no possible way to get enough capital to get out of a desperately bad situation but if you do get that capital you can start digging your way out   for example in one case i read about someone used part of that $ 1000 to buy a cow then she started selling milk and saving money

from an article i wrote a while back dalbar inc. a boston based financial services research firm has been measuring the effects of decisions to buy sell and switch into and out of mutual funds since 1984 the key finding always has been that the average investor earns significantly less than the return reported by their funds for the 20 years ended dec. 31 2006 the average stock fund investor earned a paltry 4.3 average annual compounded return compared to percent for the standard poor ’s 500 index it 's one thing to look at the indexes but quite another to understand what other investors are actually getting the propensity to sell low and buy high is proven by the data dalbar publishes and really makes the case to go after the magic s&p 0.09 gotten from an etf

you might want to just keep it in cash for one step further you could do an even split of usd eur and silver usd hedges against loss of value in the euro precious metal hedges against a global financial problem silver over gold because of high gold silver ratio is high you could lose money this way there are some bad things that can happen that will make your portfolio fall but there are also many bad things that can happen that would result in no change or gain with careful trades in stocks and even more aggressive assets you could conceivably see large returns but since you 're novice you wo n't be able to make these trades and you 'll just lose your investment ordinarily can buy an s&p etf and enjoy decent return 7 8 annual on average at reasonable risk but that only works if you stay invested for many years in the short term s&p can crash pretty badly and stay low for a year or more if you can just wait it out great it has always recovered eventually but if some emergency forces you to take the money out you 'd have to do so at a big loss lately the index has shown signs of being overvalued if you buy it now you could luck out and be 10 15 up in a year but you could also end up 30 down not a very favorable risk reward rate which is why i would hold on to my cash until it does crash or failing that starts looking more robust again and then think about investing

when investing in index funds index fund as the name suggests invests in the same proportion of the stocks that make up the index you can choose a index fund that tracks nyse or s&p etc you can not select individual companies generally these are passively managed i.e. just follow the index composition via automated algorithms resulting in lower fund manager costs is it possible to establish an offshore company yes it is possible and most large organization or high net worth individuals do this its expensive and complicated for ordinary individuals one needs and army of international tax consultants international lawyers etc but do i have to pay taxes from the capital gains at the end of the year yes canada taxes on world wide income and you would have to pay taxes on gains in canada note depending on your tax residency status in us you may have to pay tax in us as well

since no one else answered this part of your question yet   checking your own credit score or report will not affect it in any way   it only hurts you when someone looks it up to run a credit check at your request for the purpose of possibly getting a loan for example a car dealership this only hurts it a tiny bit and is not worth worrying about unless you are going to 20 different car dealerships who each do a check however it is a good idea not to let them run your credit until you are seriously ready to buy a car in fact it is better to just get financing somewhere else and not let them run it at all

you can choose to place lower buy limit orders but whether they get filled or not is not a given it depends on whether sellers care to accept your bid in your example of a 49.98 spread if you place a buy with limit of 49.99 it wo n't get filled if the order reaches the market while still at 49.98 immediately but will be added to the order book   by being added to the order book the markets bid and ask become 49.99   your order wo n't get filled until some seller places a market order or a sell limit order of 49.99 or less   no guarantee that that will happen and even if it does there 's nothing to say that your follow up buy at 49.98 will ever be filled   in fact your 49.98 buy order queues up at the end of the line behind all previously pending 49.98 bids since your order arrived after those other bids   since the initial conditions you supposed had a 49.98 bid such an order exists or at least did exist it might have been cancelled in the intervening moment basically your first buy at 49.99 if it happens has essentially no influence on whether your second buy at 49.98 will happen   you ca n't expect to move the market lower by making a bid that is higher 49.99 than the existing best bid 49.98   whatever influence your 49.99 order has is to raise the market 's price not lower it

it 's a tough question because there is society and individual to consider and the society 's effects on the individual   currently employers do n't have to provide insurance they do it to compete in the employee marketplace employers have an advantage over employees in that regard because they can procure insurance at a lower cost that employees can and they get tax breaks for doing so employers providing health insurance get a more stable relationship with their employees because employees always hold great value in having an employee who provides good benefits   the company i work for provides good benefits but suppose tomorrow they told me hey we 're not providing benefits anymore but we 'll bump your salary to what your benefits are worth plus enough to compensate for the tax break we get so now everything is equal to what it was before but i have to go out and find my own insurance which is a hassle but presumably because of the ppaca i can get a good value and carry this insurance with me wherever i go and never have to mess with changing every time i change jobs   but suppose all the employers do this so now there are no employer provided health plans and ten or twenty years down the line they 've all just taken advantage so that wages have n't kept up and they 've essentially pocketed the difference or passed it on to their customers now people have less money to buy health insurance and those near the bottom will now have to rely on the government to assist with providing health insurance   this is the way it works now with the minimum wage a recent report found that walmart employees rely on welfare to the tune of $ billion a fuels inequality epidemic taking advantage of our safety net while the company makes $ 15 billion in profit so 18 of walmart 's profits are an indirect subsidy from the us taxpayer which comes to about $ 48 per us citizen or about $ a year for the top 50 of wage earners   even so i think i 'd prefer to get my whole compensation package in one shot all else being equal that last part is important though i would need to get all the breaks my employer gets for providing myself with health insurance

i do n't think you can really classify it as front running technically the only information that the alleged front runner in this case has over the followers is the knowledge of the trade itself knowledge of the trade may indeed be share price sensitive information for some high volume traders or those respected and with many followers but it 's not really like they ca n't know about it before everyone else parity is n't possible in this case if an company organisation i.e. the social trading platform say responsible for the details log of a trader to a following or individuals working for said company organisation were to act on the trading data before dissemination then they would be guilty of front running the alleged front runner may profit from the following of course but that 's only really occurring due to the publication of information that is share price sensitive and such information generally has to be published by law if it is by law so classified so it 's difficult to find too much fault there has to be a certain amount of consideration on the part of any trader as to who is more the fool the fool or the fool that follows them

there 's nothing particularly special about a two million dollar cheque while they are n't commonplace the bank certainly has experience with them many atms wo n't allow a deposit of that size but the bank cashiers will certainly accept them they will typically get a supervisor to sign off on the deposit and may ask about the source of the money for fraud prevention reasons they may be held for longer than a smaller cheque if the bank manager chooses to do so if there 's nothing remotely suspicious for example it is a cheque from an insurance company for an expected payout you should expect it will clear in about a week on the other hand if it is a cheque from a bank in another country and the bank manager has any reason to suspect it may not be legitimate they may hold it for a month or more even then you are not guaranteed the cheque was legitimate this is used in a common scam

it appears you can elect to classify some or all of your scholarship money as taxable   if you do this you would be deemed to have used the scholarship funds for non deductible purposes e.g. room and board and you could be eligible to claim the american opportunity credit based on the money you used to pay for the tuition out of your own pocket i found this option in the section of publication 970 about coordination with pell grants and other scholarships specifically example 3 the facts are the same as in example excluded from income i.e. bill receives a $ scholarship and paid $ for tuition if unlike example 2 bill includes $ 4,000 of the scholarship in income he will be deemed to have used that amount to pay for room and board the remaining $ 1,600 of the $ scholarship will reduce his qualified education expenses and his adjusted qualified education expenses will be $ 4,000 bill 's agi will increase to $ 34,000 his taxable income will increase to $ and his tax before credits will increase to $ based on his adjusted qualified education expenses of $ 4,000 bill would be able to claim an american opportunity tax credit of $ 2,500 and his tax after credits would be $ you can only income in this way to the extent that your scholarship allows you to use that money for nonqualified expenses such as room and board   you should carefully check the terms of the scholarship to determine whether it allows this   the brief paragraph you cite from the fellowship document is not totally clear on this point at least to my eye   you might want to ask the fellowship administrators if there are restrictions on how they money may be used in addition i would be cautious about attempting to do this unless you actually did pay for the nonqualified expenses yourself so you can treat the money as fungible   if for instance your parents paid for your room and board it 's not clear whether you could legitimately claim that you used the scholarship money to pay for that since you did n't pay for it at all although in this case your parents could possibly be able to claim the themselves   i mention this because you say in your question that you only used the scholarship for tuition and fees   i 'm not sure how exactly you meant that but it seems from the example cited above that in order to claim the scholarship as taxable income you have to actually have nonqualified expenses which you can say you paid for with the scholarship   also of course you had to actually receive the money yourself   if the scholarship money was given directly to your school as payment of tuition then you never had any ability to use it for anything else

what 's the primary factor keeping a consumer from handing out fees as as corporations or small businesses do power can an individual or more appropriately what keeps an individual from being able to charge fine or penalize a business if it could be accomplished but at a high cost let 's assume it 's based on principal and not monetary gain and have a legal entitlement to money back   no   you are of course welcome to send your doctor a letter stating that you would like $ 50 to make up for your two hour wait last time around but there 's no legal obligation for him to pay up unless he signed a contract stating that he would do so corporations also can not simply send you a fine or fee and expect you to pay it you must have either agreed to pay it in the past or now agree to pay it in exchange for something in these cases the corporations have the power you have to agree to their rules to play ball    however consumers do have a significant power as well in well competed markets the power to do business with someone else   you do n't like the fee   buy from amazon which offers free shipping on returns   you do n't like paying a no show fee from the doctor   find a doctor without one or with a more forgiving fee or with a low enough that you do n't have to make appointments early   your ability to fine them exists as your ability to not continue to patronize them in some markets though consumers do n't have a lot of power for example cable television or other utilities the fcc has a list of customer service standards which cable companies are required to meet and many states have additional rules requiring penalties for missed or late appointments tougher than that    and in the case of the doctor if your doctor is late find one that is   or try sending him a bill   it does apparently work from time to time particularly if the doctor wants to keep your business

it 's never too early to start estate planning and if you already have a family getting your personal affairs in order is a must the sooner you start planning the more prepared you will be for life 's unexpected and turns   the following tips aimed at those under 40 can help you approach and simplify the estate planning process   start now regardless of net worth estate money personal finance planning tips for people is a crucial process for everyone regardless of wealth level says marc a certified financial planner and president of harvest financial advisors many people will say well i do n't have a lot of assets therefore i do n't need an estate plan he says maybe you only have debt but it still applies if you want the people around you to appropriately deal with your finances a plan is still just as important   this is especially true if you are responsible for financially dependent individuals such as young children the less you have the more important every bit you 've got is to you and the people you care about says lawrence a partner at norman and marcus in new orleans if you do n't have much money you really ca n't afford to make a mistake   have the what if conversation with friends and family before jumping into the estate planning process it 's important to establish exactly what you want and need to happen after you die and those wishes to those around you   we find that the best transitions and financial transfers happen when all family members are involved in the decision says john executive vice president of retirement and investing strategies at fidelity investments this way after a loved one is gone no one is over a couch or going why did person a get more than person b if wishes are laid out clearly while the individual is living they can share the rationale behind the decisions   focus on the basic estate plan components experts say life insurance a will a living will and a durable power of attorney are all important aspects of an estate plan that should be established at the start of the planning process   in the event of an death life insurance can replace lost earnings which can be especially beneficial for younger individuals says bill a partner with law firm in boston young people ca n't afford to die he says they are going to lose a source of income if something happens to a young couple and they have n't had enough time to accumulate wealth from earnings to put aside in savings or a retirement plan also the earlier you take out a life insurance policy the more likely you are to be approved for reduced rates compared to older individuals   utilize estate planning professionals to draft these basic estate plans experts recommend carefully selecting a team of professionals who will educate you and draft what you need based on your individual situation do n't feel like you have to jump at the first person whose name is given to you says i think that people should interview two or more attorneys accountants trust officers financial advisors and so on   according to financial planning experts the average initial cost for the legal drafting of a will living will and durable power of attorney documentation is between $ 500 and $ 1,200 depending on the family size and location   continue to review your plan over time finally your estate plan should never be a one and done thing according to every five to seven years the documents should be to adapt to significant life events tax law changes or even the addition of more children he says it is also important to keep tabs on your insurance policies and investments as they all tie into the estate plan and can fluctuate based on the economic environment if you have to make revisions says it will cost as much as it did to create the documents in the first place

gt;in regards to the government 's size i personally believe it is much too large   here i would agree and yet disagree at the same time   wait wtf do i mean by that   well take for example your local county justice courthouse operation chances are the number of judges hearing cases has increased only slightly from the number a century ago at most they have probably doubled the number of judges this despite the fact that the population has likely increased by or even and the amount of statutes and regulations people being charged with violating has probably increased a or more   end result a justice system that relies upon rather blatant coercion escalating the charges in order to force a plea deal and so to prevent the vast majority of cases from actually going to a trial much less a trial by jury thus effectively turning the 6th amendment into a hollow shell   what has increased in size and scope instead and not only in relation to the population increase but many many times greater increase the number of police the number of and probation officers etc   likewise whereas when the country was founded each congressman represented a fairly small number of constituents iirc initially one for every 30,000 people basically the equivalent of what today would be a mayor for a small to mid sized country town   but now most congressmen have far in excess of a million constituents   end result representation and the accountability elections are supposed to enable has similar to the aforementioned justice system become a thing cf   and again what has happened in the place of an expansion of representation   the inordinate multiplication of almost entirely unaccountable bureaucrats echoes of the declaration of independence which states in the list of complaints against the king of england to wit he has a multitude of new offices and sent of officers to harass our people and eat out their substance     so it is n't really so much the simple measure of the size of government as it is the specific ways and places and unconstitutional roles into which the additional personnel have been added

yes from the point of view to the end speculator investor in stocks it is ludicrous to take on liabilities when you do n't have to   that 's why single stock options are far more liquid than single stock futures however if you are a farmer with a huge mortgage depending upon the chaos of agricultural markets which are extremely volatile a different structure might appeal to you   you could long your inputs while shorting your outputs locking in a profit   that profit is probably lower than what one could expect over the long run without hedging but it will surely be less volatile here 's where the advantage of futures come in for that kind of structure the margin on the longs and shorts can offset each other forcing the farmer to have to put up much less of one 's own money to hedge   with options this is not the case also the gross margin between the inputs rarely fluctuate to an degree so if your shorts rise faster than your longs you 'll only have to post margin in the amount of the change in the net of the longs and shorts this is why while options on commodities exist to satisfy speculators futures are the most liquid

excellent question though any why question can be challenging to answer because it depends on the financial products in question   at least i have n't seen many target date retirement funds that include a high percent of foreign stocks so below explains the ones i 've seen which are primarily us stocks the united states before the last twenty years has been seen as a country of stability   this is not true anymore and it 's difficult for my generation to understand because we grew up in the u.s.a being challenged and tend to think that china and india have always been powers but when we read investors like benjamin graham who had significant influence with warren buffett we can see this bias the u.s.a to them is stable and other countries are risky   again with the national debt and the political game in our current time it does not feel this way   but that bias is often reflect in financial instruments the us dollar is still the reserve currency though it 's influence is declining and i would expect it to decline   contrary to my view because i could be wrong here is mish who argues that no one wants to have the reserve currency because having a reserve currency brings disadvantages see here bogus threats to us reserve currency status no country really wants it i present this to show that my view could be wrong finally there tends to be the go with what you know   many of these funds are managed by u.s. citizens so they tend to have a u.s. bias and feel more comfortable investing their money at home in fact a famous mutual fund manager peter lynch had a similar mentality buy the company behind the stock and what company do we tend to know best   the ones around us one final note i 'm not saying this mentality is correct just what the attitude is like   i think you may find that younger mutual fund managers tend to include more foreign stocks as they 've seen that different world

your friend would have only been liable for a tax penalty if he withdrew more 529 money than he reported for qualified expenses    that said if he took the distribution in his name it triggers a report to the irs in his name rather than his beneficiaries   this will likely be flagged by the irs since it looks like he withdrew the money but did n't pay taxes and penalties on it not the beneficiary   in other words qualified education expenses only apply to the beneficiary not the plan owner contributor   in this case the irs would request additional documentation to show that the expenses were indeed qualified    to avoid this hassle it 's easiest to make sure the distribution is payed directly to the beneficiary rather than yourself   once he or she has the check then have them sign the check over to you or transfer it into your account   otherwise you trigger an irs in your name rather than your beneficiary

with reference to the uk structured deposits should not be confused with structured products   structured deposits are often quite simple deposit accounts you place your money into what is essentially a deposit account and are therefore guaranteed not to lose your capital as with any other deposit account the attraction is that you could earn more than you would in a normal deposit account often around double due to indirect exposure to the markets another benefit is that structured deposits can form part of your annual cash isa allowance so the returns can be tax free these products are popular with those who have savings which they are happy to deposit away for between 3 and 6 years and are looking for better rates of return than standard cash isas or savings accounts the main drawback is that you may not receive anything other than your original deposit that poses a minimal risk if your savings are earning less than 1 currently   see my article at for a more rounded overview of the structured deposits

i do n't have a solid data backed answer but this is too lengthy for a comment i 've read that on average about 1 2 is what you can get as a cash discount on a home purchase all else being equal but no hard data to back that   in certain situations it makes sense for a cash discount to be much greater than that for instance if the seller is in a hurry to close and your cash offer has no inspection clause similarly if a house has been re listed after a sale fell through you might get a greater cash discount or if an owner just over values the advantages of a cash offer anecdotally i had a neighbor take a cash offer 5 below asking and they had multiple offers at asking they took the cash offer so they could close faster 15 days also i 've lost out to a cash offer also at 5 below asking and they also had a short closing period and no inspection my offer was over asking on that one so total cash discount > 5 there can be more volatility in the luxury home market but i would n't guess that changes the cash vs financed evaluation much   would love to see if anyone finds a good source but even if they do an average is only so helpful

there is no magic formula to this quite simply earn cut expenses and pay   it sounds like you can use a little bit of help in the earning area   while it sounds like you are career focused which is great what else can you do to earn    can you start a low cost of entry side business   examples would include tutoring consulting or even baby sitting   can you work a part time job that is outside of your career field waiter gas station etc one thing that will help greatly is a written budget each and every month   have a plan on where to spend your money    then as you pay off a loan throw that money at the next one no matter if you use the smallest loan first or highest interest rate first method if you do that your debt payments will snowball and you will gain momentum i 'd encourage you to keep good records and do projections   keeping good records will give you hope when you begin to feel discouraged it happens to just about everyone   doing projections will give you goals to meet and then exceed    the wife and i had a lot of success using the cash envelope system and found that we almost always had money left over at the end of the pay cycle   for us that money went to pay off more debt      do you contribute to a 401 k   i 'd cut that to at least the match and if you want to get crazy cut it to zero    the main thing to know is that you can do it i 'd encourage you to pay off all your loans not just the high interests ones

standard deviation from wikipedia in statistics and probability theory the standard deviation    represented by the greek letter sigma shows how much variation or    from the average a low standard deviation    indicates that the data points tend to be very close to the mean also    called expected value a high standard deviation indicates that the    data points are spread out over a large range of values in the case of stock returns a lower value would indicate less volatility while a higher value would mean more volatility which could be interpreted as high much change does the stock 's price go through over time mean would be interpreted as if all the figures had to be the same what would they be so if a stock returns 10 each year for 3 years in a row then 10 would be the mean or average return now it is worth noting that there are more than a few calculations that may be done to derive a mean first there is the straight forward sum and division by the number of elements idea for example if the returns by year were 0 10 and 20 then one may take the sum of 30 and divide by 3 to get a simple mean of 10 however some people would rather look at a compound annual growth rate which in this case would mean multiplying the returns together so or 32 since there is some compounding here now instead of dividing a cubic root is taken to get approximately average annual return that is a bit lower yet if you compound it over 3 years it will get up to 32 as 10 compounded over 3 years would be as sharpe ratio from investopedia a ratio developed by nobel laureate william f. sharpe to measure    risk adjusted performance the sharpe ratio is calculated by    subtracting the risk free rate such as that of the 10-year u.s.    treasury bond from the rate of return for a portfolio and dividing    the result by the standard deviation of the portfolio returns thus this is a way to think about given the volatility how much better did the portfolio do than the 10 year bond r squared alpha and beta these are all around the idea of linear regression modelling the idea is to take some standard like say the s p 500 in the case of us stocks and see how well does the portfolio follow this and what if one were to use a linear model are the and addition components to it r squared can be thought of it as a measure as to how good is the fit on a scale of 0 to 1 an s p 500 index fund may well have an r squared of 1.00 or 0.99 to the index as it will track it extremely closely while other investments may not follow that well at all part of modern portfolio theory would be to have asset classes that move independently of each other and thus would have a lower r squared so that the movement of the index does n't indicate how an investment will do now as for alpha and beta do you remember the formula for a line in slope intercept form where y is the portfolio 's return and x is the index 's return y = in this situation m is beta which is the multiple of the return and b is the alpha or how much additional return one gets without the multiple going back to an index fund example m will be near 1 and b will be near 0 and there is n't anything being done and so the portfolio 's return computed based on the index 's return is simply y = x other mutual funds may try to have a high alpha as this is seen as the risk free return as there is n't the ups and downs of the market here other mutual funds may go for a high beta so that there is volatility for investors to handle

if your income stream goes up it would usually increase both your income term and your assets term since that money sits in your bank account as an asset even more likely a combination of assets and expenses go up if you have cost associated with the increase in income   in this case they balance in the equation and your equity does n't change the question as you posed it is true mathematically but the paradox happens because you 're not taking into account where the money form the increased income falls in other terms of the equation

actually you 're missing the key feature of cdos   most cdos use much to our economic misery ultimately a system call   to simplify this idea i 'll make a two example   suppose i buy mortgages covering a face value of $   because they are subprime if i just put them in a pool and finance them with bonds the rating will be lousy and most investors will shun them at least investors who are safety oriented   what i do is divide them into two tranches   one bond issue is for $ 100,000,000 and another for $   the idea is that any defaulting mortgage comes out of the latter bond issue   i 'll probably keep these bonds the lower   thus buyers of the first issue are safe unless defaults exceed $   then the rating agencies rate the first issue aaa and it gets snapped up by investors   in a strict sense it is basically the entire $ backs up the first bond issue in reality many cdos had multiple tranches with the lowest being retained by the underwriters and the other tranches sold as bonds of various ratings

wikipedia has a detailed article explaining this a standard commercial letter of credit lc is a document issued mostly by a financial institution used primarily in trade finance which usually provides an irrevocable payment undertaking so yes they are primarily for use by businesses if you will read the article stating the terms and conditions for payment and shipment you will realize that such model wo n't be of much value to and will create many hurdles for a typical consumer yes you can cash a letter of credit but only once the conditions in the letter have been met e.g. delivery shipment of goods services an array of documents need to be presented as well whether it is easy or not is a very subjective question   a bank will issue a letter of credit only when it is reasonably sure that its risk is covered backed by a bank deposit or by conditions in the letter itself obviously derivatives on these letters have evolved as well

while the vanguard paper is good it does n't do a very good job of explaining precisely why each level of stocks or bonds was optimal if you 'd like to read a transparent and quantitative explanation of when and why a a glide path is optimal i 'd suggest the following paper   full disclosure i 'm the author   the answer is that the optimal risk level for any given holding period depends upon a combination of   using these two factors you construct a risk averse decision model which chooses the risk level with the best expected average outcome where it looks only at the median and lower percentile outcomes this produces an average which is specifically robust to downside risk the result will look something like this    the exact results will depend on the expected risk and return of the portfolio and the degree of risk aversion specified   the result is specifically valid for the case where you liquidate all of the portfolio at a specific point in time for retirement the glide path needs to be extended to take into account the fact that the portfolio will be liquidated gradually over time and dynamically take into account the longevity risk of the individual   i ca n't say precisely why vanguard 's path is how it is

freezing your credit should be the default configuration     edit   more info on why   basically you 're adding a password to your credit report access     4 is there a low cost alternative to monitoring services   the best low cost alternative to credit monitoring services is a security freeze a security freeze locks your credit files at the three credit reporting agencies equifax experian and transunion until you unlock your file with a password or pin the freeze stops new accounts from being established by because potential creditors are not able to check your credit report or credit score the standard procedure when financial accounts are opened any potential requests for access to your credit files will be denied   however a security freeze can not stop misuse of your existing bank or credit accounts you still must check the monthly statements on your current accounts for any erroneous charges or debits   generally you will pay no more than $ 30 for a lifetime of security freeze protection in some circumstances identity theft victims and senior citizens in some states this protection may be free   with a security freeze your credit reports can not be seen by prospective creditors insurance companies landlords utilities or for employment screening however you may lift the freeze when necessary to allow a company to check your credit report this is easily done by means of a password it is important to realize that a security freeze does not prevent existing creditors from seeing your credit report    while a security freeze may be the best available deterrent to new account fraud it may not be the best solution for everyone it can be cumbersome for individuals who frequently apply for credit are contemplating a new mortgage or who plan to change jobs on the other hand a security freeze is particularly well suited for seniors who are no longer in the market for new credit and a freeze provides protection for individuals affected by data breaches involving social security numbers as well as victims of identity theft or mail theft for a more complete discussion of the pros and cons of security freezes read this report in consumer reports   brian post how i learned to stop worrying and embrace the security freeze is a primer on what you can do to avoid becoming a victim of identity theft   fees supporting documentation and procedures for placing a security freeze vary from state to state and among the three credit reporting agencies the web sites of each of the credit reporting agencies provide state specific instructions for placing a security freeze the websites of each of the credit reporting agencies provide state specific instructions for placing a security freeze   equifax experian transunion

your first problem is looking at these as monthly expenses rather than looking longer term at how to remove the expenses you have a $ loan but what is the interest rate if you paid that loan more aggressively it would free up 10 of your income but you ca n't pay the loan aggressively if you do n't have an emergency fund you need enough cash flow to take care of emergencies so you do n't incur more debt on less advantageous terms the way you describe the problem it appears that you do n't know where all of the money is going so the first step is to track all of your expenses and formulate a budget the budget is a plan on how to spend the money for next month at least 10 should be money you are saving for a short term emergency fund another 10 should be money you are saving for retirement until you have 6 months of expenses saved for your emergency fund you need to skip luxuries like taxi rides and maybe you need to reduce the amount you send home 22 is a large amount and unless your parents are using that money to become independent so that they wo n't rely on your contributions forever it will only prevent you from becoming wealthy enough to really help them later only you can determine what can be cut from your monthly expenses but if you want to save spending less is required

one factor to consider is that some employers have a 401k contribution match policy that only allows a certain percentage of any given paycheck to be matched so if the company is willing to match 4 of each paycheck you could run into a problem here where you lose out on some of your company match for example suppose you get a $ 20,000 bonus you can contribute $ 18,000 per year to your 401k and this bonus could be a nice way to knock most of that out and then take home your full paycheck the rest of the year sounds pretty nice but there 's a problem the company will only match 4 of your $ 20,000 $ 800 when they otherwise would have matched up to 4 of your annual salary $ 4,000 if you 're making $ 100,000 in this example i 'd say it 's definitely worth it to make a big contribution to your 401k when you get a bonus as it 's an easy way to get a lot of money in there without really feeling a loss since it 's extra money on top of your normal paycheck but i 'd definitely be careful about this situation you do n't want to throw away free money to avoid this problem make sure that you leave enough of your annual limit so you can contribute enough to get your 4 company match on every paycheck of the year

first i want to say that i agree with you that the rule   now on to economics   i will try to address each of your points as best i can    -the lack of demand is aggregate demand   this includes individual spending corporate spending government spending and exports   individual spending is down as pointed out   whether or not that is a good thing let 's reserve for later   next corporate spending is at all time lows   the s&amp;p 500 companies have the highest cash on hand ever in history   nobody is hiring   bond issues are down   mergers are down   capital is being hoarded   third up government spending   we all know this is up but do n't rush to add in the fed and bailouts to this number lets just consider it what the government actually spends into the economy   lastly exports are down because the rest of the world is hurting   so 3 out of the 4 components of aggregate demand are down and there are those that want the government to stop spending as well which would make it a straight 4 for 4    rates   well if you know that aggregate demand is down that tells you everything you need to know about interest rates   if companies were borrowing hiring expanding opening plants etc etc etc then interest rates would naturally rise due to loans being made to these companies   the fact is that companies are not expanding and loans are not being made due to no demand for them   bank reserves are at an all time high   nobody is willing to take out a loan to grow their business right now because aggregate demand is down so hard   at the same time the stock market spooked everyone and on top of it people are paying down their home mortgages at a record pace   so you have record low demand for loans and record high supply of capital money so yeah interest rates are at 1 effectively 0 if you are in a savings account    the currency to boost the exports component of the aggregate demand curve seems like it could work but since the rest of the world is also hurting who are you going to export to   the corporate sector is n't going to start spending until the consumer is on their feet   the consumer is n't going to start spending until they get jobs   do you see the chinese finger trap here   the only way out of the is to increase government spending and history has shown that it works

credit cards are a golden goose for banks as they get to issue high interest loans and simultaneously generate alot of fee income debit cards are n't quite as good but they still generate substantial fee income ~2 of every credit non pin debit transaction goes to the bank and credit card network credit histories exist because they are the most effective tool available to predict whether you will pay back your loans or not you do n't need a credit history to buy most things you need a credit history to get a large loan think of it from perspective of a lender credit scoring is the bank 's way screening out people who are expensive to do business with it 's objective does n't discriminate on the basis of race sex or other factors and you have recourse if the rating agencies have incorrect information

your questions seek answers to specifics but i feel that you may need more general help there are two things i feel that you need to learn about in the general category of personal finance   your asking questions about investing but it is not as important imho as how you manage your day to day operations    for example you should first learn to budget   in personal finance often times living on a budget equates to poor or low income    that is hardly the case   a budget is a plan on how to spend money   it should be refreshed each and every month and your income should equal your expenses   you might have in your budget a $ 1200 trip into the city to see a concert hardly what a low income person should have in theirs secondly you need to be deliberate about debt management   for some they feel that having a car payment and having student loans are a necessary part of life and argue that paying them off is foolish as you can earn more from investments   others argue for zero debt   i fall in the later   using and carrying a balance on high interest ccs and having high leases or car payments are just dumb   they are also easy to wander into unless you are deliberate    third you need to prepare for emergencies   engineers still get laid off and hurt where they are unable to work   they get sued   having the proper insurance and sufficient reserves in the bank help prevent debt now you can start looking into investments    start off slow and deliberate with investing   put some in your company 401 k or open some mutual funds on the side   you can read about them and talk with advisers for free at fidelity and vanguard   read books from the library most of all do n't get caught up in too much hype   things like forex options life insurance gold silver are not investments   they are tools for sales people to make fat commissions off the ignorant       you are fortunate in that engineers are very likely to retire wealthy   they are part of the second largest demographic of first generation rich   the first is small business owners    to start out i would read millionaire next door and stop acting rich   for a debt free approach to life check out financial peace university by dave ramsey video course   his lesson on insurance is excellent    i am an engineer and my wife a project manager we found life changing and regretted not getting on board sooner   along these lines we have had some turmoil recently that became little more than an inconvenience because we were prepared

firstly you should yourself with your options for your pension fund they changed as of 6th april 2015 so it 's all quite new the government 's guidance on it is here if you have n't already taken a tax free lump sum from your pension fund you can take up to 25 totally tax free immediately that makes getting a house for 40 k very accessible beyond the 25 you can take any of it out whenever you want access drawdown or lump sum payment depending on whether you take the 25 out up front or not that 'll be taxed as if you earned it as income so if you did n't have any other income you can take another £ without tax this tax year and then another £ or whatever the allowance goes up to next tax year and so on above that you 'd have to pay 20 tax until you reach the higher rate tax threshold at about £ 40k year you say you do have other income so you 'll have to take that into account as well when calculating what tax you 'd have to pay if you 've reached state pension age that will add some more income of course or as you suggest you can buy an annuity you can do that with some or all of the money and you can still take the 25 tax free first if you do buy an annuity the income from it will all be taxed but again your personal allowance will apply essentially an annuity is the least risky option particularly if you get one that is with inflation with inflation makes the initial income even lower but protects you against cost of living rises as you get older in exchange for avoiding that risk you probably lose out on average compared to some more risky options you might choose to get an annuity large enough to cover your basic needs and take more chances with the rest

you 're right to seek passive income and since you 're already looking for it you probably already know some of the reasons to why it is important    do you live in the united states if so i 'd strongly recommend purchasing your primary residence and then maybe investment properties if you like owning your own home   the us tax and banking structure is set up to favor this move in more ways than i can count so save save save then beg borrow and steal to get the down payment rent rooms to friends or random people to afford the payments buy a fixer upper in an up and coming neighborhood   the us is rife with these in all price ranges if you 're working 56 hrs a week you 've got the work ethic so if you ca n't afford it it 's probably because you 're spending all your money on other stuff if you want to do this it will take some effort and savings you will have to trim back the vacations dinners out etc etc etc   let your friends do that stuff and rent from you   your life will get continually easier if you have already trimmed back all the discretionary spending and still ca n't make it then you need to earn more money doing either and both of these things will absolutely change your whole economic life and future so in summary i 'd offer these   ranked priorities 1 learn to save unless you always want to have to work for someone else 2 increase your income capability since your most valuable asset is you 3 buy and hold real estate because the game is rigged to favor passive income i 'm 38 never earned a six figure salary made some good purchases when i was 25 30 and work is optional for me now

i assume us as mhoran_psprep edited although i 'm not sure irs necessarily means us it definitely used to also include britain 's inland revenue but they changed   us stockbrokers do not normally withhold on either dividends interest distributions or realized capital gains especially since gains might be reduced or eliminated by later losses they can be required to apply backup withholding to dividends and interest do n't ask how i know you are normally required to pay most of your tax during the year defined as within 10 or $ 1000 whichever is more by withholding and/or estimated payments thus if the tax on your income including your recent gain will exceed your withholding by 10 and $ 1000 you should either adjust your withholding or make an estimated payment or some combination although even if you have a job the last week of december is too late for you to adjust withholding significantly or even to make a timely estimated payment if earlier in the year means in an earlier quarter as defined for tax jan mar apr may june aug sept dec see and for details its link to publication 505 but a safe harbor may apply since you say this is your first time to have capital gains if you did not owe any income tax for last year and were a citizen or resident or except very high earners if you did owe tax and your withholding plus estimated payments this year is enough to pay last year 's tax you are exempt from the form 2210 penalty and you have until the filing deadline normally april 15 but this year april 18 due to weekend and holiday to pay the latter is likely if your job and therefore payroll income and withholding this year was the same or nearly the same as last year and there was no other big change other than the new capital gain also note that gains on investments held more than one year are classified as long term and taxed at lower rates which reduces the tax you will owe all else equal and thus the payments you need to make but your wording bought and sold earlier this year suggests your holding was not long term and short term gains are taxed as ordinary income added if the state you live in has a state income tax similar considerations apply but to smaller amounts all states tax capital gains and other investment income other than interest on exempt bonds and do n't necessarily give the lower rates for long term gains and all states i have lived in have must have withholding or estimated payments rules generally similar to the federal ones though not identical

there are options on options   some derivative instruments assets are options some etfs and you are able to buy shares of those etfs or options on those etfs   secondly options are just a contract so you just need to write one up and find someone to buy the contract the only thing is that the exchange wo n't facilitate it so you will have liquidity issues what you want to do is a diagonal calendar spread buy the back month option sell the front month option this is n't a foreign concept and nobody is stopping you   since you have extra leverage on your leaps then you just need to change the balancing of your short leg to match the amount of leverage the leaps will provide so instead of buying selling 1:1 you need to buy one leap and perhaps sell 5 puts

if you think about it it 's really all one big pot of money   the idea behind an emergency fund is that you want to make sure your financial life has stability it 's not going to be suddenly driven into the red below $ 0   as long as that does n't happen you can figure out how to live your life as you want the reason we separate out an emergency fund is to simplify decision making   in theory every single purchase you make should include a consideration of how it you   every $ 100 you spend on groceries is $ 100 you wo n't be able to bring to bear if you get fired or have a major accident   in practice this would be a crippling way of thinking about things   you do n't know what emergencies can hit you nor when they will hit   that 's why they 're emergencies   if you had to think about them all the time it 'd be horrible   you would end up simply not thinking about it like most people and then the emergency hits when you do n't have enough cash to stay solvent the purpose of an emergency fund is to help make these decisions easier   if you have money set aside for emergencies that you only have to think about every now and then you can make the decisions in the rest of your financial life without too much concern for them   you do n't have to worry about that $ 100 in groceries because you are confident that if an emergency hits that $ 100 wo n't be the straw that broke the 's back because you have reserves to draw on so you should define an emergency fund in a way which is most helpful for you to remain stable and solvent without having to fret about it too much   for most people the criteria for tapping that fund is very high because the goal is to not have to think about it all that much   if you wanted to you could feel free to lump those medium predictability items into the emergency fund but it just means you have to spend more time and effort thinking about the state of the fund   every medium predictability purchase has to come with the thought process what is the state of the emergency fund could this purchase meaningfully destabilize my ability to handle emergencies   your emergency fund might yo yo under these extra purchases which could force you to think about the state of your emergency fund for normal purchases   that 'd be bad different people might want to think about things different ways   i 'm a big picture guy so i prefer to think about all of my assets as one big account when i make a lot of my decisions   my wife on the other hand prefers not to have to think that way when she makes her purchases   for her having a very discrete emergency fund has great value   for me it has less   so when i look at the finances i choose to lump the emergency funds in with say the funds to re do our backyard something we are looking at doing over the next 2 5 years   for me that is the most natural way to deal with analyzing the risks i just have to be aware of how backyard purchases interact with our safety net   my wife prefers to keep those funds separate in her head so that she can look at how to spend money on the backyard without thinking about how it affects our emergency   while complicated it shows that even within a household it 's possible to think about emergency funding two different ways   it causes minimal headaches though a fair bit of book keeping so define emergency fund however suits you and your life best   however practically speaking most people find it desirable to not put those medium predictability purchases into the same bucket as emergencies   those that do find it desirable to put them in the same bucket typically have a personal reason for why that suits their needs better

i can only share with you my happened with my wife and i. first and foremost if you think you need to protect your assets for some reason then do so be open and honest about it if we get a divorce x stays with me and y stays with you   this seems silly even when your doing it but it 's important you can speak with a lawyer about this stuff as you need to but get it in writing now i know this seems like planning for failure but if you feel that foo is important to you and you want to retain ownership of foo no mater what then you have to do this step it also works both ways you can use with some limitations this to insulate your new family unit from your personal risks for example my business is mine if we break up it stays mine the income is shared but the business is mine this creates a barrier that if someone from 10 years ago sues my business then my wife is protected from that keep in mind different countries different rules next and this is my advise give up on his and hers everything it 's just ours together you make 5400 € decide how to spend 5400 € together pick your goals together the pot is end of line it does n't matter how much from one person or how much from another unless your talking about mitigating losses from sick days or injuries or leave etc all that matters is that you make start your budgeting there   next setup an equal allowance that is money set aside for non sense reasons i like to buy video games my wife likes to buy books this is not for vacation or stuff together but just little tiny stuff you can do for your self without asking   permission the number should be small and equal maybe   finally setup a budget house stuff 200 € car stuff etc etc then it does n't matter who bought the house stuff you only have to coordinate so that you do n't both buy house stuff after some time took us around 6 months you will find out how this works and you can add on some rules for example i do n't go to best buy alone i will spend too much on house stuff my wife does n't like to make the budget so i handle that then we go over it things like that

first you need to figure out what your objectives for the money are   mostly this boils down to how soon you are going to need the money   if you are as you say very busy and you do n't need the money until retirement i 'd suggest putting your money in a single target date fund such as the blackrock fund   you figure out when you are going to retire and put your money in that fund   the fund will then pick a mix of stocks bonds and other investments adjusting the risk for your time horizon maybe your objectives are different and you want to become an trader   you value being able to say at a bbq oh i bought aapl at $ 20 or i think small caps are over valued   i 'd suggest you take your $ 50,000 and structure it so you invest $ 5,000 a year over 10 years   nothing teaches you about investing like making or losing a bit of money in the market   if you put it all in at once you risk losing it all well before you 've learned many valuable lessons which only the market can teach you i 'd suggest you study the efficient market hypothesis before studying specific markets or strategies

context assessed project as part of a tech internship in an investment bank working in small groups task to design an app using a financial solution that has an ethical impact   we came up with what i hope is the smart sounding idea of an app for impoverished farmers in developing countries who lack the information and market access that larger or farmers would have the app would use some kind of decision tree which may grow with machine learning to assess the best kind of crops to grow given the region and local conditions for max profitability and would provide access to some kind of derivatives market and insurance allowing the farmers a consistent income   struggling with the specifics of how the business finance side of things would work let 's assume the bank builds the app and puts it on the app store as part of some charitable initiative 1 would the farmers go directly to the bank to price and purchase derivatives on their crops 2 options futures forwards which is most appropriate or would it make sense to offer all three 3 is there any way this could be adjusted to provide regular payments with a lump sum at the end would this be something the bank chooses to do or is there an existing financial instrument for this kind of setup 4 how does this tie in with the commodities markets or is that what the derivatives already are 5 probably a long shot but any chance of know your customer implementations for countries with terrible infrastructure   6 probably a dumb question say the farmer sells an option on his crops would this be sold directly to the bank or a 3rd party who 'd be more interested in actually buying the crop or is this a far too simplistic view basically who would the farmer actually deliver the crops to 7 any other issues any ideas to make this sound somewhat viable   it does n't have to strictly be realistic in any sense but it also ca n't be flat out incorrect   in advance edited to make questions clearer

not really no the assumption you 're making withdrawals from a corporation are subject to ordinary income tax is simplistic income tax encompasses many taxes some more benign than others owing to credits and exemptions based on the kind of income moreover the choices you listed as benefits in the sole proprietor case the rrsp the tfsa and capital gains treatment for non registered investments all remain open to the owner of a small corporation the rrsp to the extent that the owner has received salary to create contribution room a corporation can even at some expense establish a defined benefit db pension plan and exceed individual rrsp contribution limits yes there is a more tax efficient way for small business owners to benefit when it comes time to retirement here is an outline of two things i 'm aware of if your retirement withdrawals from your canadian small business corporation would constitute withdrawal from the corporation 's retained earnings profits i.e. income to the corporation that had already been subject to corporate income tax in prior years then the corporation is able to declare such distributions as dividends and issue you a slip statement of investment income instead of a t4 slip statement of remuneration paid dividends received by canadian residents from canadian corporations benefit from the dividend tax credit dtc which substantially increases the amount of income you can receive without incurring income tax see non eligible small business dividend tax credit dtc quote for a single individual with no income other than taxable canadian    dividends which are eligible for the small business dividend tax    credit in 2014 approximately $ could be earned before    any federal taxes were payable provincial vary and so combined federal provincial maximums vary see here if you 're wondering about non eligible vs. eligible private small business corporation dividends are generally considered non eligible for the best dtc benefit but they get some benefit while a large public corporation 's dividends would generally be considered eligible eligible non eligible has to do with the corporation 's own income tax rates since canadian small businesses already get a big tax break that large companies do n't enjoy the dtc for small businesses is n't as good as the dtc for public company dividends finally even if there is hardly any same year income tax advantage in taking dividends over salary from an active small business corporation when you factor in both the income tax paid by the corporation and the individual dividends still allow a business owner to smooth his income over time which can result in a lower lifetime average tax rate so you can use your business as a retained earnings piggy bank to spin off dividends that attract less tax than ordinary income but if you can convince somebody to buy your business from you then you can benefit from the lifetime capital gains exemption of up to $ 800,000 on qualifying small business shares i.e. you can receive up to $ 800 k tax free on the sale of your small business shares this lifetime capital gains exemption is a big carrot designed i believe to incentivize canadian entrepreneurs to develop going concern businesses that have value beyond their own time in the business this means building things that would make your business worth buying e.g. a valued brand or product a customer base intellectual property etc of course there are details and conditions with all of what i described and i am not an accountant so please consult a qualified conflict free professional if you need advice specific to your situation

as an easy way to answer look at an index let 's say the s&p 500   look at the price this last october and predict where it will move in november easy right   it already happened and you have the benefit of hindsight   the move looks like such a consistent obvious continuation of the previous up and down pattern   it looks predictable like you could have guessed that   now look at today 's price and predict where it will go next month   not so easy now   the problem is every point you 're at all the time looks like a possible inflection point or turning point   if you 're following an uptrend you may think it 'll continue but you may also think that it so far up already that now it 's ready for a down where you 'll buy   so you wait and it keeps rising and you kick yourself for missing out   next time you see another uptrend and resolve to buy it regardless thinking now it 'll keep going but it turns down the second you buy it and keeps dropping   you kick yourself again   the market is amazing at doing this to you every time   in real time every wiggle in the price looks simultaneously like a trend that could continue and like a trend that has moved far enough and is ready to reverse   and more likely you 'll guess the wrong one    the only way with some little hope of succeeding is to study study study and find and learn trading rules with just over 50/50 chances like buying when a moving average is touched within an uptrend as an example and setting a stop loss at -1 and a sell limit at + 2 or something and then never ever deviate from that strategy because your only hope is in the consistency of statistics and odds over time   you 'll get many -1 losses and hopefully enough 2 gains to compensate the losses plus some profit    or to make it easier just buy in on a dip and hold and hold and collect dividends and be content to match the market without effort

a huge part of the problem is that low income people have been very heavily marketed to by the online and for profit colleges because they were eligible for financial aid mainly loans and were seen only as a straw through which to suck money out of the government by these schools because they were only interested in the money there was no attempt to qualify students in many of these schools or provide any support to them when students dropped out their counselors would keep signing them up for classes that they did n’t know about or attend    because a lot of the schools are bullshit schools with either no reputation or a poor one even those who finished were largely not able to get the high paying jobs they were promised in order to lure them in this goes for low income students especially ones whose families have no previous experience with post high school education across the board and all of this group is far more likely to default because they were basically ripped off got nothing useful from these bogus schools and were often outright defrauded and do not have the income they were told they would have when agreeing to the loans but because there is a higher percentage of minorities among this group they are more likely to be but our student loan system does n’t differentiate between loans for real and loans for these rip off schools so you are still 100 on the hook regardless even if they signed you up for several more worth of classes after you withdrew   it ’s a lot like the mortgage collapse desperate to keep making money the lenders targeted increasingly less qualified people who were also naive about the entire system and sold them terrible loans sometimes talking them out of more reasonable options and then when the whole thing starts to fail it ’s all because the government made the banks give mortgages to poor black people   the institutions suck up the money and leave bewildered poor people holding the bag now even poorer with nothing to show for the debt they will literally be digging out of forever    the obama administration finally took some steps to control the predatory for profit institutions and try to sort out who had been ripped off vs people who had genuinely received any useful education but of course the new sec of education is doing her best to roll all that back   and most of the victims are n’t teens either they are adults with kids who were trying to do something to better themselves and their lives and got screwed over some of these middle aged people will literally be having their social security garnished to pay for these loans it ’s disgusting and even more so to say it ’s all affirmative action

1 that 's a really complicated answer in short i think we need to make accounting rules much simpler i say this as an accountant in combination with financial education in k-12 school most adults in this country ca n't tell you which is a better investment something that returns 5 monthly or something that returns 10 annually they do n't know that accounting income and cash flow are different things and what they mean accounting rules are sometimes ridiculous look at the balance sheet of even a moderate size company what 's in other comprehensive income and why is that different than net income why is it that american airlines one of the largest airlines in the world does n't have a single airplane on their balance sheet   2 that might be a step in the right direction but i 'm just not sure how effective something like that would be more comprehensive might be better but then there 's going to be less people that want to take the time

no they are n't they either ca n't afford fast food burgers anymore or they are willing to pay a little extra because they are ashamed of eating at mcdonald 's   all fast food is roughly equivalent the differences are just perception and marketing   we probably all share the same concept of what taco bell and chipotle represent taco bell 's are dirty and filled with while chipotle 's are for younger people who enjoy fresh food that wo n't make you shit yourself   they both sell fake mexican food with ingredients that come from god knows where and are hastily assembled by surly teenagers   is one better than the other   that 's entirely subjective   is one more likely to make your sick   probably not both companies probably have roughly equivalent quality control procedures   does one have a better atmosphere   personally i think that can be up to confirmation bias   you see taco bell 's at gas stations and highway rest stops in poorer neighborhoods and taco bell has also been around for almost 40 years longer than chipotle so of course some of the stores are a bit more run down   americans are n't over fast food at all there is just more competition and the competition has great marketing

from wikipedia usage because ev is a capital structure neutral metric it is useful when    comparing companies with diverse capital structures price earnings    ratios for example will be significantly more volatile in companies    that are highly leveraged stock market investors use ev ebitda to compare returns between    equivalent companies on a risk adjusted basis they can then    their own choice of debt levels in practice equity    investors may have difficulty accurately assessing ev if they do not    have access to the market quotations of the company debt it is not    sufficient to substitute the book value of the debt because a the    market interest rates may have changed and b the market 's perception    of the risk of the loan may have changed since the debt was issued    remember the point of ev is to the different risks and    costs of different capital structures buyers of controlling interests in a business use ev to compare    returns between businesses as above they also use the ev valuation    or a debt free cash free valuation to determine how much to pay for    the whole entity not just the equity they may want to change the    capital structure once in control technical considerations data availability unlike market capitalization where both the market price and the    outstanding number of shares in issue are readily available and easy    to find it is virtually impossible to calculate an ev without making    a number of adjustments to published data including often subjective    estimations of value in practice ev calculations rely on reasonable estimates of the    market value of these components for example in many professional    valuations avoiding temporal when using valuation multiples such as ev ebitda and ev ebit the    numerator should correspond to the denominator the ev should    therefore correspond to the market value of the assets that were used    to generate the profits in question excluding assets acquired and    including assets disposed during a different financial reporting    period this requires ev for any mergers and acquisitions    whether paid in cash or equity significant capital investments or    significant changes in working capital occurring after or during the    reporting period being examined ideally multiples should be    calculated using the market value of the weighted average capital    employed of the company during the comparable financial period when calculating multiples over different time periods e.g. historic    multiples vs forward multiples ev should be adjusted to reflect the    weighted average invested capital of the company in each period in your question you stated the market cap is driven by the share price and the share price is    determined by buyers and sellers who have access to data on cash and    debts and factor that into their decision to buy or sell note the first point under technical considerations there and you will see that the access to data on cash and debts is n't quite accurate here so that is worth noting as for alternatives there are many other price ratios one could use such as price earnings price book value price sales and others depending on how one wants to model the company the better question is what kind of investing strategy is one wanting to use where there are probably hundreds of strategies at least let 's take apple as an example back on april 23 2014 they announced earnings through march 29 2014 which is nearly a month old when it was announced now a month later one would have to estimate what changes would be made to things there thus getting accurate real time values is n't realistic discounted cash flow is another approach one can take of valuing a company in terms of its future earnings computed back to a present day lump sum

your wife does n't need to file a 2014 tax return because she 's a nonresident and she did n't have any u.s. income her visa is irrelevant it only matters what her status was if she was in the u.s. but she was n't and if she had u.s. income your child does n't need to file a tax return because she did n't have any income there 's a certain income threshold below which she does n't have to file children generally never file their own tax returns i do n't know who told you otherwise you may have to file if you had income maybe including fellowship income and stuff like that in the u.s. during the year did you if you did n't then you probably do n't need to file a tax return also you said you 're nonresident for the year are you sure about that students are generally nonresident for the first 5 calendar years and resident thereafter so if you came in 2009 or before you would be resident for all of 2014 but if you came in 2010 or after you would be nonresident for all of 2014 if you were in the first 5 calendar years of being a student you also need to file form regardless of whether you need to file a tax return nonresidents generally ca n't claim dependents residents can however a dependent will provide you with an exemption it reduces your taxable income by a certain amount you can also get the child tax credit if your income is low enough there is a u.s sweden tax treaty it has a section covering students it may exempt some or all of your income from u.s. tax most universities provide free international tax programs for their international students and scholars you should look to see if your school offers this do n't go to outside tax filing places because those generally do n't know anything about how to file for nonresidents

from the bank 's perspective they are offering a service and within their rights to charge appropriately for that service depending on the size of their operation they may have considerable overhead costs that they need to recoup one way or another to continue operating profitably they hope traditionally banks would encourage you to save with them by offering interest growth on your deposits meanwhile they would invest your and all of their customer 's funds in securities or loans to other patrons that they anticipate will generate income for them at a faster rate than the interest they pay back to you these days however this overly simplified model is relatively insignificant in consumer banking instead they 've found they can make a lot more profit by simply charging fees for the handling of your funds and when they want to loan money to consumers they just borrow from a central bank what this means is that the size of your balance unless abnormally huge is of little interest to a branch manager it does n't generate revenue for them much faster than a tiny balance with the same number of transactions would to put it simply they can live without you and your threatening to leave even if you follow through is barely going to do anything to their bottom line they will let you if you do have an abnormally huge balance and it 's all in a simple checking or savings account then it might make them pause for thought but if that 's true then frankly you 're doing banking wrong and should move those funds somewhere where they can work harder for you in terms of growth they might even suggest so themselves and direct you to one of their own personal wealth managers

credit cards have three important advantages none of them are for day to day borrowing of money safety credit cards have better fraud protection than checks or cash and better than most debit check cards if you buy something with a credit card you also get the issuer 's think visa assurances that your will get the product you paid for or your money back at almost any time if a product you buy is not what you expect you can work with the issuer even if the store says screw you security credit cards are almost universally accepted as a security against damages to the vendor hotels car rentals boat rentals etc will accept a credit card as a means of securing their interests without that you may have to make huge deposits or not be able to rent at all for example in my area you can not rent a car on debit or cash you must use a credit card around here most hotel rooms require a credit card as well this is different from area to area but credit cards are nearly universally accepted emergencies if you 're using your credit card properly then you have some extra padding when stuff goes wrong for example it may be cheaper to place a bill on a credit card for a couple months while you recover from a car accident than to deplete your bank account and have to pay fees bonus some cards have perks like miles points or cash back some can be very beneficial you need to be careful about the rules with these bonuses for example some cards only give you points if you carry a balance some only give miles if you shop at certain stores but if you have a good one these can be pretty fantastic a 3 cash back on purchases can make a large difference over time

there are two main ways of transferring large sums of money between banks in such a situation 1 have your bank mail a cashier 's check   they may or may not charge you for this some banks charge up to $ 6 the bank i work at does n't charge at all   you have to wait for the check to go through the mail but it usually takes just a few days 2 wire the money   this could cost $ 50 or more in combined fees usually around $ 30 to send and $ 20 to receive but you get same day credit for the funds the limits to online transfers are in place to protect you so that if someone gets into your account the amount of damage they can do is limited   if you need those limits lifted temporarily check with your bank about doing so they may be willing to adjust them for you for a brief period a day or two

you own a fractional share of the company maybe you should care enough to at least read the proxy statements which explain the pro and con position for each of the issues you are voting on that does n't seem like too much to ask on the other hand if you are saying that the people who get paid to be knowledgeable about that stuff should just go make the decisions without troubling you with the details then choose the option to go with their recommendations which are always clearly indicated on the voting form however if you do this it might make sense to at least do some investigation of who you are voting onto that board i guess as said you could just abstain but i 'm not sure how that is any different than just trashing the form as for the idea that proxy votes are tainted somehow the one missing piece of that conspiracy is what those people have to gain are you implying that your broker who has an interest in you making money off your investments and liking them would fraudulently cast proxy votes for you in a way that would harm the company and your return why exactly would they do this i find your stance on the whole thing a bit confusing though you seem to have some strong opinions on corporate governance but at the same time are n't willing to invest any effort in the one place you have any control over the situation i 'm just update per the following information from the sec website it looks like the meaning of a proxy vote can vary depending on the mechanics of the specific issue you are voting on my emphasis added what do for against withhold mean on the proxy card or voter instruction form    depending on what you are voting on    the proxy card or voting instruction    form gives you a choice of voting    for against or abstain or    for or withhold here is an    explanation of the differences election of directors generally    company bylaws or other corporate    documents establish how directors are    elected there are two main types of    ways to elect directors    vote and majority vote a vote means that the    winning candidate only needs to get    more votes than a competing candidate    if a director runs he or    she only needs one vote to be elected    so an against vote is meaningless    because of this shareholders have the    option to express with    a candidate by indicating that they    wish to withhold authority to vote    their shares in favor of the    candidate a substantial number of    withhold votes will not prevent a    candidate from getting elected but it    can sometimes influence future    decisions by the board of directors    concerning director nominees a majority vote means that directors    are elected only if they receive a    majority of the shares voting or    present at the meeting in this case    you have the choice of voting for    each nominee against each nominee    or you can abstain from voting your    shares an abstain vote may or may    not affect a director 's election each    company must disclose how abstain or    withhold votes affect an election in    its proxy statement this information    is often found toward the beginning of    the proxy statement under a heading    such as votes required to adopt a    proposal or how your votes are    counted proposals other than an election of    directors matters other than voting    on the election of directors like    voting on shareholder proposals are    typically approved by a vote of a    majority of the shares voting or    present at the meeting in this    situation you are usually given the    choice to vote your shares for or    against a proposal or to abstain    from voting on it again the effect    of an abstain vote may depend on the    specific voting rule that applies the    company 's proxy statement should again    disclose the effect of an abstain    vote

note that these used to be a single common share that has split actually a special dividend but effectively a split if you owned one share of google before the split you had one share giving you x worth of equity in the company and 1 vote after the split you have two shares giving you the same x worth of equity and 1 vote in other words zero change buy or sell either depending on how much you value the vote and how much you think others will pay or not for that vote in the future   as google issues new shares it 'll likely issue more of the new non voting shares meaning dilution of equity but not dilution of voting power for most of us our few votes count for nothing so evaluate this as you will   google 's founders believe they can do a better job running the company long term when there are fewer pressures from outside holders who may have only short term interests in mind if you disagree or if you are only interested in the short term you probably should n't be an owner of google as always evaluate the facts for yourself your situation and your beliefs

that is absolute rubbish   warren buffet follows simple value and tenants that literally anyone could follow if they had the discipline to do so   i have never once heard of an investment made by warren buffet that was n't rooted in fundamentals and easy to understand   the concept is fairly simple as is the math buying great companies trading at discounts to what they are worth due to market fluctuations or to key sectors etc   if i buy abc corp at $ 10 knowing it is worth $ 20 it could go down or trade sideways for five years doing seemingly nothing and then one day catch up with its worth due to any number of factors   in that case my 100 return which took five years to accounts for an average 20 return per year   also and this should be obvious but diversification is a double edged sword   every year hundreds of stocks individually beat the market return   owning any one of these stocks as your only holding would mean that you beat the market   as you buy more stocks and diversify your return will get closer and closer to that of an index or mutual fund   my advice is to stick to fundamentals like value and investing learn to separate when the market is being silly from when it is responding to a genuine concern do your own homework and analysis on the stocks you buy be patient after buying stock that your analysis gives you confidence in and do n't over diversify   if you do these things congrats   you are warren buffet

a stock dividend converts some of the reserves and surplus on the company 's balance sheet into paid up capital and securities premium account without involving any actual cash outflow to the shareholders while cash dividends are by the investors due to their cash yield issuance of stock dividends are indicators of growing confidence of the management and the shareholders in the company   the fact that shareholders want to convert free cash sitting on the balance sheet which can ideally be taken out as dividends into blocked money in exchange for shares is symbolic to their confidence in the company this in turn is expected to lead to an increase in market price of the stock

just looking at your question i can tell it 's not worth it financially even if you did n't borrow the money to do it at your current rate you 'll be making in 5 years which is roughly a growth of 2.5 per year   if you go for the masters in 5 years you 'll be making with roughly the same growth rate 2.5 so it 's costing you $ 70,000 the cost of school plus the 2 years of reduced income to raise your salary by $ 1,300   the payback period would be about 25 years   it would be much worse if you borrowed the money to do it not a chance

if your annual income is less than $ or so and you expect this to change for the better in the future it 's not worthwhile to put that in an rrsp save your contribution room for the future years where you will gain more of a tax deduction   there 's no real downside in investing in a tfsa what you withdraw this year can be put back in next year so any surplus funds that you do not anticipate needing this year can be put in a tfsa to earn a bit more than the equivalent investment outside of a shelter

for every buyer there is a seller that rule refers to actual historical trades it does n't apply to suppose there are buyers for 2,000 shares and sellers for only 1,000 at a given price p. some of those buyers will raise their bid the indication of the price they are willing to pay above p so that the sellers of the 1000 shares will fill their orders first   sold to the highest bidder the ones that do n't do this will probably not get their orders filled suppose there are more sellers than buyers then some sellers will lower their offer price to attract buyers and some sellers probably wo n't at a low enough price there will likely be a match between the total number of shares on sale and shares on purchase orders

the average person does n't care nor are they affected by how much their employer spends in healthcare it may be true that the average person does n't care how much their employer spends on healthcare but it 's not true that we are n't affected   from an employer 's perspective healthcare wages and all other benefits are part of the cost of having an employee   when healthcare goes up it increases the total employee cost    employers can handle this in several ways   they could reduce the amount they give investors as dividends stock buybacks etc   but then the stock is worth less and they have to make up the money somewhere else   they could pass the expense on to customers   but then the loss in business can easily cost more than the revenue raised   they can cut wages or other benefits   then the average person will start caring and might get a different job    i found this article saying that 12 m households spend > = 50 of income on rent so i 'm assuming that an even greater number spend more than the recommended 30 which means rent should be weighted as high as it is in cpi according to the census that 's only about 10 of households   it also notes that of households are owner occupied   they do n't pay rent   the cpi makes up a number called owner 's equivalent rent for those households to get to the higher percentage    the cpi is intended for things like wages   this makes it a good choice for a cost of living adjustment but it does n't quite represent the overall economy   and for investments it 's the broader economy that matters   household consumption is less important    what the fed says

this answer is about the usa each time you sell a security a stock or a bond or some other asset you are expected to pay tax on the net gain it does n't matter whether you use a broker or mutual fund to make the sale you still owe the tax net capital gain is defined this way gross sale prices less broker fees for selling + cost of buying the asset the cost of buying the asset is called the basis price   you or your broker needs to keep track of the basis price for each share this is easy when you 're just getting started investing it stays easy if you 're careful about your record keeping   you owe the capital gains tax whenever you sell an asset whether or not you reinvest the proceeds in something else if your capital gains are modest you can pay all the taxes at the end of the year if they are larger for example if they exceed your wage earnings you should pay quarterly estimated tax the tax authorities ding you for a penalty if you wait to pay or six figure tax bills without paying quarterly estimates   you pay net capital gains tax if one asset loses money and another makes money you pay on your gains minus your losses if you have more losses than gains in a particular year you can carry forward up to $ 3,000 i think you ca n't carry forward tens of thousands in capital losses   long term and short term gains are treated separately irs schedule b has places to plug in all those numbers and the tax programs turbo etc do too dividend payments are also taxable when they are paid those are n't capital gains they go on schedule d along with interest payments the same is true for a mutual fund if the fund has ford shares in it and ford pays $ per share in march that 's a dividend payment if the fund managers decide to sell ford and buy tesla in june   the selling of ford shares will be a cap gains taxable event for you   the good news the mutual fund managers send you a statement sometime in february or march of each year telling what you should put on your tax forms   this is great they add it all up for you they give you a nice consolidated tax statement covering everything dividends their buying and selling activity on your behalf and any selling they did when you withdrew money from the fund for any purpose    some investment accounts like 401(k accounts are tax free you do n't pay any tax on those accounts capital gains dividends interest until you withdraw the money to live on after you retire then that money is taxed as if it were wage income if you want an easy and fairly reliable way to invest and do n't want to do a lot of tax form scrambling choose a couple of different mutual funds put money into them and leave it there they 'll send you consolidated tax statements once a year download them into your tax program and you 're done you mentioned riding out bad times in cash   no no not a good idea that investment strategy almost guarantees you will sell when the market is going down and buy when it 's going up that 's sell low buy high it 's a loser not even warren buffett can call the top of the market and the bottom   ned johnson fidelity 's founder definitely ca n't

wow i love some of these answers remember why you are investing in the first place   for me i like dividend stocks and dividend capturing here is why with over 3500 dividend stock companies paying out dividends this year that means i can get a dividend check almost every day what about if the stock goes down you ask well out of these 3500 companies there is a small group of these stocks that have consistently increased their dividend payout to their investors for over 25 years and a smaller group that have been increasing every year their pay outs for over 50 years yes kennedy was in office back then and to this day they consistently pay higher and higher dividend payments to their investors every year for 50 years   as for the dividend capturing strategy that allows me to collect up 10 20 checks per month with that little effort as for the stock going down here is a little that most buyers overlook stock price is more or less the public 's perception of the value of a certain company earnings balance sheet cash flow market cap and a few other things in the quarterly report will give you a better answer to the value of a company if stock price goes down while earning and market go keep going up what does that tell you

i will attempt to answer three separate questions here the standard answer is that an emergency fund should not be in an investment that can lose value   the safest course of action is to put it in a savings account or other very low risk investment somewhere this question becomes can a reasonable and low risk investment in sweden be comparable to or better than a low risk investment in brazil inflation in brazil has averaged a little less than 6 over the last 10 years with a recent spike up above 8   a cursory search indicates interest rates on savings accounts in brazil are outpacing inflation so you might still expect a positive return on money in a savings account there by contrast sweden 's inflation rate has been around 1 over the last 10 years and has around 0 or even deflation in recent years   swedish interest rates for savings accounts right now are very low nearly 0   putting money in a savings account in sweden would likely hold its value or lose a slight amount of value based on this you might be better off leaving your emergency fund invested in in brazil the answer to this a little unclear   the brazilian stock market has been all over the place in the last 10 years with a slight trend in recent years   in comparison sweden 's stock market has shown fairly consistent growth in spite of the big dip in 2008   given this it seems like the fairest comparison would your current 13 roi investment in brazil vs. a fund or etf that tracks the swedish stock market index if we assume a consistent 13 roi on your investment in brazil and a consistent inflation rate of 6 your adjusted roi there would be around 7 per year the etf that tracks the swedish 30 index has a 10 year annualized return of   if you subtract 0.8 inflation you get an adjusted roi 9 based on this sweden may be a safer place for longer term moderate risk investments right now

i 'm a series 24 securities principle and have explained and trained people on questions like these more times than i can count although my first recommendation is to speak to a qualified tax professional for the appropriate answer for each individual scenario   disclosure aside the source of truth for these questions is always the irs publications in this case it 's irs pub 590b when must you withdraw assets required minimum distributions   ira stands for individual retirement arrangement basically it 's an arrangement between you a the government to encourage retirement savings tax to a define taxable income amount agree to receive a deduction during your working years lowering your taxable income in the present your taxable income should drop in retirement because you 're not working anymore and any withdraws would most likely be taxed at a lower rate to be clear the require minimum distribution is based on a life expectancy factor and the ending balance of your pre tax retirement accounts from the prior ex 2016 ending balance for a 2017 rmd the rmd works out to be somewhere around 3 4 of your total balance   most retirement account not all have established several conveniences to automate the withdraw process i 've believe that moving funds directly to bank deposits or moving the funds to another taxable investment account are most common   retirement account providers are required by law to give you notifications about rmds some big firms allow you to setup an auto distribution a year before you turn 70.5 to start when they need to because of the 50 penalty you 're given so many notifications about an rmd that it 's hard to forget about it

because large stores do not pay their cashiers enough that the companies can dock the employees pay if they allow a bad credit card to go through   so most cashiers at large stores wo n't take the extra effort to check the card properly   as a result large stores come up with other ways to handle potential credit card fraud   for example they calculate a certain amount of fraud as expected and include it in their price calculations   or they can use cameras to catch fraudsters    at small stores there is a much higher chance that the cashier is either the owner or a relative of the owner   and even those who are unrelated tend to be hired by the owner directly   the owners do have their pay if a bad credit card is accepted as their pay is the profit from the business   so they tend to create protocols that at least in their mind reduce the chance of taking a bad credit card   the cashier is often the only employee in the store to check anything    another issue is that small stores have a harder time getting approved to accept credit cards   the companies that process the credit cards can take back their machine if there is a lot of fraud   so the companies can require more from small stores than they can from big stores   those companies ca n't stop processing cards for safeway because they need safeway as much if not more than safeway needs them   so the processors have more leverage to make small stores do what they want   and small stores can feasibly fire non owner cashiers who do not comply    owners of course ca n't be fired   but they are far more vulnerable to business losses   so it is really important to an owner to keep the credit card machine   and it is pretty important to avoid losses as it is their money directly    relatives of owners may be safe from firing but they are not safe from family retaliation like taking away television privileges   and they may also think of the effect of business losses on the family    large stores can fire cashiers but they are chronically understaffed and almost none of their cashiers will consistently follow a strict protocol   since fraudsters only need to succeed once an inconsistent application is almost as bad as no application   they might charge the cashiers for fraud but then they would have to pay the cashiers more than minimum wage specifically for that reason e.g. a $ 50 a month bonus for no fraud   for many of them it 's cheaper to risk the fraud    and large stores ca n't mix owners and relatives of owners into the mix   it 's hard to say who owns safeway   and even if you could the relationship between one fraud transaction and the dividend paid on one share of stock is tiny   it would take thousands of shares to get up to a penny

this would depend on what transfer methods your forex broker allows most will allow you to have a check or wire transfer sent best thing would be to call email your broker and ask how to get the money into your account keep in mind many brokers will force you to withdraw using the same funding method you used to deposit up to the amount of the deposit for example if i fund my forex account with $ 500 on a credit card and make $ 500 profit i now have $ 1,000 sitting in my forex account the broker will force me to withdraw $ 500 as a credit to my credit card before allowing me to use another withdrawal method this is an anti money laundering precaution

when you start at a new job here in the u.s. the default means of payment is usually a paper check most folks will quickly set up direct deposit so that their employer deposits their paycheck directly into their personal bank account the incentive to do so is that you receive your funds faster than if you deposit a paper check   even if you set up direct deposit on your first day on the job you may still receive your first paycheck as a paper check simply because the wheels of payroll processing turn slowly at some large companies a counter example is a self employed contractor perhaps a carpenter or house painter   these folks are paid by their customers homeowners and such   many larger well established now accept credit card payments from customers but smaller may be reluctant to set up a credit card merchant account to accept payment by card because of all the fees that are associated with accepting credit card payments   3 transaction fees and monthly service fees can be scary to any businessman who already has very thin profit margins   in such cases these contractors prefer to be paid by check or in cash for the simple reason that there are no fees deducted from cash payments there are a few folks here who do n't trust direct deposit or more specifically do n't trust their employer to perform the deposit correctly and on time   some feel uncomfortable giving their bank info to their employer fearing someone at the company could steal money from their account in my experience the folks who prefer a paper paycheck are often the same folks who rush to the bank on payday to redeem their paychecks for cash   they may have a bank account helps with check cashing but they prefer to carry cash i operate in a manner similar to you i use a debit card or credit card i only have one of each for nearly all transactions in daily life i use electronic payments through my bank to pay my regular bills and mortgage and i receive my paycheck by direct deposit   there have been periods where i have n't written or received paper checks for so long that i have to hunt for where i put my checkbook even though i use a debit card for most store purchases the bank account behind that debit card is actually a checking account according to the bank   again the system defaults to paper checks and you have the option of going electronic as well before we judge anyone who does n't use direct deposit or who prefers to be paid in cold hard cash consider that direct deposit is a luxury of stability steady job home etc   direct deposit does n't make sense for a contractor or day laborer who expect to work for a different person each day or week i do n't think this is all that unique to the us   there are people in every city and country who do n't have long term employment with a single employer and therefore prefer cash or paper check over electronic payments    i 'd be willing to bet that this applies to the majority of people on the planet actually

you should seriously just stop talking the term legacy employees refers to legacy cost structures costs that from a time when the competitive environment was different than it is today are referred to as legacy costs it is not derogatory    take airlines for example airlines used to have incredible legacy costs from unionized employees incurred at a time when the airline industry was regulated regulation kept new airlines from starting up so airlines could very easily afford to pay for pensions huge benefits massive salaries etc the few airlines in existence then had control over the industry   then the airlines were deregulated and anyone could start one up suddenly the airlines that could afford massive pensions in the days where they effectively controlled pricing could no longer afford these pensions and benefits when competitors did not offer the same benefits to their employees hence every single legacy airline went bankrupt over the next few decades

this is a good question and you seemed troubled by this and this person 's choices in life   and that is the rub they are choices   they know how to make them they know the consequences and they know how to work around them   its a skill you probably do n't have and do n't want to have    in the end they will survive   if you go to a fast food store in a popular retirement location you will see plenty of elderly people working   they might live in low income housing receive some financial assistance and utilize other charities such a food banks   they might depend on family and friends   there is also the ugly it is not a fairy tale that some supplement their diets with pet food    there is of course social security   the amount is very low for most workers but the amount is almost inconsequential   they would spend it all anyway and still be short despite the predictability of the income and a time frame with   predictable expenses   budgeting is a skill so i have a friend that deals with this himself and is helping an relation   he and his wife provide some help but when it started there was a endless stream of requests   his policy now is   no more help unless he works out a budget with the person requesting help i 've used his ideas myself and by using this it becomes clear on who is in actual need and who is just looking for the next handout   you can feel good about yourself for helping an actual needy person or say no

when the 2016 models come out the dealership marks down the 2015 model and then it sells pretty fast   the process does n't take that long in the car market because the 2015 models are just as good as the 2016 so if they are just a little cheaper they will sell quickly   if you want a 2008 audi that has never sold you are going to be looking for a long time the same thing happens in every industry   where are the older versions of digital cameras   cell phones     digital   any item that changes from year to year sits on shelves for a little while after its replacement comes out until the retailer reduces its price by enough and it sells   the only exceptions are goods that depreciate very quickly or go bad which are recycled or thrown away like fresh produce for example it seems kind of crazy at first that essentially all goods that are produced by the economy are consumed but that 's the magic of capitalism prices make markets clear

none taken good thoughts it would be making the same mistake to blindly accept my criticism as many will make blindly accepting this journalist 's graphs let 's see if i can address your concerns   the reason the scale is problematic to me is exactly what you said   gt i hope people would be looking at more than just a line   and i do n't think that they do the scales were adjusted so that the lines were nearly identical on someone 's computer screen but that implies a false equivalency between the debts of households corporations state and local gov and the fed i think the author has left leaning read the accompanied article that outlines who you will vote for link on the last slide not necessarily a bad thing but he frames all of this from the idea that his statistics can not be skewed and he is therefore presenting central to the left 's argument is that the federal government 's size is not of the biggest concern and if you got the average american thinking that 15 trillion is no big deal because households have a huge debt too or corporations do too or states do too i believe that to be dangerous i think i identified his bias and that his graphs are slightly manipulated to coerce less individuals to his side happens all the time but all of those facts are dead on in regards to the data again trying to keep my politics out of this simply criticizing the graphs and the subtle message they are sending under the guise of being neutral   i would agree with your point normally since contractors are temporary and often as you pointed out cost efficient from a benefits standpoint they also tend to be more efficient but this is not central to our point the problem is that the government has the longest war in our history going but we are n't really fighting anyone for the scale of our spending trillions of dollars have gone into this effort and one of the results has been the development of a quasi economy in iraq and now the numbers are staggering of how many of these people are employed or make a living off of this war effort but this is not like most contractors where you would add them to the dod 's budget as you pointed out and the difference i would is the permanent status of the employment after what length of time would you say a contractor for the dod working on computer programs in the pentagon is the equivalent of an employee and therefore must be counted in statistics such as the one the graph in question purports to 2 years 5 years certainly after a decade right remember the graph is trying to show that the number of government employees is not a problem or at least not a significant but calling an apple a banana does n't make it yellow i think political slight in hand with statistics as important as these should be criminal   sorry i got long winded but i hope i addressed your concerns it sounds like you are one of the few people who thinks critically when presented with data such as that which is in these 64 slides but remember for every one of you there may be a thousand people who are brainwashed by any data you put in front of them

question 2 some financial institutions can provide a way to invest small amounts with low or no cost fees over a period of time like monthly weekly etc   for instance a few brokerages have a way to buy specific etfs for no cost outside of the total expense ratio question 3 when someone says that investing is like buying a lottery ticket they are comparing an event that almost always has at least a 99.9 of no return large winnings to an event that has much better odds   even if i randomly pick a stock in the s&p 500 and solely invest in it over the course of a given year i do not face a 99.9 chance of losing everything so comparing the stock market to a lottery unless a specific lottery has much better odds keep in mind that some of these jackpots have a of no return is not the same   unfortunately nothing truly safe exists risk may but it 's always present instead the probability of something being safe and or generating a return may be true for a given period of time while in another given period of time may become untrue one may argue that holding cash is safer than buying an index fund or stock etf mutual fund etc and financially that may be true over a given period of time for instance the usd beat the spy for the year of 2008   benjamin franklin per a biography i 'm reading argued that the stock market was superior to gold from the context it sounds like the cash of his day because of what the stock market represents essentially you 're betting on the economic output of workers   it 's like saying in an example using oil that i believe that even though oil becomes a rare resource in the long run human workers will find an alternative to oil and will lead to better living standards for all of us do like the roman and empires collapse   yes and would holding the market in those days fail   yes   but cash and gold might be useless too because we would still need someone to exchange goods with and we would need to have the correct resources to do so if everyone in a city owns gold gold has little value   the only safe bet in those days would be farming skill land crops and or livestock because even without trading one could still provide some basic necessities

having dealt with with social security state agencies and banks more than i 'd care to i would urge you to do the following 1 get a 100 clear answer on whether or not you are listed as joint or authorized user signer for an account this will probably require a call to the bank but for less than an hour of you and your friend 's time you will save yourself a whole lot of hassle the difference is like this if you worked at a business that added you as an authorized user for a credit or debit card this would allow you to use the card to buy things but that does n't make the money in the bank yours on the other hand if you are listed as joint this regards ownership and it could become tricky to establish whether its your money or not to any governmental satisfaction 2 you are completely correct in being honest with the agency but that 's not enough if you do n't know what the facts are you ca n't really be honest with them if the form is unclear it 's ok to ask on having a bank account does being listed as an authorized user on someone else 's account count if it is n't my money or bank account but if you are listed as holding the account jointly that changes the question to i am listed as joint on someone else 's checking account but it is n't my money how is that considered to social security it might mean generating an extra form or it might mean you need to have the status on the account changed or they might not care but if you do n't get the facts first they wo n't give you the right answers or help you need and from personal experience it 's a heck of a lot easier to get a straight and clear answer from a bank than it is from a federal government agency have the facts with you when you contact them and you 'll be ok but trust me you do n't want them guessing

a firm is a separate legal person from its shareholders or owners but does n't get invited to parties much owners invest capital to get shares in the firm or may get shares for investing time effort etc but those shares are on a limited liability basis that means that shareholders are only liable up to the value of their shares and that the firm itself is responsible for any expenses or liabilities the firm will have working capital from its initial investors i.e. any capital invested to get shares and can borrow money on the bond market or issue new shares to cover outgoings share ownership simply entitles the owner to a proportion of the residual equity of the company and voting rights for non equity in a firm that i previously worked for for example one of the partners owned 51 of the firm but put up 100 of the firm 's equity capital the other partner owned 49 and provided 90 of the intellectual capital of the firm they both took decisions equally the distribution of ownership should therefore have no bearing on who finances deals the owners or managers in larger firms should decide together how to use the company 's capital for spending because it is exactly that the company 's capital not any one of the investor 's limited liability of owners is one of the major benefits of forming a company

the answer from littleadv perfectly explains that the mere exchange ratio does n't say anything still it might be worth adding why some currencies are weak and some strong here 's the reason to buy goods of a certain country you have to exchange your money for currency of that country especially when you want to buy treasuries of stocks from that country so if you feel that for example japanese stocks are going to pick up soon you will exchange dollars for yen so you can buy japanese stocks by the laws of supply and demand this drives up the price in contrast if investors lose faith in a country and withdraw their funds they will seek their luck elsewhere and thus they increase the supply of that currency this happened most dramatically in recent time with the icelandic

generally a share of stock entitles the owner to all future per share dividends paid by the company plus a fraction of the company 's assets net value in the event of liquidation   if one knew in advance the time and value of all such payouts the value of the stock should equal the present cash value of that payout stream which would in turn be the sum of the cash values of all the individual payouts as time goes by the present cash value of each upcoming payout will increase until such time as it is actually paid it will cease to contribute to the stock 's value because people are not they generally do n't know exactly what future payouts a stock is going to make   a sane price for a stock however may be assigned by estimating the present cash value of its future payments   if unfolding events would cause a reasonable person to revise estimates of future payments upward the price of the stock should increase   if events cause estimates to be revised downward the price should fall in a sane marketplace if the price of a stock is below people 's estimates of its payouts current cash value people should buy the stock and push the price upward   if it is above people 's estimates they should sell the stock and push the price downward   note that in a sane marketplace rising prices are a red flag indicator for people to stop buying   unfortunately sometimes bulls see a red flag as a signal to charge ahead   when that happens prices may soar through the roof but it 's important to note that the value of the stock will still be the present cash value of its future payouts   if that value is $ 10/share someone who buys a share for $ 50 basically gives the seller $ 40 that he was not entitled to and which the buyer will never get back   the buyer might manage to convince someone else to pay him $ 60 for the share but that simply means the new buyer is giving the the previous one $ 50 that he was n't entitled to either   if the price falls back to $ 10 calling that fall a market correction would n't be a but rather state a fact the share was worth $ 10 before people sold it for crazy prices and still worth $ 10 afterward   it was the market price that was in error the important thing to focus on as a sane investor is what the stock is actually going to pay out in relation to what you put in   it 's not necessary to look only at present price earnings ratios since some stocks may pay little or nothing today but pay handsomely next year   what 's important however is that there be a reasonable likelihood that in the foreseeable future the stock will pay dividends sufficient to justify its cost

first the good news based on the time involved and the amount of potential profits you will not owe any tax on the sale of the house no matter which option you pick now the details when determining if there are any capital gains the irs cares about the difference between the sale price and the purchase price the amount of the loan the final balance of the loan or the lack of loan do n't factor into the calculation to complicate matters the government does factor into the equation any improvements you have made to the house like a new deck and the cost of buying and selling the house real estate agents if a single person has less than 250 k in capital gains and has used the house as their main residence for 2 of the the previous 5 years their tax is zero for a couple the tax free gain is $ 500k. for your situation since the sale price is less than $ 250 k the capital gains will also be less than $ 250k. you do have one potential area of concern if the house is worth significantly more than $ 150 k the government could claim that the difference between what you charged your parents and what you could have charged was a gift assuming that there are no other factors that you did n't include in the original question it would appear that you will not face any taxes regarding your two options neither will impact the taxes though draining your savings or investments could make it difficult to meet an emergency during the time between the sending of the $ 95 k to the mortgage company and the closing on the deal with your parents if the money came from retirement account it could have an even greater impact on your taxes and retirement situation

well this relates to how you interpret something 's value we can use that magazine and restaurant as an example for you the extra $ more on a decent meal or wine is worth it while $ 5 for a magazine entertainment on a train ride might not be this is how all markets work people make decisions about how they value something and hence choose to spend or not if you 're asking should i value certain things the way i do well that 's a different story   e.g. should i keep that picture frame for years in the attic to sell it for $ 3 on ebay later probably not worth it but again you are making that decision based on how you choose to value it so to answer your question how can i possibly care about this when my stock portfolio is losing or gaining $ 1000 a day and is it normal yes it is normal and we all care everyone makes these decisions throughout each day people will vary as to what they value something to be but all in all everyone does just what you explained here is something that you may find interesting it is about how we value money what color is your money if the pdf does n't work for you then try this link what color is your money alt link

there are a few main economic reasons given why investors show a strong home bias interestingly though if you ask investors about the future of their home country compared with other countries they will generally though not always significantly overestimate the future of their own country   it is difficult to definitively say what drives investors but this psychological home bias could be one of the larger factors edit in response to the bounty maybe this vanguard article on their recommended international exposure is what you are looking for though they only briefly speculate about why people so consistently show a home bias in investing   the wikipedia article mentioned above has some very good references and while there may be no complete answer with the certainty that you seek as there are as many reasons as there are investors a combination of the above list seems to capture much of what is going on across different countries

i have this exact same issue   event the dollar amounts are close   here is how i am looking at the problem option 1   walk away   goodbye credit for 7 + years   luckily i can operate in cash with the extra $ 800 per month but should i have a non medical emergency i might be sol   with a family i am not sure i am willing to risk it   what if my car dies the month after i quit paying and the bank chooses to foreclose   what if my wife or i lose our job and we have no credit to live option 2   short sale   good if i can let it happen   i might or might not be on the hook for the balance depending on the state   if i am on the hook okay suck but i could live   if i am not on the hook it is going to hurt my credit the same as foreclosure   it is n't easy you need an experienced real estate agent and a willing bank    option 3   keep paying   i am going for this   at the moment i can still afford the house even though it is at the expense of some luxuries in my live   cable tv driving to work a new computer   i am the market fixes itself in the next several years   should the s hit the fan in most any manner the mortgage is the first thing i stop paying i do n't know what other options i have   i ca n't re fi too upside down   i ca n't sell the house is n't worth the mortgage and i do n't have the cash for the balance   i ca n't walk away the credit hit would n't be worth the monthly money gain i have no emotions about the house   i am in a real bad investment and getting out now seems like a good idea but i am going to guess that having the house 10 years from now is better than not   i do n't care about the bank at all nor do i feel i owe them the money because i took the loan   they assumed risk loaning me the money in the first place   the minute it gets worse for me than for the bank i will stop paying summary not much to do without a serious consequence   i would suggest holding out for the very long term if you feel you can   the best way to minimize the bad investment is to ride it out and pray it gets better   i am thinking i am a landlord for the next 10 years

i considered the prepaid legal but instead tried the legalzoom business legal plan and found it to be very good it does n't have any membership or new account fees you pay each month for the month and if you prepay for half a year or a year they throw in a nice discount 15 so far i 'm subscribed for less than a month and had 2 attorney consultations and a document review although they did n't tell me anything i did n't know already seems to be very cost effective considering most people do n't have sufficient legal knowledge or the ability to research it is as @duffbeer703 mentioned not an insurance and if a legal matter arises that requires representation their plan has almost no coverage only discounts as opposed to prepaid legal plan that on the paper does have some representation but to have 2 3 attorney consultations for $ 30 is definitely a bargain

so your accountant certainly knows much more than i do about israeli tax law and its interactions with us tax law which is zero   i 'm going to look at this problem from the investment perspective which i hope to convince you is the most important place to start then you can adjust for interactions between the and us tax codes even if the tax breaks are exceptional it would be hard to recommend buying real estate as an investment in the 7 10 year time frame   especially if this real estate is in the us   open closing fees mortgage fees risk of property devaluation bad renters acts of god insurance costs and tax complications make short to medium term investments in real estate a particularly risky way to invest   buying a local apartment and renting is somewhat more reasonable as you do n't have to worry about the currency conversion and you can do a lot more research in your local environment and keep a closer eye on the property it is   still this a pretty concentrated risk saving and investing using tax advantaged accounts is generally considered a great way to build toward a down payment in the medium term   a mixture of mostly local bonds with some local and foreign stocks and more and more cash as it gets close to purchase time is generally what is recommended when saving for a home   this mixture is relatively safe and will tend to grow steadily without the concentrated risk of a real estate investment   pfic rules are complicated and certainly worth taking some time to understand but owning real estate especially in a foreign country seems much more complicated and certainly riskier there may be some rule that makes investing in reits much better than normal stocks in these particular accounts though i would be surprised if that were the case   it is generally not true for people under just he us tax code so while option 1 may not be the absolute best from a tax perspective it would certainly be my guess as the most likely to succeed

look at a broader diversification something like for physical gold i 'd look at a mix of gold coins and bullion study the pricing model for coins you 'll probably find that the spreads on small coins make them too expensive there are a few levels of risk with storing in a vault the practical risk is that your government will close banks in the event of a panic and your money will be inaccessible you need to balance that risk with the risk to your personal security that comes with having lots of gold or cash in your home my recommendation is to avoid wasting time on the mad max scenarios if the world economy collapses into utter ruin we 're all screwed a few gold coins wo n't do much for you

i do n't know how much finance you know but a fundamental idea is that something 's value is the present value of all its future cash flows basically what those cash flows are worth today so if we can predict the cash flows the equity holders will get in the future not easy and determine at what rate to discount the cash flows not easy we can value the equity    so a company will have cash flows coming in but not all go to the equity holders some will go to debt holders if any interest payments some will go to preferred equity holders dividends if any what 's left over is what the equity holders will get if there 's no debt preferred equity or other things like that then the equity holders get all the cash flows   this does n't mean the equity holders literally receive the cash they 'll get whatever is given out via dividends but they own the cash and it may be reinvested in the business to generate more cash in the future

never carry a balance on a credit card there is almost always a cheaper way to borrow money the exception to that rule is when you are offered a 0 promotion on a credit card but even then watch out for cash advance fees and how payments are applied typically to promotional balances first paying interest on daily spending is a bad idea generally the only time you should pay interest is on a home loan car loan or education loan   basically that 's because those loans can either allow you to reduce an expense e.g. apartment rent taxi fair or increase your income by getting a better job you can try to make an argument about the utility of a dollar but all aside you are better off investing than borrowing under normal circumstances that said using a credit card with no annual fee can build credit for a future car or home loan the biggest advantage of a credit card is cash back if you have good credit you can get a credit card that offers at least 1 cash back on every purchase   if you do n't have good credit using a credit card with no annual fee can be a good way to build credit until you can get approved for a 2 card e.g. citi double cash additionally technically you can get close to 10 cash back by chasing sign up bonuses however that requires applying for new cards frequently and keeping track of minimum spend etc credit cards also protect you from fraud if someone uses your debit card number you can be short on cash until your bank fixes it   but if someone uses your credit card number you can simply dispute the charge when you get the bill you do n't have to worry about how to make rent after an unexpected charge side note it is a common mis that credit card issuers only make money from cardholder interest and fees card issuers make a lot of revenue from interchange fees paid by merchants every time you use your card some issuers e.g. amex make a majority of their revenue from merchants

this is a speculative question and there 's no correct answer but there are definitely some highly likely outcomes let 's assume that the united states defaults on it 's debt it can be guaranteed that it will lose its aaa rating although we do n't know what it will drop to we know it will be aa or lower   a triple a rating implies that the issuer will never default so it can offer lower rates since there is a guarantee of safety there people will demand a higher yield for the lower perceived security so treasury yield will go up   the us dollar or at least forex rates will almost certainly fall since us treasuries will no longer be a safe haven the dollar will no longer be the safe currency it once was and so the dollar will fall the us stock market and international markets will also have a strong fall because so many institutions financial or otherwise invest in treasuries so when treasuries tumble and the us loses triple a investments will be hurt and the tendency is for investors to overreact so it is almost guaranteed that the market will drop sharply financial stocks and companies that invest in treasuries will be hurt the most a notable exception is nations themselves for example china holds over $ 1 trillion in treasuries and a us default will hurt their value but the yuan will also appreciate with respect to the dollar thus other nations will benefit and be hurt from a us default now many people expect a double dip recession worse than the crisis if the us defaults i count myself a member of this crowd nonetheless we can not say with certainty whether or not there will be another recession or even a depression we can only say that a recession is a strong possibility so basically let 's pray that washington gets its act together and raises the ceiling or else we 're in for bad times and lastly a funny quote i could end the deficit in 5 minutes    you just pass a law that says that    anytime there is a deficit of more    than 3 of gdp all sitting members of    congress are ineligible for       warren buffett

when paying off multiple debts there is a protocol that many support payoff your debts according to the snowball method the snowball method proposes that you make minimum payments on all debts except the smallest one payoff the smallest debt as quickly as possible as smaller debts are paid off that makes one less minimum payment you need to make leaving you with more money to put against the next smallest debt so in your case pay off the smaller debt completely then follow up on the larger one by making regular payments at least equal to the sum of your two current minimum payments you 'll see immediate progress in tackling your debt and have one less minimum to worry about which can serve as a little safety of it 's own if you have a bad month as to saving the thousand dollars that is pragmatic and prudent it 's not financially useful you wo n't make any money in a savings account but having cash on hand for emergencies and various other reasons is an important security for modern living   as suggested in another answer you can forgo saving this thousand and put it against debt now because you will have a freed up credit card credit can certainly give you that same security this is an alternative option but not all emergencies will take a credit card you typically ca n't make rent with your credit card for example good luck paying your debts and i hope you can soon enjoy the freedom of a debt free life

i started storing and summing all my receipts bills etc it has the advantage of letting me separate expenses by category but it 's messy and it takes a long time   it sounds from this like you are making your summaries far too detailed do n't instead start by painting with broad strokes for example if you spent $ at the grocery store do n't bother splitting that amount into categories like toiletries hygiene products food and snacks just categorize it as grocery spending and move on to the next line on your account statement similarly unless your finances are heavily reliant on cash do n't worry about categorizing each cash expense rather just categorize the withdrawal of cash as miscellaneous and do n't spend time trying to figure out exactly where the money went after that because honestly you probably spent it on something other than savings because really when you are just starting out getting a handle on your spending you do n't need all the nitty gritty details what you need rather is an idea of where your money is going figure out half a dozen or so categories which make sense for you to categorize your spending into you probably have some idea of where your money is going these could be loans cost of living mortgage rent utilities housing home insurance groceries transportation car payments fuel vehicle taxes savings and so on whatever fits your situation add a miscellaneous category for anything that does n't neatly fit into one of the categories you thought of go back something like 3 4 months among your account statements do a quick categorization for each line on your account statements into one of these categories and then sum them up per category and per month calculate the monthly average for each category that 's your starting point the budget you 've been living by intentionally or not after that you can decide how you want to allocate the money and perhaps dig a bit more deeply into some specific category turns out you are spending a lot of money on transportation which you did n't expect look more closely at those line items and see if there 's something you can cut are you spending more money at the grocery store than you thought then look more closely at that and so on once you know where you are and where you want to be such as for example bumping the savings category by $ 200 per month you can adjust your budget to take you closer to your goals chances are you wo n't realistically be able to do an about face turn on the spot but you can try to reduce some discretionary category by say 10 each month and transfer that into savings instead that way in 6 7 months you have cut that category in half

first off is right at the end of the day you should not accept what anyone says to do without your money take their suggestions as directions to research and decide for yourself   i also do not think what you have is too little to invest but that depends on how liquid you need to be   often in order to make a small amount of money grow via investments you have to be willing to take all the investment profits from that principle and reinvest it   thus can you see how your investment ability is governed by the time you plan to spend without that money   they mantra that i have heard from many people is that the longer you are able to wait the more risk you can take   as someone who is about the same age as you i 'm 24 i ca n't exactly say yet that what i have done is sure fire for the long term but i suggest you adopt a few principles 1 go read a random walk down wall street by burton g. malkiel   a key point for you might be that you can do better than most of these professional investors for hire simply by putting   more money in a well selected index fund   for example vanguard is a nice online service to buy indexes through but they may require a minimum   2 since you are young if you go into any firm bank or financial planner they will just think you are naive and try to get you to buy whatever is best for them one of their mutual funds money market accounts annuities some flashy cd    do n't   you can do better on your own and while it might be tempting because these options look more secure or well managed most of the time you will barely make above inflation and you will not have learned very much 3 one exciting thin you should start learning now is about algorithmic trading because it is cool and super efficient is a good platform for this   it is a fun community and it is also free 4 one of the best ways i have found to watch the stock market is actually through a stock game app on my phone that has realtime stock price feed   seeking alpha has a good mobile app interface and it also connects you to news that has to do with the companies you are interested in

the market is for sophisticated investors who have money to lose   if you fall into that category then you belong there   otherwise it would be wise to have no confidence in the market whatsoever   there is more borrowed investment money in the market than ever   there are more derivatives out there than ever   there is less regulation than ever   the market makers will exit the market for the sole purpose of watching it drop in value as everyone else tries to get out at which time they will jump right back in after the crash its a game for them   a very profitable game at that

regardless of what they are doing you ca n't kill inflation every single dollar created by the federal reserve is done so out of debt through a promissory note loaned by the us treasury the note which is essentially debt is created amp loaned with the understanding that the federal reserve will one day pay off it off however this is impossible because more money would have to be created to pay of these notes which in turn creates more debt but wait let 's not forget to factor in tax the debt can never be paid off it is literally impossible through our current system of currency circulation carried out by the federal reserve in other words due to our crippling debt that can not be inflation will continue to occur because our currency will continue to devalue those that created the federal reserve in what the 20 's knew all of this to be true there goal was to destabilize the economy and they succeeded they being large influential families such as the and the this is the exact reason andrew jackson shut down the original central bank they are a foundation for corruption and anyone who tells you otherwise is either ill informed or in on it it is impossible to kill inflation amp the notion that one company or one man can do so is preposterous and simply click bait

except restricting how the economy can be controlled is a slippery slope into financial control of the nation by outside interests   the real issue is that every extreme becomes a problem and trying to block every extreme is futile   controls should impede but not completely stop extremes   the method should return the force against it as support or growth for the nation   financial growth of any outside interest connected to the government or in this country should bring more and more wealth into the nation while slowing the growth of the financial extremes but never stopping it   special interest groups need to return to the country a share of what they gain through their work with the government and our people   religious groups should return money and support of the lower class   women ’s advocacy groups need to return value for their gains   the nra needs to return value for its gains   the poorer populace should return work for the country in return for education health care housing food and wages   harder and smarter work better progress through education should be rewarded with better benefits and eventual financial freedom there is no true freedom in a world of limited resources and competition so the idea of true freedom is ridiculous   we should however endeavor to give as much freedom as possible   there should be an uncomfortable minimum below which a person may only fall if they refuse to work and get educated

answers here are correct but i 'll offer an extremely overly simple explanation that should help you in understanding the more detailed answers   when most people own stock they do so through a broker   unless you jump through some hoops the broker keeps the shares in the name of the brokerage   this is called holding the stock in street name when you sell short through a brokerage the broker is letting you borrow a certain number of shares owned by someone else and sell them for cash now   at some point you need to repay this loan with the same number of shares you borrowed   ideally you want the stock to drop to $ 0   the reason you might be forced to purchase the stock is that the actual owner(s of the stock want to sell   if the broker has too many people wanting to sell you will need to repay some of all of the loan in shares i.e. purchasing shares at the current market price

this is probably a very opinion based but anyway my solution to such questions is to have multiple layers of emergency funds i have one amount in a bank account that i do not like to tap but can and do when i need money this is most close to your infrequent but not completely surprising moments of cash need i have a second layer in the form of stocks as i understand that selling stocks should not be done when you need money but when the stock price is good this provides a fairly high barrier to selling it on a whim before i do so especially if the stock price is n't at a local max it would have to be an emergency my third layer is even more fixed investment which i ca n't access with online brokerage the physical aspect makes sure that it has to be a real serious emergency before i turn that into cash if you have such a layered approach the question is not black and white anymore and easier to answer

they said the expected returns from the stock market are around 7   emphasis added the key word in your quote is expected   on average the market gains in the 7 9 range more if you reinvest dividends but there 's a great deal of risk too meaning that in any given year the market could be down 20 or be   up 30 your student loan on the other hand is risk free   you are guaranteed to pay lose 4 a year in interest   you ca n't directly compare the expected return of a risk free asset with the expected return of a risky asset   you can compare the risks of two assets with equal expected returns and the expected returns of assets with equal risks but you ca n't directly compare returns of assets with different risks   so in two years you might be better off if you had invested the money versus paying the loan or you might be much worse off   in ten years your chances of coming out ahead are better but still not guaranteed what 's confusing is i 've heard that if you 're investing you should be investing in both stocks and bonds since i 'm young i would n't want to put much in bonds though so how would that factor in   bonds have lower risk uncertainty than stocks but lower expected returns   if you invest in both your overall risk is lower since sometimes not always the gain in stocks are offset by losses in bonds   so there is value in diversifying since you can get better expected returns from a diversified portfolio than from a single asset with a comparable amount of risk   however there it no risk free asset that will have a better return than what you 're paying in student loan interest

there are lots of different ways to generate passive income   what is passive income basically it is income you receive without having to consistently work for it i.e. paid to do your day job or get paid by the hour instead you do the work once and then receive ongoing payments like a recording artist getting paid royalties or a book author etc   online passive income also some online business models can be great ways to generate passive income you set up an automated system online to drive traffic and sell products either as the merchant or an affiliate and get paid regularly without having to do any more work   you just need to use seo or ppc or media buys or online advertising to generate the automated traffic to your website which will have special landing pages and sales that do the conversion and selling for you if you are an affiliate you do n't even have to handle any products packaging delivering etc   and if it ’s a digital product like software or information products they can be sent straight to the customers automatically online then you can set up a system that can generate true passive income time consuming or expensive however the above mentioned methods of generating passive income tend to require a lot of work or special skills talent or knowledge and can be expensive or time consuming to set up preferred method therefore for many people the preferred passive income method is fully managed hands free property investing or other types of investing for that matter   but for people who want full ownership of the income generating asset then property investing is the best as they can sell and have control over the capital invested whereas investing in a business for example will have a lot of other variables to consider like the business sector the market factors the management team and even down to individual employee performance so in my opinion if you have the money to invest then fully managed hands free buy to let property investing is one of the best types of passive income available to us today   some of the most popular income generating property assets today in the uk include    student property    care homes    residential buy to let

number 2 so before i try to answer number 1 i 'll just mention that academics generally ignored negative real interest rates and have always admitted that negative nominal rates were perfectly possible   there 's nothing in his explanation that i think is controversial at this point though   as for number 1 a drop in a company 's share price affects the company 's ability to raise cash in the present and future   in a closely related issue that drop can affect the company 's ability to compensate its employees through options and restricted stock grants   in the long run and i suspect you already know this and drop in the share price affects the shareholders wealth and can lead them to demand that changes be made to be firm 's operations usually changes made to who 's running the firm   if a firm does n't need more financing and it does n't pay any employees with stock or derivatives on its stock then changes to its stock price wo n't affect the firm 's operations in the slightest   naturally this assuming that the change in stock prices is n't indicative of changes to the economy but that 's a causal relationship in the other direction the stock price reflects changes in operations not the other way around

wealthsimple lists their prices as follows those are the fees you pay over and above what you pay for the underlying etfs management fees but why not just invest in the etfs yourself the canadian couch potato website shows some sample portfolios the etf option has an average management expense ratio very similar to that of the etfs used by wealthsimple but without the additional management fee rebalance once or twice a year and you cut your fees from approximately if investing mid six figures to 0.17 for very little work is it worth it to you well that depends on how much you have to invest and how much effort you are willing to put in wealthsimple is n't particularly unreasonable with their fees but the fees do look a bit high once you are in to the six figures of investing on the other hand i often recommend tangerine 's mutual funds to my friends who are looking at investing for retirement those mutual funds last time i checked cost that 's about twice what wealthsimple is charging but they are easy to understand and easy to invest in a good choice for my friends looking to invest $ 1,000 $ 50,000 in my opinion so and understanding this is just my personal opinion i think wealthsimple fits in a niche where tangerine mutual funds carry too high a cost for you but you do n't want to do all the management yourself even if this is just an hour or so of work a couple of times a year i wish they were cheaper but their pricing makes sense for a lot of people in my opinion do they make sense for you if you are looking at investing less than $ 10,000 i 'd stick with an option like tangerine only because that 's an easier option if investing more than $ 100,000 or $ 200,000 i think you are paying a bit much for what they offer but many people pay much much much more for their investments

i agree with option 3 from the accepted answer his hers joint but with one caveat that my wife and i are finding out once you have children if your income is in the mid range where you are not paycheck to paycheck but are not floating in excess money either ie you can have a vacation but you have to plan for it and save up for a few months to do so the child relative expenses begin to be a huge factor in your overall budget such that particularly if one partner does more of the child related buying it can be hard to really keep up the 3 account separation because those child related expenses may end up being all of one earner 's paycheck we originally did the 3 way split where we took rent car and utilities from joint ie each transferred a reasonable portion to the joint account to cover and just bought groceries each occasionally such that it was generally a reasonable split as we both shopped for groceries and both earned close enough to each other that it worked out   but once we had kids it ended up being very different and we eventually had to more properly budget all of our funds as if they were basically joint funds   while we still do have separate accounts and largely separate credit cards etc except for one joint card it 's almost pro forma now due to the kids

in my experience when a salesperson says a particular deal is only good if you purchase right now 100 of the time it is not true of course i ca n't guarantee that is universally the case but if you leave and come back 5 minutes later or tomorrow or next week it 's extremely likely that they 'll still take your money for the original price in fact sometimes after you leave you get a call with even a lower price than the excellent offer most of the time when you are presented with high pressure sales accompanied by a this price is only good right now pitch it ends up being because they do n't want you to go search the competition and read reviews in this case you have already done that and deemed the item to be worthwhile perhaps a better tactic for the salesperson would have been to try to convince you that others are interested in the item and if you wait it might be sold to someone else at that excellent price sales is an art and it requires the salesperson to size you up and try to figure out your vulnerability and exploit it this particular salesperson obviously you and/or you do n't have an easily vulnerability i would n't let the shortcomings of the salesperson get in the way of your purchase if you are worried about the scenario of someone else up the item consider offering a deposit to hold the item for a certain amount of time while you reflect and/or arrange for the funds

advantage of cash you can spend the money without having to pay any fees or taxes to get it out disadvantage when inflation is greater than zero which it has been for many decades your cash is continually losing value advantages of an ira roth or classic your money will usually grow as the investments return a profit you get special tax benefits disadvantages there 's risk you may lose money there are tax penalties for withdrawing the money before retirement in general you should only put money in an ira if you expect to leave it there until you retire or at least for a long time whole life is a combination of a life insurance policy and an investment advantages combines insurance and investment into one convenient monthly payment disadvantages the investment portion typically has lower returns than you could get elsewhere if you have no need for life insurance if you 're not supporting anyone or you 're they could get along without you or you do n't like them and do n't care what happens to them when you 're gone or whatever then there 's no point buying life insurance whole or term you 're paying for a product that you do n't need it 's pretty common advice to tell people that instead of buying a whole life policy they should buy a term policy with the same coverage and then invest the difference in the premium for example if you were considering getting a $ 100,000 whole life policy that costs $ 50 per month just making up numbers of course it depends on your age health etc and you see you could get a $ 100,000 term life policy for $ 30 per month you will almost certainly do better in the long run to buy the $ 30 term policy and put the other $ 20 into investments the catch to this plan is that there are usually transaction costs to investing even a discount broker like ameritrade or scott trade charges around $ 10 per transaction so if you tried to invest $ 20 each month you 'd lose half of it to transaction fees which means that in practice you 'd have to save that money up until you had at least a few hundred and at that point many people find other things always seem to come up to spend the money on so that while they start out with every intention of investing this money they do n't

if you only have to pay 23k federal taxes on 100k that means you are in the long term capital gains tax rate which is the lower of the tax rates available first you get your federal income tax marginal tax rate and then find the matching long term capital gains tax rate for example if your marginal federal income tax rate is 28 your capital gains tax rate would be 15 or rather if the amount of the gain would put you in the 28 rate then your long term capital gains tax rate is 15 you can reduce that by having more losses if you have anything else invested anywhere that is taking a loss then you can sell that this year and it will offset the other gains you have realized the only note is that your losses have to be long term capital losses too tax loss harvesting takes this to an extreme where you sell something at a loss to lock in the tax loss but you did n't really want to get rid of that investment so then you buy a nearly identical investment ie if you owned shares of tech sector etf and it was at a loss you would sell that and then immediately buy tech sector etf the competing product that does the exact same thing then there is charity this still requires spending money and you not having it any longer if you feel that a cause can use the money more directly than the us government you can donate an appreciated asset to the charity not report a gain and also take a charitable deduction

i moved from contributing 10 to maxing as my salary rose over the course of three years after graduation   because of my raises my monthly take home still increased so it was a pretty painless way to increase my 401(k contribution and also avoid lifestyle inflation that said i would not do it if you have any credit card debt school loans or an auto loan   pay that off first   then work on maxing the 401(k   personally i rate owning a home behind that but that 's partially because i 'm in an area where the rent ratios are barely on the side of buying so i do n't find buying to be a pressing matter one thing to investigate is if your company offers a roth 401(k option   it 's a nice option where you can go roth without worrying about income limits   my personal experience does not include a roth ira because when i still qualified for one i did n't know much about them and now that i know about them i have the happy issue of not qualifying

your asset mix should reflect your own risk tolerance   whatever the ideal answer to your question it requires you to have good timing not once but twice let me offer a personal example in 2007 the s&p hit its short term peak at or so as it tanked in the crisis a coworker shared with me that he went to cash on the way down selling out at about 1100 at the bottom or so i his brilliance sarcasm here and as it passed 1300 just 2 years later again mentions how he must be thrilled he doubled his money he admitted he was still in cash done with stocks so he was worse off than had he held on to his pre crash assets for sake of disclosure my own mix at the time was 100 stock that 's not a recommendation just a reflection of how my wife and i were invested   we retired early and after the 2013 excellent year moved to a mix closer to at any time a crisis hits and we have 5 6 years spending money to let the market recover if a long term decline occurs social security kicks in for us in 8 years   if my intent was n't 100 clear i 'm suggesting your long term investing should always reflect your own risk tolerance not some short term gut feel that disaster is around the corner

i suggest that you use your own judgement on this you can assign a reasonable percentage since it is impossible to monitor the hours using those assets example 40 personal and 60 for business it 's really your call i also suggest that you should be conservative on valuing the assets record the assets at it 's lowest value this is one of the most difficult scenarios in making your own financial statements you can also use this approach i will record the assets at its original cost then use a higher depreciation rate or double declining method of depreciation if the assets have a depreciation rate of 20 per year useful life of 5 years i will make it 30 the other 10 will add more expense and helps you not to overstate your financial statement you can also use the residual value of the asset but if you do this you should figure out the reliable amount i understand that this is not for tax reporting purposes therefore there 's no harm if you overstate your financial statement and even if you overstate you can still adjust the cost of the asset along the way in the middle of the year or year end you will figure out the cost of the asset if it 's over valued once the financial statement is done

probably not in general if you withdraw money from a 401k before age 59 1/2 you must pay a 10 penalty there are some special cases you can withdraw money to pay certain unreimbursed medical bills if you are disabled or to pay back taxes you can also withdraw money if you are dead see there is also a provision that you can make penalty free withdrawals as long as you take them regularly made as part of a series of substantially equal periodic payments beginning after separation from service and made at least annually for the life or life expectancy of the participant or the joint lives or life of the participant and his or her designated beneficiary the payments under this exception except in the case of death or disability must continue for at least 5 years or until the employee reaches age 59½ whichever is the longer period see i do n't quite understand this rule you ca n't take money out one time but you can take money out multiple times oh well i think the idea is supposed to be that you can take out money for an early retirement

this can be answered by looking at the fine print for any prospectus for any stock bond or mutual fund it says past performance is not an indicator of future performance a mutual fund is a portfolio of common stocks managed by somebody for a fee there are many factors that can drive performance of a fund up or down here are a few   i 'm sure there are many more market influences that i can not think of that push fund prices up or down what the fund did last year is not one of them if it were making money in the mutual fund market would be as easy as investing in last year 's winners and everyone would be doing it

a few ideas i suggest it would wise to consider what lesson is learned as a result of any resolution of a financial issue is it a lesson of responsibility and of the importance of keeping one 's word or of getting away with whatever happens poorly planned business with no adverse consequences no consequences e.g. forgiven loan is also a consequence and it sends a message sounds like paying the loan from your savings automatically means it 's deducted from inheritance since the savings are part of that inheritance this may seem like a square deal if we ignore inflation assuming today the $ 54 k is worth much more than unless it is adjusted for inflation the same $ 54 k will be worth i.e. will allow to buy a few decades from now when the inheritance   so this option means your son is foregoing a significantly smaller financial loss in the future in exchange for foregoing his debt completely today this is like borrowing $ 54 k from a bank now and only having to forego the same amount decades in the future when it is in fact worth much less what borrower would not be happy with such arrangement and what lender would do it only one 's own loving parents you are in charge of what life lessons your son will walk away with from this situation good luck

a few years ago i had a 5 year car loan i wanted to prepay it after 2 years and i asked this question to the lender i expected a reduction in the interest attached to the car loan since it did n't go the full 5 years they basically told me i was crazy and the balance owed was the full amount of the 5 year car loan this sounds like you either got a bad car loan i.e. pay all the interest first before paying any principal a crooked lender or you were misunderstood   most consumer loans both car loans and mortgages reduce the amount of interest you pay not the percentage as you pay down principal the amount of interest of each payment is computed by multiplying the balance owed by the periodic interest rate e.g. if your loan is at 12 annual interest you 'll pay 1 of the remaining principal each month although that 's the most common loan structure there are others that are more complex and less friendly to the consumer typically those are used when credit is an issue and the lender wants to make sure they get as much interest up front as they can and can recover the principal through a repossession or foreclosure it sounds like you got a interest loan   with these loans the amount of interest you 'd pay if you paid through the life of the loan is computed and added to the principal to get a total loan balance you are required to pay back that entire amount regardless of whether you pay early or not you could still pay it early just to get that monkey off your back but you may not save any interest    you are not crazy to think that you should be able to save on interest though as that 's how normal loans work    next time you need to borrow money make sure you understand the terms of the loan and if you do n't ask someone else to help you or just save up cash and do n't borrow money

is there not some central service that tracks current currency rates that banks can use to get currency data sure   but this does n't matter   all the central service can tell you is how much the rate was historically   but the banks paypal do n't care about the historical value   they want to know the price that they 'll pay when they get around to switching not the last price before the switch   beyond that there is a transaction cost to switching   they have to pay the clearinghouse for managing the transaction    the banks can choose to act as a clearinghouse but that increases their risk   if the bank has a large balance of us dollars but dollars are falling then they end up eating that cost   they 'll only take that risk if they think that they 'll make more money that way   and in the end they may have to go on the currency market anyway   if a european bank runs out of us dollars they have to buy them on the open market   or a us bank might run out of euros   or yen   etc    another problem is that many of the currency transactions are small but the overhead is fixed   if the bank has to pay $ 5 for every currency transaction they wo n't even break even charging 3 on a $ 100 transaction   so they delay the actual transaction so that they can make more than one at a time   but then they have the risk that the currency value might change in the meantime   if they credit you with $ 97 in your account $ 100 minus the 3 fee but the price actually drops from $ 100 to $ 99 they 're out the $ 1    they could do it the other way as well   you ask for a $ 100 transaction   they perform a $ 1000 transaction of which they give you $ 97   now they have $ $ 1000 minus the $ 5 they paid for the transaction plus the $ 3 they charged you for the transaction   if there 's a 1 drop they 're out $ $ in currency loss plus a net $ 2 in fees    this is why banks have money market accounts   so they have someone to manage these problems working twenty four hours a day   but then they have to pay interest on those accounts further eating into their profits   along with paying a staff to monitor the currency markets and things that may affect them

what most respondents are forgetting is when a company allows its employees to purchase its shares at a discount with their salary the employee is usually required to hold the stock for a number of years before they can sell them the reason the company is allowing or promoting its employees to purchase its shares at a discount is to give the employees a sense of ownership of the company being a part owner in the company the employee will want the company to succeed and will tend to be more productive if employees were allowed to purchase the shares at a discount and sell them straight away it would defeat this purpose your best option to decide whether or not to buy the shares is to work out if the investment is a good one as per any other investment you would undertake i.e. determine how the company is currently performing and what its future prospects are likely to be regarding what percentage of pay to purchase the shares with if you do decide to buy them you need to work that out based on your current and future budgetary needs and your savings plan for the future

changes in graduated income tax rates do n't necessarily drive how you should allocate money to a traditional vs roth account true for both ira or 401k what does drive this decision is what your income tax rate is now compared to what you believe your rate will be when you retire so if you expect the tax rate change to still be in effect when you retire it does n't matter if the change is a tax increase or decrease your previous allocation could likely remain the same this means that if congress passed the change effective immediately it would be too late for you to make a meaningful adjustment but if congress passes the change effective next year then most likely your tax rate will decrease for next year meaning you are probably better off switching all roth allocations to traditional and then switching them back to whatever allocations you have now for next year the reverse would be true if you knew about an upcoming tax increase in which case you would load up roth this year and then switch back to whatever you had for next year that being said regarding after the fact considerations i suppose it would be fair to say that if the country is accustomed to a higher tax rate and then rates are dropped if spending is not cut to make up for it then rates would likely have to go up again in the future to make up the difference if you believe that will happen then roths would become a little more attractive since rates would be lower than what you expect them to be when you retire as a side note if you ever had reason to believe that congress was going to move away from the graduated income tax structure all bets are off for example if the income tax was replaced with a tax on spending such as the then in the interim period roths would become worthless and you 'd want to switch to until the change went into effect and then once in effect both roths and would be pointless

i have a job and would like to buy equipment for producing music at home and it would be easier for me to pay for the equipment monthly i just want to address your contention that it would be easier to pay monthly with an interest calculation   lets say you get a credit card with a very reasonable rate of 12 and you buy $ 2,500 of equipment   a typical credit card minimum payment is interest charges + 1 of the principle you can see how this is going   you 've paid nearly $ 200 to clear about $ 100 off your principle   obviously paying the minimum payment will take forever to wipe out this debt   so you pay more or maybe you get 0 interest for a while and take advantage of that paying $ 100 per month against $ 2,500 at 12 per year will take 29 months and cost about $ 390 in interest   at $ 200 per month it 'll take 14 months and cost $ 184 in interest   also note you 'll probably get an interest rate closer to 16 or 17 it 's always easier to pay small amounts frequently than it is to pay a lot of money all at once that ease has a cost   if you 're buying the gear to start a little business or you already have a little business going and want to upgrade some gear great disciplined debt handling is a wonderful skill to have in business   if you want to start yourself in to a new hobby you should not do that with debt   if interest rates are low enough financing something can make sense   0.9 apr on a car sure 15 apr on a mixing board no   credit card interest rates are significant and really should not be with

to answer your first part its not an opposition to profit it 's an opposition to usury the practice of charging excessive interest on loans there are extensive in the condemning the practice and in many cases excessive interest is any interest to the second part of the question these may well be more risky investments but if you 're trying to build a strong and thriving community financial spirit one might expect there to be significant social pressures to use the loaned money responsibly additionally while it removes some of the penalty for failure it does n't remove the rewards for success the incentive is still there to succeed it 's merely the penalty for failure is no longer financial it may also temper the incentive for banks to give money to riskier borrowers but rather to prudently invest in ventures with an acceptable amount of risk the question as to whether or not this is a house of cards likely depends on the questioner whether or not this is also true for the western banking system likely remains to be seen but it has n't exactly been doing a sterling job of convincing me it is n't true for the past decade

what is a dividend essentially for every share of a dividend stock that you own you are paid a portion of the company ’s earnings you get paid simply for owning the stock for example let ’s say company x pays an annualized dividend of 20 cents per share most companies pay dividends quarterly four times a year meaning at the end of every business quarter the company will send a check for 1/4 of 20 cents or 5 cents for each share you own this may not seem like a lot but when you have built your portfolio up to thousands of shares and use those dividends to buy more stock in the company you can make a lot of money over the years the key is to reinvest those dividends source what is an ex dividend date once the company sets the record date the ex dividend date is set based on stock exchange rules the ex dividend date is usually set for stocks two business days before the record date if you purchase a stock on its ex dividend date or after you will not receive the next dividend payment instead the seller gets the dividend if you purchase before the ex dividend date you get the dividend source that said as long as you purchased the stock before you are entitled to the next dividend if not you 'll get the following one after that
