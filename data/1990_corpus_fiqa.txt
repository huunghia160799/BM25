old question but in the comments of the accepted answer i believe nate is correct and littleadv is incorrect nate copied the actual quote from the irs guidelines quoted below an expense is ordinary if it is common and accepted in your trade business or profession an expense is necessary if it is appropriate and helpful to your business an expense does n't have to be required to be considered necessary noise cancelling headphones certainly count as appropriate and helpful to your business in the software industry especially with the trend of open office layouts and because of the ubiquitous distractions inherent in the aforementioned office space noise cancelling headphones are becoming quite common and accepted for use by developers   i 'd be more hesitant about the keyboard and monitor as presumably the employer is providing those already as using your own could be said to just be a personal preference over those provided the argument that providing your own version is appropriate and helpful is a little more shaky   i am not a tax lawyer so do n't come after me if you get audited but my guess from reading the actual irs guidelines is noise cancelling headphones probably keyboard and monitor maybe

firstly well done on building a really sold base of savings an emergency fund needs to have two key characteristics be enough to get you through a typical emergency event often seen as approx ~6 salary in your style of situation assuming you have no dependents etc be liquid and available to you instantly if an emergency arises once you have decided how much you will need for 1 you then generally find the best interest available on an instant access savings account and leave it there it 's important to note that because you need it very liquid and very secure you will basically never make nor should   you expect to make any sizeable rate of interest on your emergency fund once this is done whatever left should be invested in an asset mix of assets that best fit your risk profile of which long term bonds are a completely legitimate option but it 's hard to say without knowing more about your long term aims liabilities job market etc

the canada revenue agency describes in detail here what information businesses must generally include on their invoices so that gst hst registrants can claim input tax credits for the expenses quote sales invoices for gst hst registrants you have to give customers who are gst hst registrants specific    information on the invoices receipts contracts or other business    papers that you use when you provide taxable goods and services this    information lets them support their claims for input tax credits    or rebates for the gst hst you charged the page quoted continues with a table describing what specifically needs to be on a sales invoice based on the total amount of the invoice the requirements differ for total sale under $ 30 total sale between $ 30 to $ and total sale $ 150 or more for the total sale under $ 30 category the only things a sales invoice must contain to support an itc claim are 1 the provider 's business name 2 the invoice date and 3 the total amount paid payable i.e. when the total sale is under $ 30 there is no requirement for any gst hst amount to be indicated separately nor for a business number to be present on the invoice hence imho and i am neither an accountant nor a lawyer if your uber rides are for $ 30 or less then you should n't expect a gst hst number anyway and a simple invoice as described should be enough for you to claim your whether or not the provider is registered in fact for gst hst is beside the point for amounts over $ 30 you need a bit more while the page above specifies that the provider 's business number should be included beginning with the next level of total sales   there are exceptions to those rules described at another page mentioned exceptions to invoice requirements that specifically apply to the taxi limousine case quote exceptions to invoice requirements gst hst registrants are required to keep the necessary documentation    to support their claim for and rebates in certain circumstances    the documentation requirements have been reduced for taxi or limousine fares your books and records must show so at a minimum for fare in excess of $ 30 total you should ask the driver to note either a the amount of gst hst charged or b a statement that the fare includes gst hst the driver 's business number need not be specified consequently if your receipt for a ride in excess of $ 30 does not contain any such additional information with respect to gst hst then i would expect the receipt does not satisfy the cra 's requirements for supporting your itc claim i.e. keep your individual rides under $ 30 each or else get a better receipt from the driver when it is above that amount p.s it should go without saying but your rides of course must be considered reasonable business expenses in order to qualify for gst hst for your business receipts for rides of a personal nature are not eligible so be sure to maintain proper records as to the business purpose and destination for each ride receipt so claimed

modigliani miller theorem   the modigliani miller theorem of modigliani merton miller is a theorem on capital structure arguably forming the basis for modern thinking on capital structure the basic theorem states that in the absence of taxes bankruptcy costs agency costs and asymmetric information and in an efficient market the value of a firm is unaffected by how that firm is financed since the value of the firm depends neither on its dividend policy nor its decision to raise capital by issuing stock or selling debt the modigliani miller theorem is often called the capital structure irrelevance principle   the key modigliani miller theorem was developed in a world without taxes     ^ ^pm](https://www.reddit.com message compose?to = kittens_from_space ^| ^exclude ^me](https://reddit.com message compose?to = wikitextbot&amp;message = excludeme&amp;subject = excludeme ^| ^exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com r finance about banned ^| ^faq ^/ ^information](https://np.reddit.com r wikitextbot wiki index ^| ^source](https://github.com kittenswolf wikitextbot    ^ ^downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.27

now asking if college is worth it   that 's not the question that should be asked   higher education and extended training are always a benefit at any point in life when it 's of high quality   the question that should be asked is why is the cost of college as high as it is   when i went to college to get my bachelors a semester at my state university cost $ bucks us this was in the early to mid 90s   twenty years later that same education cost $ 6,500 per semester   the main difference between these periods is that borrowing for school is now standard practice much less so in the 90s   any time you need to borrow to pay for something you 're going to overpay just because you have access to credit and can keep borrowing when someone hands you a bill   today kids borrow for college because they do n't have much choice if their parents did n't save enough or stopped supporting them right out of high school   and if you have this level of debt right out of college your hands will be tied for decades it affects things like first home buying and disposable income spending   the only way to drive the cost of college down is to plan ahead and pay with cash and to do that you need to have enough luck to be born to parents who care enough to help with your future   if schools know you ca n't or wo n't borrow to pay for an education they adjust

gt the economic term for this concept is velocity of money and it gets into stuff that i did n't really cover above   i noticed that it was n't covered and it seems to me that this actually has something to do with the original question about where all the money has gone    it 's my understanding that the velocity of money has slowed with corporations being uncertain of future prospects both due to the economy itself as well as to an uncertain regulatory environment and thus hesitant to make new investments   however this does n't make complete sense to me it 's not that they 're hiding the money under a mattress they must have it invested into something and presumably the holders of those investments are themselves doing something with it

any way you look at it this is a terrible idea cars lose value   they are a disposable item that gets used up   the more expensive the car the more value they lose if you spend $ 100,000 on a new car in four years it will be worth less than $ 50,000   that is a lot of money to lose in four years in addition to the loss of value you will need to buy insurance which for a $ 100,000 car is incredible if your heart is set on this kind of car you should definitely save up the cash and wait to buy the car   do not get a loan   here is why your plan has you saving $ 1,300 a month $ 16,000 a year for 6.5 years before you will be able to buy this car   that is a lot of money for a long range goal   if you faithfully save this money that long and at the end of the 6.5 years you still want this car it is your money to spend as you want   you will have had a long time to reconsider your course of action but you will have sacrificed for a long time and you will have the money to lose   however you may find out a year into this process that you are spending too much money saving for this car and reconsider if instead you take out a loan for this car then by the time you decide the car was too much of a stretch financially it will be too late   you will be upside down on the loan and it will cost you thousands to sell the car so go ahead and start saving   if you have n't given up before you reach your goal you may find that in 6.5 years when it is time to write that check you will look back at the sacrifices you have made and decide that you do n't want to simply blow that money on a car consider a different goal   if you invest this $ 1300 a month and achieve 8 growth you will be a millionaire in 23 years you do n't need to take my word for it   look at the car you are interested in go to select the 2012 version of the car and look up the private sale value   you 'll most likely see a price that is about half of what a new one costs

a 529 plan is set up in a specific beneficiary 's name but the money can be rolled over or transferred into another 529 plan in the same beneficiary 's name or the beneficiary can be changed by the owner of the account   i mistakenly believed that the new beneficiary could be anyone else but as mhoran_psprep has   pointed out in the comment below the new beneficiary must be related to   the previous one in specific ways as detailed in publication 970 2011 tax benefits for education in order for the change to occur without any tax consequences   so my original statement that distributions can be used for anyone 's educational expense without tax consequences was incorrect if the new beneficiary is not related to the original beneficiary tax consequences will indeed occur   note also that unlike iras where the entire amount can be withdrawn by the owner without incurring a 10 penalty after a certain period or after reaching a certain age distributions from a 529 plan for nonqualified expenses including as a special case a withdrawal of funds by the owner will incur the 10 penalty tax regardless of when this occurs the problem with ugma accounts is that you have to turn the money over to the beneficiary when that beneficiary becomes an adult 18 years old in most cases regardless of your current opinion of that beneficiary and the beneficiary is free to use the money to buy a motorcycle with it if she chooses instead of using it for her education   in this sense i agree with mhoran_psprep 's answer that it is best to put away the money in an ordinary account without seeking tax benefits and deal with the matter as you see fit when the niece is filling out her college paperwork

the entire time you 've talked about cost changing incomes matters little if the cost scales with it me thinks you do n't understand how a market works even a semi planned one if more people make more money the price of most goods goes up this is n't due to real actual demand its due to something called inflation when the amount of money in circulation increases we have inflation lets say i make 35k a year as a store clerk is my labor being undervalued compared to the income of a store clerk in the past or is the price of goods scaling faster than my income has scaled   simply adding more money does n't fix anything the price of the good or service is what matters the most while everyone having more money is good you ca n't just magically give everyone more money without the cost of goods and services rising i imagine that if everyone suddenly were at least a millionaire the price of a laptop would sky rocket the cost of the laptop in parts would n't be that much more but since most people would have disposable income beyond their needs some goods would then get more expensive once that happens the inflation of prices starts to spread until its effects are seen across the market   i do n't think the fruit of my labor is being stolen by the upper class if anything the fruit of my labor gets taken more and more by my own government and transferred to the lower classes more and more i 'm not rich not even close but i know i 've had at least 15k of my income in the last 5 years taken and distributed through taxes on my income to people that are generally unable to earn enough on their own   if these people are the upper class then i must be

i agree completely   i do n't always agree with john cochrane but when i do i agree completely   i think heavy reliance on either approach to pricing is generally a bad idea   equilibrium models always include something that you 're supposed to inherently know but never do   no arbitrage models do n't necessarily say anything that you do n't in some mathematical sense already know   so you 're either stuck with unknown parameters or you ca n't explain why you 're something is worth what you say it is beyond derp other people are doing it   so i think if buy side people made some use of no arbitrage models they 'd have a better understanding of the parameters they 're making up and if sell side people sometimes used equilibrium models they 'd have a better grasp of what 's going on economically   also it would have the beneficial effect of reminding people that their models are always wrong even if they 're frequently useful

you can always reduce the income by the direct expenses required to earn it and figure out whether it is ultimately a net profit or loss    the net profit is taxable income   the loss may be tax deductible if the underlying thing is tax deductible     for the book the $ 50 revenue required a $ 100 expense so that 's a $ 50 net loss   you do n't owe any income tax since it 's a loss   you could take the loss as a tax deduction if you have a business trading books or if buying the book would be tax deductible for some reason   note that in the latter case you can only deduct the $ 50 not the $ 100   for the airline ticket it is to compensate you for the losses you took as a result if the delayed flight so you tally up the $ 22 meal you had in the airport waiting for news the $ 110 on the motel room you rented or forfeited any other way you can peg a cash value to any losses you took   total them up again a net loss is only deductible if the travel is already deductible note that if the actual expenses book flight were tax deductible for some reason the cash back reduces the amount of your tax deduction so it has the same effect as the sale gift being taxable income

note that you 're asking about withholding not about taxing   withholding does n't mean this is exactly the tax you 'll pay it means they 're withholding a certain amount to make sure you pay taxes on it but the tax bill at the end of the year is the same regardless of how you choose to do the withholding   your tax bill may be higher or lower than the withholding amount as far as tax rate that will be the same regardless you 're just moving the money from one place to the other    the only difference would be that your tax is based on total shares under the plan meaning that if you buy 1k shares for example at $ 10 so $ 1,500 discounted income if you go the payroll route you get say $ 375 withheld   if you go the share route you either get $ 375 worth of stock so 38 shares withheld and then you would lose out on selling that stock meaning you do n't get quite as much out of it at the end or you would ask them to actually buy rather more shares to make up for it meaning you 'd have a slightly higher total gain   that would involve a slightly higher tax at the end of it of course option 1   buy and then sell $ 10000 worth share based withholding   assuming 15 profit and $ 10/share at both points then buy sell 1000 shares $ 1500 in profit to take into account 38 shares worth = $ 380 withheld   you put in $ 8500 you get back $ net $ 1120    option 2   buy and then sell $ worth share based withholding   same assumptions   you make about $ 2000 in pre tax profit meaning you owe about $ 500 in tax withholding   put in $ get back $ net $   owe 35 more tax at the end of the year but you have the full $ 1500 to spend on whatever you are doing with it option 3   buy and then sell $ 1000 worth paycheck withholding   you get the full $ = $ 1500 up front but your next paycheck is $ 375 lighter   same taxes as option 1 at the end of the year

so many complicated answers for a straight forward question first to this point i am failing to see why would a person get an ira instead of just putting the same amount of money into a mutual fund an ira can be invested in a mutual fund   the ira benefit over standard mutual fund is pre tax contribution lowering your current tax liability the advantage of an ira over a 401k is control   your employer controls where the 401k is invested you control where your ira is invested   often employers have a very small number of options because this keeps their costs with the brokerage low 401k is amazing if you have employer matched contributions   use them to the maximum your employer will match   after that own your ira   control is key when it comes to your money on ira 's buy roth first   contribute the calendar maximum   then get a traditional   the benefit of roth is that you already paid taxes on the contribution so your withdrawal is not taxed and they do not tax the interest earned like they do on a standard mutual fund

from a mathematical point of view the stats do not change depending on past performance just because a fund is lucky one year does n't mean that it will be unlucky the next consider tossing a coin the chance of heads is 50 if you have just thrown 3 heads the chance of heads is still 50 it does n't go down   if you throw 10 heads in a row the chance of a heads is still 50 in fact you many suspect there is something odd about the coin if it was an unfair coin then the chance of a heads would be higher than 50 it could be the fund is better run but there could be other reasons including random chance some funds will randomly do better and some will randomly do worse what you do know is that if they did better than average other funds have done worse at least for last year

mostly you nailed it   it 's a good question and the points you raise are excellent and comprise good analysis probably the biggest drawback is if you do n't agree with the asset allocation strategy   it may be too much too little into stocks bonds international cash    i am kind of in this boat   my 401 k offers very little choices in funds but offers vanguard target funds   these tend to be a bit too conservative for my taste so i actually put money in the 2060 target fund   if i live that long i will be 94 in 2060    so if the target funds are a bit too aggressive for you move down in years   if they are a bit too conservative move up

has good advice here i would like to add my notes if they give a 50 match that means you are getting a 50 return on immediately i do not know of a way to get a better guaranteed roi next when investing you need to determine what kind of investor you are i would suggest you make yourself more literate in investments as i suggest to anyone but there are basic things you want to look for if your primary worry is loss of your go for conservative investments this means that you are willing to accept a reduced expected roi in exchange for lower of loss of principal this does not mean you have a 100 safe investment as the last market issues have shown but in general you are better protected the fidelity investments should give you some information as to volatility or if they deem the investments conservative conservative investments are normally made up of trading bonds which have the lowest roi in general but are the most secure you can also invest in blue chip companies although stock is inherently riskier it is pointed out in comments that stocks always outperform bonds in the long term and this has been true over the last 100 years i am just suggesting ways you can protect yourself against market downturns when the market is doing very well bonds will not give you the return your friends are seeing i am just trying to give you a basic idea of what to look for when you pick your investments nothing can replace a solid investment adviser and taking the time to educate yourself

gold is a commodity   it has a tracked price and can be bought and sold as such   in its physical form it represents something real of value that can be traded for currency or   a single pound of gold is worth about dollars it is very valuable and it is easily transported as opposed to a car which loses value while you transport it   there are other metals that also hold value platinum silver copper etc as well as other commodities   platinum has a higher value to weight ratio than gold but there is less of a global quantity and the demand is not as high   a gold mine is an investement where you hope to take out more in gold than it cost to get it out    just like any other business   high gold prices simply lower your break even point tips protects you from inflation but does not protect you from devaluation   it also only pays the inflation rate by the treasury   there are experts who believe that the fed has understated inflation   if these are correct then tips is not protecting its investors from inflation as promised    you can also think of treasury bonds as an investment in your government   your return will be effectively determined by how they run their business of governing   if you believe that the government is doing the right things to help promote the economy then investing in their bonds will help them to be able to continue to do so   and if consumers buy the bonds then the treasury does not have to buy any more of its own

a lease is a rental plain and simple   you borrow money to finance the expected depreciation over the course of the lease term   this arrangement will almost always cost more over time of your ownership   that does not mean that a lease is always a worse deal    cars are almost always a losing proposition save for the oddball porsche or ferrari that is too scarce relative to demand   you accept ownership of a car and it starts to lose value   new cars lose value faster than used cars   typically if you were to purchase the car then sell it after 3 years the total cost over those three years will work out to less total money than the equivalent 36 month lease   but you will have to come up with a lot more money down or a higher monthly payment and/or sell the car after 36 months assuming the pretty standard 36 month lease   with this in mind some cars lease better than others because the projected depreciation is more favorable than other brands or models    personally i bought a slightly used car certified pre owned with a agreeable factory warranty extension   my next car i may lease   late model cars are getting so unbelievably expensive to maintain that more and more i feel like a long term rental has merit just understand that for the convenience for the freeing up of your cash flow for the of maintenance to not bother with resale or trading the car in a lease will cost a premium over a purchase over the same time frame

the examples you provide in the question are completely irrelevant it does n't matter where the brokerage is or where is the company you own stocks in for a fairly standard case of an non resident alien international student living full time in the us your capital gains are us sourced let me quote the following text a couple of paragraphs down the line you quoted on the same page gain or loss from the sale or exchange of personal property generally    has its source in the united states if the alien has a tax home in the    united states the key factor in determining if an individual is a    u.s. resident for purposes of the sourcing of capital gains is whether    the alien 's tax home has shifted to the united states if an alien    does not have a tax home in the united states then the alien ’s u.s.    source capital gains would be treated as foreign source and thus    nontaxable in general under the tax home rules a person who is away or who    intends to be away from his tax home for longer than 1 year has    shifted tax homes to his new location upon his arrival in that new    location see chapter 1 of publication 463 travel entertainment    gift and car expenses i 'll assume you 've read this and just want an explanation on what it means what it means is that if you move to the us for a significant period of time expected length of 1 year or more your tax home is assumed to have shifted to the us and the capital gains are sourced to the us from the start of your move for example you are a foreign and your 4-year assignment started in may. year end you 're not us tax resident exempt but you 've stayed in the us for more than 183 days and since your assignment is longer than 1 year your tax home is now in the us you 'll pay the 30 flat tax another example you 're a foreign airline pilot coming to the us every other day flying the airline aircraft you end up staying in the us 184 days but your tax home has n't shifted nor you 're a us tax resident you do n't pay the flat tax keep in mind that tax treaties may alter the situation since in many cases they also cover the capital gains situation for non residents

to break it to you but it 's the republican policies of deregulation and tax cuts we ca n't afford that got us this shit sandwich    not even close year deficit is not related to taxes it 's related to increased spending while yes tax revenues fall a bit but you do n't take actions that will make tax revenues fall more putting additional burdens on companies does nt yield more tax revenue if it did why not tax them at 90 but then guess what happens along that chart curve there are no companies left   how much in additional taxes could we take in 100 billion conservatively ok genius what about the other $ 1 trillion year we spend too much   seems to me like a person living paycheck to paycheck would actually have a very good idea of what it 's like to live on the edge of bankruptcy   except for most people close to bankruptcy they never had any capital to begin with they lived pay check to pay check using credit cards buying houses buying cars    businesses must keep a much larger cushion of liquid capital and assets and must plan years in advance few individuals do this or ever will    the only correlation is that more and more liabilities are not meeting income except when an individual goes bankrupt it 's mostly on them if a company goes bankrupt it can effect hundreds or thousands of employees and the company an going bankrupt wo n't then bankrupt their creditors or vendors but a company going bankrupt very well could    i do n't know if you knew this but the united states itself is bankrupt we ca n't meet liabilities with the current income that does n't mean increased taxes to increase income it means reducing liabilities and creating an envionment where those who bring in the revenue can expand    what we 're talking about here is companies receiving additional burdens not less thus there is an incentive to decrease liabilities where possible sell or close if necessary

the value of an option has 2 components the extrinsic or time value element and the intrinsic value from the difference in the strike price and the underlying asset price with either an american or european option the intrinsic value of a call option can be locked in any time by selling the same amount of the underlying asset whether that be a stock a future etc   further the time value of any option can be by delta hedging the option i.e. buying or selling an amount of the underlying asset weighted by the measure of certainty delta of the option being in the money at expiry instead the extra value of the american option comes from the financial benefit of being able to realise the value of the underlying asset early for a dividend paying stock this will predominantly be the dividend but for non dividend paying stocks or futures the buyer of an in the money option can realise their intrinsic gains on the option early and earn interest on the profits today but what they sacrifice is the of the option   however when an option becomes very in the money and the delta approaches 1 or -1 the discounting of the intrinsic value i.e. the extra amount a future cash flow is worth each day as we draw closer to payment becomes larger than the theta or time value decay of the option then it becomes optimal to early exercise abandon the optionality and realise the monetary gains upfront for a non dividend paying stock the value of the american call option is actually the same as the european the spot price of the stock will be lower than the forward price at expiry discounted by the risk free rate or your cost of funding this will exactly offset the monetary gain by exercising early and banking the proceeds however for an option on a future the value today of the underlying asset the future is the same as at expiry and its possible to fully realise the interest earned on the money received today hence the american call option is worth more for both examples the american put option is worth more slightly more so for the stock as the stock 's spot price is lower than the forward price the owner of the put option a higher intrinsic profit from selling the stock at the higher strike price today than waiting till expiry as well as realising the interest earned liquidity may influence the perceived value of being able to exercise early but its not a tangible factor that is added to the commonly used maths of the option valuation and is n't really a consideration for most of the assets that have tradeable option markets it 's also important to remember at any point in the life of the option you do n't know the future price path you 're only modelling the distribution of probable outcomes what subsequently happens after you early exercise an american option no longer has any bearing on its value this is now zero whether the stock subsequently crashes in price is what is relevant is that when you early exercise a call you give up all potential upside protected by the limit to your downside from the strike price

funds especially index funds are a safe way for beginning investors to get a diversified investment across a lot of the stock market they are not the perfect investment but they are better than the majority of mutual funds and you do not spend a lot of money in fees compared to the alternative buying individual stocks based on what a friend tells you or buying a hot mutual fund it 's a great choice for a lot of people if you are willing to do some study you can do better quite a bit better with common stocks as an individual investor you have some structural advantages you can take significant to you positions in small cap companies while this is not practical for large institutional investors or mutual fund managers   however you can also lose a lot of money quickly in individual stocks it pays to go slow and to your homework however and make sure that you are investing not speculating i like as a good place to start and subscribe to a couple of their newsletters i will note that investing is not for the faint of heart to do well you may need to do the opposite of what everybody else is doing buying when the market is down and selling when the market is high a few people mentioned the efficient market hypothesis there is ample evidence that the market is not efficient the existence of the .com and mortgage bubbles makes it pretty obvious that the market is often not rationally valued and a couple of hedge funds profited in the billions from this

in theory when you obtained ownership of your usd cash as a canadian resident resident for tax purposes which is generally a quicker timeline than being resident for immigration purposes it is considered to have been obtained by you for the cad equivalent on that date   for example if you on dec 31 2016 and carried $ 10k usd with you when the rate was then canada deems you to have arrived with $ cad if you converted that cad to usd when the rate was 1.39 you would have received cad a gain of $ 400 to show as income on your tax return   receiving the foreign inheritances is a little more complex those items when received may or may not have been taxable on that day however whether or not they were taxable you would calculate a further gain as above if the fx rate gave you more cad when you ultimately converted it if the rate went the other way and you lost cad value you may or may not be able to claim a loss if it was a small loss i would n't bother trying to claim it due to hassle if it 's a large loss i would be very sure to research thoroughly before claiming because something like that probably has a high chance of being audited

reading stuff like this makes me want to go into the debt collection business just send letters to random people demanding money sounds like an easy way to make a living what 's your name and address just kidding if they are sending stuff to a virginia po box close the box with no forwarding address and consider it case closed if they are you personally in new hampshire the best thing to do is to sue proactively before it goes to collection new hampshire has strict anti debt collection laws basically what you do is go to small claims court and fill out a one page form sue them for $ 2000 $ 3000 or whatever is convenient do not hire a lawyer you can do this in 2 hours of your own time your grounds are 1 violation of the creditor of nh laws according to the laws the creditor has to put all kinds of specific stuff in their threat letters since they are not doing this they have violated nh read the so you know which specific items they are violating 2 extortion since you do not owe them any money demanding money from you is extortion which is both criminally and actionable you sue them for mental anguish due to extortion   the validity of your claims is irrelevant you just need to get them in court there are two possibilities a they fail to show up in this case you win and they owe you $ 3000 or whatever not only that if they later try to collect from you send a copy of the judgement to the credit bureau or collector or whatever and that is proof you owe them no money b they hire some local lawyer who appears accept the court 's offer for arbitration when you go into arbitration with the lawyer tell him you will drop the lawsuit if they send you a check for $ 500 and a hand written guarantee from him that you will never hear from his client again either way you come out ahead by the way it is absolutely guaranteed that the enemy lawyer will accept your offer in b above because the seo company is already paying him $ 5000 to show up to answer your lawsuit and the lawyer does not want to hang around all morning in court waiting for the case to be heard if he can get out of there in half an hour for only $ 500 he will do it if all you are getting is calls and the caller refuses to identify then it is definitely an illegal scam it is illegal in new hampshire to make collection calls and refuse to full identify who is calling the phone company has methods for dealing with illegal calls first you have to file a police report then you call verizon security at 1 800 or whatever your phone company is they will trace the call and identify the caller they you can make a criminal complaint in their jurisdiction unless the call is from pakistan or something

have her pay something like a friendly monthly rent this should be less than half of the monthly mortgage cost since you are assuming the risk and benefits of a mortgage and closer to the rent of similar places near you for when you get married and she is to have half the apartment have a pre agreed way to calculate a lump sum that she needs to provide to match your own contributions up to that time as if you two had equal contributions from the beginning the financially precise way to do it would be to have her pay more than the mere sum of the amount since she will be providing the amount at a later time than you but i would be generous and skip this in your place if the difference is not too big if you break up she will have payed what would be a fair amount of rent as if you two were renting so in this sense it is fair that she would not have a claim on the apartment in case that you two would like that she keeps the apartment you can just sell it to her having her pay this same amount as above and assume responsibility for the rest of the mortgage

the price the provider charges you is the amount he would like to get for his services let 's take an example you do a blood test at a lab and they charge you $ if you have insurance and the provider has a contract with that insurance meaning they take them the contract limits what they can charge and what the will get for the example that might be this is what the insurance pays them or what you pay them if you have deductible note that if you have no insurance you owe them they are typically willing to negotiate that you only pay maybe $ but it still will be much higher than the insurance price why the reason is that the insurance agreed payment of $ does not cover their cost but the insurance forces them to make that contract or basically be out of business let 's say for example they need $ to make a living on it so they lose 5.00 $ on every insured customer one in 235 customers has no insurance and his price is calculated as + 235 5.00 = $ so his bill covers the losses for all insured under payers all numbers are examples made up to illustrate the math the provider does my typically comes between 800 and 1400 and gets reduced to around 20 so the numbers are not completely off the ratio and concept works for doctors and hospitals the same just not as significant a difference

overall since gold has value in any currency and is sort of the ultimate reserve currency why would anyone want to currency hedge it because gold is mostly priced in usd you currency hedge it to avoid currency risk and be exposed to only the price risk of gold in usd   hedging it does n't mean less speculative it just means you wo n't take currency risk edit responding to op 's questions in comment what happens if the usd drops in value versus other major currencies do you think that the gold price in usd would not be affected by this drop in dollar value use the etf $ gld as a proxy of gold price in usd the correlation between weekly returns of $ gld and us dollar index measured by major world currencies since the etf 's inception is around what this says is that gold may or may not be affected by usd movement it 's certainly not a one way movement there are times where both usd and gold rise and fall simultaneously is n't a drop in dollar value fundamentally currency risk per investopedia currency risk arises from the change in price of one currency in relation to another in this context it 's referring to the eur usd movement the bottom line is that if gold price in dollar goes up 2 this etf gives the european investor a way to bring home that 2 or as close to that as possible

that may be true but what will happen is that every carrier raises prices in an oligopoly it will be an opportunity to act as an so maybe after a while costs will be driven down but in the short it will probably only raise prices and also it creates a situation where the a service that was previously accessible to all customers will now only be available to the ones willing to pay whatever the cost of an actual human behind the telephone is   so in the short run it will only increase telecom costs also since having a phone or internet in something you can just opt out of everyone will be more or less forced to accept this practice again the oligopoly is where can find the cause

jamie dimon calling bitcoin a fraud for price is hilarious considering jp morgan literally got bailed out by us tax dollars for investing in trash mortgage loans ok   knocks aside i 'm just buying low the problem with financial analysis on bitcoin is that inevitably financiers do n't know anything about computer science and they are n't in the business of making applications bitcoin is an application of an interesting concept the distributed ledger and the ability to have a distributed ledger verify and lock the ledger the problem with this analysis is that he does n't have application knowledge to infer the positive externalities of having a distributed ledger and most of those use cases for the applications are in their infancy or have n't been though of yet blockchain is an idea that can later power other tools it 's like when the microsoft ceo said apps are n't useful on phones he did n't see the big picture because the use cases were n't defined yet and the same thing is going on here we have n't really fleshed out all the possible use cases of a distributed ledger with a decentralized oracle   does it work for payments yes bitcoin is proof of that and the fact that it 's been bailed out a total of zero times by american taxpayers is so far a strong indicator that it works are there other applications that are being developed yes are there some applications out there that are absolute shit yes are there some applications out there that are absolute gold yes

to be completely honest i think that a target of 10 15 is very high and if there were an easy way to attain it everyone would do it if you want to have such a high return you 'll always have the risk of losing the same amount of money option 1 i personally think that you can make the highest return if you invest in real estate and actively manage your if you do this well with short term rental and/or airbnb i think you can make healthy returns but it will cost a lot of time and effort which may diminish its appeal think about talking to your estate agent to find renters or always ensuring your airbnb place is in good nick so you get a high rating and keep getting good customers if you 're looking for passive income i do n't think this is a good choice also make sure you take note of 's point of costs no matter what you plan for your costs will always be higher than you think think about water damage a tenant that breaks things doesn't take care of stuff etc option 2 i think taking a loan is unnecessarily risky if you 're in good financial shape as it seems unless you 're gon na buy a house with a mortgage and live in it option 3 i think your best option is to buy bonds and shares you can follow 's 100 minus your age rule which seems very reasonable personally i invest all my money in shares because that 's how my father brought me up but it 's really a matter of taste both can be risky though bonds are usually safer i think i should note that you can not expect a return of 10 or more because as everyone always says if there were a way to guarantee it everyone would do it you say you do n't have any idea how this works so i 'd go to my bank and ask them you probably have access to private banking so that should mean someone will be able to sit you down and talk you through also look at other banks that have better rates and/or pretend you 're leaving your bank to negotiate a better deal if i were you i 'd invest in blue chips big international companies listed on the main dax ftse 100 dow jones or passively managed mutual funds etfs that track these just remember to diversify by country and industry a bit note i would not buy the vehicles plans that my bank no matter what they promise and they promise a lot suggest because if you do that then the bank always takes a cut off your money tldr do nt expect to make 10 15 on a passive investment and do what a lot of others do shares and bonds also make sure you get a lot of peoples opinions

you might want to read about about the coase theorem   in law and economics the coase theorem attributed to ronald coase describes the economic efficiency of an economic allocation or outcome in the presence of externalities the theorem states that if trade in an externality is possible and there are no transaction costs bargaining will lead to an efficient outcome regardless of the initial allocation of property rights in practice obstacles to bargaining or poorly defined property rights can prevent bargaining this is similar to what you are asking each country has an endowment of gold and they must create a set amount of money to represent their endowment of gold this will establish an exchange rate if i have 5 tons of gold and you have 5 tons and i print 10 dollars and you print 20 then one of my dollars is worth two of your dollars   thus the amount of money is not   it 's the exchange rate between the countries if all the nations know each other 's gold endowment then we will have a perfect exchange rate if we do n't then currency printing will vary but arbitrage should drive it to an accurate price   gold and diamonds are both valuable in part due to scarcity but gold has been used as a measure of value because it 's been historically used as a medium of exchange people just realized that swapping paper was safer and cheaper than physically transporting gold but the idea of gold as a measure of value is present because that 's how it 's always been nobody creates these procedures but organizations like the imf ecb fed reserve etc implement monetary policy to regulate the money supply and arbitrage drives exchange rates to fair values

for the type of market neutrality you desire free from crash risk it 's best to hedge the shares with covered calls when implied volatility is expensive and puts when implied volatility is cheap with the nearest at the money expirations   a put only strategy can be very expensive and should only be used with the longest term options available since they can cost many tens of per year securities become almost perfectly correlated during a crash therefore market crash risk of one security is essentially equal to the market crash risk so hedging the security itself makes a position market neutral for crash risk this strategy will have intermittent opportunity cost risk in the form of slower returns during market expansion to pay for smaller losses during a crash however the expected long run return hedged this way should be greater than the underlying 's expected long run return with less volatility

i 'd suggest buying a used car for cash car loans are a bad idea i bought my last car a few years ago for $ 8k off of craigslist and it is still running great make sure you get a car checked out by a mechanic before buying usually they 'll drop it off at a mechanic you want to have take a look or perhaps just go with you my general rule is to not take out loans for anything which decreases in value so a home mortgage would be fine a car loan is not a great plan buy cash and save for the next purchase if you buy a decent used corolla or other small import car you can get it for $ 8k it will likely last a few years at least that could end up costing you less than $ 200 per month total or less much better deal in the long run

the value will certainly fluctuate up and down but on average gain more than a savings account but so long as you have enough liquid assets for emergencies then yes it 's a perfectly good alternative to savings accounts how risky in general are index income funds how are you defining risk if you mean probability that i 'll lose it all then it 's virtually zero   if you mean how much the value can fluctuate then it 's certainly not risk free but it has less volatility that individual stocks   if you take the s&p 500 as a proxy you might expect the change in value over any given year to fluctuate between -30 like 2008 and + 40 with an average change of around 8 there will be funds that have less volatility but produce less return and funds that have more volatility but higher average returns

you can perfectly well manage their wealth without transferring their money into your account first just make them open their own account on their name then ask them for credentials and then manage their money from within their own account that way everyone will be taxed according to their wealth which is probably advantageous but you probably have to help them with the paperwork and it is clear at every time what belongs to whom and your relatives can at every time access their wealth these are big advantages for them this keeps you at the role of an adviser a very active one though which should have almost zero legal ramifications for you unless you try to deceive your relatives you may want to shift wealth between accounts to minimize tax burdens but that comes at the risk that should the family relations get worse this might result in anger you could open up a registered society all members getting shares and voting rights making you the ceo but that should be a lot of paperwork and maybe only a good idea for large amounts of money if you decide to transfer money between accounts of different persons this is like a gift it might invoke a gift tax in your area all in all i strongly advise you to make them all open up their own accounts and then just operate the accounts and manage their wealth in their name sell it to them as the solution that retains them maximum ownership

as a general rule of thumb on average you 'll gain a similar amount of total money over time whether you start withdrawing early or not yes you get less money on each check but you 're also going to get more checks a whole since it 's based on how long you live   i personally do n't try and adjust how i manage my money based on what decisions the government might make but i also am fairly young so do n't quite have the heightened concerns regarding social security others might have i 've pretty much always lived and invested assuming it was n't going to be there at all by the time i retire

as littleadv says if you 're a sole proprietorship you do n't need to file a 1099 for money you pay yourself you certainly will need to file a schedule c or schedule e to report the income and do n't forget se to pay social security taxes on the income if you made a profit if your company is a corporation then i 'm not a tax lawyer here but i think the   corporation would need to file a 1099 for the money that the corporation pays to you assuming that the amount is above the threshold that requires a 1099 that 's normally $ 600 but it 's only $ 10 for royalties

wikipedia level definitions are not an argument   you 're also conflating terms you do n't understand   obligations issued by the us government are backed by the full faith and credit of the government as is its physical currency   this is not the same as every electronic dollar in every bank account comprising the money supply   money is accepted by convention and by government fiat   now i know you do n't understand the nuance of what i just said so i look forward to your confused and mixed up answer which will be a blend between whatever white you can lift off a money 101 website coupled with a c level community college education   hahaha but seriously thanks for letting me know about fractional reserve banking by simply on its definition   true insights there my friend   anyway when a bank lends out money funds above the reserve are created out of thin air   the bank gives you a whole lot of full faith and credit apparently by your understanding and if you do n't pay them then they get your car house non exempt assets in bankruptcy etc   my point is that it is an exorbitant privilege which if thought about for more than two seconds and without an authority boot attitude is pretty fucked up   the reserve ratio is n't just about the assets kept on hand   it 's about where the 100 of those assets come from   ultimately they come from the federal reserve and not even the treasury

i do n't want to hate on those other comments but as a college student having a 4.0 and going to a target school are not realistic goals for everyone the best advice i would give you is to be passionate about the field it sounds dumb on its face but being involved in student investment clubs funds or competing in investment competitions are great ways to get exposure and meet people in the field while building your resume internships are incredibly important because that 's where you prove to yourself and others that you are a capable person    you also have a lot of options ahead of you you can do research client facing roles cfp and even corporate finance i was n't a finance major but i spent 3 years in college working in our student managed investment fund and it absolutely paid off now doing corporate finance you have to want to learn and grow it 's not realistic for a college student with limited resources to get your cfa level 1 or series exams especially if it does n't suit your field be open to different types of jobs and build relationships with your professors who are well connected it does help to have stellar grades and it helps to be at a top school but our state school has put kids on the street you just have to be hungry and realistic about your talents and passion    good luck to you

not all miles carry the same amount of risk a survey by progressive indicated that accidents are most likely to occur within 5 miles of home and 77 of accidents occur within 15 miles of home only 1 of accidents occurred 50 or more miles from home that 's from 2002 but it seems unlikely to have changed much since the miles closest to your home carry more risk they cost more and low mileage discounts reflect that there are per mile insurance options in a few states which could save you money but they do constant monitoring via that device and other insurers offer discounts if you accept their monitoring either in perpetuity or for a limited period of time   without monitoring insurers do n't know if that 4,000 miles of driving is spread into a few mid day trips each week or maybe you 're doing all that driving from midnight to 4 am on weekends far more likely or from 5 during accidents far more likely personally i save ~10 by being a low mileage driver and am currently in the middle of a 90-day monitoring so might go lower but given that accidents are far more likely close to home 10 feels pretty significant and appropriate

there are two obvious cases in which your return is lower with a heavily leveraged investment if a $ 100,000 investment of your own cash yields $ 1000 that 's a 1 return if you put in $ 50,000 of your own money and borrow $ 50,000 at 2 you get a 0 return after factoring in the interest as above if you buy an investment for $ 100,000 and it loses $ 1000 that 's a -1 return if you borrow $ 100,000 and buy two investments and they both lose $ 1000 that 's a -2 return

i found this article to clarify some of the issues one point raised is that the concession can be thought of as getting tax exemption for the closing costs which normally are not allow i 'm not sure i follow this logic since you can only deduct the interest not the principal i asked a lender and he verified you can only spend the concession money on closing costs i think if your closing costs are less than 1 of the loan its probably not worth it to go for a concession over the price reduction with interest rates so low its also not cost effective to buy down points on the loan this should limit most of your closing costs

q will i have to submit the accounts for the swiss business even though i m not on the payroll and the business makes hardly any profit each year i can of course get our accounts each year but they will be in swiss german you will have to submit on your income from the business   the term partnership refers to a specific business entity type in the u.s.   i 'm not sure if you 're using it the same way   in a partnership in the u.s. you pay income tax on your share of the partnership 's income whether or not you actually receive income in your personal account   there 's not enough information here to know if that applies in your case in the u.s. the partnership itself does not pay income tax it is a disregarded entity for tax purposes with the tax liability passed through to the partners as individuals q will i need to have this translated is there any format procedure to this will it have to be translated by my swiss accountants and if so which parts of the documentation need to be translated as regards language you will file a tax return on a u.s. form presumably in english   you will not have to submit your account information on any other form so the fact that your documentation is in german does not matter   the only exception that comes to mind is that you could potentially get audited just like anyone else filing taxes in the u.s. in which case you might need to produce your documentation   that situation is rare enough that i would n't worry about it though   i 'm not sure if they 'd take it in german or force you to get a translation i was told that if i sell the business and property after i a that i will be liable to 15 tax of the profit i 'd made i also understand that any tax paid on selling in switzerland will be deducted from the 15 q is this correct the long term capital gains rate is 15 for most people at very high incomes it is 20   it sounds like you would qualify for long term held for greater than 1 year capital gains in this case although the details might matter there is a foreign tax credit but i 'm not completely sure if it would apply in this case if forced to guess i would say that it does   if you search for foreign tax credit and irs you should get to the information that you need pretty quickly i will effectively have all the paperwork for this as we 'll need to do the same in switzerland but again it will be in swiss german q would this be a problem if its presented in swiss german even in this case you will not need to submit any of your paperwork to the irs unless you get audited   see earlier comments

i 'm going to offer a contrarian answer depending on how big the jackpot is i would suggest that your best bet might be the annuity over the lump sum not because of math but because of behavior   let 's say that you are looking at a jackpot of hundreds of millions and the annuity option is tens of millions each year for me even the annual payment of the annuity is more money than i can even comprehend do i trust myself to handle the lump sum no i have no experience with that kind of money nor does anyone i know by taking the annuity option i allow myself to figure it out a piece at a time if i make a mistake by choosing the wrong advisor or spending more than i should i can learn my lesson and do better with next year 's payment   there are too many stories of past lottery winners who blow it all early and end up broke the annuity option protects you from yourself   but you do n't have to take my word for it new york times jan 12 2016 dear winner take our advice and take the annuity

ultimately money derives its value from being spend on a good or service investing it is an act of denying your present self a good or service so that your future self can obtain hopefully more goods or services investing is a sensible and responsible default position but you clearly have passed the point at which the opportunity cost of the dollar not spent today is greater than its benefit in the future not all dollars are the same remember that money is a temporary store of value but you have to spend it to realize that value in your search learn about the psychology of money what are you saving it for how much do you want left over when you die if you die tomorrow will you regret not having spend a little more i 'm sorry to get morbid on you but saving for the future requires answering the question how long and it 's never forever this may be tangential but it shaped my behaviour towards money nonetheless frank on the psychology of time i would hazard a guess and say that you land in the future oriented camp

you do n't have to create a paypal account in order to buy from a merchant that uses paypal for processing their payments   you can use your credit card just like with any other purchase creating a paypal business account is as you say mainly for businesses wanting to accept payments not make them   paypal does n't require you the customer to have an account just to make a payment to a merchant   we have dozens of customers a day make purchases through us using our paypal account we 're small and for them the main attraction to using paypal to pay us is that paypal has pretty good security and offers some very good customer protections against fraud   they do n't have to create a paypal account just to pay us though when you create a paypal business account you link a bank account to it that they verify then they issue you a paypal mastercard which is a debit card that links to your paypal account   when you make purchases if the funds are in your paypal account because for instance you 're using paypal as your merchant processor then the payment is deducted from that   if there 's no money in your paypal account then paypal simply debits the bank account you linked with them no differently than if you were to use your bank 's debit card in this instance if you do n't plan to use paypal for merchant processing then there 's no real reason to open a business account   it does n't have any advantages over your bank 's debit card and imho just adds another layer of complexity and paperwork to your accounting for no identifiable benefit i hope this helps good luck

the money is transferred through an electronic funds transfer which is an umbrella term that encompasses wire transfers direct debits etc the application form for key trade bank the only place i can find that uses that exact phrasing lists a swift number this usually indicates that the transfer of funds is done through an international wire transfer   in the most basic sense the process works like this key trade bank uses the swift number to notify your current bank of the transfer   your bank instructs the settlement bank e.g. the central bank of your country where your bank is located to transfer funds to key trade   if key trade is in another country from your current country your central bank will send money to the central bank where key trade is located which will in turn send the money to key trade otherwise your central bank deposits the money into the account that key trade also has with them and the transfer is complete

edited to incorporate the comments elsewhere of assuming apparently incorrectly that duration is time to maturity first note that the question does not mention the coupon rate the size of the regular payments that the bond holder will get each year   so let 's calculate that consider the cash flow described   you pay out 1015 at the start of year 1 to buy the bond   at the end of years 1 to 5 you receive a coupon payment of x.   also at the end of year 5 you receive the face value of the bond 1000   and you are told that the pay out equals the money received using a time value of money of 4.69 so if we use the date of maturity of the bond as our valuation date we have the equation maturity + future value of coupons = future value of bond purchase price 1000 + x 1 + = 1015 ^ 5 solving this for x we obtain   the coupon rate is   you will receive at the end of each of the five years    now we can take this fixed schedule of payments and apply the new yield rate to the same formula above   only now the unknown is the price paid for the bond y. 1000 + 1 + 1 = y ^ 5 solving this equation for y we obtain y =

putting your money in the same account as a parent could cause many problems with very few benefits one of you would have to claim the dividends and capital gains that the fund might earn during the year that person might have to pay taxes on those earnings you would have to find some way of figuring out how to split the costs and somebody would have to reimburse the other if one person wanted to sell figuring out which shares to sell would be much more complex if these are retirement accounts which have maximum limits based on income and the use of other retirement accounts there is no way to co mingle the funds even if it was possible to combine the funds the reality is that two people decades apart have different investment goals and risk tolerances so the types of investments that a great for one are very poor for the other the only benefit is that an existing account would already have more than the minimum investment so some investments would be easier to make also some investments have lower fees if you meet specific investment thresholds if the fund increases in value by 10 in a year it does n't make a difference if the value at the start of the year was 10 k or 100k. the rate is the same the benefits are minor and few the drawbacks are many and some situations make it impossible to co mingle the funds

the answer is simple you can generally claim a deduction for an expense if that expense was used to derive an income of course social policy sometimes gets in the way and allows for deductions where they usually would n't be allowed your rent is not tax deductible because this expense is not used to derive your income if however you were working from your home example you had a home based business and you dedicated a part of your home for your work say an office then part of your rent may then become tax deductible

short term the game is supply demand and how the various participants react to it at various prices on longer term prices start to better reflect the fundamentals within something like week to some month or two if there has not been any unique value affecting news then interest options market swing traders and such play bigger part with intraday the effects of available liquidity become very pronounced the market makers have algos that try to guess what type of client they have and they prefer to give high price to large buyer and low price to small buyer as intraday trader has spreads and commissions big part of their expenses and leverage magnifies those instead of being able to take advantage of the lower prices they prefer to stop out after small move against them in practise this means that when they buy low that low will soon be the midpoint of the day and high etc if they are still holding on buy and sell are similar to long call or long put options position and options are like insurance they cost you also the longer the position is held the more likely it is to end up with someone with ability to test your margin if you 're highly leveraged and constantly making your wins from the same source   risk management is also issue the leveraged pros trade through a company not sure if they 're able to open another such company and still open accounts after the inevitable

finding the optimal solution and even defining what optimal is would probably take a lot of searching of all the possible combinations of stocks you could buy given that you ca n't buy fractional shares but i 'd guess that a simple greedy algorithm should get you close enough for any given portfolio state look at which stock is furthest below the target size e.g. in your example s3 is 3.5 away whereas s1 is only 3.1 away and s2 is over sized then decided to buy one stock of s3 recalculate the current proportions and repeat until you ca n't buy more stocks because you 've invested all the money if you have to pay a transaction fee for each kind of stock you purchase you might want to calculate this in larger lot sizes or just avoid making really small purchases

i understand you 're trying to ask a narrow question but you 're basically asking whether you should time the market   you can find tons of books saying you should n't try it and tons more confirming that you can   both will have data and anecdotes to back them up   so i 'll give you my own opinion market timing especially in a macro sense is a zero sum game   your first thought should be i 'm smarter than the average person the average person is an idiot   however remember that a whole lot of the money in the market is not controlled by idiots   you really need to ask yourself if you can compete with people who get paid to spend 12 hours a day trying to beat the market stick with a mid range strategy for now   your convictions are n't and should n't be strong enough at the moment to do otherwise   but if you ca n't resist i say go ahead and do what you feel   regardless of what you do your returns over the next 3 years wo n't be life changing   in the meantime learn as much as you can about investing and keep a journal of your investment activity to keep yourself honest

if i buy 10 stocks on monday and sell the same on tuesday different trading day would i be considered a day trader no it is only counting if you buy something and then sell that same something during the same trading session and that counter only lasts for 5 days things that happened outside of that time period get removed from the counter if the counter reaches a number three to five depending on the broker then you are labelled as a pattern day trader and will have your trading capabilities severely restricted unless you have an account size greater than $ 25,000

companies often provide cafeteria or catering services to employees tax free at subsidized rates i 'll use cafeteria as an illustration the irs says that in order to avoid lunch being taxed as income the employees must pay the direct costs of the lunch food and labor in addition to those costs add two more items to come up with the total tab overhead the cost of renting the space and of course profit the company can waive the last two and charge employees only materials and labor that 's why subsidized cafeteria food can cost as little as half of what it would cost elsewhere

afaik they use entirely different lte frequencies in japan and the us hence the issues with the new ipad being lte in the states but not here     additionally there are still japanese manufacturers who are big brands in the japanese market but more or less unheard of overseas   so there 's likely to be relatively limited scope for economies of scale regarding handsets   sure with a limited number of handsets e.g. the iphone you may be able to place a larger order but when was the last time you heard of a network operator dictating terms to apple   that 's why only softbank had the iphone at launch because they were the only one willing to cede to apple 's high pricing demands     and that 's before you even get into language related issues   as far as lte equipment goes it depends on suppliers and whether the of ordering equipment for two very different territories thousands of miles apart with very different geography will bear a lot of fruit   as for people traveling between japan and the states its such a tiny proportion of customers it would barely make a dent   and most corporate customers historically favor anyway and given japanese business culture are unlikely to change any time soon   in a nutshell the synergies may not be as strong as it first seems

i would say the japanese economy is a bit different to greece it 's still quite large it 's been in recession or stagnation for the last 2 decades or so   one major problem for japan is its aging population japan has the oldest population in the world average is 42 this is a problem in terms of old age pensions decreasing workforce etc in addition to low birth rates many young people have fewer kids or just none at of the grass   while that does n't sound good the difference with greece is they 're close to bankruptcy japan is n't also japan gets to somewhat control their currency or at least their economy is the primary thing affecting the currency unlike greece which is in a monetary union and so are not able to devalue their currency

as suggested tracking spending is a great start   but how about this   figure out the payment needed to get to zero debt in a reasonable time 24 months perhaps if that 's more than 15 of your income maybe stretch a tiny bit to 30 months if it 's much less send 15 to debt until it 's paid then flip the money to savings   from what 's left first budget the needs rent utilities etc whatever you spend on food try to cut back 10   there is no budget for entertainment or clothes the whole point is one must either live beneath their means or increase their income you 've seen what can happen when the debt   in reality with no debt to service and the savings growing you 'll find a way to prioritize spending some months you 'll have to choose dinner out or a show i agree with keith 's food bill $ for 3 of us months with a holiday and large guest list throws that off of course

nothing can be done well in the past the courts were the mechanism by which something was done and that something was called consent decree where the court would simply order the monopolistic practices to stop immediately or the offenders could instead pay for instance a million dollar per day fine until they came into compliance xerox for instance only opened the specs of what we now call the pc under a court ordered consent decree    this nationwide system of trust busting was dismantled under reagan with the creation of the court of appeals of the federal circuit which was created out of nothing   in order to strengthen so called intellectual property rights the term intellectual property in turn had been crafted by a group of patent lawyers decades earlier in order to promote monopolistic practices    things could go back to the way they were with a major of the court system but as in the 30s it will probably take a sustained economic depression and complete collapse of the stock market to make that happen with mechanisms like the 401 k which also emerged in the reagan era that becomes more and more difficult to achieve without enormous suffering and loss of wealth by typical households

i work in the fsa hsa industry and just wanted to point out that if your wife has a medical fsa you can not contribute to an hsa whether or not you are covered by her medical insurance plan the only exception to this per the rules is if your wife 's employers plan limits the medical fsa benefit to the employee your wife which i can say from experience is extremely rare it 's possible but i 've never personally seen an employer with this in their plan document so better check first to be sure the fsa is restricted to your wife only you have to understand the fsa to know why this is true unless restricted your wife can use her medical fsa for herself her spouse and any tax dependents meaning whether or not she uses the fsa for your eligible expenses you still have 1st dollar coverage from the fsa making you in eligible to open and contribute to an hsa until the end of the plan year and possibly grace period if her employer has one in place and she does not spend her funds by the end of the plan year hope this helps if your still not sure talk to a tax professional which i am not but do advise employers and participants on both hsas and fsas

update here is a message the seller just sent me does this make sense   i spoke with my bank again and they explained it a little better for me i guess how it works is they will print out something for you that is called an affidavit in lieu of title that states they are no longer the holder and to release it to you you then take that to the dol and they get it put in your name he says that 's how they do it all the time when we get to the bank the teller just verifies the check and i deposit it and they release the funds to pay off the account and that 's when you would get the paperwork you would be there for the whole process so nothing is sketchy sorry it 's such a pain i did n't understand how that worked we 've never sold a car with a loan on it before

in usa if you take a personal loan you will probably get rates between 8 19 it is better that you take a loan in india as home loan rates are about is the lowest offered by sbi   this might not be part of the answer but it is safer to hold usd than indian rupees as india is inflating so much that the value of the rupee is always going 1970 when you could buy 1 dollar for 7 rupees there might be price fluctuations where the rupee gains against the dollar but in the long run i think the dollar has much more a personal opinion and since you are taking a home loan i am assuming it will be somewhere between 10 20 years so you would actually save a lot more on the depreciating rupee than you would pay interest yes if you can get a home loan in usa at around 4 it would definitely be worth considering but i doubt they will do that since they would not know the actual value of the property coming to answer your question getting a personal loan for 75k without keeping any security is highly unlikely what you can do since you have a good credit score is get a line of credit for 20 25k as a backup and use that money to pay your emi only when absolutely required that way you build your credit in the united states and have a backup for around 2 years in india in case you fail to pay up moreover line of credits charge you interest only on the amount you use cheers

first i want to say that i agree with you that the rule   now on to economics   i will try to address each of your points as best i can    -the lack of demand is aggregate demand   this includes individual spending corporate spending government spending and exports   individual spending is down as pointed out   whether or not that is a good thing let 's reserve for later   next corporate spending is at all time lows   the s&amp;p 500 companies have the highest cash on hand ever in history   nobody is hiring   bond issues are down   mergers are down   capital is being hoarded   third up government spending   we all know this is up but do n't rush to add in the fed and bailouts to this number lets just consider it what the government actually spends into the economy   lastly exports are down because the rest of the world is hurting   so 3 out of the 4 components of aggregate demand are down and there are those that want the government to stop spending as well which would make it a straight 4 for 4    rates   well if you know that aggregate demand is down that tells you everything you need to know about interest rates   if companies were borrowing hiring expanding opening plants etc etc etc then interest rates would naturally rise due to loans being made to these companies   the fact is that companies are not expanding and loans are not being made due to no demand for them   bank reserves are at an all time high   nobody is willing to take out a loan to grow their business right now because aggregate demand is down so hard   at the same time the stock market spooked everyone and on top of it people are paying down their home mortgages at a record pace   so you have record low demand for loans and record high supply of capital money so yeah interest rates are at 1 effectively 0 if you are in a savings account    the currency to boost the exports component of the aggregate demand curve seems like it could work but since the rest of the world is also hurting who are you going to export to   the corporate sector is n't going to start spending until the consumer is on their feet   the consumer is n't going to start spending until they get jobs   do you see the chinese finger trap here   the only way out of the is to increase government spending and history has shown that it works

credit scores are not such a big deal in canada as they are in the us and even some european countries   one reason for this the social insurance number sin number is n't used for so many purposes like the social security number ssn in the us   the sin number is n't even required to get credit but with some exceptions it is needed to open an interest bearing savings account so that the interest income can be reported   you can refuse to provide the sin number to most private companies canada also has one of the highest per capita immigration rates of any large country so new are expected and services are geared up for them   most of the banks offer special deals for new canadians   you should get a credit card even if just a secured credit card through them with one of these offers to start a credit file anyway but there 's no need to actually use it much   auto paying a utility bill through the card and paying it off in full each month is one way to keep it active   no need to ever pay any interest most major apartment rental firms will expect a good proportion of their renters to be new to canada so should have procedures in place to deal with it such as a higher deposit   you should not give them your sin for a credit check even when you 're more established same for utilities they can just charge a higher deposit if they ca n't credit check you   for private landlords everything is negotiable but see the laws link at the end of this answer you will later need a credit rating for a mortgage on a house if not paying cash so it 's worth getting that one token credit card   useful for car rental also here 's a fairly complete summary of the laws on renting in canada which includes the maximum deposits that can be asked for and notice periods

finding statistics is exceedingly hard because the majority of traders lose money that is not only they do n't beat the markets not only they do n't beat the benchmark s&p 500 being used a lot as reference they just lose money finding exact numbers quality statistics and so on is very difficult finding recent ones is almost impossible with enormous effort i have found two references that might help make an idea one is very recent forex centered and has been prepared by a large finance group for the the central bank ecb it 's available on their website at an obscure download location the document is stated to be confidential but its download location has been disclosed to the public by cnbc i ca n't post cnbc 's link because i have just joined this stack exchange portal so i do n't have enough reputation you can find it by looking for their article about forex broker debacle due to the swiss central bank removing the eur chf peg at 1.20 the second is a paper about retail traders profitability statistics published by oxford university press and talks about stocks both documents focus on retail traders i strongly suggest you to immediately save those documents because they tend to disappear after a while we had a fantastic and complete statistics report made by a group of german banks in 2011 they pulled it off in 2012

your investment is probably in a collective investment trust these are not mutual funds and are not publicly traded i.e. they are private to plan participants in your company because of this they are not required to distribute dividends like mutual funds instead they will reinvest dividends automatically increasing the value of the fund rather than number of shares as with dividend reinvestment you mention the s&p 500 fund you have tracks closely to the s&p index keep in mind there 's two indexes you could be looking at without any new contributions your fund should closely track the total return version for periods 3 months or longer minus the expense ratio if you are adding contributions to the fund you ca n't just look at the start and end balances the comparison is trickier and you 'll need to use the internal rate of return look into the xirr function in excel google sheets are not strictly required to pay dividends but are strongly tax incentivized to do so and essentially all do

standard deviation is a mathematical term that is useful in many areas it can be considered a measure of how tight the data points are to the average if there is consistency in the measurement system then a point that is two standard from the average can be considered an outlier it does n't even need to be time based we can say that a child born weighing less than x pounds is more than 2 standard deviations below the average   using it to look at a price or an index value does n't make a lot of sense because many expect there to be long term growth for example you would never say that you will buy a new jacket for your child when they are two standard deviations above their average height you can say you will buy or sell a financial instrument when the p e ratio is 2 standard deviations from some average it could be the average of the long term history or the index or the sector you could do the same thing for earnings per share or many other business of financial statistics a standard deviation calculated from a time series assumes that the measurement will normally stay withing some bounds and that from those bounds is a sign of the right time to buy or sell

foreign stocks have two extra sources of risk attached to them exchange rate and political   exchange rate risk is obvious if i buy a stock in a foreign currency and there is a currency movement that makes that investment worth less i lose money no matter what the stock does this can be offset using exchange rate swaps this is ceteris paribus of course changes in exchange rate can give a comparative advantage to international and exporting companies that will improve the fundamentals and so increase the price of the stock relative to a local firm the economics of the firms in particular are not explored in this answer as it would get too complicated and long if i did political risk relates not only to the problems surrounding international politics such as a country deciding that foreign nationals may no longer own shares in their national industries or deciding to seize foreign nationals assets as happens in some areas your home country may also decide to apply sanctions to the country in which you are invested thus making it impossible to get your money back even though the foreign country will allow you to redeem them or sell diplomatic relations and trade agreements tend to be difficult there are further problems in lack of understanding of foreign countries laws tax code customs etc relating to investments and the necessity to find legal representation in a country you may never have visited if there are issues there is also a hidden risk in that as an individual investor you are not likely to be reading the local financial news for that country regularly enough to spot company specific issues arising by the time these issues get into international media its far too late as all of the local investors have sold out of their positions already the risks are probably no different if you have the time to monitor international relations and the foreign country 's news and have fx swaps in place to counteract fx risk as the funds and investment banks do but as an individual investor the time required is not feasible

this may vary some by the state but the general facts are consistent broadly the elements of check fraud typically are this means that not only do you have to have presented a check that is returned for insufficient funds but you must have known at the time that it would n't be honored    it must typically also be given for present consideration which is why the comments to the other answer correctly note that the post dated check scam cooked up by the payday loan folks should n't generally be relevant under these laws on the same site they note the cases that are clearly not present consideration so if i give you a check for $ 50 and it 's returned for nsf because i screwed up my bank accounts and had all my money in savings that 's probably not fraud   but if i decide i really want a tesla x and give tesla motors a check for $ 95,000 knowing i do n't have $ 95,000 that 's fraud how the prosecutor proves knowledge is probably beyond the scope of personal finance and money stack exchange though i imagine it tends to commonly be done so by showing the person does n't normally have that much money in their account

i agree with mrchrister about first considering how necessary the renovations are is it a nice to have or a need to have as well as the importance of consulting a realtor if you are selling your home as they will advise you wisely   for instance they might advise you to replace the with a neutral ceramic tile as you would be assured a better resale value on your dollar spent than if you were to replace the old with new or there are many types of renovations that simply do n't pay off and others that do provide good return on investment like intelligent kitchen and bathroom updates   i found this roi grid at which is pretty consistent with what i remember reading in the toronto star this spring top 10 renovations ~ average return    on investment painting and interior decorating = 73 kitchen renovations = 72 bathroom renovations = 68 exterior painting = 65 flooring upgrades = 62 window door replacement = 57 family room addition = 51 fireplace addition = 50 basement renovation = 49 furnace heating updating = 48 if you are selling your home and your realtor has suggested improvements they are probably necessary and not doing them might serve as an to quickly selling your home so factor in the potential costs of carrying your home for additional weeks months or worse overlapping mortage costs if it takes your home longer to sell and you end up owning two homes simultaneously for a bit as far as your question should you pay cash for or take out a loan one factor to consider if you live in canada is the home renovation tax credit which applies to that take place until feb 1 2010 and can deduct up to $ 1,350   so if you have to do a reno and yours qualifies for this tax credit and you wo n't have the cash before that deadline factor in the cost of borrowing vs. the $ 1,350 good luck

no it will have no negative impact on getting a mortgage you are building up a history with regular payments and are not carrying a balance on the card each month your ability to get a mortgage will ultimately be based on other things money saving expert has a good guide on what will affect your credit score a further discussion on the topic that backs up that what a mortgage company is interested in is affordability and a stable history they really do n't care about ratios   though might be spooked by almost maxed out cards sign of poor spending control or large unused limits too easy to go into bad debt

typically the power of capitalized interest would work in your favor and you could carry the loan paying it down while investing the original sum which would earn interest but you are n't going to get any sort of return to compare with 15 so pay off that loan immediately also contrary to popular belief and here paying off incurred balance on your credit card every month is responsible use of credit but it will not do much for your credit score the score ultimately means your ability to pay your bills and most importantly your willingness to pay interest i.e. revolving the borrowed money at least in the consumer market where the product they want you to buy is paying monthly interest charges

i would advise against this answering only the first part of question 1 borrowing and lending money among friends and family members can often ruin relationships   while it can sometimes be done successfully this is most likely not the case   all parties involved have to approach this uniquely in order for it to work   this would include your son 's future significant other   obviously you have done very well financially congratulations   your view for your son might be for him to pay you off asap    even after becoming a doctor continue to live like a student until the loan is paid off    his view might be more conventional get the car and house and pay off my loans before i am 50   he may start with your view but two years in he a woman that pressures him to be more conventional    my advice would be to give if you can afford to but if not do not lend   if you decide to lend then come up with a very clear agreement on the repayment schedule and consequences of non payment   you may want to see a lawyer for the rest of it interest payments received are taxable

i love the flat rate vat scheme it 's where you pay a percentage based on your industry an example might be computer repair services where you 'll pay 10.5 of your total revenue to the hmrc but you 'll be invoicing for vat at 20 still would definitely recommend registering for it since you 're expecting to cross the threshold anyway and like dumbcoder said you also get a first year discount of 1 so in the example above you 'd end up paying 9.5 vat on your turnover i personally found it a pain to invoice without vat my clients expected it so registering made sense regardless of the fact i was over threshold the tricky bit is keeping under the £ 150k turnover so you stay eligible for the flat rate it does get more complex otherwise

to sum up my question came from misunderstanding what cost basis applies to now i get it that it applies to stocks as physical entities consider a chain of buys of 40 stock a with prices $ qty 10 each time then irs wants to know exactly which stock i am selling and when i transfer stocks to different account that cost basis transfers with them cost basis is included in transfers so that removes ambiguity which stock is being sold on the original account in the example above cost basis of 20 stocks moved to a new account would probably be $ 1 x 10 and $ 4 x 10 i.e. fifo also applies to transfers

i have received a response from sipc confirming littleadv 's answer for a brief background the protections available under the securities    investor protection act are only available in the context of    a liquidation proceeding of a sipc member broker dealer and relate to    the custody of securities and related cash at the sipc member    broker dealer thus if a sipc member broker dealer were to fail at a    time when a customer had securities and/or cash in the custody of the    sipc member broker dealer in most instances it would be sipc 's    obligation to restore those securities and cash to the customer    within statutory limits that does not mean however that the    customer would necessarily receive the original value of his or her    purchase rather the customer receives the security itself and/or the    value of the customer 's account as of the day that the liquidation    sipc does not protect against the decline in value of any    security in a liquidation proceeding under the sipc may advance    up to $ 500,000 per customer including a $ 250,000 limit on cash in the    account please note that this protection only applies to the extent that you    cash or securities to a u.s. sipc member foreign broker    dealer subsidiaries are not sipc members however to the extent that    any assets including foreign securities are being held by the u.s.    broker dealer the assets are protected by sipc stocks listed on the    lse are protected by sipc to the extent they are held with a sipc    member broker dealer up to the statutory limit of $ 500,000 per    customer as i mentioned in the comments in the case of ib indeed they have a foreign subsidiary which is why sipc does not cover it rather they are insured by lloyds of london for such cases

if you deposit the money in your account it will count against the gift tax exclusion for you not your daughter as such you should open a bank account for your daughter   assuming she already has a social security number this will not be complicated   otherwise apply for one as mhoran notes before the end of the year the kind of account you should open depends on the purpose of the money but likely it should be opened as a uniform gift to minors act or uniform transfer to minors act account   this means it is your daughter 's account not yours but you designate one or more custodians who are the ones who can actually make withdrawals   any money in this account must be spent in your daughter 's interest but it 's not required to be spent with her approval even as an older child nor on a specific thing it 's not just college money like a 529 account is before you do so you should consider how to set up   some parents simply make themselves custodians some ask another relative to be custodian or joint custodian or even someone like a or close trusted friend   having a joint custodian is helpful if you feel like it may be challenging to not dip into the account if you had financial difficulties as both custodians must sign off on withdrawals finally you should consider whether you want this to be a simple bank account or whether you might want to consider something like vanguard or fidelity investment account   if it 's likely to contain over $ 10,000 or whatever the reduced no fee limit is at the investment firm you choose it may well be worth your while to do this as you can earn significant returns fairly safely assuming the money is intended for longer term use for college or other later in life uses note that for tax purposes this gift will count for 2016 taxes regardless of when you actually set up the account as you have constructively received the gift when the check was given to you   so there 's no rush to work this out before the end of the year you can still deposit it next year   however your daughter needs a ssn to be able to be claimed as a dependent on your taxes so that at least needs doing before the end of the year

and ach are a desperate try of the us banking system to get into the 21st century all eu countries and some others have direct deposits and transfers as the standard way of transferring money since about 20 years and since about 5 years it is cost free and one day across all the eu the rest of the world runs mostly country specific system as there is not that large a demand for cross country shifting and exchange rates are also an issue in any such transaction because they have different ways that work fine since decades other countries will consider the idea as a step backwards and will probably ignore it so your answer is none international companies work with banks in a different relationship than retail customers so they can do things you and me can not do depending on size and volume some large companies get a banking license and then handle their own stuff medium sized companies make favorable contracts with banks they are golden goose customers never an issue no brick and mortar presence needed banks love them or they simply suck up the transfer cost if you move millions who cares about a 40 $ fee small businesses whine and live with what they get

the formula you are looking for is pretty complicated it 's given here you might prefer to let somebody else do the grunt work for you this page will calculate the probability for you in your case you 'd enter standard and standard oh you did n't say what you 're paying on your debt let 's say it 's 6 i.e. .06 note that this page will give you the probability that the actual number will be less than or equal to the standard score enter all that and click the magic button and the probability that the investment will produce less than 6 is or 34 the handy rule of thumb is that the probability is about 68 that the actual number will be within 1 standard deviation of the mean 95 that it will be within 2 standard deviations and that it will be within 3 which is n't exactly what you want because you do n't want within but less than but you could get that by just adding half the difference from 100 for each of the above i.e. instead of 68 95 it would be 84 98 99.9 oh i missed that in a follow up comment you say you are paying 4 on a mortgage which you are adjusting to 3 because of tax implications probability based on mean and sd you gave of getting less than 3 is 26 i did n't read the article you cite i assume the standard deviation given is for the rate of return for one year if you stretch that over many years the sd goes down as many factors tend to even out so while the probability that money in a given say mutual fund will grow by less than 3 in one year is fairly high the 25 35 we 're talking here sounds plausible to me the probability that it will grow by an average of less than 3 over a period of 10 or 15 or 20 years is much less further thought there is of course no provably true formula for what makes a reasonable risk suppose i offered you an investment that had a 99 chance of showing a $ 5,000 profit and a 1 chance of a $ loss would you take it i would n't even though the chance of a loss is small if it happened i 'd lose everything i have is it worth that risk for the modest potential profit i 'd say no of course to someone who has a billion dollars this might be a very reasonable risk if it fails oh well that could really cut in to what he can spend on lunch tomorrow

to add to @keshlam 's answer slightly a stock 's price is made up of several components the only one of these that is known even remotely accurately at any time is the book value on the day that the accounts are prepared even   completed cashflows after the books have been prepared contain some slight unknowns as they may be reversed if stock is returned for example or reduced by unforeseen costs   future cashflows are based on amongst other things how many sales you expect to make in the future for all time exercise for the reader how many iphone will apple sell in even known future cashflows have some risk attached to them customers may not pay for goods a supplier may go into liquidation and so need to change its invoicing strategy etc estimating the risk on future cashflows is highly subjective and depends greatly on what the analyst expects the exact economic state of the world will be in the future investors have the choice of investing in a risk free instrument this is usually taken as being modelled by the 10 year us treasury bond that is guaranteed to give them a return to invest in anything riskier than the risk free instrument they must be paid a premium over the risk free return that they would get from that the risk premium is related to how likely they think it is that they will not receive a return higher than that rate calculation of that premium is highly subjective if i know the management of the company well i will be inclined to think that the investment is far less risky or perhaps riskier than someone who does not for example since none of the factors that go into a share price are accurately measurable and many are subjective there is no right share price at any time let alone at time of ipo each investor will estimate these values differently and so value the shares differently and their trading based on their ever changing estimates will move the share price to an level in comments to @keshlam 's answer you ask if there is enough information to work out the share price if a company buys out the company before ipo dividing the price that this other company paid by the relative ownership structure of the firm would give you an idea of what that company thought that the company was worth at that moment in time and can be used as a for market price but it will not and can not accurately represent the market price as other investors will value the firm differently by estimating the criteria above differently and so will move the share price based on their valuation

as for refinancing many institutions charge up front fees when doing any type of vehicle loan typically this is in the neighborhood of 1 the value of the loan with a floor of $ 100 although this may vary by lender however for the loan the be secured by the vehicle the principle value must be less than the collateral value in your case this means there is a collateral shortfall of $ 4,000 when working with a traditional bank you would have two options pay the difference up front reducing the principle value of the loan or obtaining a separate loan for the difference this separate loan would often have a higher interest rate unless you have some other form of collateral to secure it with i doubt carmax would do a separate loan all that being said if you plan on selling the vehicle within the next months do n't bother refinancing it wo n't be worth the hassle

you have a lack of credit history   lending is still tight since the recession and companies are n't as willing to take a gamble on people with no history the secured credit card is the most direct route to building credit right now i do n't think you 're going to be applicable for a department store card pointless anyways and encourages wasteful spending nor the gas card gas cards are credit cards funded through a bank just like any ordinary credit card only you are limited to gas purchases at a particular retailer although gas cards department store cards and other limited usage types of credit cards have less requirements in this post financial crisis economy credit is still stringent and a no history file is too risky for banks to take on having multiple hard inquiries wo n't help either you do have a full time job that pays well so the $ 500 deposit should n't be a problem for the secured credit card after 6 months you 'll get it back anyways just remember to pay off in full every month after 6 months you 'll be upgraded to a regular credit card and you will have established credit history

a dividend is a cash disbursement from the company   the value of the company goes down the same amount of the dividend so it is analogous to having money in a savings account and taking a withdrawal every month   obviously you are going to have less in the end than if you just kept the money in the account suppose that i own 10 different stocks and do n't reinvest dividends but keep them on account and each month or two as i add more money to invest either in one of my existing stocks or perhaps something new i add whichever dividend amount is currently available in cash to my new purchase would this strategy provide the same results roughly yes   reinvesting dividends is essentially buying more stock at the lower price which is a net zero effect in total balance   so if you invested in the same stocks yes you 'd be in the same place   if you invested in different stocks then you would have a performance difference depending on what you invested in the risk is the temptation to take the cash dividend and not reinvest it but take it in cash thereby reducing your earning power that is is there some particular reason that the brokers are recommending automatically reinvesting dividends as opposed to reinvesting them manually perhaps not always in the same item i 'd like to think that they 're looking after your best interest and they might be but the cynical part of me thinks that they 're either trying to keep your business by increasing your returns or there 's some uk regulation i 'm not aware of that requires them to disclose the effect of reinvesting dividends     £ 100 invested in the uk stock market since would have grown into just £ after adjusting for inflation this figure seems ludicrous to me   i have n't actually measured what the historical returns on the uk market are but that would mean an annualized return adjusted for inflation of just 0.5   either uk stocks pay a ridiculous amount of dividends or there 's something wrong with the math edit i still have not found a definitive source for the real uk market return but according to this inflation calculator £ 100 in would equate to almost £ 12,000 today for an average inflation rate of percent which would put the cagr of the uk market at about 4.9 which seems reasonable   the cagr with dividend reinvestment would then be about making dividend reinvestment a no brainer in the uk market at least

neither party gives an f about the consumer    the real issue is class action lawsuits in which the consumer gets shafted and the lawyers make a killing    real class action reform would not come in the form of favoring arbitration over lawsuits or vice versa but in requiring that fees in class action suits be paid in the same form as the payment to consumers and requiring that people opt in to join a class rather than having to actively opt out ending payment of fees in cash but consumers getting coupons which are only good one buys more of the alleged wrong doing products services would ensure consumers get a fair shake   this would hurt the lawyer lobby and thus most democrats and many republicans would never support it requiring people to opt in to class action suits rather than go through a long process of opting out would reduce the number of frivolous class action suits   again this would hurt the lawyer lobby and thus most of our politicians would n’t support it in short it comes down to most democrats favoring the lawyer lobby over the business lobby and most republicans favoring the opposite neither cares about the consumer citizen

well the article did mention that if you continually beat your you 're likely to get rejected in future which is hilarious but personally i have actually bet on sports and i 've found that it 's a fairly easy game to win at if you do n't go for bets with huge odds and i do n't think i 've ever placed a bet where after i lost and said what the hell just happened i only really bet on and soccer though so team sports may be a bit less prone to corruption from the   i 'm not saying i think this is a safe way to do business though i do n't think day trading is either i think they are both speculation i just think that sports betting has a lot more for a speculator to work with before they develop a strategy    for instance i always bet on new zealand winning a game their players line up as the top in their respective positions and their game strategy essentially has the rules of the game exploited to the maximum all of the data on this team based on their past performance is actually applicable to their future performance skilled players usually continue to be so up till a certain age skilled coaches who stay in their position mean no variation in team strategy that makes me feel confident that even though new zealand might lose a game here or there   that they will continue to be winners and even though the gains on their wins are n't much consistently winning with them over time builds up to a nice bit of profit    with day trading in the stock market so much of the variation in prices is due to non accounting fundamentals and even though historical data can be useful we know that investor sentiment secret information and a myriad of other factors mean that unless you are extremely experienced or have a natural eye for reading markets that most traders will lose i know developing strategies do work for some people but i think i 've seen it said on this sub a couple times that trading strategies work until they do n't i only speak as a uni student who has limited research beyond bloomberg articles etc but from what i can tell the majority of day traders lose money eventually and even with ai the profits are only when the capital input is extremely high    sports events ca n't really be by the confidence of supporters and yes corruption is rampant in sports as with every industry but at least the data you have tells a fairly good story about where the bets will head in the future

at your age i do n't think its a bad idea to invest entirely in stocks the concern with stocks is their volatility and at 40 + years from retirement volatility does not concern you just remember that if you ever want to call upon your 401(k for anything other than retirement such as a down payment on a home which is a qualified distribution that is not subject to early distribution penalties then you should reconsider your retirement allocations i would not invest 100 into stocks if i knew i were going to buy a house in five years and needed that money for a down payment if your truly saving strictly for a retirement that could occur forty years in the future first good for you and second put it all in an index fund an s&p index has a ridiculously low expense ratio and with so many years away from retirement it gives you an immense amount of flexibility to choose what to do with those funds as your retirement date approaches closer every year

if you want to buy once the price goes up to $ 101 or above you can place a conditional order to be triggered at $ 101 or above and for a limit order to entered to buy at $ 102 this will mean that as soon as the price reaches $ 101 or above your limit order will enter the market and you will buy at any price from $ 102 or below so if the price just trickles over $ 101 you will end up buying at around $ 101 or just over $ 101 however if the price gaps above $ 101 say it gaps up to $ then you will end up buying at around $ if the price gaps up above $ 102 say $ then your limit order at $ 102 will hit the market but it will not trade until the price drops back to $ 102 or below

it depends on many factors but generally the bid ask spread will give you an idea there are typically two ways to buy or sell a security with a limit order you would place a buy for 100 shares at $ then it 's easy in the worst case you will get your 100 shares at $ 30 each exactly you may get lucky and have the price fall then you will pay less than $ 30 of course if the price immediately goes up to say $ 35 nobody will sell at the $ 30 you want so your broker will happily sit on his hands and rake in the commission while waiting on what is now a hail mary ask with a market order you have the problem you mention the ticker says $ 30 but say after you buy the first 5 shares at $ 30 the price shoots up and the rest are $ 32 each you have now paid on average $ per share this could happen because there is a limit order for 5 at $ 30 and 200 at $ 32 you would have filled only part of that 200 you would be able to see these in the order book sometimes shown as bid ask spread or market depth however the order book is not law just because there 's an ask for 10k shares at $ 35 each for your $ 30 x stock does n't mean that by the time the price comes up to $ 35 the offer will still be up the guy or algorithm who put it up may see the price going up and decide he now wants $ 40 each for his 10k shares also people are n't obligated to put in their order maybe there 's a trader who intends to trade a large volume when the price hits a certain level like a limit order but he elected to not put in a limit order and instead watch the ticker and react in real time then you will see a huge order suddenly come in out of nowhere so while the order book is informative what you are asking is actually fundamentally impossible to know fully unless you can read the minds of every interested trader as others said in normal securities meaning traded at a major exchange especially those in the s&p500 you simply ca n't move the price the market is too deep you would need millions of dollars to budge the price and if you had that much money you would n't be asking here on a qa site you would have a professional financial advisor or even a team that specializes in distributing your large transaction over a longer time to minimize the effect on the market with stocks such as otc and especially worthless penny stocks with market caps of $ 1 mil or less what you say is a real problem you can end up paying multiples of the last ticker if not careful and you do have to be careful about it which is why you should n't trade penny stocks unless you know what you 're doing and if you 're asking this question here you do n't

a cfd broker will let you open a trade on margin as long as your account balance is more than the margin required on all your open trades if the required margin increases within a certain percentage of your account balance you will get a margin call if you then do n't deposit more funds or close losing trades out the broker will close all your trades note your account balance is the remaining funds you have left to open new trades with i always use stop loss orders with all my open trades and because of this my broker reduces the amount of margin required on each trade this allows me to have more open trades at the one time without increasing my funds effects of a losing trade on margin say i have an account balance of $ 2,000 and open a long trade in a share cfd of 1,000 cfds with a share price of $ 10 and margin of 10 the face value of the shares would be $ 10,000 but my initial margin would be $ 1,000 10 of $ 10,000   if i do n't place a stop loss and the price falls to $ 9 i would have lost $ 1,000 and my remaining margin would now be $ 900 10 of $ 9,000 so i would have $ 100 balance remaining in my account i would probably receive a margin call to deposit more funds in or close out my trade if i do n't respond the broker will close out my position before my balance gets to $ 0 if instead i placed a stop loss at say $ 9.50 my initial margin might be reduced to $ 500 as the price drops to $ i would have lost $ 400 and my remaining margin would now only be $ 100 with my account balance at $ 1,500 when the price drops to $ 9.50 i will get stopped out my trade will be closed and i would have lost $ 500 with my account balance still at $ 1,500 effects of a winning trade on margin say i have the same account balance as before and open the same trade but this time the price moves up if i do n't place a stop loss and the price goes up to $ 11 i would have made a $ 1,000 profit and my remaining margin will now be $ 1,100 10 of $ 11,000 so my account balance would now be $ 2,000 + $ 1,000 $ 1,100 = $ 1,900 if i had placed a stop loss at say $ 9.50 again and the price moves up to $ 10.50 i would have made a profit of $ 500 and my margin would now be $ 1,000 my account balance would be $ 2,000 + $ 500 $ 1,000 = $ 1,500 however if after the price went up to $ 10.50 i also moved my stop loss up to $ 10 then i would have $ 500 profit and only $ 500 margin so my balance in this case would be $ 2,000 + $ 500 $ 500 = $ 2,000 so by using stop losses as part of your risk management you can reduce the margin used from your balance which will allow you to open more trades without any extra funds deposited into your account

given that you have your emergency fund and no other high interest rate debts credit cards etc you will want to put down at least enough to not have to pay private mortgage insurance pmi   pmi is solely to protect the lender if you default   it has no benefit to you   it generally means that you will need at least 20 down   after that its a personal decision depending on what else you are going to do with the money   if you are the type to spend money frivolously if you have it it might make sense to put as much down as you can   if you think that you can invest the money and over the long term make more than the historically low mortgage interest rates it might make sense to invest    one thing to keep in mind is that money that you put into the down payment is relatively illiquid meaning that it is hard to turn back into cash   if you have large expenses in the future like health problems or college for the kids it might be better to have the money in something easier to turn into cash

hmmm i think it 's because in both cases you must pay for it up front before the positions are closed out you own nothing except the right to buy the stock re the call and the obligation to buy the stock re the short   you buy a call but must borrow the stock for which you must put some margin collateral and there is a cost to borrow you pay for that of course   i would n't call it lending though

like pointed out fundamentally you need to decide if the money invested elsewhere will grow faster than the interest you are paying on the loan in india the safe returns from fixed deposits is around 8 9 currently factoring taxes the real rate of return would be around 6 7 this is less than what you are paying towards interest the ppf gives around 9 with tax break if there are no other options and tax free interest the real return can be as high as 12 14 there is a limit on how much you can invest in ppf however this looks higher than your average interest the stock markets in long term 7 years averages give you around 15 returns but are not predictable year to year so the suggest from is valid you would need to see what are the high rate of interest loans and if they accept early repayment you should complete it asap if there are loans that are less than average say in the range of 7 8 you can keep it and pay as per schedule

internal billing might make sense in some businesses not so much in other personally i hate it with a passion i used to work for a big newspaper that is part of a huge media company with several other papers we shared a huge archive with newspaper clipping that go back for 140 years with a huge staff of excellent so this was a big asset every time i started on a new story my first call was to them usually they would provide me with an overview of about 20 relevant articles that saved me lots of time and got me quick up to speed    then the business consulting types came in and decided the archive needs to be a profit center in its own right billing each research request individually to each paper two months after they changed that we were ordered by our editors in chief not to use the archive as much as we used in fact most of them said that archive use was only permitted if all other ways or research had failed even the use of the electronic archive over our intranet was billed against us so the professional database had been built up over many decades it was ready and easy to use but we had to stick with google half a year later they started downsizing the archive because for some weird reason their workload had dropped by half the fact that our rate for errors in article had gone up was obviously absolutely unrelated

i 'd have a good look at how much anonymity an llc offers in your state as far as i 'm aware this varies from state to state out here in nv an llc owner 's privacy is supposedly fairly well protected but in other states not quite as much also keep in mind that while the llc offers some protection and i 'm a big advocate of this sort of structure if you 're taking larger risks that might have a big impact on your overall personal finances this might not apply to financing a lot of banks tend to require an llc 's owner to guarantee loans to an llc once they go over a certain amount or even in general do some research in this area because the llc would be worth less as a protective shield to you if you 're on the hook for the full amount of the loans anyway

we are talking at cross purposes but not for the reason you think    the debt might or might not be legally or practically recoverable the apple farmer and everything he owns might have been destroyed in the fire but the value created and destroyed was real and so was the money    you 're focusing on the debt owed to the shoemaker which is fine but your mistake is thinking that the debt is in some way meaningfully different from money which it 's not    most people who try to explain this difference would go off on a about how the overwhelming majority of money on deposit in banks and otherwise in circulation has never been printed or something which is okay but it 's not a very convincing argument because you 'll come back with something like but i can still withdraw all my money i can still cash all my checks etc   so instead i 'm going to try and break this down bear with me   the apple grower got a deer worth 12 loddars let 's set the interest part aside for the moment i got a pair shoes also worth loddars   forget about the shoe maker and the debt for a moment and focus on me i sold a deer and i used the proceeds to buy a pair of shoes    did i defraud anyone no i engaged in a fair transaction with willing partners on both sides    did i get paid for the deer obviously i did because i used the payment to buy shoes    what did i get paid with if not money    i can hear you saying yeah but the shoe guy    forget about the shoe guy when buy something on amazon marketplace and charge it on a credit card and then get paid via direct deposit and then have the money taken from your account to pay off the credit card company electronically is all of that real money of course it is    now what happens if you die before paying the the credit card bill does that mean that the money amazon paid to the seller does n't exist   does that mean that money paid by the cc company to amazon does n't exist how about the money in your bank account does that exist what if your employer once defrauded someone how about then    none of that money has ever been printed nobody got permission from ben bernanke to authorize these transactions but the money that changed hands was absolutely real even though it was nothing more than a series of promises    before you argue with me think this through all these account transfers ultimately boil down to promises by the end bank to produce cash when and if the account holder walks up to a teller and demands it the bank does n't have nearly enough cash to pay every account holder but they do have enough hopefully to keep their promises since they know they wo n't all be called in at once    nobody ever actually delivered a package of paper currency to cover these transactions everyone is just trading promises and passing those promises along to others it sounds crazy to say it that way but it is absolutely true    tally up your net worth or if that 's too ugly imagine up someone 's net worth who has a net worth chances are that you have never in your life seen that amount of paper cash certainly not in your physical possession so who has it it 's not like your local bank branch has a box marked with $ 400,000 in bills and coins sitting there    what you have is a series of promises    when your employer gets by credit card the customer promises to pay the credit card company who promises to pay your employer 's bank your employer then pays you with a direct deposit whereby his bank promises to pay your bank you then swipe an atm card and your bank promises to pay the grocery store 's bank who in turn sends a check to their supplier which is a promise that the grocery store 's bank will pay the supplier 's bank who in turn does the same with the farmer who does the same with his mortgage company who does the same to their investors who do the same to whoever they spend money with    occasionally one of them takes a cash withdrawal to tip the or stick in a birthday card or buy hot dogs at the ballpark or something but overwhelmingly we are all just spending and re spending promises and the remarkable thing is that overwhelmingly we keep them without anyone involved ever hiring a truck to deliver a of cash to the first person because there is no first person   all of that stuff is absolutely real money*.    i used the example of a wildfire but maybe it will be more useful to think of something that just changes in value for no obvious reason think of some article of clothing that has gone out of everyone was buying that stuff up until the day they stopped somewhere someone was stuck with the last warehouse full of hot pink parachute pants or whatever a month before when they were ordered from china or wherever they were worth $ 50 each now you ca n't give them away that value is gone it 's just vanished the money that bought the pants was real the pants are real but they are no longer worth anything    the person holding that warehouse full of pants now has to pay to either store of dispose of them they might start bouncing checks and breaking promises there was no fraud but there also might not be any way to recover the money owed $ 10 mm worth of parachute pants is now negative $ 1 mm worth of trash that has to be disposed of and mortgage obligations on the warehouse    i hope some of that makes sense it is really hard to explain this stuff via analogy and hypothetical and the kinds of terms that lawyers think in if you will forgive me for saying so

what is never mention was that even though top marginal taxes were high even extreme nobody paid them reagan lowered taxes but also made lots of people pay taxes that had never had to pay them before you could essentially write off losses from a business indefinitely failing to earn money on an investment was also a loss my dad on the advice of an irs tax auditor built a greenhouse and we started selling flowers but it was intended to never make any money it 's sole purpose was to reduce tax liability   these tax shelters were geared as personal tax shelters so what was done to service bigger business was to create what was called holding corporations these corporations would take investors money and basically just sit on it which could then be claimed as a loss but if these spread between bank interest cds paid on the holdings of this corporation and the interest cost of borrowing against those holdings hit a sweet spot they would build a strip mall or something similar this was the trigger to the boom bust when the feds raised lowered the interest rates and had a lot to do with stagflation at the time they would turn key the project and reinvest in holdings people could essentially bring their taxes down as much as they wanted even to zero it just meant that they had to put more money into holding corporations   when reagan changed the tax code to disallow these tax write offs he put lots of very wealthy people in the poor house overnight they went to bed one night and woke up with all their investors wanting their money i know a guy that operated a holding corporation that still cries about it to this day of course he has never really financially recovered either      the point is that what the tax code listed as your top marginal tax had no bearing on what you paid in tax prior to reagan 34 tax was way more than most of these people ever dreamed of paying in taxes prior to reagan

1- wells fargo does not own our current mortgage   they have bundled it and sold it as an investment 2- they make their money from servicing the loan   even if they only get $ 50 per month to service it 3 of our monthly payment that adds up to $ per month if they have a million homes under management   that is $ 600 million per year for each million homes being serviced 3- managing the escrow gets them additional profit because they can invest it and earn 2 3   if 1,000,000 homes have an average balance of $ 2,000 in their escrow accounts they can earn up to $ 60 per year or $ annually they make $ 1,000 every time they refinance the home   this is the approximate profit after paying real closing costs   refinance those million homes and you make a cool billion in profit 5- they also want to be sure that they keep us as a customer   by lowering our payment they decrease the likelyhood that we will refinance with someone else and we are less likely to default   not that they lose if we default because they do n't own the loan they make additional profit by paying off the old loan they do n't own it remember then packaging and selling the new mortgage   since they are selling it as a security they sell for future value meaning they sell our $ 200,000 loan for a valuation of $   this means that they sell for $ 200,000 plus some fraction of the additional $ 160,000   let 's say they only want a 10 premium of the $ valuation   that means they sell our $ 200,000 loan for $   they pocket $ 36,000   if they make a million of these transactions every year that is $ 36 billion dollars in profit so wells fargo refinances one million homes every year and they make $ initial profit for selling the loan with absolutely no risk plus $ for doing the loan $ annually to service the loan very little risk since it is being paid by the owner of the loan as a service fee if they can retain the loans for their entire life keep us from refinancing with someone else they can make $ that is billion dollars in servicing fees the profit they make in a refinance is much greater than the money then can make by holding the loan for 30 years

this is referred to as an hsa mistaken distribution an hsa mistaken distribution occurs when you take a distribution and later find out that it is not for a qualified medical expense   for example this could occur if you accidentally pay for a restaurant dinner with your hsa debit card   it can also occur if you take a distribution to pay for a medical expense but then are later reimbursed by insurance this is discussed in the instructions for irs forms 1099-sa and   note these forms are submitted by the hsa bank not the consumer so the instructions are addressed to them hsa mistaken distributions    if amounts were distributed during the year from an hsa because of a mistake of fact due to reasonable cause the account beneficiary may repay the mistaken distribution no later than april 15 following the first year the account beneficiary knew or should have known the distribution was a mistake for example the account beneficiary reasonably but mistakenly believed that an expense was a qualified medical expense and was reimbursed for that expense from the hsa the account beneficiary then repays the mistaken distribution to the hsa   you have until april 15 in the year following the refund to repay the hsa and avoid the extra tax and penalty that should be paid if you were to keep the distribution that was not ultimately used for medical expenses   when you send the money to the hsa bank you need to explicitly tell them that it is a mistaken distribution repayment so that they can report it to the irs correctly and it will not affect your contribution limits

some most credit cards have a way to get a one time use number if that is an available option for one of your cards that is probably the way to do the very risky transaction these numbers can be good for only one purchase or for multiple purchases with a single vendor this will limit your exposure because they wo n't have access to your entire account also review your fraud protections with your credit card with the single use number it wo n't matter if you use the electronic form or the email just make sure you keep the confirmation email or a screen capture of the form

this scheme does n't work because the combination of corporation tax even the lower tax plus the personal income tax does n't give you a tax advantage not on any realistic income i 've ever worked it out on anyway   prior to the 2014 tax year on lower incomes you could scrape a bit of an advantage but the 2013 budget changed the calculation for the tax credit on non eligible dividends so there should n't be an advantage anymore moreover if you were to do it this way by paying corporation tax instead of cpp you are n't eligible for cpp if you sit with a calculator for long enough you may figure out a way of saving $ 200 or something small but it 's a lot of paperwork for little if any benefit and you would n't get cpp i understand the money multiplier effect described above but the tax system is designed in a way that it makes more sense to take it as salary and put it in a tax deferred saving account i.e. an rrsp so there 's no limit on the multiplier effect like i said sit with a calculator if you 're earning a really large amount and are still under the small business limit it may make more sense to use a but that is the case regardless of using it as a tax shelter because if you 're earning a lot you 're probably running a business of some size the main benefit i think is that if you use a you can carry forward your losses but you have to be aware of the definition of an allowable business investment loss

not anytime soon i suspect but not necessarily for financial reasons i found this interesting including the link to the five tests but i think that this topic is only partially judged through financial eyes there 's a lot of political issues around this with national identity immigration issues already in the spot light as well as political aspirations if there will be a call in the near future to join the euro how would that reflect on the financial industry in the uk from a pr perspective and on the political leadership and how it managed the financial crisis   i believe that it is in the interest of all the people in the high positions to show the country getting back on track rather than making ground shaking moves but what do i know

in financial theory there is no reason for a difference in investor return to exist between dividend paying and non dividend paying stocks except for tax consequences   this is because in theory a company can either pay dividends to investors who can reinvest the funds themselves or reinvest its capital and earn the same return on that reinvestment and the shareholder still has the choice to sell a fraction of their holdings if they prefer to have cash that theory may not match reality because often companies pay or do n't pay dividends based on their stage of life   for example early stage mining companies often have no free cashflow to pay dividends they are capital intensive until the mines are operational on the other side longstanding companies may have no projects left that would be a   good fit for further investment and so they pay out dividends instead effectively allowing the shareholder to decide where to reinvest the money therefore saying dividend stock can be a proxy for talking about the stage of life + risk and return of a company saying dividend paying implies long standing blue chip company with relatively low capital requirements and a stable business likewise growth stocks non dividend paying implies new startup company that still needs capital and thus is somewhat unproven with a chance for good return to match the higher risk so in theory dividend payment policy makes no difference in practice it makes a difference for two reasons 1 you will most likely be taxed differently on selling stock vs receiving dividends which one is better for you is a specific question relying on your jurisdiction your current income and things like what type of stock how long you hold it for example in canada if you earn ~ < $ 40k your dividends are very likely to have a preferential tax treatment to selling shares for capital gains but your province and specific other numbers would influence this in the united states i believe capital gains are usually preferential as long as you hold the shares for a long time but i am not 100 on this without looking it up 2 dividend policy implies differences in the stage of life risk level of a stock this implication is not guaranteed so be sure you are using other considerations to determine whether this is the case   therefore which dividend policy suits you better depends on your tax position and your risk tolerance
# 140769
instead of a price chart can use a performance chart which is usually expressed as a percentage increase from the original purchase price   to factor in the dividends you can either add in all of your dividends to the final price or subtract the accumulated dividends from your cost basis the initial price

this is the best tl;dr i could make maybe been thinking about the productivity slump all reduced by 82 i 'm a bot gt just maybe if the labor market tightens and good workers are harder to find and wages rise that will be the impetus to get companies to consider more of those big ticket innovations that generate productivity growth   gt you could imagine the same thing happening if wages rose because of market forces that same fast food restaurant might invest in kiosks and robots if the labor market were so tight that no workers were willing to take the job for $ 10 if you look at long term patterns of productivity growth they roughly fit this idea that a booming job market tends to be followed by a productivity boom and that deep recessions are followed by productivity   gt in this way of thinking about productivity inventors and business innovators are always cooking up better ways to do things but it takes a labor shortage and high wages to firms to deploy the investment it takes to actually put those innovations into widespread use    extended summary**](http://np.reddit.com r autotldr | faq](http://np.reddit.com r autotldr comments/31b9fm faq_autotldr_bot/ version 1.65 tl;drs so far | feedback](http://np.reddit.com message compose?to=%23autotldr pm 's and comments are monitored constructive feedback is welcome | top keywords wage**^#2 growth**^#4 market**^#5

i am personally not terribly impressed with their articles there is one that talks about how they had to do a rebuild of their matching engine which makes me wonder what was wrong with the previous matching engine maybe it was broke or whatever   one of their head people bailed out of the company a few years ago and they said something that all of this hft stuff really started in 2008 if i read that correctly   maybe hft is a dead dog   then there was the article that attempts to debunk myths about the hft business if they were profitable they would not be talking about myths but instead they might instead be talking about their profits lol   bernie madoff was once the chairman of the nasdaq and i think this is one of the exchanges that sells these high speed connections to these hft firms which means that the exchange will eventually figure a method to put their hands onto this hft money and they might cut out the original hft firms as they are no longer needed   i smell a tradeworx is dead

as an addition to chris rea 's excellent answer these tender offers are sometimes made specifically to cast doubt on the current market price for instance a large public company that contracts with a smaller supplier or service company also public might make a tender offer below market price the market will look at this price and the business relationship and wonder what the larger company knows about the smaller one that they do n't now what happens when investors lose confidence in a stock they sell it supply goes up demand goes down and the price drops the company making the tender offer can then get its shares either way directly via the offer or on the open market this is however usually not successful beyond the very short term and typically only works because the company making a tender offer is the gorilla which can dictate its own terms with practically anyone else it meets such offers are also very closely watched by the sec if there 's any hint that the larger company is acting in a predatory manner or that its management is using the power and information of the company to profit themselves the strategy will backfire as the larger company finds itself the target of sec and doj legal proceedings

has very little idea about how much we earn and how high up we are in terms of income percentile the first part of this sentence is tough to understand my daughter was 12 when she told us what she estimated our income to be she looked up the price of our home worked backwards using conservative numbers and was pretty close here you are saying your wife does n't know the family income   percentiles are meaningless there are $ 60k couples who donate 10 and there are $ 300k earners who are not charitable at all and do n't even save   it 's time to have a general budget conversation with her perhaps starting with the rate of savings and show how there 's room for charity if your charitable desire is based on a religious compulsion share that as well the 10 is what many feel to share by their maker and feel that it comes off the top regardless of their income level   in reality this issue is not financial it 's about open dialog between 2 people money is difficult for some to discuss but you need to start somewhere

an experienced individual would n't ask such questions   i do n't say this to take a at you but to provide context   the matter is much more complicated than a simple answer to your question could accomplish the short answer is no not necessarily but it depends on the details generally if the employer matches it 's suggested that you take advantage of the match   it 's free money   that said it comes with some strings attached like a vesting schedule   it 's not yours right away necessarily   choices are limited in a 401k but we should still come out ahead with that free money the investment choices available in a 401k are also a part of the details   if they meet your needs you should certainly consider the 401k even if the employer does n't match there is also the matter of one 's particular tax situation which is certainly an involved matter   a 401k can certainly be a part of judicious tax planning   it 's a matter of working out the details continuing this theme of details and coming back to the employer match if the employer does n't i would make sure that i 'm maxing out an ira before considering the 401k   if the employer matched i would probably contribute to take advantage of that match   however it quickly becomes complicated here   i 'm accustomed to employer matching up to some percentage of pay which typically works out to be less then the contribution limits for a 401k   so i my plan for such a situation is to contribute up to the employer match in the 401k then max out an ira and then return to the 401k to finish contributing up to its yearly maximum there is plenty for you to consider in order to come up with a plan of action   while it 's certainly complicated it 's accessible to most people   you do n't have to be a genius   in fact are regularly by the markets

the benefit as other answers have mentioned is higher interest rates than are available compared to other comparable options   my bank keeps spamming me with offers for a sub 1 apr savings account that only requires a $ 10,000 balance for example   while cds and similar safe investments do n't seem like they offer much value now or in the recent past that 's because they strongly correlate to the federal funds rate which is near historic lows   see the graph of cd rates and the federal funds rate here you may have felt differently in july of 1984 when you could get a 5 year cd with an apr above 12   as you can see in this graph of historical cd yields it has n't always been the case that cds offered such small returns   that being said cds are safe investments being fdic insured up to the fdic insurance limits so you 're not going to get great rates from one because there 's basically no risk in this particular type of investment   if you want better rates you get those by investing in riskier instruments that have the possibility of losing value

i think your question is the reason why generics are cheaper part of what you 're paying for in a brand is consistency   depending on what you buy and where you shop it may be a no brainer to buy the generic brand of certain products buying generic otc drugs is in that category it 's amazing to me that anyone purchases tylenol when the generics deliver superior quality at half the cost but for other products subtle differences can be significant my wife would never purchase generic flour which seems like it would be a commodity product for baking as she 's a serious baker and there are qualitative differences and consistency issues between brands if i were just making gravy the those differences do n't really matter

how can i calculate my currency risk exposure   you own securities that are priced in dollars so your currency risk is the amount all else being equal that your portfolio drops if the dollar depreciates relative to the euro between now and the time that you plan to cash out your investments not all stocks though have a high correlation relative to the dollar   many us companies e.g. apple do a lot of business in foreign countries and do not necessarily move in line with the dollar   calculate the correlation using excel or other statistical programs between the returns of your portfolio and the change in fx rate between the dollar and euro to see how well your portfolio correlated with that fx rate   that would tell you how much risk you need to mitigate how can i hedge against it   there are various currency etfs that will track the usd eur exchange rate so one option could be to buy some of those to offset your currency risk calculated above   note that etfs do have fees associated with them although they should be fairly small one i looked at had a 0.4 fee which is n't terrible but is n't nothing also note that there are etfs that employ currency risk mitigation internally including one on the nasdaq 100    note that this is not a recommendation for this etf just letting you know about alternative products that might meet your needs

first you should probably have a proper consultation with a licensed tax adviser ea cpa licensed in your state in fact you should have had it before you started but that ship has sailed you 're talking about start up expenses you can generally deduct up to $ 5000 in the year your business starts and the expenses in excess will be amortized over 180 months 15 years this is per the irc sec the amortization starts when your business is active i.e. you can buy the property but not actually open the restaurant you can not start the depreciation i have a couple questions about accounting should all the money i    spent be a part of capital spending or is it just a part of it if it qualifies as start up organizational expenses it should be capitalized if it is spent on capital assets then it should also be capitalized but for different reasons and differently for example costs of filing paperwork for permits is a start up expense buying a commercial oven is a capital asset purchase which should be depreciated separately as buying the tables and if it is a salary expense to your employees then it is a current expense and should n't be capitalized our company is llc if this matters   it matters to how it affects your personal tax return

certainly there are people who do pay off their homes   others do not   it 's a question of risk tolerance and preference   some considerations relevant to this question taxes interest on a mortgage is tax deductible   particularly for high earners this is a significant incentive to maintain a mortgage balance and place extra money in the market instead liquidity if you lose your job you can sell stocks to pay the mortgage   but if you have made principle payments on your mortgage but still owe some outstanding balance you are still required to make monthly payments without any source of income rates in recent years it is been common to get a mortgage for 3.2 to 3.5   the difference between those rates and 9 rate of return for the market is substantial    there are other considerations but the answer in the end is that for many people the risk reward calculus says the ~5 difference in rate of return is worth the potential risks

dividends are normally paid in cash so do n't generally affect your portfolio aside from a slight increase to cash   you get a check for them or your broker would deposit the funds into a money market account for you   there is sometimes an option to re invest dividends see 's answer regarding dividend re investment plans as tom au described the dividends are set by the board of directors and announced   also as he indicated just before the record date a stock which pays dividends is worth slightly more reflecting the value of the dividend that will be paid to anyone holding the stock on the record date and goes down by the dividend amount immediately after that date since you 'd now have to hold the stock till the next record date to get a dividend   in general unless there 's a big change in the landscape such as in late 2008 most companies pay out about the same dividend each time and changes to this are sometimes seen by some as indicators of company health and such news can result in movement in the stock price when you look at a basic quote on a ticker symbol there is usually a line for div yeild which gives the amount of dividend paid per share and the relative yeild as a percentage of the stock price   if a company has been paying dividends this field will have values in it if a company does not pay a dividend it will be blank or say na depending on where you get the quote   this is the easiest way to see if a company pays a dividend or not   for example if you look at this quote for google you can see it pays no dividend   now in terms of telling when and how much of a dividend has been paid most financial sites have the option when viewing a stock chart to show the dividend payments   if you expand the chart to show at least a year you can see when and how much was paid in terms of dividends   for example you can see from this chart that msft pays dividends once a quarter and used to pay out 13 cents but recently changed to 16 cents    if you were to float your mouse over one of those icons it would also give the date the dividend was paid

others have pointed out that many benefits offered by employers for free are actually taxed the employee must pay taxes on the value of what they 're receiving usually services of some kind this is called imputed income also pointed out was that healthcare is an exception a specifically protected class of benefits that are n't taxed but sometimes they are many companies now offer domestic partner health coverage as well regardless of whether the couple is in any kind of civil union or other arrangement the costs to the employee vary but it 's often that they simply pay double of what their individual coverage contribution would be independent of the employee 's direct contribution for their domestic partner they must also pay taxes on the value of the employer 's cost of the coverage this can be significant as typically the employer is paying the lion 's share of the healthcare cost

thanks for the article a couple questions   is your basic investment premise that as defaults rise investors will demand higher rates and thus loans will become more expensive for borrowers why ca n't the lenders include a larger reserve to offset defaults making loans less profitable for them or why does n't this just wipe out the riskiest tranches of abs does it have to result in an implosion in supply   since 2009 car loans have exploded over $ 1.1 would n't car loans increase significantly from the bottom of the great recession as the economy recovered also the graph shows the billions of car loans i think you 'd have to look at an inflation adjusted loan origination as cars do not cost the same today as they did 1970 so you 'd expect the total dollar value of loans to be much higher   how many borrowers are using their cars as collateral for new debt are you asking how many are refinance their cars i do n't think this is a thing cars depreciate and most of the time the value of the car is less than loan people may be rolling over into a new car and loan but i do n't think they are re mortgaging their cars i could be wrong but there has to be information available on this   we do this through purchasing long dated 1 2 year out of the money put options on first order how do you know where the strike price on these stocks will be if your very confident you can sell a call above to offset the cost of the put or alternatively why do n't you buy a credit default swap on the abs tranches

i found a way to do this but it 's slightly backwards quicken does not allow you to make a graph of just your income probably because that would be a fairly boring graph for most people   but it does allow you to do a graph of your expenses   doing so while including income categories will produce the graph i want but with negative numbers savings is negative spending this will show a bar graph of overall spending counting income as negative spending   so having negative bars is good in this case

what is the best option to start with and   i am not sure about my goals right now but i do want to have a major retirement account without changing it for a long time that is a loaded question your goals should be set up first else what is stopping you from playing the mega millions lottery to earn the retirement amount instantly if you have the time and resources you should try doing it yourself it helps you learn and at a latter stage if you do n't have the time to manage it yourself you can find an adviser who does it for you to find a good adviser or find a fund who which can help you achieve your monetary goals you will need to understand the details how it works and other stuff behind it   when you are thrown terms at your face by somebody you should be able to join the dots and get a picture for yourself many a rich men have lost their money to unscrupulous people i.e. bernie madoff so knowing helps a lot and then you can ask questions or find for yourself to calm yourself i.e. ditch the fund or adviser when you see red flags it also makes you not to be too greedy when somebody paints you a picture of great returns because then your well oiled mind would start questioning the rationale behind such investments have a look at warren buffet he is an investor and you can follow how he does his investing it is simple but very difficult to follow investing through my bank i would prefer to stay away from them because their main service is banking and not allowing people to trade i would first compare the services provided by a bank to td ameritrade or any firm providing trading services the thing is as you mentioned in the question you have to go through a specific process of calling him to change your portfolio which should n't be a condition what might happen is if he is getting some benefits out of the it clarified in the first place if you intend to go through them from the side of the fund he might try to dissuade you from doing so to protect his stream of income and what if he is on a holiday or you can not get hold of him secondly from your question it seems you are n't that investing literate so it is very easy to get you confused by jargon and making you do what he gets the maximum benefit out of it rather than which benefits you more   i ai n't saying he is doing so but that could be a possibility too so you have consider that angle too the pro is that setting up an account through them might be much easier than directly going to a provider but the best point doing it yourself is you will learn and there is nothing which tops that you do n't want somebody else managing your money however knowledgeable they maybe i.e. anthony

gt;then we will have to agree to disagree   the important thing is that we did n't give any solid advice to the original question   gt;the social discount rate is n't about borrowing it is about funding projects that would return a higher rate to simply say the discount rate is the same as the borrowing rate which is dirt cheap right now is n't wise because different projects offer better social value think of it as your opportunity cost   i agree with you that there may be better projects but i am implying that as long as those other projects irr are above the borrowing rate they also should be basically keep on borrowing and going down the order until the borrowing rate meets the irr of projects not started what every that equilibrium is should be the discount rate   and while someone may say that borrowing takes away from private investment and they are right it is in the best interest of the country to ignore that the market for government securities is global the state could be taking more from foreign private investment than domestic   however this does ignore the manipulation on the rate that goes on from forced lending from citizens social security by law has no choice but to invest in government securities i do n't know i think i 'm just rambling now

i think you 're looking for the public float public float or the unqualified term may also refer to the number of    outstanding shares in the hands of public investors as opposed to    company officers directors or controlling interest investors    assuming the insider held shares are not traded these shares are the    publicly traded ones the float is calculated by subtracting    restricted shares from outstanding shares as mentioned treasury stock is probably the most narrow definition of restricted stock not publicly traded but shares held by corporate officers or majority investors are often included in the definition as well in any case the balance sheet is indeed a good place to start
