in a sole proprietorship and an llc the expenses can still be deducted against the profits or losses from the operations the irs does not even require that a profit seeking activity be incorporated under its own entity hence why this is also applicable in a sole proprietorship from what you 've said there is no reason to use a more complicated and costly corporate structure at all in comparison a sole proprietorship and single member llc will be completely pass through entities to the irs and all of their earnings go to you with the llc you have the option of letting the llc 's earnings remain with the entity itself or you can just treat it as your own and pay individual income taxes on it this has nothing to do specifically with a gambling business and is largely a red herring to your profit seeking motives gambling in casino games and lotteries already enjoy favorable tax treatment in some regards gambling in capital markets also enjoy a myriad of favorable tax laws a business entity related to this purpose should be able to deduct costs related to this trade and pass an audit more convincingly than not having formed an llc and business bank account

you probably do n't need s corp there 's no difference between what you can deduct on your schedule c and what you can deduct on 1120s it will just cost you more money since you 're gambling yourself you do n't need to worry about liability but if you do you should probably go llc route much cheaper and simpler the reasonable salary trick to avoid fica wo n't work do n't even try schedule c for professional gamblers is a very accepted thing nothing extraordinary about it

first to answer the question   the benefit of a 401k is that you do n't have to pay income tax on the money contributed nor do you pay capital gains tax on the money that accumulates   you get that with the restriction that you ca n't willy nilly remove and contribute money to the account and you are taxed on withdrawals more severely if you do it before you are 65   similar sorts of restrictions apply to all retirement accounts which give tax benefits   now for the 7000 not providing benefit   assuming a very modest 4 growth over 40 years 7000 becomes not something to sneeze at inflation risk reward blah blah blah it is less than it looks but 4 is really pretty low the stock market averages anywhere from and iirc the bond market is somewhere around 5   now certainly to avoid bankruptcy you should withdraw   however if it is possible you will be best served by keeping the money in your 401k account   the penalties and lost earning opportunities are pretty significant   /u has the r finance for how much you lose by doing an early withdraw   do n't do this lightly and i would suggest avoiding cashing out the whole thing if you can

as documented in myfico there are several factors that affect credit scores payment history 35 the first thing any lender wants to know is whether you 've paid past    credit accounts on time this is one of the most important factors in    a fico ® score as miller mentioned checking your credit report to determine whether or not late payments were reported to credit bureaus will give you a sense of whether or not this was effected you mentioned several bounced payments which certainly could have caused this this would be my largest concern with a closed account is to investigate why and what was reported to the bureaus and in turn other lenders also since this has the highest impact on credit scores 35 it 's arguably the most important this is further detailed here which details the public record and late payment effect on your score amounts owed 30 having credit accounts and owing money on them does not necessarily    mean you are a high risk borrower with a low fico ® score however    when a high percentage of a person 's available credit is been used    this can indicate that a person is overextended and is more likely to    make late or missed payments given that this card was closed whatever your credit limit was is now no longer added into your total credit limit however your utilization on that card is gone assuming it gets paid off depending on any other credit lines and since you reported heavy use that could be a positive impact though likely not length of credit history 15 in general a longer credit history will increase your fico ® scores    however even people who have n't been using credit long may have high    fico scores depending on how the rest of the credit report looks depending how old your card was and particularly since this was your only credit card it will likely impact your average age of credit lines depending on other lines of credit loans etc you have open this accounts for about 15 of your score so not as large of an impact as the first two   credit mix in use 10 fico scores will consider your mix of credit cards retail accounts    installment loans finance company accounts and mortgage loans given that this was your only credit card your loan mix has been reduced possibly to none new credit 10 research shows that opening several credit accounts in a short period    of time represents a greater risk especially for people who do n't    have a long credit history this focuses on credit inquiries which as you mentioned you will likely have another either re opening this credit card or opening another at some point in the future   regardless paying off the rest of that card is a priority as interest rates on average credit cards are over 13 and often higher source this rate comes into play when not paying the balance in full every month and also as miller suggested i would not utilize a credit card without being able to pay it in full it can often be a dangerous cycle of debt

if you are looking to go long buy you would use bid prices as this is what you will be matched against for your order to be executed and a trade to go through if you are looking to go short sell you would use the ask prices as this is what you will be matched against for your order to be executed and a trade go through in your analysis you could use either this convention or the midpoint of the two prices as fx is very liquid the bid and ask prices would be quite close to each other so the easiest way to do your analysis is to use the convention i listed above

this is my opinion as a car nut it depends on what you want out of a car for your situation paying cash want to keep the car long term but also save money i recommend seriously considering a slightly used vehicle maybe 2 or 3 years old or a certified pre owned vehicle reasons much less expensive than a brand new car because the first two years have the biggest depreciation hit cars come with a 4-year warranty so a 3 year old car will still be in warranty yes a certified pre owned car will have a bit of a premium compared to a private party used car but the peace of mind of knowing it 's in good shape is worth the extra cost considering you want to keep it long term consumer reports will have good advice on the best values in used cars

i 'm not sure if you are including the use of credit cards in the intent of your   however i will give you some good reasons i use them even when i can pay cash 1 i get an interest free loan for almost 30 days as long as i do n't carry balances 2 i get a statement detailing where i am spending my money that is helpful for budgeting i 'd never keep track to this level of detail if i were using cash 3 many cards offer reward programs that can be used for cash back 4 it helps maintain my credit rating for those times i need to buy something and pay it off over time car house etc 5 not so much an issue for me personally but for people that live paycheck to paycheck it might help to time your cash outflows to match up with your inflows for a business i think it is mostly a cash flow issue that is in a lot of b2b type businesses customers can pay very slowly managing their own cash flows so your revenue can sometimes lag quite a bit behind the expenses that were associated with them e.g payroll a business line of credit can smooth out the cash flow especially for companies that do n't have a lot of cash reserves

the one thing your friend needs to understand is for every dollar paid out there is somebody paying that dollar in   the mark of a ponzi scheme is that it feeds on itself the stock market has trade volumes where it almost meets the definition of a ponzi scheme   however it deals with shares in actual production facilities rather than only financial institutions and provides means of production in return for large amounts of the profits   so there is someone legitimately expecting to pay back more than he gets out in return for the availability of money at a time where he could not finance matters except by credit with your friend 's scheme there is nobody expected to pay more than he gets out nail him down with that every dollar paid out has to be paid in   who is the one paying at this point of time it sounds like there will be two possible outcomes   you 'll be visiting your friend in debtors prison or you 'll visit him in criminal prison   if you highly value your friendship you might get him out of the former with your own money   you wo n't be able with the latter   and if you let him exploit his standing for scamming his community make no mistake it will be the latter i do n't envy you

one easy way to monitor costs in quickbooks is to establish sub bank accounts    for example you may have an asset account called state bank numbered asset cash and cash equivalents bank convert this to a parent account for a middle school by making subaccounts such as at budget formation transfer $ 800 from operations to family fun committee   then write all checks for family fun from the family fun subaccount    for fundraising transfer $ 0 at budget formation to the x grade accounts   do deposit all grade level receipts into the appropriate grade level subaccounts and write all checks for the grades from the grade level subaccounts    the downside to the above is that reconciling the check book each month is slightly more complicated because you will be reconciling one monthly paper bank statement to multiple virtual subaccounts also you must remember to never write a check from the parent state bank and instead write the checks from the appropriate subaccounts

hsas as they exist today allow a person to contribute tax deductible money like a traditional ira to a savings account   the funds in the savings account can be spent tax free for qualified expenses   if the money is invested it also grows tax free   this means a discount on your cash health expenses of the amount you would have paid in taxes which given your relative 's income is n't likely to be very much as hsas exist today they must be paired to a qualified high deductible health plan hdhp   many plans have a deductible that meets or exceeds the level set by the regulations but many plans waive the deductible for things like x rays waiving the deductible causes most high deductible plans to not qualify for hsa accounts there are other qualified hsa expenses like long term care ltc insurance premiums that can also be spent tax and penalty free from hsa funds at age 60 with low income an hsa serves little purpose because the tax savings is so marginal and an hdhp is required   that does not however mean that the scope of hsa availability should not be expanded   just because this is not a silver bullet for everyone does not mean it is of no use to anyone

all of the answers given so far are correct but rather narrow when you buy a 30-year mortgage you are buying the right to pay off the debt in as long as 30 years   what you pay depends on the interest rate and how long you actually take to pay it off and principal and points and so on just as you are buying that right the is selling you that right and they usually charge something for it typically a higher rate   after all they and not you will be exposed to interest risk for 30 years however if some bank has an and is willing to give you a 30-year loan for the same price as or lower than any other bank is willing to go for a 15-year loan hey free flexibility   might as well take it   if you want to pay the loan off in 15 year or 10 or 20 you can go ahead and do so

other answers here cover some of the basics but this is also a great time to start establishing a credit history and developing good financial habits to carry throughout your life in addition to opening a free checking account with the local credit union establish an overdraft line of credit on that account never close this account or this line of credit as it will work to increase the average age of your accounts when you apply for credit later in life if you are disciplined with your use of credit cards you may also want to apply for a low limit credit card through the same credit union for the same purpose as above never carry a balance on this card but make minor purchases with it each month never more than 20 of the balance maybe just buy gas with it start tracking all of your spending and make a monthly budget there are a lot of online tools that make this very easy establishing the habit now will help you make informed financial decisions in the future open a roth ira and put at least 10 of your money away for retirement in the future your income may increase enough to put you in the 25 tax bracket if that ever happens open a regular ira and put the money there instead also when you have employers that offer 401k matching do the same thing with a roth 401k account keep your money invested in a low cost index fund

i agree that best is subjective and will not give investment advice however the tax deductible part can be dealt with quite swiftly if you need tax deductibility right now at the expense of later put it into an rsp account if you do n't need tax deductibility right now put it into a tfsa assuming you have room in either of these vehicles i would suggest using just an rsp or tfsa cash savings account for now at ing direct three reasons you get the immediate benefit of having put it somewhere and in the case of the rsp an immediate tax deductibility you do n't have to worry about rushing into a specific investment and can give yourself time to figure out your goals and portfolio composition read about the couch potato portfolio for a starting point you can transfer your money from them for free and still keep it registered in whichever plan it is in the last point is the most important for my suggestion the ability to quickly park the cash in a registered account and to move it for free using the appropriate form at a later date most places have a sneaky transfer out fee ing may not be the only place that does n't but i have n't looked into many other places about this you might find something else that works the same way and please do n't ever use gic and high return in the same sentence

simply put that 's not allowed    outside a retirement fund they simply do not provide a mechanism to pay that expense ratio separately   ergo any effort to pay that expense ratio would be classified as a new additional purchase of the fund you now must deal with   inside a retirement fund paying the expense ratio of the fund with cash would be treated as an additional contribution which may then violate contribution rules such as going over your contribution limit or contributing past age 70 1/2

ben already covered most of this in his answer but i want to emphasize the most important part of getting a loan with limited credit history go into a credit union or community bank and talk to the loan officer there in person ask for recommendations on how much they would lend based on your income to get the best interest rate that they can offer sometimes shortening the length of the loan will get you a lower rate sometimes it wo n't in any case make sure you can pay it off quickly no matter the term that you sign with   each bank may have different policies talk to at least two of them even if the first one offers you terms that you like talking to a loan officer is valuable life experience and if you discuss your goals directly with them then they will be able to give you feedback about whether they think a small loan is worth their time

it is a decent time to purchase real estate despite 's opinion   i feel is falling for the old economic psychology of what ever direction its going it will continuing in that direction which is a bad mentality for any investing up or down      this may not be the bottom and there is some sign that another dip is coming with in a year or two   but if you purchase now and focus on a few key factors you may end up on the upside of the swing   first and foremost location matters more then value of the property   when the up demand is eventually released after we get employment moving in the right direction you will see a land grab   the first and highest valued places are those with nice neighborhoods and good schools as the young families economically start making homes     second pay attention to valuation in so much as your burden   this means consider taxes and mortgage and terms of mortgage stay away from variable or balloon rates   when thing go up the interest rates will lead the way   in this time of uncertainty you should make sure you can cover your mortgage payment with ease   put plenty down 20 being the recommended to avoid mortgage insurance and long term costs and shoot low on   price   if you 're handy you may even consider buying something that needs minor work outdated kitchen or the like    if you shoot lower then your limit then you 'll be comfortable even if things turn sour for you   ultimately all this hinges on what you want to do with the property   its a wise time to buy homes today where you will be able to rent them out tomorrow   but the important thing is aim in the middle instead of at your limit 450 is definitely your limit   remember banks will always tell you that you 're able to afford twice as much as you actually should   and keep in mind no matter how new or nice the home it will need work at some point and that costs   so you should have that in mind when you consider savings   based on your information i would nt shoot higher then 250 300k   i have friends who make your salary in dividends plus two incomes and they are comfortable in their home at its 250 price   they are able to afford repairs and upgrade regularly and are nt threatened by potential tax hikes though they gripe of course    the one good piece of advice from imho is that you should be ready for the environment to change   higher interests rates will weigh on your comfort as much as cpi and increased taxes will so plan for them to be much higher and you 'll be ahead of the game

when trying to understand accounting it 's always helpful to reference the balance sheet identity thus and debits and credits must balance in this case one would so that cash is subtracted credited from assets and loans to family members is added debited to assets the income identity is treated differently as so unless if the cash and loans to family members did not start there was no revenue or expense   a revenue will be any interest paid   the expenses will be any costs related to loaning the money such as drafting a contract or any amount defaulted assets are not liabilities a liability on the balance sheet is a liability owed by the entity measured such as a person or a company the family members in this case are the borrowers so they are the ones who must increase their liability accounts like so the lender to family members would not increase liabilities in this case because the lender is not borrowing from the borrower debits credits and the balance sheet debits credits must be equal or an identity is violated debits add to assets and subtract from liabilities and equity while credits subtract from assets and add to liabilities and equity if a lender were to try to simultaneously subtract cash from assets and add loans to liabilities to book a loan the operation would look like this this would cause an immediate imbalance because there are no offsetting debits but more importantly crediting loans to family members as a liability would actually mean that the lender owes loans to family members

different stocks balance dividend versus growth differently some have relatively flat value but pay a strong dividend utility stocks used to be examples of that model and bonds are in some sense an extreme version of this some especially startups pay virtually no dividends and aim for growth in the value of the stock and you can probably find a stock that hits any point between these this is the growth versus income spectrum you may have heard mentioned in the past investors took more of their return on investment as dividends conceptually a share of the company 's net profits for the year reflecting the share 's status as partial ownership if you wanted to do so you could use the dividend to purchase more shares via a dividend reinvestment plan or not but that was up to you these days with growth having been strongly hyped many companies have shifted much more to the growth model and dividends are often relatively essentially this assumes that everyone wants the money reinvested and will take their profit by having that increase the value of their shares of course that 's partly because some percentage of stockholders have been demanding growth at all costs not always realistically   to address your specific case no you probably are n't buying microsoft because you like its dividend rate you 're buying it in the hope it continues to grow in stock value but the dividend is a bit of additional return on your investment and with other companies the tradeoff will be different that 's one of the things along with how much you believe in the company that would affect your decision when buying shares in specific companies personally i mostly ignore the whole issue since i 'm in index funds rather than individual stocks picking the fund sets my overall preference in terms of growth versus income after that it 's their problem to maintain that balance

what most respondents are forgetting is when a company allows its employees to purchase its shares at a discount with their salary the employee is usually required to hold the stock for a number of years before they can sell them the reason the company is allowing or promoting its employees to purchase its shares at a discount is to give the employees a sense of ownership of the company being a part owner in the company the employee will want the company to succeed and will tend to be more productive if employees were allowed to purchase the shares at a discount and sell them straight away it would defeat this purpose your best option to decide whether or not to buy the shares is to work out if the investment is a good one as per any other investment you would undertake i.e. determine how the company is currently performing and what its future prospects are likely to be regarding what percentage of pay to purchase the shares with if you do decide to buy them you need to work that out based on your current and future budgetary needs and your savings plan for the future

i would add to this that while everyone is right on trading there are certain special situations you could look into that could turn a profit in a relatively short time frame one month say    a recent example is realty finance i bought in at $ prior to a spinoff sold half the spinoff company at $ within a month and the other half the reit has since paid a 50 cent dividend and gone up to mid $ as well within a total of just over 2 months this admittedly sounds like bragging which is n't i just want to give an example of a short term position resulting in a gain and i do n't know any off the top of my head except the one i did recently    this is n't trading but it is a short term position that would have turned a profit with $ 1800 i still would n't recommend it considering commissions eats a sizable portion but if you want to take short term positions you do n't need as much as you would to be a day trader    i would read seth klarman 's margin of safety the sections on spinoffs and bankruptcy they provide some useful information on some short term positions however also be aware that you should be willing to hold any short term position as a long term position if it does not immediately work out by way of example i believed would go up post spinoff but the spinoff company stay the same instead stayed the same and the spinoff went up but was undervalued so i held it for another month    just my advice as far as learning use play money but if you never are going to have enough money to really trade with hopefully my info on short term positions is helpful

while i agree that highly processed foods including plant based meat substitutes are probably not the best things we could be eating them with scare words like chemicals is unhelpful and certainly does n't account for the bigger picture   all food is made of water is a chemical is full of various chemicals   looking at the specific nutritional profile of meat alternatives most of them fall somewhere between marginally better and no worse than meat based foods   getting protein from greens whole grains nuts and would probably be better but meat alternatives still make it easier for people to adopt plant based diets and see them as viable which is likely to have a positive health impact or again at least be no worse than an diet   you also discount the non health related reasons that people choose these options   many people may be choosing meat alternatives because of concerns over animal welfare or the environment   other people may simply like the many options are different enough from meat to not be comparable from a taste standpoint and many plant based meat alternatives are much better tasting than similar frozen convenience foods made from animals

you need a cosigner someone prepared to repay the if you should fail to needless to say this is going to have to be someone who knows you and trusts you very much one way is to find someone prepared to share a house with you buy a bigger house than you would otherwise need you would own half each and the sharing agreement would specify that if one of you defaulted on their payments the other would get a larger share according to how much extra they end up paying the other way is to find a silent partner who does n't live there they put up no money unless you actually default they would almost certainly have to be part owners but you can structure the agreement so that you end up with the whole house if you succeed in paying off the mortgage or miss no payments until you sell parents sometimes do this for their kids

this seemed very unrealistic i mean who would do that but to my immense surprise the market price increased to 5.50 $ in the following week why is that this is strange it seems that people mistakenly believe that the company should be at 5.5 and currently available cheap this looks like irrational behaviour most of the past 6 months the said stock in range bound to 4.5 to 5 the last time it hit around 5.5 was so this is definitely strange if the company had set a price of 6.00 $ in the rights offering would the price have increased to 6 $ obviously the company thinks that their shares are worth that much but why did the market suddenly agree possibly yes possible no it can be answered more often the rights issue are priced at slight discount to market price why did this happen obviously management thinks that the company is worth that much but why did the market simply believe this statement without any additional information i do n't see any other information if the new shares had some special privileges in terms of voting rights dividends etc then yes however the announcements says the rights issues is for common shares

so you 've already considered relocation here are a few additional things to consider with respect to negotiating a signing bonus if any would you be leaving a position where you are eligible for an upcoming bonus profit share or other special incentive payout such as a stock option or rsu vesting date   a signing bonus can help offset the opportunity cost of leaving a previous job when an incentive payout date is near at the new company would you be required to wait some pre defined period to be eligible to participate in the pension or retirement savings plan with employer basic or matching contributions if you were receiving ongoing employer contributions in your previous company 's plan and would need to wait say six months before participating in the new company 's plan a signing bonus can offset lost employer contributions in the interim consider funding your own ira in that time would you be required to give up something else of value to you that your previous employer was providing such as an expensive laptop that is not expected to otherwise be replaced by the new company whether they offer a signing bonus and how much you can expect to negotiate is based on a lot of factors and you 'll need to play it by ear   remember what bonus means a payment or gift added to what is usual or expected in particular remember also that a signing bonus is a one time thing   in general it 's more important to consider the overall ongoing compensation package salary and incentive plans vacation retirement benefits health benefits etc and whether those meet your long term needs

there is a tax treaty between canada and the us that recognizes rrsps as retirement accounts   you wo n't be taxed on the gains in your rrsp like you would be if it was in a tfsa   so you do n't really have to do anything except fill out a form for the irs every year    the problem that usually arises is if you want to buy something else   i do n't know of any canadian brokerage that will sell products to a us resident   it 's a question of where they 're licensed   however the sec has issued an exemption so you can try to argue with your broker to get a trade done link to sec order with such a small amount in the account you may be paying fees or have it invested in funds with higher fees   you will have to do the math on whether or not you should just withdraw the money and invest in cheaper funds and accounts in the us when you withdraw the money canada will withhold a flat rate of 25 or in some circumstances 15 for more info go to a cross border tax specialist

in the us there are a few different schemes namely regulated and unregulated in regulated states e.g. colorado everything except for some of the generators are owned by one company called a vertically integrated utility and that company is allowed a specific return on its investment rates being set by a formula that includes the utility 's fixed costs the variable amp fuel costs and this return in unregulated markets like texas the generators transmission system load serving entities aka distributors and retailers are all separate although sometimes the same company owns parts at various levels the transmission and load serving entities function like the traditional utilities i described above but can choose their own retailer and the retailers then buy energy from the generators    here is a good video about how the us energy market works   to answer the question i think the answer is actually that in most cases the wires costs for us customers is lower due to the higher density and of the various power systems in the us in the the primary energy market in australia there are significant distances between loads and the larger generators and there are overall fewer customers per mile of line other than that the system both and from a market design standpoint is generally based on the us system specifically   the other big difference is that australia does not have a single grid like the us does us has 3 but is one big grid

great response thanks i 'll do my best to answer your questions   1 i 'm a genuine believer that everything from calculus to charisma can be taught to most people some people do n't have the intelligence to ever learn calculus for example and some people will only ever be average at it but most people can at least improve in most areas through education    the messed up part is that professors are never formally taught to teach some of the things i listed i implicitly learned in grad school e.g. when doing research i learned how to filter out inaccurate information when writing research papers i learned how to organize information i learned theories of motivation because i was in an org program but i never learned how to apply them especially in a classroom setting i had to figure that out myself but yes i do believe it 's something that can be learned    2 i think the vast majority of work related skills that people develop are learned on the job as you mentioned there are some generic skills students learn in college that can be applied to their work however i 'm thinking of communication and social skills although i 'm probably biased since those are the two topics i teach college it seems to me is more about learning how to follow directions figure things out for yourself and work effectively in groups than any particular subject matter and i think those skills do transfer well to the workplace    3 i 100 agree with this we 're pressured to pass students and inflate grades character issues including being disorganized being dishonest or just being rude are diagnosed as psychological disorders and we have to accommodate students with these disabilities to be clear i 100 believe in psychological disorders and i 100 support accommodating students with these i just think they are these days     totally agree with your last paragraph

it makes no sense to spend money unnecessarily just for the purpose of improving your credit score   you have to stop and ask yourself the question why do i need a good credit score   most of the time the answer will be so i can get a lower interest rate on abc loan in the future   however if you spend hundreds or even thousands of dollars in the present just so that you can save a few points on a loan you 're not going to come out ahead the car question should be considered strictly in the context of transportation expenses   it cost me $ x to get around last year using lyft if instead i owned a car it would have cost me $ y for gas insurance depreciation parking etc   if you come out ahead and y < x then buy the car   do n't jump into an expensive vehicle which is never a good investment or get trapped into an expensive lease which will costs you many times more than the depreciation value of a decent used car just so that you can save a few points on a mortgage your best option moving forward would be to pay off your student loans first getting rid of that interest expense   place the remainder in savings then start to look at a budget   setting aside a 20 down payment on a home is considered the minimum to many people and if that is out of reach you might need to consider other neighborhoods less than 400 k   if you 're still concerned about your credit score a good way to build that up once you have a budget and spending under control is to get a credit card with no annual fees   start putting all of your expenses on the credit card groceries etc and paying off the balance in full every month   by spending only what you need to within a reasonable budget and making payments on time and in full your credit rating will begin to gradually improve   if you have a difficult time tracking your expenses or sticking to a budget then there is potential for danger here as credit cards are notorious for high interest and penalties   but by keeping it under control and putting the rest toward savings you can begin to build wealth and put yourself in a much better financial position moving into the future

no one can claim markets are perfectly efficient the stiglitz paradox explains one reason why it is impossible for the market to be perfectly and there are plenty of investors that show it is practically possible to consistently beat the market e.g. the of graham and or 's medallion fund   however even if you accept as true that prices behave strangely around round numbers that is n't a of the efficient market hypothesis the efficient market hypothesis says that price reflect all available information so the expected price tomorrow is just the price today not taking into account the time value of money   the efficient market hypothesis says nothing about how prices are distributed historically a random walk has been used but that is neither a consequence of the emh nor a required assumption   you could say that prices are more volatile the nearer they are to a round number or new high but that does n't necessarily give you an edge in making money off the stock

sometimes what is holding us back are barriers which do n't really exist sometimes it is possible to pull yourself up by your bootstraps if only you try but i think conservatives underestimate the difficulties of following a new paradigm    i 've become fascinated by this topic because it ties in with my thoughts on visionary thinking what is it that allows some people to break out of rigid patterns of thought i.e. routines researchers in artificial intelligence are developing interesting theories on how to train neural networks to find new possibilities quicker some of this research might apply to the human mind and how creativity works   anyway i do n't think people can see a way out of poverty when you only present them with hypothetical possibilities i think we need mentoring programs and apprenticeships people can only follow a new paradigm when they have an example before them in other words if they can do it i can do it but when nobody around you is doing it then you are not going to give the possibility much weight no observations support that optimism

no they certainly are not compensated the same way   some are paid by commission that they earn from the products they sell ie certain mutual funds insurance etc   others are paid for their advice based on an hourly fee or a percentage of the portfolio you have to invest this is a great question because too many of us just assume that if someone is in the business they will give trustworthy advice   this may certainly be the case but think about it the financial planner at your bank who also is a mutual fund specialist just flip that handy business card over is employed by bank x.   bank x sells mutual funds gic 's insurance all kinds of great products   that bank x employee is not likely to tell you about products from bank z down the street that might be a better fit for you find a fee based planner someone you can pay by the hour for advice and let them help you review products across the industry   it 's like asking your bank for mortgage advice they will discuss the options they offer but may not tell you about a deal down the street   using a mortgage broker helps you find the best deal across the board i believe the current issue of magazine has an insert discussing planners   their magazine and website are good sources of reliable canadian financial advice

bookkeeping and double entry accounting is really designed for tracking the finances of a single entity it sounds like you 're trying to use it to keep multiple entities information which may somewhat work but is n't really going to be the easiest to understand here 's a few approaches in this approach the books are entirely from your perspective so if you 're holding onto money that really belongs to your kids then what you 've done is you 're taking a loan from them this means that you should record it as a liability on your books if you received $ 300 of which $ 100 was actually yours $ 100 belongs to kid 1 and thus is a loan from him and $ 100 belongs to kid 2 and thus is a loan from her you 'd record it just that way note that you only received $ 100 of income since that 's the only money that 's yours and the other $ 200 you 're only holding on behalf of your kids when you give the money to your kids or spend it on their behalf then you debit the liability accordingly and credit the petty cash or other account you spent it from if you wanted to do this in excruciating detail then your kids could each have their own set of books in which they would see a transfer from their own income garage sale account into their assets held by parents account for this you just each of your asset accounts into subaccounts tracking how much money each of you has in it this lets you treat the whole family as one single entity sharing in the income expenses etc it lets you see the whole pool of money as being the family 's but also lets you track internally some value of assets for each person whenever you spend money you need to record which subaccount it came from and it could be more challenging if you actually need to record income or expenses separately per person for some sort of tax reasons say unless you also break up each income and expense account per person as well in which case it may be easier just to have each person keep their entirely separate set of books i do n't see a whole lot of advantages but i 'll mention it because you suggested using equity accounts equity is designed for tracking how much capital each investor contributes to the entity and for tracking a household it can be hard for that to make a lot of sense though i suppose it can be done from a math perspective equity is treated exactly like liabilities in the accounting equation so you could end up using it a lot like in my approach 1 where equity represents how much you owe each of the kids but in that case i 'd find it simpler to just go ahead and treat them as liabilities but if it makes you feel better to just use the word equity rather than liability to represent that the kids are investing in the household or the like go right ahead if you 're going to look at the books from your perspective and the kids as investing in it the transaction would look like this and it 's really all handled in the same way an approach 1 if on the other hand you really want the books to represent the family then you 'd need to have the family 's books really look more like a partnership this is getting a bit out of my league but i 'd imagine it 'd be something like this that is to say the family make the sale and has the money and the shareholders could see it as such but do n't have any obvious direct claim to the money since there has n't been a distribution to them yet any assets would just be assumed to be split three ways if it 's an equal partnership then when being spent the entity would have an expense transaction of dividend or the like where it distributes the money to the shareholders so that they could do something with it alternatively you 'd just have the capital be contributed and then any income would have to be handled on the individual books of the investors involved as it would represent that they make the money and then contributed it to the family books this approach seems much more complicated than i 'd want to do myself though

you 're getting paid by the job not by the hour so i do n't see why you think the employer is obligated to pay you for the drive time   the only way that might be true as far as i can see is if he were avoiding paying you minimum wage by structuring your employment this way   it looks like to me you 're over the minimum wage based on what you wrote   at maximum unpaid drive time 59 min each way and maximum length of job 4 hours as you stated it gives your minimum hourly rate of $ the federal minimum wage is currently $ so you 're over that   a quick search online suggests that nv does have a higher minimum at $ under some conditions but you 're still over that too the fact that you 're required to pick up the and that you have a company car at home probably does mean that you 're on the clock from the moment that you leave your house but again you 're not actually being paid by the clock   as long as no other law is being broken and it appears from your telling that there is n't then the employer can set any policy for how to compute the compensation that he wants regarding taxes the employer probably has no discretion there   you 're making what you 're making and the employer needs to tax it in total   since you 're driving a company vehicle from home i do n't think that you 're entitled to any reimbursement vs. wages that would not be taxed unless maybe you pay for gas yourself   the gas money if applicable should be reimbursable as a business expense and that generally would not be taxed

no you can not withdraw the money until settlement day some brokers will allow you to trade with unsettled funds but you can not withdraw it until it is settled   think about it when you buy stock you have to pay for them by t+3 so if you sell you actually do n't receive the funds until t+3

this sounds like it makes no difference if you behave in the same manner i.e. take the same vacation time for example say you work 1 hour and take 1 hour of vacation and the current hourly rate is $   you would make $ 2 using your formula new rate = 1 1 + = 1 2 = $ 2   so they would pay you $ 2 for the hour you worked and then you would take the 1 hour of vacation with no pay if you plan on taking less vacation than used in the formula you make more money   if you plan on taking more vacation you make less money

with a check there are limits on cashing the stale check but that is set by the banks involved with a debit card transaction it will be up the the debit card company and your bank imagine a situation where a person finds an old check and tries to cash it at their bank if the bank considers the check stale they might reject it or put a longer hold on the check when the check writers bank gets the transaction they will also decide what to do if they reject it the first bank will reverse the transaction you ca n't count on a 90 day or 180 day limit most banks will ask you to put a stop payment on an old check that you do n't want cashed this is especially important step if you write a replacement check because there is no check number to put a stop payment on in fact the temporary hold will fall off after a few days there does n't appear to be a way to stop an old transaction be careful if you do contact the restaurant you could end up double paying for the meal if they swipe your card again   your best option may be just to keep the transaction as pending

disclaimer i am neither a lawyer nor a tax expert this page on the hmrc site lists several pages that appear to be relevant starting with foreign currency delayed remittances and on to foreign currency example which seems pertinent to your case paraphrased a property bought in 1983 is sold for a taxable gain in one tax year but the proceeds can not be released remitted to the uk until later by which time currency fluctuations have created a second taxable gain the size of the first gain selling the property is determined by the exchange rate in effect at the time of the sale but because of local restrictions this can be deferred   the size of the second gain currency movement is determined by the change in exchange rate between the time of the sale and the time of conversion in your case the first gain was actually a loss so i believe you should be able to use this to offset any tax due second gain   this page states that losses can be claimed up to four years after the end of the tax year in which they were incurred so you are probably still ok the example makes application under to defer the gain made on the original sale because of the inability to transfer funds but as i understand it this is primarily to avoid a tax liability in that year   since you made a loss on the sale there would n't have been a tax liability so there would be no need to defer it

manufacturers sometimes give incentives to car dealers to ensure that the prior year models are sold out before the year is up   however dealers are usually pretty smart on only ordering the cars they know they can sell before this happens   also manufacturers are usually pretty good about only producing enough vehicles to cover demand    honestly you are n't likely to see these incentives materialize unless the manufacturer really screwed up    if that happens then three things occur   first is that manufacturers give a hidden incentive to the dealers   dealers wo n't publicize this even internally   if the cars are still not moving after a month then the dealers will tell the salespeople that those cars have a specific bonus on them   if those cars still do n't sell then the bonus inflates quite a bit and dealers begin advertising that car at a deep discount on the radio   it 's pretty much guaranteed to sell at that point barring those circumstances the deal you get on a brand new car late in the model year is likely to be the same you could have gotten early in the model year    honestly if you want the best deal possible look at the date of the inspection sticker on the car   if it is close to the 3 month mark then the dealer will bend over backwards to sell the car as the finance costs are racking up on it   they 'll often sell that one at heavy discounts

remind yourself that markets recover usually within a few years if you believe this and can remind yourself of this you will be able to see the down cycles of the market as an opportunity to buy stock on sale no one knows the future so many people have found investing on a regular schedule to be helpful by putting in the same amount of money each period you will end up buying fewer shares when the market is up and more when it is down as long as your time horizon is appropriate you should be able to wait out the ups and downs stocks are volatile by their very nature so if you find that you are very concerned by this you might want to consider whether you should adjust the amount of risk in your investments since over time most people lose money by trying to time the market however if your investment goals and requirements have n't changed there likely is n't any need to change the types of assets you are investing in as what you are choosing to invest in should depend on your personal situation edit i am assuming you want to be a long term investor and owner making money by owning a portion of companies profits and not by trading stocks and/or speculation

life strategy funds are more appropriate if you want to maintain a specific allocation between stocks and bonds that does n't automatically adjustment like the target retirement funds which have a specific date   thus it may make more sense to take whichever life strategy fund seems the most appropriate and ride with it for a while unless you know when you plan to retire and access those funds in theory you could use vanguard 's total market funds i.e total stock market total international and total bond and have your own allocations between stocks and bonds be managed pretty easily and do n't forget that the fees can come in a couple of flavors as betterment does n't specify where the transaction fees for buying the etfs are coming out just as something to consider

this is potentially a real risk to google the odds of such a huge success it decreases google 's profits are tiny i think but there is a real risk that the increase in google 's profits going forward are materially affected by a well done competitor to adsense   if amazon took away 10 of what google 's adsense business 4 years from now would have been that is likely material to google 's earning not huge but real   even losing the ads on amazon 's web site is likely noticeable though not a huge deal i would guess to google though to most companies it would be a huge lose   there is even the potential google has to reduce their profitability on adsense to compete giving web sites a better cut of revenue   that said i think amazon has plenty of challenges to making it an effective competitor to google but they have a chance and there is even a small chance very small i think that amazon could create a competitor that actually results in noticeably say over 15 declining revenue to google via adsense likely even in this case google continues to grow profit as a company overall   google revenue from ads from their own websites are the most important earnings and likely to continue to be so also new business non web ad income is growing and i think will continue to do so this is likely an area some might find more questionable

not for the tax break no as others have said that still costs you money however with rates being low right now and brought a bit lower by the tax break this is an opportunity for the safest form of leveraged investing you will ever find if you invest that money the returns on investment will probably be better than the mortgage rate and that leaves you with a net profit there is some risk if the market collapses but it 's less risk than any other form of borrowing to invest that also leave you with more flexibility if you need cash in a hurry you can draw down the investments rather than taking another loan if the risk bothers you you can do what i did and split the difference i put 50 down and financed the rest i sometimes regret not having pushed it harder since it has worked out well for me but that was the level of risk i was comfortable with

this is how all corporations shift taxes to low income tax most large companies are actually hundreds of companies with individual companies in each country they do business in they use this type of transfer payment so most of the profits end up in countries with low income taxes that is why you might as well lower the corporate rate   it will help employment and end this kind of useless profit shifting it 's a world wide economy and companies do what they need to do to keep taxes low no matter what

but i ca n't help but feel that these low rates are somehow a gimmick    to trick people into taking out loans let me help you it 's not a feeling that 's exactly what it is since the economy is down people do n't want to jeopardize what they have and keep the cash in their wallets but while keeping the money safe in the pocket it makes the economy even worse so in order to make people spend some money the rates go down so that the cost of money is lower it also means that the inflation will be on the rise which is again a reason not to keep money uninvested so yes the rates are now very low and the housing market is a buyers market so it does make sense to take out a loan at this time provided of course that you can actually repay it over time and do n't take loans you ca n't handle of course you should n't be taking loans just because the rates are low but if you were already planning on purchasing a house now would be a good time to go on with that

bit hesitant to put this in an answer as i do n't know if specific investment advice is appropriate but this has grown way too long for a comment the typical answer given for people who do n't have the time experience knowledge or inclination to pick specific stocks to hold should instead invest in etfs exchange traded index funds what these basically do is attempt to simulate a particular market or stock exchange an s&p 500 index fund will generally attempt to hold shares in the stocks that make up that index they only have to follow an index not try to beat it so are called passively managed they have very low expense ratios far below 1 and are considered a good choice for investors who want to hold stock without significant effort or expense and who 's main goal is time in the market it 's a contentious topic but on average an index and therefore an index fund will go even with or outperform most actively managed funds with a sufficiently long investment horizon which you have these may be ideal for you trading in etfs is also typically cheap because they are traded like stock there are plenty of low fee online brokers and virtually all will allow trading in etfs my broker even has a list of several hundred popular etfs that can be traded for free   the golden rule in investing is that you should never buy into something you do n't understand do n't buy individual stock with little information it 's often little more than gambling the same goes for trading platforms like do n't use them unless you know their business model and what they stand to gain from your custom as mentioned i can trade certain funds for free with my broker but i know why they can offer that and how they 're still making money

i do n't think the verbal confirmation from the branch manager is worth anything unless you got it in writing it basically never happened that said what did you sign exactly an application i 'd think they would be well within their rights to deny that no matter what the branch manager said if you actually signed a binding contract between you and the bank things would be different but the fact that approval was mentioned suggests that all you and the bank signed was an application and the bank manager made some unreasonable promises he or she does n't want to be reminded of now if the complaints department ca n't get off their collective a firm but polite letter to the ceo 's office might help or it might end up in the round filing cabinet but it 's worth a try other than that if you are unhappy enough to go through the pain you can try to remortgage with another bank and end the business relationship with your current bank

sure there is expense however anyone who raises their kids even with the hint of frugality will never come close to their base numbers     my wife and i both worked before three having kids and at least for us the outgoing costs pretty much the same as the money spent without kids   how you say   because you budget on what you make   what changes when you have kids is your lifestyle and how you spend your money   bar tab = diapers weekend getaways = 1 big disney   convertible = minivan etc     there is an opportunity cost but according to these folks they seem to be assuming you are spending money you are normally saving on kids when in truth you would have more than likely spent it on yourself

mostly got it right it basically mean that past performance of a stock or a basket of stocks are not at all useful when trying to predict its future there is no proven correlation between past and future performance if there was such a correlation that was proven or known then investors would quickly exploit this correlation by buying or selling this stock thus the prediction it does n't mean the specific individuals can not predict the future stock market hell if i set up 2 ^ 100 different robots where every robots gives a different series of answers to the 100 questions how will stock x do y days from now for then one of those robots would be perfectly correct the problem is that an outside observer has no way of knowing which of the predictor robots is right to say that stock is memoryless strikes me as not quite right to    the extent that stocks are valued based on earnings much of what we    infer about future earnings relies on past and present earnings to put it another way you have $ 1000 now and need to decide whether to invest in a particular stock or a stock index the memoryless property means that no matter how many earning reports you view by the time you see them the stock price already accounts for them so they 're not useful to you if the earning reports are positive the stock is already too high because people bought it before you did so on average you ca n't use this information to predict the stock 's future performance and are better off investing in an index fund unless you desire extra risk that does n't come with more profitability

one such strategy i have heard for those who have this opportunity is to purchase the maximum allowed when the window to sell opens sell all of your shares and repurchase the most you can with the amount you gained or keep an equivalent to avoid another transaction fee this allows you to buy at a discount and spread out the risk by investing elsewhere   this way you are really only exposing yourself to lose money which you would n't have had access to without the stock discount

i would like to establish credit history have heard it 's useful to    gain employment and makes it easy to rent an apartment higher credit scores will make it easier with landlords that 's true as to employment they do background checks which means that they usually wo n't like bad things but wo n't care about the good things or no things they 'll know you 're a foreigner anyway is it safe to assume that this implies i have no history whatsoever probably but you can verify pulling through do n't go around giving your personal information everywhere is taking out a secured loan the only way for me no but it 's one of the easiest better would be getting a secured credit card not loan for loan you 'll have to pay interest for a credit card assuming you pay off all your purchases immediately you will only pay the credit card fees for secured credit cards they charge 100 yearly fees so do shop around the prices vary a lot if you 're using it wisely after a year it will be converted to a regular credit card and the collateral will be returned to you with interest which is actually very competitive last i heard it was around 2 twice as much as the online savings accounts as to a secured loan you 'll be paying 4 to cu for your own money does n't make any sense at all for me for credit cards you 'll at least get some value for your money convenience additional fraud protection etc the end result will be the same usually the credit starts to build up after ~6 12 months that 's why after a year your secured cc will be converted to a regular one make sure to have the statement balance in the range of 10 30 of your credit limit to get the best results would it make much better sense to wait till i get a job then i would    have a fixed monthly salary and can apply for a regular cc directly you can apply but you 'll probably be rejected as i mentioned in another answer elsewhere the system in the us is such that you 're unable to get credit if you do n't already have credit which is kindof a magic circle which you can break with the secured credit card as the least costly solution

first it is worth noting the two sided nature of the contracts long one currency short a second make leverage in currencies over a diverse set of clients generally less of a problem   in equities since most margin investors are long equities making it more likely that large margin calls will all be made at the same time also it 's worth noting that high frequency traders often highly levered make up a large portion of all volume in all liquid markets in equity markets for instance   would you call that grossly artificial   what is that volume number really telling us anyway in that case the major players holding long term positions in the fx markets are large banks non investment arm central banks and corporations and unlike equity markets which can nearly slow to a trickle currency markets need to keep trading just for many of those corporations banks to do business   this kind of depth allows these brokers to even consider offering leverage   i 'm not suggesting that it is a good idea for these brokers but the liquidity in currency markets is much deeper than their costumers

i 'll assume united states as the country the answer may probably does vary somewhat if this is not correct   also i preface this with the caveat that i am neither a lawyer nor an accountant   however this is my understanding you must recognize the revenue at the time the credits are purchased when money changes hands and charge sales tax on the full amount at that time   this is because the customer has pre paid and purchased a service i.e. the credits which are units of time available in the application   this is clearly a complete transaction   the use of the credits is irrelevant   this is equivalent to a customer purchasing a box of widgets for future delivery the payment is made and the widgets are available but have simply not been shipped and therefore used   this mirrors many online service providers say netflix in business model    this is different from the case in which a customer purchases a gift card or debit card   in this case sales tax is not collected because this is technically not a purchase   revenue is also not booked at this time   instead the revenue is booked when the gift card 's balance is used to pay for a good or service and at that time the tax is collected usually from the funds on the card   to do otherwise would greatly complicate the tax basis suppose the gift card is used in a different state or county where sales tax is charged differently   suppose the gift card is used to purchase a tax exempt item   for justification see bankruptcy consideration of the two cases   in the former the customer has ownership of an asset the credits which can not be taken from him although it might be unusable   in the latter the holder of the debit card is technically an unsecured creditor of the company and is last in line if the company 's assets are liquidated for repayment    consider also the case where the cost of the credits is increased part way through the year say from $ 10 per credit to $ 20 per credit or if a discount promotion is applied buy 5 credits get one free   the customer has a tangible item one credit which gets the same functionality regardless of price   this would be different if instead of credits you instead maintain an account where the user deposited $ 1000 and was billed for usage in this case you fall back to the gift card scenario but usage is charged at the current rate and revenue is booked when the usage is purchased similarly tax is collected on the purchase of the service   for this model to work the credit would likely have to be refundable and could not expire see gift cards above and must be usable on a variety of services   you may have particular responsibility in the handling of this deposit as well

this link does it ok   basically you calculate percentage return by doing stock price now stock price before   you 're not calculating the rate of return hence no subtraction of 100   the standard is to do this on a daily basis stock price today stock price yesterday the most important and most misunderstood part is that you now have to analyze the data geometrically not   to easily do this convert all percentage returns with the natural log next you take the standard deviation of all of those results and apply exp   this answers the title of your question for convenience 's sake it 's best to annualize since volatility implied or statistical is now almost always quoted annualized   there are trading days each year   you multiply your result by 240 of trading days per return ^ 0.5 so if you 're doing this for daily returns multiply the result by 240 ^ 0.5 if you were doing it weekly you 'd want to multiply by 240 etc   this is your number for sigma   this answers the intent of your question for black scholes you do not convert anything back with exp bs is already set up for geometric analysis so you need to stay there the reason why analysis is done geometrically is because the distribution of stock returns is assumed to be even though it 's really more like

you could achieve the same result with a balance transfer with many institutions some institutions allow bank accounts to be used as the balance transfer destination instead of another credit card balance transfers typically have much lower fees than cash advances and also are typically more readily available during 0 interest promotional periods after you receive cash in your checking account it is just as fungible and liquid as any other source of cash making the answer yes one caveat being that your credit utilization will also spike which has the effect of lowering your credit eligibility for the mortgage but there is a delay of a month or two before that is reported to the credit bureaus so the time delay mitigates that particular concern

they still wo n't reflect reality might be marginally better but people inherently use optimistic assumptions when evaluating acquisitions the cost savings numbers are always overstated synergies tend to be bullshit revenue growth always slows margins are optimistic    the fact is the person getting fucked in this the shareholder does n't really have a seat at the table and all the true decision makers want the deal the ceo wants the deal the bankers want the deal the corp dev team wants the deal as well they need to justify their existence and if they always say no they will be painted as overly negative by a deal ceo and in the end the board almost always listens to the ceo

the 5 to 6.5 loan rates are a bit high you 'll probably want to pay those off first and make it one of your priorities as soon as you have a 6-month savings fund this should probably take precedence over savings for retirement unless you 're giving up a 401(k match pay extra on the highest interest loan until it 's all paid off then switch to the next one down and accelerate the payoff as much as you can if you 're looking at a loan at 6 and a payoff date in 8 years or so 2020 am extra dollar paid now will save you not a bad return in general and an excellent return for something that 's zero risk the other loans at 2 3 are different an extra dollar paid now on a 2 loan will save you $ 0.17 over 8 years that 's a pretty mediocre return if you have a good stable job and good job prospects and a decent family support network and few commitments like children and mortgages and a low cost of living generally the things that help you have a high tolerance for risk then you should consider investing your money in the stock market instead of paying off these loans any earlier than you need to broad index funds and the like not individual stocks

right but there were tangible reasons that made sense that was fueled by a cycle of predatory loans and consumers being dumb enough to think that just because they got approved for a $ 500 k house with a 500 credit score meant they should definitely take out massive loans and buy it this was piled on by the derivative market specifically credit default swaps which certain people recognized as creating a liquidity issue they did n't know when the crash was going to occur they just knew that the asset bubble fueled by massive debt with this debt being falsely rated as aaa when most of it was junk left banks in a position of complete insolvency when the mortgage defaults reached a certain point when people realized the extent of the debt e.g. knowing with common sense that people with a 550 credit score should n't have 7 properties and be allowed to be that over leveraged let alone be rated aaa and the amount of derivatives that would have to be paid out on top of having no cash flow due to mortgage defaults they recognized that a bubble bursting would wreak havoc on the economy        that had a lot of moving parts simply saying overvalued record highs crash coming soon when how is fucking stupid nobody knows what evidence did op offer not that he would n't still get laughed out because this topic is fucking annoying with thousands of people crying overvalued but he did n't even mention p e ratio or anything he literally came in and basically said when is it all gon na fall apart nobody knows the answer

the best answer i can give is be prepared for change there 's no perfect question you can ask or assurance you can get prior to accepting the offer that will give you any particularly perfect security or sense of stability here   the company itself is going through a change of identity that can change how it will do business and even what the business is and how revenue is acquired   in the time of the acquisition your role within the company could change radically for better or worse it could even be eliminated entirely if that type of uncertainty does n't appeal to you do n't take the position if you are absolutely about this job the best thing you can do is to learn more about the business itself and see if you can make any educated bets about how your role will play into the changes in business strategy that will come with the acquisition

this is the sad state of us stock markets and regulation t. yes while options have cleared settled for t+1 trade + 1 day for years and now actually clear instantly on some exchanges stocks still clear settle in t+3   there really is no excuse for it if you are in a margin account regulations permit the trading of unsettled funds without affecting margin requirements so your funds in effect are available immediately after trading but are n't considered margin loans   some strict brokers will even restrict the amount of margin funds you can trade with scottrade used to be hyper safe and was the only online discount broker that did this years ago others will allow you to withdraw a large percentage of your funds immediately i think e*trade lets you withdraw up to 90 of unsettled funds immediately if you are in a cash account you are authorized to buy with unsettled funds but you ca n't sell purchases made on unsettled funds until such funds clear or you 'll be barred for 90 days from trading as your letter threatened besides most brokers do n't allow this   you certainly are n't allowed to withdraw unsettled funds by your broker in such an account as it would technically constitute a loan for which you are n't even liable since you 've agreed to no loan contract a margin agreement   i ca n't be sure if that actually violates reg t but when i am i 'll edit while it is true that all marketable options are cleared through one central entity the options clearing corporation with stocks clearing settling still occurs between brokers netting their transactions between each other electronically all financial products could clear settle immediately imo and i 'd rather not start a by giving my opinion why not do n't even get me started on the bond market as to the actual process it 's called clearing settling the general process which can generally be applied to all financial instruments from cash deposits to derivatives trading is the reason why all of the old financial companies were grouped on wall st. is because they 'd have runners physically all of the certificates from building to building   then they discovered netting so slowed down the process to balance the accounts and only cart the net amounts of certificates they owed each other   this is how we get the term bankers hours where financial firms would close to the public early to account for the days trading   while this is all really done instantly behind your back at your broker they 've conveniently kept the short hours

i found the following on a stock to mutual conversion for insurance firms for ohio pulling from that link   any domestic stock life insurance corporation incorporated under a general law may become a mutual life insurance corporation and to that end may carry out a plan for the acquisition of shares of its capital stock provided such plan a has been adopted by a vote of a majority of the directors of such corporation b has been approved by a vote of stockholders representing a majority of the capital stock then outstanding at a meeting of stockholders called for the purpose c has been approved by a majority of the policyholders voting at a meeting of policyholders called for the purpose each of whom is insured in a sum of at least one thousand dollars and whose insurance shall then be in force and shall have been in force for at least one year prior to such meeting   and any stockholder who has to the plan or who has been concluded by the vote of the stockholders and any stockholder who has objected and made demand in writing for the fair cash value of his shares subsequent to which an agreement has been reached fixing such fair cash value but who fails to surrender his certificates for cancellation upon payment of the amount to which he is entitled may be ordered to do so by a decree of the court of common for the county in which the principal office of such corporation is located after notice and hearing in an action instituted by the corporation for that purpose and such decree may provide that upon the failure of the stockholder to surrender such certificates for cancellation the decree shall stand in lieu of such surrender and cancellation   since they successfully became a mutual insurance company i would guess that those stocks were acquired back by the company and are leftover from the conversion they would not represent an ownership in the company but might have value to a collector

it 's hard to be disciplined when the money is right there to be spent so what you should do is have two bank accounts one for savings and one for spending figure out how much you need to spend per week and have your pay automatically deposit that much into the spending account and divert the rest into these accounts   never touch your savings account unless it is an emergency or whatever in fact if you really want you should put it as a termed deposit which you ca n't touch as the only thing you see is your spending balance you 'll be forced to get used to living within your means after a while you 're going to forget that you have that savings account at all

from also corp or is an intentionally erroneous spelling of the word bank but pronounced the same way it has been adopted by companies which are not banks but wish to appear as such and satisfy legal restrictions on the usage of the word bank for instance if the original company is known as bank of america then the new investment banking entity may be known as of america securities llc if the original company is known as bank of manhattan then its insurance business might be known as of manhattan insurance and its holding company might be called manhattan this practice originates from legal necessity under the laws of most states a corporation may only use the word bank in its name if it has obtained a banking charter under state or federal banking laws so of america is the subsidiary of boa that does n't have appropriate licenses to be called bank wonders of complex regulation

it 's a matter of opinion as a general rule my advice is to take charge of your own investments sending money to someone else to have them invest it though it is a common practice seems unwise to me this particular fund seems especially risky to me because there is no known portfolio normally real estate investment trusts reits have a specific portfolio of known properties or at least a property strategy that you know going in simply handing money over to someone else with no known properties or specific strategy is buying a pig in a poke

the true answer is it depends because   it is up to the credit card issuer to follow the right path when issuing a replacement credit card typically issuers will transfer the account history to the new trade line says barry the consumer operations manager at fico the creator of the fico scoring formula the new account should have the old open date so you should retain your payment history he says the credit limit and balance should also stay the same how issuers report replacement cards we asked the major card issuers how they report replacement cards to credit reporting agencies american express the new card has the same open date and member since year as the previous card the balance on the old account number is transferred to the new account number all payment history transfers over bank of america all transactions and account history are transferred to the new account number when there is a card replacement or renewal capital one the new account number with all the original account data original open date etc is reported along with a notification to the bureaus that the new account number is replacing the old   the two can then be into one so that all the applicable payment history balance etc is now under the new account number chase the original does not change the history on the account remains just the account number field is updated with the new account number there is no new in this scenario

great answers here 's my two cents first do n't forget to look at the overall picture not just the dividend study the company 's income statement balance sheet and cash flow statement for the last few years make sure they have good earnings potential and are not carrying too much debt i know it 's dull but it 's better to miss an opportunity than to buy a turkey and watch the dividends and the share price tank i went through this with bac bank of america a couple of years ago they had a history of rising dividends when i bought them and the yield was about 8 then the banking crisis happened and the dividend went from $ to $ 0.04 and the price fell from $ 40 to $ 5 i stuck with it continuing to buy at lower and lower prices and eventually sold them all at $ 12 and managed to break even but it was not a pleasant experience do your homework still one of the most reliable ways to judge a company 's dividend paying ability is to look at its dividend history once a company has started paying a dividend there is a strong expectation from shareholders that these payments will continue and the company 's management will try very hard to maintain them though sometimes this does n't work out e.g. bac you should see an uninterrupted stream of non decreasing payments over a period of at least 5 years this timeframe is just a rule of thumb well established profitable companies also tend to increase their dividends over time which has the added benefit of pushing up their share price so you 're getting increasing dividends and capital gains next look at the company 's payout ratio over time and the actual cost of the dividend can the projected earnings cover the dividend cost without going above the payout ratio if not then the dividend is likely to get reduced in the case of the dividend history is short and erratic the earnings are also all over the place so it 's hard to predict what will happen next year the company is up to its eyeballs debt current ratio is .2 and its earnings have dropped by 20 in the last quarter they have lost money in two of the last three years even though earning have jumped dramatically this is a very young company and in my opinion it is too early for them to be paying dividends a very speculative stock and you are more likely to make money from capital gains than dividends is a different story they are profitable and have a long dividend history although the dividend was cut in half recently this may be a good to buy them hoping the dividend comes back once the economy recovers however they are trading at over 40 times earnings which seems expensive considering their low profit margins before investing your money invest in your education get some books on interpretation of financial and learn how to read the numbers it 's sort of like looking at the codes in the matrix and seeing the in the red dress or whatever it was good luck

fortunately labour costs in china have been increasing at 15 per year for a lot of years now and it ’s rare ie only the most extremely labour heavy industries that can justify a new move setup to china purely on the basis of lower labor costs there is a lot of expertise and deep manufacturing chain advantages to contend with though   the biggest threat in the decade ahead is automation and it ’s adoption is accelerating unbelievably fast

if you 've already used turbotax on your 2015 taxes you can use the numbers turbotax gave you as your reasonable estimate   line 4 is your estimate of total tax liability for 2015 this would be line 63 of form 1040 this is federal income tax only not social security tax   line 5 is the total of tax payments you made last year you should be able to read this off your w-2 forms box 2 it corresponds to line 74 on the 1040   line 6 is the difference between lines 4 and 5 you ca n't claim a refund on the extension so if line 5 is more than line 4 enter 0 otherwise subtract line 5 from line 4 and enter it in line 6 this is the amount you should send in with the form to minimize any penalty due with your taxes later   the turbotax software can generate this extension form automatically i believe   also do n't forget to give a copy of this extension form to your tax preparer he will need to know the amount you sent in

first check with your lender to see if the terms of the loan allow early payoff   if you are able to payoff early without penalty with the numbers you are posting i would hesitate to refinance this is simply because if you actually do pay 5k month on this loan you will have it paid off so quickly that refinancing will probably not save you much money back of the napkin math at 5k month has you paying 60k pounds a year which will payoff in about 5 years   even if you can afford 5k month i would recommend not paying extra on this debt ahead of other high interest debt or saving in a tax advantaged retirement account if these other things are being taken care of and you have liquid assets cash for emergencies i would recommend paying off the mortgage without refinancing

what is your time horizon over long horizons you absolutely want to minimise the expense ratio a seemingly 2 fee p.a can cost you a third of your savings over 35 years over short horizons the cost of trading in and trading out might matter more a mutual fund might be front loaded i.e. charge a fixed initial percentage when you first purchase it etfs traded daily on an exchange just like a stock do n't have that what you 'll pay there is the broker commission and the bid ask spread and possibly any premium discount the etf has vis a vis the underlying asset value   another thing to keep in mind is tracking error how closely does the fond mirror the underlying index it attempts to track more often than not it works against you however not sure there is a systematic difference between etfs and funds there size and age of a fund can matter indeed i 've had new and smallish etfs that did n't take off close down so i had to sell and re allocate the money two more minor aspects synthetic etfs and lending to short sellers 1 some etfs are synthetic that is they do n't buy all the underlying shares replicating the index actually owning the shares instead they put the money in the bank and enter a swap with a counter party typically an investment bank that promises to pay them the equivalent return of holding that share portfolio in this case you have implicit credit exposure to that counter party if the index performs well and they do n't pay up well tough luck the etf was relying on that swap never really held the shares comprising the index and wo n't necessarily cough up the difference 2 in a similar vein some non synthetic etfs hold the shares but then lend them out to short sellers earning extra money this will increase the profit of the etf provider and potentially decrease your expense ratio if they pass some of the profit on or charge lower fees so that 's a good thing in case of an operational screw up or if the short seller ca n't fulfil their obligations to return the shares there is a risk of a loss   these two considerations are not really a factor in normal times except in improving etf expense ratios but during the 2009 meltdown they were floated as things to consider mutual funds and etfs re invest or pay out dividends for a given mutual fund you might be able to choose while etfs typically are of one type or the other not sure how tax treatment differs there though sorry not something i have to deal with in my jurisdiction   as a rule of thumb though as alex says for a popular index etfs will be cheaper over the long term very low cost mutual funds such as vanguard might be competitive though

you 're biting off a lot let 's say you can swing 5 for a down payment $ 13k   a 30-year loan on $ at the rate you quote gives you a payment of $ per month this does not include taxes insurance or private mortgage insurance which you 'll pay because you have a down payment less than 20   the pmi will run you about $ per month i think until your loan to value ratio falls below 80 plus your hoa fee utilities your 401(k loan payment etc you 're pushing $ 2k month you have a roommate in mind and that will help but the roommate can go and you still own the property   then you get the whole payment all to yourself if i had the option i 'd rent a little longer   save up for a decent down payment and shop around for someone who is desperate to sell

nearly every country has its own exchange because so many countries have their own currency and currency every part of an exchange 's business    generally an exchange will support transaction and settlement only in local currency   securities except those that explicitly enable fx trading are denominated and will trade in a single you can only buy a share of ibm in u.s. dollars   securities trading always seeks to be a clean scalable process and adding cross currency translation to the mix would just complicate things   so it 's one exchange one currency in most countries citizens and even businesses are largely restricted to having bank accounts in local currency   there are various political reasons for this but there it is   it is difficult or impossible to open a domestic bank account in a foreign denominated currency   a public company headquartered in a given country will be required to publish financial statements in local currency will be more likely to do business with the local and businesses in that currency and so will likely look for investors from that same which generally means listing in local currency which means on an exchange in that country there are exceptions of course   big multinationals do business all over the world and many seek investors all over the world as well   mechanisms have been created to permit this american depositary receipts or adrs for example   but once again cross currency translation makes things more complicated so adrs and their like are only practical for very big international players as to why there may be many exchanges in a single country imo nick r has it right   read flash boys many market makers profit from trading between exchanges and so have an interest in there being many of them   and in the u.s. regulators have expressed an interest in innovation in the exchange space and so permit them   there is also an argument to be made against having a single too big to fail exchange just like the argument for banks but i would n't call that a reason for the current state of affairs

yes and no   you can not claim the maid service cleaning your home but you can cleaning your office or your office 's facilities   for example if you have a mother in law suite in the back that you converted to an office and you have a maid service cleaning just that then you should be able to claim the expense another example would be if you have a room in your house set aside as an office careful here and your maid services charges $ 20 per room you should be able to claim that $ 20   another example if you have a maid service that charges you $ 100 to clean your house and you have a dedicated office in that house then you may be   claim a portion of your expenses as a business expense however this can be very subject to your situation for example your much more likely to meet the criteria if you have clients in your office much less likely if your the only person using the office   also you need to be aware that what the irs allows you to call an office is not as clear cut as it seems   your best bet is to ask a tax consultant

sidebar on gold and gold backed currency and stuff like that   because i said i would get to it   the above pretend history of the pretend village is not how modern money actually came to be in reality things are much less sequential and happen much more without the moments the above was a parable to illustrate how money works to a 5-year old not an actual history of how money emerged    until fairly recent times paper money was not really very useful or practical for most purposes especially if you wanted to spend money in a different village than where it was printed    if we go back in time a period before atms wire transfers widespread literacy etc then a piece of paper written in is not likely to get you very far in you could take your apples and deer and shoes around with you to trade but the earliest naturally emerging currencies tend to be hard things that were rare and easily identifiable colored etc and they frequently with the personal of the rich in a self reinforcing feedback loop people with a surplus of time and food could decorate themselves with pretty things which became valuable as status symbols which made them more valuable as which made them more valuable as barter objects which made them more prestigious shows of wealth etc   gold emerged as a sort of inevitable global currency before people even thought of it as currency it is rare portable easy to identify can easily be made into jewelry and can be easily quantified unlike say or seashells which are harder to treat as a substance once word got around that rich people like it it became easy to barter with anyone anywhere for anything    in the early stages it was not really the same thing as money it was just an easy thing to barter but it had money like characteristics   if someone walked into your apple orchard offering to trade a yellow rock for apples you might look at them a little funny what use does an apple grower have for a yellow rock   but if you know that rich people in town this soft yellow metal as something they can make jewelry out of then you might be happy to trade apples for it    once everyone knows that rich people will trade for this stuff it becomes something like actual currency neither the hunter the shoemaker nor the fisherman in town has much use for it but because they know they can redeem it for the stuff they do want and need it becomes a sort of transferable iou that can be redeemed anywhere i.e. money    the early history of paper money did not evolve the way i described in the earlier posts although it could have and would have got to the same place instead the early history of paper money was certificates issued by storage vaults of precious metals i.e. early banks instead of carrying around yellow and silver rocks you could deposit them somewhere and get a piece of paper entitling the holder to withdraw a certain quantity of gold or silver or whatever    dollars like virtually all paper currency until fairly recently could be redeemed for physical gold or silver at a federal reserve bank and dollars were only printed if the treasury had enough physical gold and silver to pay off the bearer with precious metals    for a whole lot of reasons that are topics for another discussion decisions were made that eventually led to the abandonment of the gold standard and now the dollar like most modern currencies is pure fiat paper it 's only worth whatever everyone agrees it is worth and can only be redeemed by trading it to someone else for whatever they will give you for it there are long loud and ongoing over whether that was a good idea and i 'm not going to get into that here

my general rule of thumb with start ups is do n't quit your day job until you can afford to quit your day job if you were a single man or your wife also could provide income for the family then you would have more flexibility but if you are the single income provider i suggest a more cautious route it may be frustrating to deal with the of work but if you really want to see that start up i would suggest getting started to work on it with what you can while working at your other job until you have enough money saved and enough work done that you can fully launch the start up full time it will be a lot of work so would a start up but it is less risky especially considering your family situation if you really hate what you are doing i would suggest looking for other opportunities in your field of work maybe there is something that you have overlooked and do n't hesitate to apply for jobs you are not sure if you are qualified as long as it does n't involve time away from your current job an application is fairly painless and the worst case is you keep doing what you are still doing

the shift to trading at the close began in 2008 traders did not want to be caught off guard by surprise news and there was a lot of volatility during the financial crisis so they would close their position in the evening that s how it began there are two reasons why it sticks around first there has been an increase usage of index funds or passive funds these funds tend to update their positions at the end of the day from the wsj another factor behind the shift has been the proliferation of passively managed investments such as index funds these funds aim to mimic an index like the s&p 500 by owning the shares that comprise it index funds do n’t trade as often as active investors but when they do it is typically near the market close traders say that is because buying or selling a stock at its closing price better aligns their performance with the index they are trying to emulate the second reason is simply that volume attracts volume as a result of what s mentioned above you have a shift to end of day trading and the to that is that there is a liquidity shortage from 10 am to 3 pm thus if you want to buy or sell a stock but there are few buyers or sellers around you will significant move the price when you enter your order obviously this does not affect retail traders but imagine hedge funds entering or closing a billion dollar position it can make a huge impact on price and one way to mitigate that is to wait until there are more market participants to take the other end of your trade just as at the end of the day so this is a self reinforcing trend that has begun in the markets and will likely stick around

first off i think you are on the right path not paying 3 to a broker that sort of fee reduces the money you earn significantly in the long term for your fund investing approach 10 funds seems like a lot one of the point of funds is that they are diversified so i would expect that the 10th fund would give relatively little diversification over the other 9 i would think about targeting only 5 funds to invest in the funds rather than trying to invest in all funds every month put all of the money into a single fund and rotate the fund month to month that reduces your transaction costs significantly

at least in the us a cashier 's check is just like a regular personal check only it 's guaranteed by the bank itself so the person accepting it can be pretty certain the check wo n't be returned for insufficient funds if the check is genuine most banks therefore have a policy for cashier 's checks that is very similar to their policies on regular checks and money orders if you are a member with an account in good standing they 'll make all or part of the money available to you according to their fund availability policy which is usually anywhere from immediately to 7 10 days with amounts over $ 5,000 banks will tend to put a hold on the funds to ensure it clears and they get their money if you are not a member then many banks will refuse to cash the check at all unless the cashier 's check is drawn on on that brand of bank so if the cashier 's check is issued by say chase bank chase banks will usually be willing to cash out the entire check to you immediately with properly provided id because the bank is guaranteed by them they are able to check their system and ensure the check is real and can clear the check instantly this policy is n't just up to individual banks entirely as it is defined by united states federal banking policies and federal regulations on availability of funds if you really must cash the check without a holding period and won't can't have a bank account of your own to perform this then you will generally need to go into a branch of the bank that is guaranteeing the check to be able to cash it out fully right away note that since the check might be issued by a bank with no branch near you you should have a back up plan generally banks will allow you to setup a special limited savings only account to deposit your check even if you do n't have a checking account so if no other option works you might try that as well the funds availability policies are the same but at least you 'll be able to cash it generally in 10 days time and then close the account and withdraw your money

it is a great advice   i would suggest going to the companies house it 's in london somewhere picking up all of their regarding requirements for different forms of corporate entity and deciding if you want to have that burden   it is not a lot of work you can essentially claim vat on all business purchases the way roughly it works is that your company invoices your client your client has to pay the fee + vat usually that vat is then deducted by your client from it 's vat so no loss there and you pay the vat on the difference between the service sales price and your costs computers etc you have to be careful to avoid excessive double taxation paying income tax on both corporate income and then your personal income off said company but it usually comes off in your favor essentially if you 're making more than 50 of your income from services rendered it is to your advantage to render such services as a business entity

the following are my opinion based upon research analysis since this involves taxation rules suggest you consult a tax attorney for their views   a. yes you can transfer any any amount of dollars to your nre account without paying any additional taxes   b. since you have passed substantial presence test you will be categorized resident alien you need to disclose the interest earned on your nre account this amount will be with your total income in us you would have to add this interest income in your total income and calculate tax c. transferring money to parents answer is yes you need to elaborate on this further advantage of parking money in nre account is that you can repatriate money in dollars any time you want assuming you need to buy a house or further education this would be useful incase you do n't have any of those goals yes you can transfer money to your parent if they are in need of funds   d. any transfer above $ 14000 will attract gift taxes this $ 14000 is the overall limit for a tax payee incase you transfer $ 14000 for each parent then it comes to $ there are chances that irs may raise a that you are circumventing the limit by splitting the recipients   e. only when you transfer more than $ 14000 you need to report and pay the gift tax

  adding to h answer about damage limitation online purchases could include phone tablet app purchases which could be an issue if you have children or you are a victim of fraud first link from googling kid racks up almost $ 6,000 on world in app purchases adding to c. answer i think credit cards perhaps can make it more difficult to budget if you are more lazy have limited savings   these might happen more long term if you do n't keep track of your spending i.e. if your credit limit matches your monthly income and if you pay off your card each month i think it is harder to overspend as you do n't have more credit available than you can afford to spend however this is countered by that a slightly higher credit limit may help to avoid fees from exceeding your credit card limit i think due to that some not all purchases are instantly banked i.e. the shop might send all of its monies to its bank at the end of the day or something like this so you can just keep spending not realising you have exceeding your credit limit and get hit by fees

i 'll address one part of your question there are other taxes that companies pay as well such as income tax but do n't charge to the customer as a fee so why are gross receipts taxes charged to the customer things like income tax ca n't be passed on to the consumer in a direct way because there 's no fixed relationship between the amount of the tax and the price of an individual product   income tax is paid on taxable income which will incorporate deductions for the costs the company incurred to do business   so the final amount of corporate income tax can depend on things unrelated to the price of goods sold like whether the business decided to their parking lot gross receipts taxes by definition are charged on the total amount of money taken in so every dollar you spend on an item at the store will be subject to the gross receipts tax and hence will cost the business 7 cents or x% where x is the tax rate   this means there is a direct link between the price you pay for an individual item and the tax they pay on that transaction   the same is true for sales taxes which are also often added at the time of sale of course businesses could roll all of these into the posted price as well   the reason they do n't is to get their foot in the door and make the price seem lower you 're more likely to buy something if you see it for the low low one time only price of $ 99.99 act now save big and then find out you owe an extra $ 7 at the register than if you saw $ 107 on the price tag

source see if you have access to it convertible notes are often used by angel investors who wish to fund businesses without establishing an explicit valuation of the company in which they are investing     when an investor purchases equity in a startup the purchase price of the equity implies a company valuation   for example if an investor purchases a 10 per cent ownership stake in a company and pay $ 1 m for that stake this implies that the company is worth $ 10 m some early stage investors may wish to avoid placing a value on the company in this way because this in turn will affect the terms under which later stage investors will invest in the company   convertible notes are structured as loans at the time the investment is made   the outstanding balance of the loan is automatically converted to equity when a later equity investor appears under terms that are governed by the terms set by the later stage equity investor   an equity investor is someone who purchases equity in a company suppose an angel investor invests $ 100,000 using a convertible note   later an equity investor invests $ 1 m and receives 10 of the company 's shares   in the simplest possible case the initial angel investor 's convertible note would convert to 1/10th of the equity investor 's claim   depending on the exact structure of the convertible note however the angel investor may also receive extra shares to compensate them for the additional risk associated with being an earlier investor the worst case scenario would be if the issuing company initially performed well meaning that the debt would be converted into shares and subsequently went bankrupt the converted shares would become worthless but the holder of the note would no longer have any recourse will twitter have to sell their offices and liquidate staff to close this debt this depends on the of the debt debt is serviced according to seniority the higher seniority debts will be paid off first and then only the lower seniority debts be serviced this will all be in the agreements when you enter into a transaction when you say liquidate staff you mean sell off their assets and not sell their staff into slavery

during my time in the uk i 've never seen saving bonds or other term deposit accounts that were not denominated in gbp the obvious downside of converting the money into gbp would be that you 're adding currency risk to the whole scenario if the eur appreciates against the gbp you 'll have to make up for that too just to keep your nominal capital intact

the problem is you are trying to qualify for a loan that has a 25 down payment using money you do n't have which defeats the purpose of having a down payment the best thing to do is have your parents buy the house for you you then rent the house from them where your rent is equal to the mortgage + x. your parents then put x into savings account for you and then once you have 25 in that account they gift it to you and you purchase the house from them using that 25 as the downpayment for the mortgage

as a 24 year old single your needs for insurance are minimal why you might consider it are for these reasons you are young so it will be cheaper than buying say at 34 insurance is always on sale two there is no guarantee that your health will always be good you may have to pay additional premiums later or even be refused coverage ask me i pay 70 more than others my age for the same coverage   three insurance ownership with equity values can grow tax free as you accumulate the monies consider it like a bond portfolio offering guaranteed returns on portions of the growth and a long term return of 5.5 or more four stating sooner versus later means more cash buildup just like being in a pension will generate more cash for you by age 65 than if you had started at age 34 insurance is only one tool in getting a good start it is not a panacea

it 's perfectly consistent with capitalism through the process of the market not every resource is used most productively ie there is always going to be waste somewhere in some form but the goal of maximum productivity is still what is practically desired by entrepreneurs    i only brought up the govt job example to show an instance of unproductive work versus productive work not to relate anything to government funded employment per se

yeah i went to a free seminar which was really just a roundabout sales pitch for their expensive seminars they promised big secrets etc yet when i asked the guy what his portfolio consisted of some property and some stocks was his reply     so how did you get them and choose them i asked    we cover that in our other seminars which you can sign up for   yeah and pay tons for obviously he was there to drum up sales for nebulous and vague seminars on wealth building for a thousand bucks i 'd rather just buy a thousand bucks on investment books least i know ill be getting worthwhile knowledge out of that    tl;dr felt like a sales pitch lots of show and money spent probably bullshit aliens at the end

forget the math 's specifics for a moment here 's some principles additional housing for a renter gives you returns in the form of money additional housing for yourself pays its returns in the form of here is a nice house live in it which do you need more of   if you do n't need the money get a nicer house for yourself if you need or want the money get a modest house for yourself and either use the other house as a rental property or invest the proceeds of its sale in the stock market but under normal circumstances + + do n't expect that buying more house for yourself is a good way to increase how much money you have it 's not + + the exception being during situations where land housing value rises quickly and when that rise is not part of a housing bubble which later collapses generally long term housing values tend to be relatively stable the real returns are from the rent or what economists call imputed rent when you 're occupying it yourself

you should definitely favor holding bonds in tax advantaged accounts because bonds are not tax efficient the reason is that more of their value comes in the form of regular periodic distributions rather than an increase in value as is the case with stocks or stock funds with stocks you can choose to realize all that appreciation when it is most advantageous for you from a tax perspective additionally stock dividends often receive lower tax rates for much more detail see tax efficient fund placement

if you look at the visuals of the video it 's fairly clear that keynes is presented as a misguided party boy and hayek as a boring but sober dude the actual conversations surrounding the different theories are a lot more complicated and a lot less clear cut on who is right    personal belief the reality is that different crises are caused by different things and so we have the different macroeconomic theories a model that captured every single possibility would be impossible to work so we instead have several different of reality and try to see which one is most applicable currently unfortunately people tend to pick one theory and try to bash it into every problem that arises the same way that armies fight the last war economists fight the last recession

i assume you 've looked into gold as an asset class which is considered to be a good in your portfolio at about 5 of investments because there are a lot of opinions around about that   but in terms of physical vs paper gold investment my experience has been that they 'll absolutely kill you on fees if you 're not careful i had a broker try and charge me $ they do it in the margins though so they 'll just sell at say $ 1,350 but buy at $ 1,200 just make sure you either know the market price when you walk in and stick to your guns or lock in a price ahead of time

depends on if the stock pays a dividend or not some companies in their early years may choose to not pay dividends your calculations are off as the dividend stated is annual that you 'd have to divide by 4 to get what the quarterly amount would be and there can be variances as 's compensation package may well include options so that the number of shares he owns could fluctuate over the course of a year
