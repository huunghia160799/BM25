it can certainly help build a credit score but remember that businesses gain credit differently from individuals   depending on the country there is n't usually a national register of business credit ratings the way there is for individuals   the credit record you 'd be gaining is with your own bank only banks will usually base your business credit record on revenue and transactional loads rather than merely on having and holding a credit card   that said it is n't always that easy to get a business credit card and so it is a useful thing to have for credibility with clients depending on the type of work you do a credit card can also sometimes work out cheaper and faster for financing small overdrafts than a regular business overdraft facility   that said i 've found that larger loans over a five year term can work out much cheaper for an established business than they would for an individual even where the business itself has no history of using credit

i would suggest at least getting a personal card that you only use for business expenses even if you do n't opt for a business card   it makes it very clear that expenses on that card are business expenses and is just more professional   the same goes for a checking account if you have one of those   it makes it easier to defend if you are ever audited and if you use an accountant or tax preparer

i would try to avoid mixing business expenditure with personal expenditure so a second credit card might be a good idea that said i did get a business credit card for my company in the uk as i did n't want to be personally liable for the money that was spent on the business card even though i owned 100 of the business in case things went horribly wrong as i did n't fancy signing a personal guarantee this meant that the limit was quite low but it was good enough in most cases

this depends on a combination of factors what are you charged call it margin interest to hold the position how does this reduce your buying power and what are the opportunity costs what are the transaction costs alternative ways to close the position what are your risks exposure while out for alternative ways to close finally where is the asset closing relative to the strike generally if asset price is below the put strike then the call expires worthless and you need to exercise the put if asset is above the call strike then put expires worthless and you 'll likely get assigned   given this framework   if margin interest is eating up your profit faster than you 're earning theta a convenient way to represent the time value then you have some urgency and you need to exit that position before expiry i would not exit the stock until the call is covered keep minimal risk at all times if you are limited by the position 's impact on your buying power and probable value of available opportunities is greater than the time decay you 're earning then once again you have some urgency about closing instead of unwinding at expiry same as above cover that call before you ditch your hedge in the long stock playing the tradeoff game of expiration exercise cost against open market transactions is tough you need sub penny commissions on stock and i would say a lot of leverage and most importantly you need options charges much lower than ib to make that kind of trading work ib is the cheapest in the retail brokerage game but those commissions are n't even close to what the traders are getting who are more than likely on the other side of your options trades

they do n’t grind down profits because they do n’t want to pay taxes they have no need to turn a profit because the premium people are willing to pay to amazon for their stock is so high that their cost of capital is essentially negative in amazon ’s world any retained profits reflect a lack of investment in growth or willingness to take risk and because their capital is so cheap this essentially means that turning a profit is a lack of investment in growth   you could make an argument that tax law has not kept pace with the reality of the technological revolution but to argue amazon ’s primary driving motive is to avoid taxes is just silly

it looks like with the sale of your current home you have enough liquidity to obtain credit on the best terms without tapping your wife 's ira the biggest factor to consider is the deduction on mortgage interest which reduces the effective interest on your mortgage significantly particularly as you jump into a higher tax bracket along these lines deferred retirement savings should have a higher priority than paying down the mortgage or your student loans student loans should probably be your biggest priority to pay down with the mortgage deduction a 4 rate becomes effectively a 3.4 rate if you are in the 15 bracket but as low as 2.6 effective rate if you are in the 35 bracket both of these are lower than the 3.5 rate that you can get on the student loans after refinancing   this also assumes you are n't hit with the amt this is probably worth the cost of a quick consultation with a tax professional to go over these options and how they affect your taxes

a better question would be to ask why do n't movie theaters charge to use the bathroom or why do n't movie theaters charge for parking in america either government regulation or the mall itself forbids charging for parking or limits the amount that can be charged for parking this tends to be more true in suburban areas where land is cheap but less true downtown in cities the nearest theater to me is in a mall that is also on a metro line those who arrive by metro to see the movie are effectively subsidizing those who arrive via automobile and park i do n't know of any place in america that charges to use the bathroom but the practice is still common in europe i saw the second the matrix film in brussels and had to pay to pee i 'm not sure why this is n't the case in the u.s. maybe there are widespread regulations against this or maybe it 's a cultural thing that we would be so offended by this that we would never go back to the theater

incorrect as a given product or service becomes more complex to manufacture or support the cost of entry into that marketplace increases    any aspect of technology automatically tends towards increased barrier to entry even without regulation   increased barrier to entry requires larger investment means more risk means increased difficulty finding investment   consider computer processors in the 80s creating a processor that can compete in the fledgling marketplace against similarly available chips would cost maybe a few million   today creating a processor thousands of times more complex requiring much more complex chip of which there are a mere handful and bringing it to market to compete against that already have the infrastructure and programming history to support them would be nearly impossible and require billions   or you know you could look at the whole microsoft and intel locking out their competition from pc manufacturers by means of economic incentives or disincentives leading to a de facto monopoly that they can then abuse to force pc manufacturers to deal on their terms all possible without regulation

first are you sure that no interest accrues on the student loans until six months after you finish your studies my understanding is that you have to start paying back the student loans six months after leaving the university but that does n't mean no interest accrues in the meantime my concern about student loans is that life happens and when it happens in an unexpected way the powers of the student loan companies exceed pretty much everybody else 's with the possible exception of the irs if you are in a position to be able to pay cash for the tuition then i would cut back the lifestyle scrimp as much as i can and pay cash you 'll be in a much better position afterwards for starters you wo n't have a student loan payment which means you 're in a much better position financially than most of your peers and have a lot more options open plus you 're not carrying around a mortgage before you even bought a house

true blue preferred shares are considered loose hybrids of credit and equity   they are more senior than common equity in bankruptcy liquidation but pay out a dividend which is not mandatory financial institutions issue the bulk of genuine preferred shares because of their need for more flexibility than a bond but not so much that they can afford the cost to shareholders by diluting common equity since it is a credit like security that receives none of the income from operations but merely pays out a potentially unpredictable yet fixed amount of income it will perform much more like a bond rising when interest rates fall and vice versa and since interest rates do not move to the extent of common equity valuations price variances will correspond much more to bonds than common equities   if the company stops paying the preferred dividend or looks to become in financial trouble the price of the preferred share should be expected to fall there are more modern preferred however   it has now become popular to fund intermediate startups with convertible preferred shares   because these are derivatives based upon the common equity they can be expected to be much more variant

if you are looking for an advisor to just build a portfolio and then manage it a robo advisor can be beneficial especially if the alternative is doing it your self assuming that you are not well versed in the markets the primary risk with one is that it does not build a portfolio that accurately represents your needs and risk tolerance some firms base the number of questions they ask you on sign up based not on what is needed to get a good profile but on how many before people decide that it is too much hassle and bail that usually results in poorer profiles also a live advisor may be better at really getting at your risk tolerance many of day our risk tolerance is one thing but in reality we are not so risk tolerant   once the profile is built the algorithms maintain your portfolio on a day by day basis if rebalancing opportunities occur they take advantage of it   the primary benefit of a robo advisor is lower fees or smaller minimum account balances the downside is the lack of human interaction and financial advise outside of putting together a portfolio

it 's actually the other way around   distributions in an llc are usually based on   each member 's equity share although the operating agreement can specify how often such distributions are made   shareholders in a corporation can receive dividends but those are determined by the corporation 's board and can vary depending on the class of stock each shareholder owns   preferred class shareholders who may hold a smaller overall fraction of the company 's outstanding shares than the common stock shareholders may receive disproportionately larger dividends per share than common stock shareholders which is one of the many reasons that preferred stock is a better choice when it is available   take for instance what berkshire class a shareholders receive in dividends per year compared to class b shareholders here 's a good link from legalzoom that can explain what you 're asking about explanation of llc distributions i hope this helps good luck

a couple options that i know of interactive brokers offers a paper trading mode to its account holders that allows you to start with a pretend stack of money and place simulated trades to test trading ideas they also provide an api that allows you to interface with their platform for retrieving quotes placing orders and the such as you noted however it 's not free you must hold a funded brokerage account in order to qualify for access to their platform in order to maintain an account there are minimums for required equity and monthly activity measured in dollars that you spend on commissions so you wo n't get access to their platform without having a decent amount of skin in the game ib 's native api is java based is an unofficial wrapper that makes the interface available in python i 've not used ib at all myself but i 've heard good things about their api and its accessibility via edit ib now supports python via their published api so using is no longer needed unless you wish to use python the officially supported api is based on python 3 td ameritrade also offers an api that is usable by its brokerage clients they do not offer any such paper trading mode so you would need to execute transactions based on quotes at the corresponding trade times and then keep track of your simulated account history yourself the api supports quote retrieval price history and trade execution among other functions tda might be more attractive than ib if you 're looking for a low cost link into market data as i believe their minimum equity levels are lower to get access you 'll need to sign up for an api developer account which i believe requires an nda i do n't believe there is an official python implementation of the api but if you 're a capable python writer you should n't have trouble up to the published interfaces some caveats as when doing any strategy backtesting you 'll want to be sure to be pessimistic when doing so so your optimism does n't make your trades look more successful than they would be in the real world at a minimum you 'll want to ensure that your simulations transact at the posted bid ask prices not necessarily the last trade 's price as well as any commissions and fees associated with the trade a more robust scheme would also take into account the depth of the order book also known as level 2 quotes which can cause additional slippage in the prices at which you buy sell your security an even more robust scheme would take into account the potential latency of trade execution looking at all prices over some time period that covers the maximum expected latency and simulating the trade at the worst possible price

sorry but i have to disagree the usda has very strict guidelines around what can and can not be labeled organic there is certainly an obligation to understand what the various labels mean but i would be very surprised if walmart or other major were not compliant where a mom amp pop grocery store may be able to get away with simply because the usda fda may not get around to checking i think we can be pretty certain that walmart and other major chains get checked often for information about what organic labels entail look here

the employer most likely has already sent that money that was withheld to the irs therefore they can not refund you any money instead you need to get the money back from the irs you do this by filing a tax return   your will show that taxes were withheld i.e. that you paid taxes the rest of the return will show that no taxes were due and therefore you are entitled to have your money refunded if you have already filed for that tax you you just need to file an amended return with the new data that amendment will show that you are to be refunded the extra money then just wait several weeks for the payment from the irs   as pointed out if it is medicare and social security taxes that have been withheld in error then you need to file a different set of forms with irs it would be nice if refunding fica also occurred via the tax return

i used to be a trader at a desk that sold delta one derivatives on listed indices think swaps etfs there is a lot to do    sell stocks according to redemptions or new orders manage the currency exposure indices rebalance their composition everyday based on stock corporate actions dividends and index reviews you need to be aware of each and everyone and rebalance your portfolio to account for it manage your inventory to get the best repo rates possible trade single stock swaps with foreign counterparties to get access to better tax rates on dividends when you have a big order where certain stock orders may not get filled you have to create a strategy for managing that risk sometimes you hedge your positions using futures that expire every three months in which case you need to figure out the best times to roll your expiring futures i could go on and on   basically since the profit margins are so low the market so competitive for such vanilla products and the volumes so high you have to really make your processes super efficient and error proof trust me there is a lot to be done

aggressively paying of mortgage is better if you have more cash available assuming you have covered all other aspects i.e. emergency funds retirement etc the only question you need to ask is where will you invest and what returns would you get so if your mortgage is say at 5 if the spare money can get you more than this its beneficial if its in bank cd with say near zero interest its not worth it however if you are sure you can make 10 returns on the investments then go ahead and do n't pay the mortgage aggressively

this is a great question i 've been an entrepreneur and small business owner for 20 + years and have started small businesses in 3 states that grew into nice income streams for me i 've lived off these businesses for 20 + years so i know it can be done first let me start by saying that the rules regulations requirements and laws for operating a business small or large legally for the most part are local laws and regulations depending on what your business does you may have some federal rules to follow but for the most part it will be your locality state county city that determines what you 'll have to do to comply and be legal also though it might be better in some cases to incorporate and even required in some circumstances you do n't always have to there are many small businesses think etc that get income from their business operations and do so as individuals of course everyone has to pay taxes so as long as you property record your income and expenses and properly file your tax returns every year you are income tax legal   i wo n't try to answer the income tax question here though as that can be a big question also though you certainly can start a business on your own without hiring lawyers or other professionals more on that below when it comes to taxes i definitely recommend you indeed plan to hire a tax professional even if it 's something like h&r block or jackson etc in some cities there might even be free tax preparation services by certain organizations that want to help the community and these are often available even to small businesses in general income taxes can be complicated and the rules are always changing i 've found that most small business owners that try to file their own taxes generally end up paying a lot more taxes than they 're required to in essence they are overpaying running a business and making a profit can be hard enough so on to of that you do n't need to be paying more than you are required to   also i am going to assume that since it sounds like it would be a business of one you that you wo n't have a payroll that is another area that can be complicated for sure ok with those generics out of the way let me tackle your questions related to starting and operating a business since you have the idea for your business pretty figured out will you have to pay any substantial amount of money to attorneys or advisors or accountants or to register with the government not necessarily since the rules for operating a business legally vary by your operating location where you will be providing the service or performing your work you can certainly research this on your own it might take a little time but it 's doable if you stick with it some resources the state of florida where i live has an excellent page at you might not be in florida but almost every state will have something similar what all do i need to do to remain on the right side of the law and the smart side of business   all of the answers above still apply to this question but here are a few more items to consider you will want to keep good records of all expenses directly related to the business if you license some content stock images for example you 'll want to document receipts these are easy usually as you know directly if you subscribe to the apple developer program which you 'll need to if you intend to sell apps in the apple app stores the subscription is an expense against your business income etc you will want to keep good records of indirect costs these are not so easy to figure out and where a good accountant will help you when this becomes significant but these are important and a lot of business owners hurt themselves by not considering these what do i mean well you need an office in order to produce your work right you might need a computer a phone internet electricity heat etc all of which allow you to create a working environment that allows you to produce your product the irs and state tax authorities all provide ways for you to quantify these and count them as legitimate business expenses no you ca n't use 100 of your electric bill since your office might be inside your home and the entire bill is not just for your business but you are certainly entitled to some part of that bill to count as a business expense again i do n't want to get too far down the income tax rabbit hole but you still need to keep track of what you spend you must keep good record of all your income this is especially important when you have money coming in from various sources a payroll gifts from friends business income from clients and/or the app stores etc do not just assume that copies of your bank deposits tell the whole story bank statements might tell you the amount and date of a deposit but you do n't really know where that money came from unless you are tracking it the good news is that the above record keeping can be quite easy with something like quicken or quickbooks or many many other such popular programs you will want to ensure you have the needed licenses not necessarily required at all for a lot of small businesses especially home based businesses depending on your business activity you might want to consider business liability insurance again this will depend on your clients and/or other business entities you 'll be dealing with some might require you to have some insurance   will be efforts even be considered a business initially until some amount of money actually starts coming in   this might be a legal accountant question as to the very specific answer from the pov of the law and taxing authorities however consider that not all businesses make any money at all for a long time and they definitely are a business for instance twitter was losing money for a long time years and no one would argue they were not a business again deferring to the attorneys cpas here for the legal answer the practical answer is that you 're performing some business activity when you start creating a product and working hard to make it happen i would consider acting as a business regardless what things do i need to do up front and what things can i defer to later especially in light of the fact that it might be several months to a couple years before any substantial income starts coming in this question 's answer could be quite long there are potentially many items you can defer   however one i can say is that you might consider deferring incorporation an individual can perform a business activity and draw income from it legally in a lot of situations for tax purposes this is sometimes referred to as schedule c income i 'm not saying incorporation is a bad thing it can shield you from a lot of issues but i am saying that it 's not necessary on day 1 for a lot of small businesses having said that this too can be easy to do on your own many companies offer services so you can incorporate for a few hundred dollars if you do incorporate as a small business of one person i would definitely consider a tax concept called an s corp to avoid paying double taxes but here too we 've gone down the tax rabbit hole again

there actually would n't be a need to increase prices in order to provide wal mart employees with a living wage though there is another way cut executive pay   in fact i 'd like to see a law on the books that makes maximum executive pay including bonuses and stock a certain percentage or multiple of the pay of the lowest paid employee before you can raise the pay of an executive beyond a certain point the pay of all the employees simply has to go up this would give executives another incentive to raise the pay of their employees since their ability to get a raise would depend on it i 'm thinking something along the lines of executive pay being capped at 100x the pay of the lowest paid employee your employees make $ 20,000 a year your executives make no more than $ 2,000,000 a year want that to go up guess it 's time for raises then   the main point of such a law would be to make sure that employees are paid for the benefits they bring in to the company along with having a living wage as it stands employees might get a 25 cent hour raise a year in low wage jobs if they get anything at all this way if there 's enough money to go around to the people at the top the people at the bottom also see some of that money

most of the bankruptcy is due to taking or building over a period of time a loan that one can not service if the interest rates rise then the amount of money to repay the loan increases when one does nt pay the revised amount and keeps paying less the over all debt keeps shooting through the roof a lower interest rate means that one can continue to pay the same amount and few missed payments do not cause as much as damage as it does when the rates are high

this is n't some new revelation pensions have been around for a long time and the bankruptcy code is complex and has developed over a long period of time along side it there is a strong reason why secured creditors are favored over unsecured creditors because we want creditors to actually make loans and finance operations investment expansion etc if you eliminate the secured creditors priority then loans do n't get made in the first place the company ca n't offer pensions let alone salaries because the company is n't likely to exist or at least it would be much smaller   the claims of employees are valid nobody is questioning that but they are just lower priority than those of secured creditors who only made loans on the promise that they could recover some assets if ever the loans go into default   this is also another reason pensions have gone out of style in favor of 401ks it is foolish to rely on whether a company will exist 10 20 or 30 years down the road companies are always rising and falling in the economy and there is no reason to expect one to just exist in perpetuity

this is an excellent topic as it impacts so many in so many different ways here are some thoughts on how the accounts are used which is almost as important as the as calculating the income or tax the roth is the best bang for the buck once you have taken full advantage of employer matched 401k.   yes you pay taxes upfront   all income earned is n't taxed under current tax rules   this money can be passed on to family and can continue forever   contributions can be funded past age 70.5   once account is active for over 5 years contributions can be withdrawn and used ie house down payment college medical bills without any penalties   all income earned must be left in the account to avoid penalties   for younger workers without an employer match this is idea given the income tax savings over the longer term and they are most likely in the lowest tax bracket the 401k is great for retirement which is made better if employer matches contributions   this is like getting paid for retirement saving   these funds are locked up until age 59.5 with exceptions   all contributed funds and all earnings are untaxed until withdrawn the idea here is that at the time contributions are added you are at a higher tax rate then when you expect to withdrawn funds trade accounts investments as stated before are the used of taxed dollars   the biggest advantage of these are the liquidity

generally for tax questions you should talk to a tax adviser do n't consider anything i write here as a tax advice and the answer was not intended or written to be used and it can not be used by any taxpayer for the purpose of avoiding penalties that may be imposed on the taxpayer does irs like one payment method over other or they simply do n't care    as long as she can show the receipts they do n't care as long as she withholds the taxes 30 unless specific arrangements are made for otherwise she should withhold 30 of the payment and send it to the irs the recipient should claim refund if the actual tax liability is lower it 's only consulting work at the moment so most of the communication    is done over phone should they start engaging in written    communication to keep records of the work done yes if she wants it to be a business expense is it okay to pay in one go to save money transferring fees can she    pay in advance again she can do whatever she wants but if she wants to account for it on her tax returns she should do it the same way she would pay any other vendor in her business she can not use different accounting methods for different vendors basically she has not outsourced work in previous years and she    wants to avoid any red flags then she should start by calling on her tax adviser and not an anonymous internet forum

i wanted to know that what if the remaining 40 of 60 in a ltv loan to value ratio for buying a home is not paid but the borrower only wants to get 60 of the total amount of home loan that is being provided by lending company generally a lending company say bank will not part with their funds unless you first pay your portion of the funds this is essentially to safeguard their interest let 's say they pay the 60 either to you or to the seller the title is still with seller as full payment is not made now if you default the bank has no recourse against the seller who still owns the title and you are not paying some banks may allow a schedule where the 60/40 may be applied to every payment made this would be case to case basis the deal could be done with only paying 20 in the beginning to the buyer and then i have to pay emi 's of $   the lending company is offering you 1.1 million assuming that you are paying 700 k and the title will be yours this would safeguard the banks interest now if you default the bank can take possession of the house and recover the funds a distress sale may be mean the house goes for less than 1.8 m say for 1.4 million the bank would take back the 1.1 million plus interest and other closing costs so if you can close the deal by paying only 20 bank would ask you to close this first and then lend you any money this way if you are not able to pay the balance as per the deal agreement you would be in loss and not the bank

pre qualification is only a step above what you can do with a rate payment calculator   they do n't check your credit history and credit score they do n't ask for verification of your income or verify that you have reported your debts correctly they also do n't guarantee the interest rate but if you answer truthfully and completely and nothing else changes you have an idea of how much you can afford factoring in the down payment and estimates of other fees taxes and insurance you can get pre by multiple lenders then base your decision on rates and fees   you want to get pre approved they do everything to approve you you can even lock in a rate you want to finalize on one lender at that point because you will incur some fees getting to that point then knowing the maximum amount you can borrow including all the payments taxes insurance and fees you can make an offer on a house once the contract is accepted you have a few days to get the appraisal and the final approval documents from the lender they will only loan you the minimum of what you are pre approved for and the appraisal minus down payment also do n't go with the lender recommended by the real estate agent or builder they are probably getting a kick back based on the amount of business they funnel to that company

this is why minimum wage has not gone up   its a fallacy way of thinking   your business will be required to do one of 4 things   raise prices fire employees remove pointless expenses or you take a hit   more than likely you will attempt to do situation 1 because you need all your employees you currently have   if you could work with less employees as a business owner you would of already had done that   the next part is you will find things that are pointless   why are you paying for a certain type of yeast when you found out you can get the same type from someone else cheaper   finally you may have to take the hit to yourself   the market will balance itself out   however this is the big part people do nt understand   the larger companies like to dick people over as much as possible   you think walmart which already uses illegal workers on their farms has everything made in china is going to raise prices the exact same amount   of course not   they will raise prices but nothing like that and the only people who will be hurt is the companies profit sheets and the ceo pay   that is nothing that will ruin a company   furthermore that person who was making around 7 dollars an hour will have a higher income to spend and instead of purchasing crap bread from walmart they will now splurge sometimes and purchase higher end bread from such as yourself   i think people do nt understand that companies will do and always done everything they can to save money   walmart will have no choice but to either raise prices or not make as large of a profit as they once made   the company wo nt fail the economy will also continue but the wealth is now going to spread out more   i wish i could make more people understand this but alas they will believe that you ca nt raise prices because it will ruin the economy   what s ruining the economy is actually letting the min wage stay so low   it basically turns most people into indentured servants because they can barely afford to live   does that make sense

gt you bring up the feds but that the issue because now we have to talk about monetary policy taxation is fiscal policy   if the goal is for more investments you have to account for loans and money supply far more investment is done on issued bonds than on retained profits   gt;the firm has more money they are going to spend it somewhere   that 's an oversimplification they 'll spend to maximize profit not to grow gdp the two are related but the first is n't always optimal to the second if a firm captures monopoly that 's bad for gdp   the examples in the link are relevant in that context they 're only a part of the economy 92 publicly held u.s. corporations that reported a u.s. profit every year from 2008 through 2015 they 're a non trivial portion of the economy and represent a large share of who will benefit from reducing corporate taxes so when you say gt;in general lowering taxes increases capital investment regardless of the investment rate   the counter point is that no the investment rate matters if spending those taxes produces a higher investment rate you have to adjust policy accordingly to know that you have to estimate the investment rate from a marginal reduction in taxes and compare to the investment rate resulting form your marginal fiscal program spending increase saying that lowering taxes increases investment is insufficient in the same sense that saying infrastructure spending increases investment is insufficient

if i understand you correctly your logic goes wrong right at the beginning it sounds like you think one could avoid the income tax that would otherwise be owed to the us because of earning the money that was sent as a gift that 's not normally true from the irs 's gift tax faq may i deduct gifts on my income tax return making a gift or leaving your estate to your heirs does not ordinarily affect your federal income tax you can not deduct the value of gifts you make other than gifts that are deductible charitable contributions so the person who sends $ 10k to their parents does n't pay any less income tax than if they had kept the $ 10k in the us or had just send the $ 10k overseas directly to their own bank account gifting and re gifting did n't accomplish anything from the point of view of irs taxes you may have been confused by the annual exclusion that 's mentioned on that same page this exclusion is an exclusion for the gift tax this is a separate tax on gifts usually paid by the person who gives the gift if it were n't for the exclusion one would pay taxes twice on the money sent to their parents first when the money is earned and then again when the gift is given the exclusion helps avoid this second tax

your scenario 2 in the money options not at the money the former is when the share price is higher than the option strike the second is when share price is right at strike i agree this is a highly unlikely scenario because everyone pricing options knows what everyone else in that stock is doing much about an option has everything to do with the remaining time to expiration depending on how much more the buyer believes the stock will go up before hitting the expiration date that could make a big difference in which option they would buy i agree with the others that if you 're seeing this as real world then there must be something going on behind the scenes that someone else knows and you do n't i would tread with caution in such a situation and do my homework before making any move    the other big factor that makes your question harder to answer more concisely is that you did n't tell us what the expiration dates on the options are this makes a difference in how you evaluate them we could probably be much more helpful to you if you could give us that information

awesome you are a math guy   very good for you   in theory what you are proposing should work out great as the math works out great   however have you taken a economics or finance coursework   the math that they do in these class will leave a most math guys uncomfortable with the even when one is comfortable with chaos theory personal finance is worse   if it were about math things like reverse mortgages payday lenders and advances on one income tax returns would not exist    the risk derived from the situation you describe is one born out of behavior   sometimes it is beyond control of the person attempting your scheme   suppose one of these happen in my opinion the market is risky enough without borrowing money in order to invest   its one thing to not pay extra principle to a mortgage in order to put that money in play in the market it is another thing to do what you are suggesting   while their may be late fees associated with a mortgage payment a fixed rate mortgage will not change if you late on payment(s on these balance transfer cc schemes they will jack your rate up for any excuse possible   i read an article that the most common way to end up with a credit card was to start out with a 0 balance transfer   one thing that is often overlooked is that the transfer fee paid up the stated rate of the card    in the end get out of consumer debt have an emergency fund then start investing   building a firm financial foundation is the best way to go about it   without one it will be difficult to make headway   with one your net worth will increase faster then you imagined possible

the best option for maximizing your money long term is to contribute to the 401(k offered by your employer if you park your inheritance in a savings account you can draw on it to augment your income while you max out your contributions to the 401(k you will get whatever the employer matches right off the bat and your gains are tax deferred in essence you will be putting your inheritance into the 401(k and forcing your employer to match at whatever rate they do so if your employer matches at 50 cents on the dollar you will turn your 50 thousand into 75 thousand

are there banks where you can open a bank account without being a citizen of that country without having to visit the bank in person i 've done it the other way around opened a bank account in the uk so i have a way to store gbp   given that britain is still in the eu you can basically open an account anywhere   german online banks for instance allow you to anything online should there be cards issued you would need an address in the country   and for opening an account a passport is sufficient you can identify yourself in a video chat   now what 's the downside   french banks online services are in french german banks services are in german   if that does n't put you off i would name such banks in the comments if asked are there any online services for investing money that are n't tied to any particular country can you clarify that   you should at least be able to buy into any european or american stock through your broker   that should give you an ease of mind being fca regulated   however those are usually global depository receipts and denominated in gbp pence so you 'd be visually exposed to currency rates by which i mean that if the stock goes up 1 but the gbp goes up 1 in the same period then your gdr would show a 0 profit on that day also and more dividends are distributed in the foreign currency then exchanged by the issuer of the gdr on that day and booked into your account so if you want to be in full control of the cashflows you should get a trading account denominated in the currency and maybe situated in the country you 're planning to invest in if you 're really serious about it some brokers banks offer multi currency trading accounts again i will name them if asked where you can trade a wide range of instruments i.e. on the primary exchanges and you get to manage everything in one interface   those accounts typically include access to the foreign exchange markets so you can move cash between your accounts freely well for a surcharge   also typically each subaccount is issued its own iban

a key principle of economics is sunk costs are irrelevant you bought the stock at 147 and it has now fallen to 144 that 's too bad this has nothing to do with whether it is wise or foolish to buy shares at 144 the only relevant thing to consider is do i expect the stock to go up or down from 144 you have lost $ 3 per share on the original buy buying more shares will not reduce your loss in any way suppose you bought 100 shares at 147 the price then drops to 144 you have lost $ 3 per share or $ 300 total you buy another 50 more shares at 144 the price stays at 144 so your average purchase price is now 147 x 100 + 144 x 50 150 = 146 so i guess you could say that your average loss per share is now only $ 2 but it 's $ 2 x 150 shares instead of $ 3 x 100 shares you still lost $ 300 you did n't reduce your loss by a penny maybe it made you feel better that you reduced your average loss per share but this is just an arithmetic game if you believe that the stock will continue to drop than buying more shares just means you will lose even more money your average loss per share may go down but you 're just multiplying that average by more and more shares of course if you believe that the stock is now at an low price and it will likely go back up then sure buy if you buy at 144 and it goes back up to 147 then you 'll be making $ 3 per share on the new shares you purchased but i repeat whether or not you buy more shares should have nothing to do with your previous buy buy more shares if you think the price will go up from the present price do n't buy more shares if you do n't think it will go up the decision should be exactly the same as if you had never previously bought shares i 'm assuming here that you are a typical small investor that you not buying enough shares to have any significant effect on the market nor that you are in a position to buy enough shares to take control of the company

they are wrong agreed the problem i have is that sooner or later you get in so much debt no one will lend money to you anymore at that point austerity is forced on you the increased spending comes from domestic and foreign investors we all know how fickle the financial markets can be if our debt gets too high and they cut off the tap we are fucked i do n't think we are anywhere near that point now however things can change dramatically in the course of a few months political tensions global uncertainty and social unrest could all cause enough of a panic that people start questioning the safety of u.s. treasuries we could also see the day where everyone collectively demands the u.s. stop ripping them off with negative bond yields like i said i see no indication of that now but who knows how long it will take   i know this is a bit of a tangent but it is clear my solution borrow money to improve the economy while you can but make sure that your dollars count to fixing the economy otherwise you are going to be stuck with a stagnant economy   and at a serious risk of bankruptcy when the financial markets no longer see you as a wise investment you ca n't save yourself from falling off of two at the same time so our politicians should stop dicking around and start looking for real solutions with the money they are borrowing instead of pissing it away on useless shit

hi there i 'm a tesla owner i think for the model s and x segment currently buying cars you 're right is n't the first and foremost thing in their mind however that is n't to say being environmentally conscious is n't a credit they should receive for their purchase because other informing factors like charging at home instead of needing to refuel is a perk and it reduces oil gas usage i did n't buy my car to lower my carbon footprint as buying an ev does n't necessarily do so in the big picture i do however love the fact i can charge my car at home and never visit a gas station every day i get in my car with a full tank and i 'm one less paying customer at the pump    as far as a status symbol for me it 's the opposite i do n't want a iconic vehicle that people will at me over i 'm fairly low key i 'd rather not have the attention i just needed wanted a car with great interior cargo space but was an electric vehicle i could charge at home the chevy bolt vw fiat and other ev options did n't fit the bill for me also and most importantly i wanted a vehicle that 's future at least for a few years to offer full self driving capability the moment it was allowed tesla became the icon for offering attractive electric vehicles at a time when most available options looked phoned in   remember what you said in your first post $ loan for a car they 've never seen and many wo n't receive for well over a year a lot of people myself included never saw the official prototype until after we made our reservations on march 31 2016 so the notion that it 's purely an icon seems incomplete i will say this though as soon as other auto makers take the ev market seriously and design cars that actually look attractive i think you 'll see the tesla demand drop for those who are looking for ev options pure and simple   i think in the next few years as more ev makers step up what will differentiate the vehicles is the underlying tech in the car first and foremost closely followed by design aesthetic tesla will retain buyers if they beat everyone to market with an available fully self driving capable vehicle but they 'll see some of that market shift away if other makers break in

the fact that some asset in this case corporate bonds has positive correlation with some other asset equity does n't mean buying both is n't a good idea   unless they are perfectly correlated the best risk reward portfolio will include both assets as they will sometimes move in opposite directions and cancel out each other 's risk   so yes you should buy corporate bonds   short term government bonds are essentially the risk free asset   you will want to include that as well if you are very risk averse otherwise you may not   long term government bonds may be default free but they are not risk free   they will make money if interest rates fall and lose if interest rates rise   because of that risk they also pay you a premium albeit a small one and should be in your portfolio so yes a passive portfolio actually any reasonable portfolio should strive to reduce risk by diversifying into all assets that it reasonably can   if you believe the capital asset pricing model the weights on portfolio assets should correspond to market weights more money in bonds than stocks   otherwise you will need to choose your weights   unfortunately we are not able to estimate the true expected returns of risky assets so no one can really agree on what the true optimal weights should be   that 's why there are so many rules of thumb and so much disagreement on the subject   but there is little or no disagreement on the fact that the optimal portfolio does include risky bonds including long term treasuries to answer your follow up question about an anchor if by that you mean a risk free asset then the answer is not really   any risk free asset is paying approximately zero right now   some assets with very little risk will earn a very little bit more than short term treasuries but overall there 's nowhere to hide the time value of money is extremely low at short horizons   you want expected returns you must take risk

start with the tax delta for example you 'd hope to deposit at 25 bracket but take withdrawals while at a marginal 15 in this case you 're 10 to the good with the 401(k and need to look at the fee eating away at this over time pay an extra and after 10 years you 're losing money that 's too simple however along the way you need to consider that the capital gain rate is lower than ordinary income it 's easier to take those gains as you wish to time them where the 401(k offers no flexibly for this even with low fees this account is going to turn long term gains to ordinary income note in 2013 a couple with up to $ in taxable income has a 0 long term cap gain rate so if they wish they can sell and buy back a fund claim the gain and raise their cost basis a tiny effort for the avoidance of tax on the gains each year first paragraph do n't forget there are the standard deduction exemption and 10 bracket while you are in the range to save enough to create he income to fill the low end at withdrawal there 's more value than just the 10 i discussed earlier   last there 's a phenomenon i call the phantom tax rate zone when one 's retirement withdrawals trigger the taxation of social security   it further complicates the math and analysis you seek

started to post this as a comment but i think it 's actually a legitimate answer running a rental property is neither speculation nor investment but a business just as if you were renting cars or tools or anything else that puts it in an entirely different category the property may gain or lose value but you do n't know which or how much until you 're ready to terminate the business so like your own house it really is n't a liquid asset it 's closer to being inventory meanwhile like inventory you need to it on a fairly regular basis by maintaining it finding tenants and so on and how much it returns depends strongly on how much effort you put into it in terms of selecting the right location and product in the first place and in how you market yourself against all the other businesses offering near equivalent product and how you differentiate the product and so on   i think approaching it from that angle deciding whether you really want to be a business owner or keep all your money in more abstract investments then deciding what businesses are interesting to you and running the numbers to see what they 're likely to return as income then making up your mind whether real estate is the winner from that group is likely to produce better decisions among other things it helps you remember to focus on all the costs of the business when doing the math do n't forget that income from the business is taxed at income rates not investment rates and do n't forget that you 're making a bet on the future of that neighborhood as well as the future of that house changes in demographics or housing stock or business climate could all affect what rents you can charge as well as the value of the property and not necessarily in the same direction it may absolutely be the right place to put some of your money it may not explore all the possible outcomes before making the bet and decide whether you 're willing to do the work needed to influence which ones are more likely

i think many of you are making unrelated comments and taking unjustified conclusions from the news without reading the research many of the mentioned share provisions are not exclusive to silicon valley technology firms or the rest of private equity i.e. ex vc   the paper says   gt;these generous terms are not necessarily evidence of active post money valuation manipulation and could simply be due to a difficult fund raising environment   and   our discussion does not imply that these terms were given for the purpose of manipulating spacex ’s value   that is not to say that i am not skeptical of many of the business models and valuations of the companies in the sample but that is off the research topic    what the authors suggests is that valuation is often by many people in the industry and provides some relevant cases from mutual funds who market those shares at the value of the most recent funding round regardless of share provisions to employees that wrongly perceive their wealth   i have some trouble accepting brownian motion to model exit prices or pretty much anything else it seems a bit off from reality but nevertheless i think the paper is worth the read

yes depending on what you 're trying to achieve if its just a symbolic gift you can use a service like this there are several companies providing this service look them up but the prices are fairly the same you 'll end up getting a real stock certificate but it will cost a lot of overhead around $ 40 to get the certificate and then another $ 40 to deposit it into a brokerage account if you want to sell it on a stock exchange so although the certificate is real and the person whose name on it is a full blown shareholder it does n't actually have much value unless you buy a google or apple stock where the price is much much higher than the fees take into account that it takes around 2 months for the certificate to be issued and mailed to you so time accordingly otherwise you can open a custodial brokerage account and use it to buy stocks for the minor both ways are secure and legal each for its own purpose and with its own fees

i think it 's great that you want to contribute course instructor you may want to take a look at becoming an instructor for a course like dave ramsey 's financial peace university these are commonly offered through churches and other community venues for a fee this may be a good fit if you want to focus on basic financial literacy setting up and sticking to a budget and getting their financial house in order it may not be a good fit if you do n't want to teach an existing curriculum or if you find the tenets of the course too unpalatable a significant number of the people in dave 's audience are close to or in the middle of a financial meltdown and so his advice includes controversial ideas such as avoiding credit altogether often because that 's how they got into their current mess counselor if you want to run your own show i know of several people who have built their own practice that is run along the lines of a counselor charging hourly rates and they work with couples who are having money problems building a reputation and a network of referring counselors and professionals is key here and definitely seems like it would require a full time commitment i would avoid credit counseling and the like most of these organizations are focused on restructuring credit card debt not spending time on behavioral change you do n't need a series 7 63 65 etc or even a cfa i 've previously acquired a number of these and can confirm that they are investment credentials that are intended to help you get a job and/or get more business as a broker or conventional financial planner i.e. salesperson of securities the process is necessary to protect consumers from advice that serves the investment sales force but is bad for the consumer and because you must be licensed to provide investment advice there is a class of fee only financial planners but they primarily deal with complex issues that allow them to make money and often give away basic personal finance advice for free in the form of articles podcasts etc   charity for part time or free work in my area there are also several charity organizations that help people do their taxes and provide basic budgeting and personal finance instruction but this is very localized and may vary quite a bit depending on where you live however if there are none near you you can always start one journalism if you have an interest in writing there are also people who work as journalists and write columns books or newsletters and it is much easier now to publish and build a network online either on your own through a blog or contributing to a website speaker at community events there are also many opportunities to speak to a specific community such as a church or social organization for example where i live there are local organizations for spanish speaking polish speaking elderly young professional young mother and retiree groups for example all of who might be interested in your advice on issues that specifically address their needs good luck

a practical issue is that insider trading transfers wealth from most investors to the few insiders if this were permitted non insiders would rarely make any money and they 'd stop investing that would then defeat the purpose of the capital markets which is to attract capital a moral issue is that managers and operators of a company should act in shareholders interests insider trading directly takes money from other shareholders and transfers it to the insider it 's a nasty conflict of interest and would allow any ceo of a public company to make ton of money quickly regardless of their job performance in short shareholders and management should succeed or suffer together so their interests are as aligned as possible and managers have the proper incentives

someone who filed for bankruptcy multiple times be running national finances at a time when we have a big debt problem   his answer   i 've never filed for bankruptcy   um to say the least this is semantics i would classify it as an outright lie   i say that because he the name on everything he is the president ceo chairman of the board he is responsible until things go south then the investors and debtors are left with an empty shell   here are some examples   trump plaza hotel bankruptcy on nov 2 1992 trump 's plaza hotel was forced to file chapter 11 bankruptcy protection after being unable to make its debt payments under the plan trump agreed to give up a 49 stake in this luxury hotel to citibank and five other lenders    trump shuttle closure the trump shuttle became no more when it merged with shuttle inc operating as shuttle in 1992   donald trump personal bankruptcy by 1994 trump slashed a large portion of his $ 900 million personal debt and washed away $ 3.5 billion in his portfolio 's business debt   trump hotels amp casino resorts bankruptcy on november 21 2004 trump 's company filed for bankruptcy trump said the filing was really just a technical thing as the best way to implement a restructuring plan   donald trump personal bankruptcy again once again trump filed for personal bankruptcy protection and restructured his debt in 2004   bankruptcy on november 22 2006 donald j. trump ’s casino empire filed for bankruptcy protection after months of negotiations with bondholders over restructuring a crushing debt   donald trump 's online travel search engine was launched in 2006 just a year later it folded   trump 29 casino now known as spotlight 29 casino because donald trump 's ownership management involvement ended in 2006   donald trump ocean resort baja this mexican resort was never built and investor 's deposits up to $ have not been returned trump claims these buyers are lucky because they would have lost more money in a tanking market had the projects been actually built   trump towers tampa trump is being sued right now in tampa florida for taking deposits on a condo tower that he never built none of the buyers got their $ 45,000 deposits back and in an ironic twist initial sales of this condo were so successful that all deposits were returned to charge a higher price   trump international hotel and tower chicago trump built the second tallest building in chicago he also defaulted on a $ 40 million loan rather than having to pay the bank loan trump demanded the same bank should pay him $ 3 billion for undermining the project and damaging his reputation   trump magazine trump 's private labeled publication which was aimed at affluent readers in major us markets suffered from ad sales it folded on may 19 2009 this was trump 's third failed attempt at offering a magazine bearing his name   trump international hotel amp tower new orleans if constructed this trump tower would become the tallest building in the city of new orleans and the state of louisiana at 70 stories high but the project was put on hold in february of 2009   trump entertainment resort holdings bankruptcy on february 17 2009 casino operator trump entertainment resorts inc filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy protection with a debt ratio of $ 50 million in assets to his $ 500 million in debt   donald trump hotel condominium donald trump was sued for fraud over his new york condo offering in 2010 the lawsuit by 15 plaintiffs alleged that during the first 18 months of marketing trump advertised that the building was 30 40 50 60 percent or more sold when in fact just 16 of the units were sold   trump ocean resort baja mexico instead of a luxury vacation home complex with pools and tennis courts this project is shaping up to be a legal battle with a big hole in the ground dozens of angry buyers sued trump for failing to complete the project trump claims he only lent his name to the project and it was the developers who allowed the project to fail   trump international hotel amp tower fort lauderdale construction was to be completed by the end of 2009 featuring hotel condominium units having defaulted on a $ million loan donald trump announced in november of 2010 he was no longer affiliated with the project   trump international hotel amp tower las vegas through the end of february 2010 the condominium hotel had only closed on units that equates to a vacancy rate it was forced into renting out the building as apartments   trump international hotel amp tower in dubai this mixed used building on the palm ’s golden mile was first announced in 2005 construction was never started and the $ 2.9 billion project had been canceled and replaced with a shopping mall   so back to your distinction has he filed for personal bk   no   has he filed for personal bk protection while he reorganized debt yes   does he manipulate the corporate bk laws by playing a corp shell game and filing for bk protection yes   is it smart business

googling vanguard target asset allocation led me to this page on the bogleheads wiki which has detailed breakdowns of the target retirement funds that page in turn has a link to this vanguard pdf which goes into a good level of detail on the construction of these funds portfolios i excerpt to the question of why so much weight in equities in our view two important considerations justify an expectation of an    equity risk premium the first is the historical record in the past    and in many countries stock market investors have been rewarded with    such a premium   historically bond returns have lagged equity returns by about    percentage points annualized amounting to an enormous return    differential in most circumstances over longer time periods    consequently retirement savers investing only in safe assets must    dramatically increase their savings rates to compensate for the lower    expected returns those investments offer the second strategic principle underlying our    construction that younger investors are better able to withstand    risk recognizes that an individual ’s total net worth consists of both    their current financial holdings and their future work earnings for    younger individuals the majority of their ultimate retirement wealth    is in the form of what they will earn in the future or their human    capital therefore a large commitment to stocks in a younger    person ’s portfolio may be appropriate to balance and diversify risk    exposure to work related earnings to the question of how the exact allocations were decided as part of the process of evaluating and identifying an appropriate    glide path given this theoretical framework we ran various    financial simulations using the vanguard capital markets model we    examined different risk reward scenarios and the potential    implications of different glide paths and approaches the pdf is highly readable i would say and includes references to quant articles for those that like that sort of thing

from investopedia a stock split is usually done by companies that have seen their share    price increase to levels that are either too high or are beyond the    price levels of similar companies in their sector the primary motive    is to make shares seem more affordable to small investors even though    the underlying value of the company has not changed from wikipedia it is often claimed that stock splits in and of themselves lead to    higher stock prices research however does not bear this out what    is true is that stock splits are usually initiated after a large run    up in share price stock splits do increase the liquidity of a stock    there are more buyers and sellers for 10 shares at $ 10 than 1 share at    $ 100 some companies have the opposite strategy by refusing to split    the stock and keeping the price high they reduce trading volume    berkshire hathaway is a notable example of this something more to on why warren buffett is against stock splits

one of the best things you can do for this purpose while getting a modest roi on a passive investment is invest in a company that profitably does whatever you want to see more of for example you could invest in a for profit company that sells needed goods to low income people at lower prices   something like wal mart which is one of the most effective anti poverty engines in the us   you might also say the same of something like aldi owner of aldi stores and trader joe 's which is a discount store chain   this is true even though a company like wal mart is seeking to make money first   its customer base tends to skew heavily towards low income consumers and historically to rural and elderly consumers   when wal mart is able to provide food clothing appliances and the like to poor people at a lower cost it is making it marginally less painful to have a low income peter can explain why wal mart is a humanitarian enterprise walmart ’s customer base is heavily concentrated in the bottom income quintile which spends heavily on food the bottom income quintile spends about 25 percent of income on food compared to just 3.5 percent for the top quintile so the benefits of walmart ’s substantially lower prices to the lowest earning cohort are huge especially on food as points out this view of wal mart dramatically lowering prices that low income people pay for food was by an obama adviser that 's just one company   you can pick the industry and company that best suits your personal preferences alternatively you could invest in something like whole foods a company with multiple missions to improve the planet and the community in addition to the more typical mission of being a prosperous retail chain of course as a general proposition a less than entirely altruistic charity inclined investment does n't need to be targeted at those with low incomes or at saving the planet   you could invest in almost anything you think is good yachts yo energy production industrial inputs music performances and the company will take care of making more of that good thing   you did n't say whether your goal was to help the poor the planet arts sciences knowledge community or whatever what i understand you to be saying is you are willing to accept a lower roi in exchange for some warm from your investment   that seems perfectly valid and reasonable to me but it makes it much more subjective and particular to your tastes   so you 'll need to pick something that 's meaningful to you   if you 're going to trade roi for positive feelings then you should pick whatever gives you your optimal blend of emotions and returns alternatively you could invest in something stable and predictable to beat inflation some sort of index or fund and then annually use some portion of those profits to simply give to the charity of your choice   your investment and your charity do not necessarily need to be the same vehicle

so basically i wanted to know how to calculate that how much should i be paying for car or rent etc i 'm not big on percentages   instead i prefer hard numbers based on what you owe and what you earn here are rules of successful budgeting which i developed when deep in debt   they apply to everyone after going through this exercise you definitely might realize that you need to move to a less expensive apartment or trade your car in for something smaller drink less etc or even get a second job

i too am a full monthly statement balance payer and i received a balance transfer offer from my credit card company this one was quite different from many others that i have read about on this forum i could do a balance transfer for any amount up to $ x from another credit card or use the checks to pay   some other non credit card bills and i would not have to pay any interest for 12 months on the amount thus borrowed   but there would be a 2 service charge on the amount i was borrowing this amount would be billed on the next monthly statement and it would have to be paid in full by the due date of that month 's payment that is within the grace period allowed for payment of monthly statements else interest would start being charged on the unpaid part of the service charge at the usual rate of per month if i had not paid the previous month 's balance in full i would be charged interest at per month on the service charge starting from day one no free ride till the due date of the next month 's statement of course the balance carried over from last month would also be charged interest at if i had paid last month 's bill in full but there were any other charges purchases during the current month then   unless the entire amount due this month 's purchases plus service charge and that interest free for twelve months loan   balance was paid off within the grace period my purchases would be deemed unpaid and would start being charged interest in short the only way to avoid paying interest on the amount borrowed was to start with a card showing a $ 0 balance due on the previous month 's statement not make any charges on that card for a whole year and pay off that 2 service charge within the grace period it might also have required that one of that interest free loan be repaid each month but   i had stopped reading the offer at this point and filed it in the round circular file in short while @joetaxpayer 's tale of how as a pay in full user i 've used the zero rate to throw $ 20 k at the 5.25 mortgage is undoubtedly how things worked once it is not at all clear that they still work that way at least they do n't work that way for me   heck once upon a time for a period of about 3 months you could earn 1.5 interest per month from the credit card company by overpaying your credit card bill considerably their computers then just added on 1.5 interest by multiplying your credit balance by and so you got 1.5 per month interest from the credit card company the credit card agreements and the software got changed in a hurry and all credit card agreements state in the fine print that if you overpay your bill you do n't earn any interest on the overpayment

has a couple of articles on this topic how investing taxes work part 1 and part 2 the following is a summary of that article capital gains and dividends are taxed at a preferred rate while interest tax is taxed at your regular rate interest is taxed at your marginal rate but capital gains are taxed at only 50 of your marginal rate that means that it makes sense to place the interest bearing account inside the rrsp but keep stocks outside additionally you can claim your losses on your capital appreciating stocks against your gains if they are outside of your rrsp hopefully your stocks will never go down but that 's not very realistic dividends from canadian companies are eligible for a dividend tax credit but not dividends from foreign companies i actually understood that dividends from u.s. companies are treated as a special case it 's not clear to me from reading the article how much of this applies to mutual funds the summary is as follows

people buy stocks because there is more to return on investment than whether dividends are issued or not some people want ownership and the ability to influence decisions by using the rights associated with their class of stock another reason would be to park capital in a place that would grow faster than the rate of inflation these are only a few of many reasons why people would buy stock

i remember in the 19th and early 20th century was the problem of trusts set up by the wealthy to avoid taxes hence the term anti trust that 's not what antitrust means   the trusts in that case were monopolies that used their outsized influence to dominate customers and suppliers   they were n't for tax evasion purposes   trusts were actually older than a permanent income tax   antitrust law was passed around the same time as a permanent income tax becoming legal   prior to that income taxes were temporary taxes imposed to pay for wars    the primary ways to evade taxes was to move expenses out of the personal and into businesses or charities   the business could pay for travel hotels meals and expenses   or a charity could pay for a trip as a promotion activity the infamous safari to africa scheme   charities can pay salaries to employees so someone could fund a charity tax deductible and then use that money to pay people rather than giving gifts   if you declare your house as a historical landmark a charity could maintain it    subscribe to magazines at the office and set them in the waiting room after you read them   use loyalty program rewards from business expenses for personal things   sign up for a benefit for all employees at a steep discount and pay everyone a little less as a result   barter   you do something for someone else e.g. give them a free car and they return the favor   call it marketing or promotion trump is carried away from his tower in a new mercedes benz limousine    another option is to move income and expenses to another tax jurisdiction that has even fewer laws about it   where the united states increasingly cracked down on personal expenses as business expenses many jurisdictions would be happy just to see the money flow through and sit in their banks briefly    tax policy is different now than it was then   many things that would have worked then would n't work now   the irs is more aggressive about insisting that some payments be considered income even if the organization writes the check directly to someone else   it 's unclear what would happen if united states tax rates went back to the level they had in the fifties or even the   would tax evasion become again   or would it stay closer to current levels    the rich actually pay a higher percentage of the overall income taxes now than they did in the and fifties   and the rich in the united states pay a higher percentage of the taxes paid than the rich in other countries with higher marginal rates   some of this may be more rich people in the us than other countries but tax policy is part of that too   high income taxes make it hard to become rich

the only way you will incur underpayment penalties is if you withhold less than 90 of the current year 's tax liability or 100 of last years tax liability whichever is smaller   so as long as your total tax liability last year not what you paid at filing but what you paid for the whole year was more than $ you should not have any penalty what you pay or get back when you file will be your total tax liability less what was withheld for example you had $ withheld from your pay for taxes   if after deduction and other factors your tax liability is $ you will owe $ 111 when you file   on the other hand if your tax liability is only $ 1,000 you 'll get a refund of $ when you file since you 've had more withheld that what you owe since your income was only for part of the year and tax tables assume that you make that much for the whole year i would suspect that you over withheld during your internship which would offset the lack of withholding on the other $ 6,000 in income

no it is n't generally believed that inflation is caused by individual banks printing money   governments manage money supply through central banks which may or may not be independent of the state there are a number of theories about money supply and inflation from monetarist to keynesian and so on the quantity theory of inflation says that long term inflation is the result of money supply but short term inflation is related to events local conditions short term inflation is a symptom of economic change   it 's like a cough for a doctor   it simply indicates an underlying event when prices go up it encourages new producers to enter the market create new supply which will then act to lower prices   in this way inflation is managed by ensuring that information travels throughout the economy   if prices go up for specific goods then all things being equal supply should go up since the increase implies increasing demand   if prices go down then this implies demand has gone down and so producers will reduce supply obviously this is n't a perfect relationship   there is which can be caused by a whole bunch of market conditions from banning of short selling to of demand supply your question is n't about quantitative easing which is a state led way of increasing money supply and which could increase inflation but is hoped to increase expenditure and investment so i wo n't cover that here the important take away is that inflation is an essential price signal to investors and business people so that they can assess market cycles   without it we would end up with vast or under supply and much greater economic disruption

first excellent choice to say no to non subsidized loans but i 'd say you are cutting things very close either way and you need to face up to that now   $ extra at the end of the month is within the noise of financial life meaning you should think of it as essentially $ 0 each month or even negative money since one vet bill school books unforeseen problem could remove it for the entire year easily   you are leaving yourself no buffer but by taking the loan unless you are as joe said socking away savings to pay for it upon graduation you are guaranteeing you 'll leave college with debt which i think should be avoided if you can   could you do a hybrid plan in which you worked hard to do the following if you do these things or something along these lines the loan is probably ok if not i 'd be concerned about taking it probably unnecessary but keep in mind that student loans are not by bankruptcy so one is on the hook for them no matter what also consider whether you can take a semester off now and then to catch up financially   the key is to really stay far from the edge of any financial

for personal investing and highly risky securities wasting assets which is exactly what options are it is better to think in terms of sunk costs do n't chase this trade trying to make your money back you should minimize your loss unwind the position now while there is still some remaining value in those call options and take a short term loss or you could try this   let 's say you own an exchange traded call option on a listed stock very general case i do n't know how much time remains before the option 's expiration date be that as it may i could suggest this to effect a recovery   you 'll be long the call and short the stock this is called a delta hedge as you would be delta trading the stock delta refers to short term price volatility   in other words you 'll short a single large block of the stock then buy shares in small increments whenever the market drops slightly on an intra day basis when the market price of the stock rises incrementally you 'll sell a few shares back and forth in response to short term market price moves while maintaining a static hedge ratio as your original call option gets closer to maturity roll it over into the next available contract either one month or preferably three month time to expiration if you do n't want to or ca n't borrow the underlying stock to short you could do a synthetic short a synthetic short is a combination of a long put and a short call whose pay off replicates the short stock payoff   i personally would never purchase an unhedged option or warrant but since that is what you own right now you have two choices get out or dig in deeper with the realization that you are doing a lot of work just to trade your way back to a net zero   while you can make a profit using this sort of strategy i 'm not certain if that is within the scope of the website

i struggled with this one at first    it 's easiest if you temporarily ignore the mathematical machinery of and go back to the derivation that black and scholes provide in their 1973 paper they basically show that when you construct a portfolio consisting of a long position in the option the one being priced and a short position on the replicating portfolio consisting of shares of stock and cash in the risk free bank account then that portfolio will be entirely risk less and hence will earn the risk free rate of interest this makes intuitive sense if you think about it every change in the value of the option is going to be countered by an opposite change in the replicating portfolio by no arbitrage that composite portfolio the option + the replicating portfolio must therefore earn the risk free rate    the fact that the composite portfolio earns the risk free rate provides the connection to martingale pricing    recall that a martingale is basically a stochastic process that has no drift only volatility here it 's useful to think of the drift as being the risk   premium or return of a particular asset like the stock    what martingale pricing theory says is that to find the price of the option we 1 discount the value of the replicating portfolio by the cash bond the asset and 2 turn the stochastic process of the risky asset in the replicating portfolio into a martingale this move intuitively makes sense because the black scholes derivation shows that the replicating portfolio + the option must earn the risk free rate but if you divide the value of the black scholes replicating portfolio by the asset you 're going to cancel out that risk free rate e.g. have a martingale   i 'm not a so please correct me if i 've something up in my explanation    i say basically because there are some technical conditions that need to be fulfilled but that 's generally true

i just read through all of the answers to this question and there is an important point that no one has mentioned yet oftentimes buying a house is actually cheaper than renting the identical house i 'm looking around my area suburbs of chicago il in 2017 and seeing some houses that are both for sale and for rent which makes for an easy comparison if i buy the house with $ 0 down you ca n't actually put $ 0 down but it makes the numerical comparison more accurate if you do my monthly payment including mortgage taxes insurance and hoa is still $ 400 less than the monthly rent payment if i put 20 down it 's an even bigger savings so in addition to the the tax advantages of owning a home the locked in price that helps you in an economy that experiences inflation and the accumulated equity you may even have extra cash flow too if you were on the fence when you would have had to pay more per month in order to purchase it should be a no brainer to buy if your monthly cost is lower from the original question get a loan and buy a house or i can live for the rest of my life in rent and save the extra money investing and stuff well you may be able to buy a house and save even more money than if you rent of course this is highly dependent on your location

j gruber 's consulting reports for the various states minnesota wisconsin etc     and the article it addresses which included some numbers from the reports     note that gruber has made a whole spectrum of claims from initially claiming that premiums would go down for a consulting agreement with the obama administration to later revisions showing significant increases to varying degrees depending on the individuals specific demographic to wit   ’s new reports are in direct contrast obama ’s words and with claims gruber himself made in 2009 then the economics professor said that based on figures provided by the independent congressional budget office health care reform will significantly reduce not increase non group premiums   gt;during his presentation to wisconsin officials in august 2011 gruber revealed that while about 57 percent of those who get their insurance through the individual market will benefit in one way or another from the law ’s an even larger majority of the individual market will end up paying drastically more overall   the application of tax subsidies 59 percent of the individual market will experience an average premium increase of 31 percent gruber reported   gt;the reason for this is that an estimated 40 percent of wisconsin residents who are covered by individual market insurance do n’t meet the affordable care act ’s minimum coverage requirements under the affordable care act they will be required to purchase more expensive plans   for his own explanation for the expected health insurance rate hikes gruber told that his reports reflect the high cost of folding state high risk pools into the federal government 's exchange without using the money the state was already spending to subsidize those high risk pools   note emphasis added     note 2 to begin with an average increase of 31 qualifies as significant hell it 's a lot more than merely significant that 's a huge increase and secondly that is an average meaning that while some of the people in that 59 will probably not see such a high increase a fairly large segment and per the provisions of the act versus current premium calculation methods we know these will be young healthy singles and especially males will face increases that are substantially higher than 31 and in fact will probably be in the nature of double or triple previous premiums as would be required in order to meet another provision of the act that highest premiums for older pool members can not be higher than 3x that of the youngest lowest tier premiums and if the company is to balance the books it can only bring down the one end if it makes a compensating increase at the other end   none of that is rocket science and it is entirely predictable the only things that would be odd would be that anyone should expect anything different and that gruber 's initial claims of across the board lower costs were ever accepted in the first place

here 's another rational reason discount this typically works only in smaller stores where you 're talking directly to the owners but it is sometimes possible to negotiate a few percent off the price when paying by check since otherwise they 'd have to give a few percent to the credit card company occasionally the sales reps at larger stores have the authority to cut this deal but it 's far less common not worth worrying about on small items but if you 're making a large purchase a bedroom suite for example it can pay for lunch and sometimes the store 's willing to give you more discount than that simply because with checks they do n't have to worry about chargebacks or some of the other that can occur in credit card processing another reason nobody 's very likely to steal you check number and try to write themselves a second check or otherwise use it without authorization it 's just too easy to steal credit card info these days to make printing checks worth the effort but in the end the real answer is that there 's no rational reason not to use checks so it takes you a few seconds more to complete the transaction what were you going to do with those seconds that makes them valuable especially if they 're seconds that the store is spending your purchase so there 's no lost time and the effort really is n't all that different from signing the credit card authorization quoting dean there are two kinds of fool one says this is old and therefore good the other says this is new and therefore better

first if it is in any way a joint account the debt usually goes to the surviving person assets in joint accounts usually have their own instructions on how to disperse the assets for example full joint bank accounts usually immediately go to the other name on the account and never become part of the estate non cash assets will likely need to be converted to cash and a fair market valuation shown to the probate court unless the debts can be paid without using them and they can be transferred to next of kin if after that the deceased has any assets at all there is usually varies by state a legally defined order in which debtor types must be paid this is handled by the estate there is a period during which you publish a death notice and then wait for debt claims and bills to arrive then pay as many as possible based on the priority and inform the others the holder is deceased and the estate is empty this sometimes needs to be approved by a judge if the assets are less than the debts then disperse remaining assets to next of kin if there are no assets held by just the deceased as you get bills you just send a certified copy of the death certificate tell them there is no estate then forget about them a lawyer can really help in determining which need to be paid and to work through probate which is not simple or cheap but also note that you can negotiate and sometimes get them to accept less if there are assets when my mother died the doctors treating her zeroed her accounts the hospitals accepted a much reduced total but the credit cards wanted 100

i think you raise a very good point here    it is a very well known fact that the us is not a leader in automated manufacturing europe has traditionally been the place that consumes the majority of the automated manufacturing equipment that in turn comes out of japan    japan specializes in the manufacture of automated manufacturing equipment and has since the us this market to them in the 1950s offering the japanese access to the technology created at general motors called ladder logic and logic controllers these technologies were created from scratch on the shop floor at general motors at a time when there was a saying that what is good for general motors is good for the america   this was back before were affordable those early manufacturing robots actually used of and ladder logic which is still used till this days in the robots that come out of japan is still based on although they are now virtual    the japanese ran with the tech and now many people believe that the japanese invented it certainly they refined it over the years but the early work was handed to them in part as an effort to win them over from their potential allegiance with the japan was always a much larger lynch pin than either korea or vietnam where the actual military battles went down what was really scary to america was losing japan and the transfer of robotics technology to the japanese was part of the arrangement to keep them cozy with the us military empire    but the largest customer was not within japan the actual sales of equipment went to the europeans that 's where automated manufacturing is currently at its peak however things have been rapidly changing and for over a decade the fastest rising automation market has been china    currently foxconn or the large contract manufacturer famous for their apple contracts is in the process of building an automation base in the middle of taiwan    if you want jobs in automated manufacturing technology you should be studying chinese as well as

some questions will you need a car after 18 months   what are you going to do then how likely are you able to go over the mileage granted paying $ 300 per month seems somewhat attractive as a fixed cost   however lease are notorious for forcing people into making bad decisions   if your car is over miles or there is some slight damage even normal wear and tear or you customize your car such as window the dealer can demand extra dollars or force you to purchase the car for more than it is actually worth    the bottom line is leasing is one of the most expensive ways to own a vehicle and while you have a great income you have a poor net worth   so yes i would say it is somewhat irresponsible for you to own a vehicle if i was in your shoes i would cut my gym expenses cut my retirement contributions to the match and buy another used car   i understand you may have some over your last car but it is the best mathematical choice having said all that you have a great income and you can absorb a lot of less than efficient decisions   you will probably be okay leasing the car   i would suggest going for a longer term or cutting something to pay off the student loans earlier   this way there is some cushion between when the lease ends and the student loan ends    this way when lease turn in comes you will have some room in your budget to pay some fees as you wo n't have your student loan payment assuming around that you can then pay to the dealer

this conclusion is highly misleading although they lead with the 90 figure   i can not for the life of me see it substantiated in the data    according to their own information which by the way preferences   not actual purchases the actual number is between 55 and 80 only by including every item that you saw first in store tried out at a store bought at a store or returned to a store can you get to the 90 figure they are n't talking purchases at all   personally i go out shopping all the time and see something cool and put it back on the shelf because i know that it is cheaper on amazon somehow this study uses that as proof that retail stores are winning    he who converts sales wins not him who gives free advertising for the other guy

ponder this suppose that a reputable company or government were to come out and say hey we are going to issue some 10 year bonds at 6.4 anyone interested in buying some assume that the company or government is financially solid and there is zero chance that they will go bankrupt think those bonds would sell would you be interested in buying such a bond well i would wager that these bonds would sell like despite the fact that the long term stock market return beats it by a half percent heck vanguard 's junk bond fund is hot right now it only yields 4.9 and those are junk bonds not rock solid companies see vanguard high yield corporate bond fund every time you make an extra principal payment on your student loan you are effectively purchasing a investment with a rock solid guaranteed 6.4 return for 10 years or whatever time you have left on the loan if make no extra payments on top of that paying off a loan early builds your credit reputation improves your monthly cash flow once the loan is paid may increase your purchasing power for a house or car and if nothing else it frees you from being a slave to that debt payment every month   edit improved wording based on ross 's comment

debit cards with the visa or mastercard symbol on them work technically everywhere where credit cards work there are some limitations where the respective business does not accept them for example car rentals want a credit card for potential extra charges but most of the time for day to day shopping and dining debit cards work fine however you should read up the potential risks a credit card gives you some security by incorrect fraudulent charges from your account and credit card companies also help you reverse incorrect charges before you ever have to pay for it if you use a debit card it is your money on the line immediately any incorrect charge even takes your money from your account and it is gone while you work on reversing the charge any theft and your account can be cleaned out and you will be without money while you go after the thief many people consider the debit card risk too high and do n't use them for this reason however many people do use them it is up to you

note the main trade off here is the costs of holding cash rather than being invested for a few months vs trading costs from trading every month   let 's start by understanding investing every month vs every three months   first compare holding cash for two months at for most canadians right now and then investing on the third month vs being invested in a single stock etf ~5 annually   at those rates she is forgoing equity returns of around   these costs and the $ 10 for one big trade give total costs of $ dollars    if you were to trade every month instead there would be no cost for not being invested and the trading costs over three months would just be   so in this case it would be better to trade monthly instead of every three months however i 'm guessing you do n't trade all $ 2000 into a single etf   the more etfs you trade the more trading more infrequently would be an advantage   you can redo the above calculations the amount across more etfs and including the added trading costs to get a feel for what is best   you can also rotate as suggests but that can leave you unbalanced temporarily if not done carefully   a second option would be to find a discount broker that allows you to trade the etfs you are interested in for free   this is not always possible but often will be for those investing in index funds   for instance i trade every month and have no brokerage costs dollar cost averaging and value averaging are for people investing a single large amount instead of regular monthly amounts   unless the initial amount is much much larger than the monthly amounts this is probably not worth considering edit hopefully the above edits will clarify that i was comparing the costs including the forgone returns of trading every 3 months vs trading every month

your understanding of the stock market is absolutely correct theoretically however there is a lot more to it a stock on a given day is effected by a lot of factors these factors could really be anything for example if you are buying a stock in an agricultural company and there was no this year there is a big chance that your stock will lose value there is also a chance that a war breaks out tomorrow and due to all the government spending on the war the economy collapses and effects the prices of stocks why does this happen this happens because bad or war can get people to lose confidence in a stock market on the other hand gdp growth and low unemployment rates can make people think positive and increase the demand in a stock driving the prices up the main factor in the stock market is people perceive certain news this causes a stock to rise or fall even before the event actually happens for weather pundits predicted good for next year that news is already known to people so if the weather was correct it might not drive the prices up however if the was way better than people expected it to be it would drive the price up and vice versa    these are just examples at a basic level there are a lot of other factors which determine the price of the stock the best way to look at my personal opinion is the way warren buffet puts it i.e. look at the stock as a business and see the potential growth over a long period of time   there will be unexpected events but in the long run the business must be profitable there are various ways to value a company such as price to earnings ratios peg ratios discounted cash flows and you can also create your own see what works best for you and record your success failure ratio before you actually put money in   good luck

so has observed a lot of irresponsible spending from a parent which has so for life ok so we 've got fear so is not very financially savvy and has very little idea about how much we earn   and ignorance    you are entirely correct to worry about the conversation fear plus ignorance equals disastrous conversations i manage our finances apparently your so wishes to have input on the management of your finances without understanding them it strikes me that this serves neither of you well i would note that it is exceedingly difficult to rationally argue someone out of a position that they arrived at through irrational fear and ignorance so i would n't start by having a conversation about charitable giving at all rather i would start by addressing the ignorance because that 's the easy one   how high up we are in terms of being in the top y% of households by income income is irrelevant to the fearful income can vanish with debts remaining if your so is not earning much of that income then so 's future financial security is dependent on the whims of another which has already turned out badly once for so   focusing on raw income is the wrong way to go focusing on an abstraction like percentile is even more irrelevant the figures to focus on are not income and percentile but rather net worth and change in net worth over time   income $ 300 k expenses $ 350 k eventually leads to poverty if you lack net worth even if you are in the 1 of income earners open up with how much do you think we earn playing rhetorical games with ignorant people seems both risky and perhaps unethical to me and it seems unlikely to trust i would approach this situation by first removing the ignorance rather than attempting to take advantage of it for rhetorical purposes   i would also institute a policy that ignorant people do n't get a say if so wants to financial responsibility to you then so should accept your decisions without question if so wants to have a say in your joint financial life then so has a responsibility to make recommendations based on both facts and feelings not just feelings so how to remove this ignorance this will take some doing but not much go through your records and account for from that you can compute your net worth then go back a few years and account for from this you can show the effect of your past prudent decisions on your net worth there should be no percentages there should be no math more complicated than adding and subtracting and it should be very clear what adds and to what   people who are financially savvy are extremely intimidated by jargon if some of your increase in net worth came from a realized capital gain less taxes do not say realized capital gain less taxes on your summary document there should be no depreciation or cost basis or anything even vaguely like that even assets and liabilities are too possessions and debts are more easily understood i 'm thinking something like my so is financially savvy and still i do this about twice a year it 's helpful for both of us to have a quick summary of what 's coming in what 's going out and what we 've got once the ignorance is gone then start working on the fear it sounds like the fear comes from a betrayal of trust so it 's not just enough to be trustworthy you 've got to consistently appear trustworthy a great way to do that is to keep doing what i already suggested on a regular ongoing basis inform so of how you are doing financially when so sees that net worth is consistently improving over time that you are not one bad decision away from poverty the fear should diminish expect this to take a long time

in the case of regulated exchange traded options the writer of an options contract is obliged to maintain a margin with their broker and the broker is obliged to maintain a margin with the clearing house   institutional writers of options will deal directly with the clearing house in the event that the writer is unable to make a daily margin call the broker or clearing house may automatically close out all of their positions using existing margin held   if there was a shortfall the broker or clearing house would be left to the client writer to make good on their obligations none of this effects the position of the original buyer of the options contract   effectively the buyer 's counterparty is their broker 's clearing house account

a subsidy is a payment made by a group usually the state to individuals or corporations in order to shift the balance if the rational economic decision for the individual would be detrimental to the group as a whole otherwise for example if there are different quality kinds of crops that can be planted for example a gm that brings in high yields but can only be processed to high corn syrup or a naturally bred corn that brings lower yields but tastes well enough for direct consumption then if demand for both exceeds supply the economic choice for the individual farmer is to plant the former if the claims that contribute to obesity are founded then it is in the public interest to produce less of it and more alternative foods given that a market rather than a planned economy is desired this can not be achieved by decree but rather money is used as an incentive in the long term this investment may very well pay off through reduced health care costs so it is a rational economic decision from the state 's point of view in a world where all actors make decisions that are fully in their self interest in principle subsidies would not be needed as consumers would demand healthy rather than cheap foods and market mechanisms would provide these

i would be very careful with annuity products if you do n't mind sharing what are the terms for the annuity   usually i would recommend not to use retirement account to pay off debt mainly because of the penalty that comes from withdrawing prematurely but in this case first of all stop contributing to the annuity account if you 're not contractually obligated second try to convert your annuity assets to more common equity debt products thirdly try to cut back on spending to pay off debt assuming you stopped paying 2x on housing since 30k debt should n't be that hard to pay off with 100k income lastly if all of the above are impossible you can withdraw from that account to pay off your debt

my answer might be out of date due to the affordable health care law   i will answer for the way things were prior to that law taking effect in my experience hospitals have a financial assistance program you can apply for   if you can show a financial need the hospital will only charge you a certain percentage of your bill   a person with a very low income will likely only be charged 5 or 10 of the theoretical balance   that would be assuming the person is at or near the poverty level which has an official definition but to give you an idea your cashier at mcdonald 's is probably at or near the poverty level also note that sometimes it takes a while for hospital charges to be submitted to insurance and to be approved and paid   thus many people have learned through experience to ignore the first bill that comes in from a hospital and wait a month before paying there can be a dramatic drop in the what you owe line after the insurance company responds and the billing office adjusts the bill to the negotiated amount and subtracts off what the insurance company covered

after tax contributions to a 401k are after tax    the earnings on that money is taxable but not the contributions this means you 'll have $ 15,000 in the 401k and $ 10,000 is considered after tax and $ 5,000 is considered pre tax the after tax portion can be converted to a roth ira without paying taxes or penalties new in september 2014 the irs has made substantial changes that now enable this to happen    you can request a distribution from your 401k provider where they divide the money into pre tax and after tax funds   in my example you 'd get a check for $ 10,000 that you could send to a roth ira and a check for $ 5,000 you could add to a traditional roll over ira neither of those would be taxable events and you 'd end with a roth ira with $ 10 k and a traditional rollover ira with $ 5 k in it notes

while this question is old and i generally agree with the answers given i think there 's another angle that needs a little insurance if you go with an 84 month loan your car will likely be worth less than the amount owed for substantially all of the entire 84 month loan period this will be exacerbated if you put zero down and include the taxes and fees in the amount borrowed   your lender will require you to carry full comprehensive collision liability coverage likely with a low maximum deductible   while the car is underwater it will probably also be a good idea to carry gap insurance because the last thing you want to do is write a check to your lender to shore up the loan to value deficit if the thing is totaled   these long term car loans i 've seen as high as 96 months are a bear when it comes to depreciation and related insurance costs there is more to this decision than the interest calculation    obviously if you had the cash at the front of this decision presumably you 'll have the cash later to pay off the loan at your convenience   but while the loan is outstanding there are costs beyond interest to consider

there are many different kinds of sec filings with different purposes   broadly speaking what they have in common is that they are the ways that companies publicly disclose information that they are legally required to disclose   the page that you listed gives brief descriptions of many types but if you click through to the articles on individual types of filings you can get more info one of the most commonly discussed filings is the 10-k which is as wikipedia says a comprehensive summary of a company 's financial performance   this includes info like earnings and executive pay one example of a form that some people believe has potential utility for investors is form 4 which is a disclosure of insider trading   people with a privileged stake in a company executives directors and major shareholders can not legally buy or sell shares without disclosing it by filing a form 4   some people think that you can make use of this information in the sense that if for instance the ceo of google buys a bunch of twitter stock they may have some reason for thinking it will go up so maybe you should buy it too   whether such inferences are accurate and whether you can garner a practical benefit from them i.e. whether you can manage to buy before everyone else notices and drives the price up is debatable my personal opinion would be that for an average retail investor sec filings is unlikely to be useful   the reason is that an average retail investor should n't be investing in individual companies at all but rather in mutual funds or etfs which typically provide comparable returns with far less risk   sec filings are made by individual companies so it does n't generally help you to read them unless you 're going to take action related to an individual company   it does n't generally make sense to take action related to an individual company if you do n't have the time and energy to read a large number of sec filings to decide which company to take action on   if you have the time and energy to read a large number of sec filings you 're probably not an average retail investor   if you are a wheeler dealer who plays in the big leagues you might benefit from reading sec filings   however if you are n't already reading sec filings you 're probably not a wheeler dealer who plays in the big leagues that said if you 're a currently average investor with big dreams it could be to read a few filings to explore what you might do with them   you could for instance allocate a play money fund of a few thousand dollars and try your hand at following insider trades or the like   if you make some money great if not oh well   realistically though there are so many people who make a living reading sec filings and acting on them every day that you have little chance of finding a diamond in the rough unless you also make a living by doing it every day it 's sort of like asking should i read boating monthly to improve my sailing skills   if you 're asking because you want to rent a cat and go for a pleasure cruise now and then sure it ca n't hurt   if you 're asking because you want to enter the america 's cup you can still read boating monthly but it wo n't in itself meaningfully increase your chances of winning the america 's cup

there are two ways to measure the value of money in the past 1 as victor mentioned there are inflation statistics covering the last 100 or so years that value the currency against an ever changing basket of goods this is sufficient when measuring general inflation over the period of the hundred years where there is data this is how it was measured in your example 2 for older time periods or where a value comparison is required between specific items particularly where these were not in the basket of goods used for the inflation calculation historical records of the price of comparable goods can be used this is in effect the same as mark to market valuations for illiquid financial instruments and requires through records to find the price of either a comparable basket of goods to one that would be used for inflation calculations today or a comparable set of items an example of this is finding the value of a particular type of house say a house in london in the 19th century compared to the same house today by finding records of how much comparable houses would sell for on average then and now this second measure is also used where the country in question did n't or does n't keep reliable inflation statistics which may well be true of colombia in the 90s this means that there is a chance that this way of estimating 's wealth in today 's terms may have also been used another notable reason to use this methodology is that unless you are using exchange rates in purchasing power parity terms the value of money held in different currencies is different this is even true today as the value of $ 1 in inr in india is likely to be higher than the value of a dollar in the us in terms of what you can buy using this methodology allows for a more accurate comparison in values where different countries and currencies are involved

you need to find out if the credit card has been reporting these failed automated payments as late or missed payments to your credit report to do this go to annualcreditreport.com the official site to get your free credit reports and request your report from all three bureaus if you see late or missing payments reported for the months where you made a payment but then they did an automatic payment anyway you should call up the credit card company explain the situation and ask them to retract those negative reports if they refuse you should dispute the reports directly with the credit bureaus if they have been reporting late payments even though you have been making the payments that will impact your credit much more than the fact that they closed your account   unfortunately they can turn off your credit account for any reason they like and there is n't much you can do about that find yourself another job as soon as you can get back on your feet pay off your debt and think very carefully before you open another credit card in the future do n't start a new credit card unless you can ensure that you will pay it off in full every month

the solicitor involved up front should be able to place as your suggesting   i think you should look carefully at the desired wording you deserve a return on your £ 100k say the day after you buy this is hypothetical please bear with me a developer says he needs the property and will give you £ your wording here says you get £ 100k and then after the mortgage split £ 230k but it seems more reasonable that your deposit doubles to £ 200k the remaining £ pays the mortgage and the £ 130k left is split £ 65k each   my method accounts for the value of your £ 100k some would ask why not apply the mortgage rate to that deposit because the home value may grow at a different rate in my opinion it 's fair to apply the home value growth to the £ 100k deposit   fair means different things to different people this is my opinion and a suggestion consider it and do what you and your partner wish use a solicitor put it in writing

bloomberg suggests that two fidelity funds hold preferred shares of snapchat inc preferred shares hold more in common with bonds than with ordinary stock as they pay a fixed dividend have lower liquidity and do n't have voting rights because of this lower liquidity they are not usually offered for sale on the market whether these funds are allowed to hold such illiquid assets is more a question for their strategy document than the law it is completely legal for a company to hold a non marketable interest in another even if the company is privately held as snapchat is the strategy documents governing what the fund is permitted to hold however may restrict ownership either banning non market holdings or restricting the percentage of assets held in illiquid instruments since ipo is very costly funds like these who look to invest in new companies who have not been through ipo yet are a very good way of taking a diversified position in   start ups since they look to invest directly rather than through the market they are an attractive low cost way for start ups to generate funds to grow the fund deals directly with the owners of the company to buy its shares the of the stock value reflects the accounting principle of marking to market financial assets that do not have a trade price so as to reflect their fair value this implies that fidelity believe that the total npv of the company 's net assets is lower than they had previously calculated this probably reflects a lack of revenue streams coming into the business in the case   of snapchat edit by the way since there is no market for start up stocks pre ipo my heart sinks a little every time i read the title of this question i 'm going to be sad all day now

if the irs changes your return in any way including math errors they send a letter explaining the change and the reasons for it you should read that letter it will answer your question usually its a notice if you did n't receive it you can call them and ask to it they 're unlikely to answer over the phone but you can try asking i 'm confused by your using the word estimate your tax return is not supposed to be estimate it supposed to be precise why are you considering your tax return estimate if your filed tax return shows refund of $ x and you received $ then as i said a letter of explanation from the irs is due if you do n't know what the refund amount on your return is and you 're trying to estimate it now you better get a copy of that return

i was n't linking her performance to her gender i do n't think any of these ceo 's are failing because they have a cycle they are just making poor decisions   it is impossible to ignore gender when we are constantly hearing about the tech gap and the puff stories about being a female ceo in a male dominated industry it is entirely relevant

i disagree the article is clear that it is n't necessarily the fault of the individual or their spending habits   gt certainly we can all do the hard work of cutting back on our expenses says but she says the results of this study show something more structural than individual spending   gt people are spending a shockingly large amount of income on housing they have to pay for transportation to get to a job these costs are going up while their wages stay the same

an additional way to get a better grip on the mechanics of what you 're looking to do is to use a paper trading tool for example thinkorswim gives you $ 200k in virtual money to trade money you do n't have to worry about as you might initially make mistakes in trading futures as mentioned above each product has it 's own pricing and trading options on futures derivatives of derivatives is even more confusing so you 'll be well served by a risk free learning tool

he 's calculating portfolio variance the general formula for the variance of a portfolio composed of two securities looks like this   where and are the weights of each stock in the portfolio and the represent the standard deviation risk of each asset or portfolio   in the case of perfect positive or negative correlation applying some algebra to the formula relating covariance to the correlation coefficient the greek letter that looks like p   tells us that the covariance we need in the original formula is simply the product of the standard deviations and the correlation coefficient -1 in this case   combining that result with our original formula yields this calculation   technically we 've calculated the portfolio 's variance and not it 's standard deviation risk but since the square root of 0 is still 0 that does n't matter the wikipedia article on modern portfolio theory has a section that describes the mathematical methods i used above the entire article is worth a read however

yes you could avoid capital gains tax altogether however capital gains are used in determining your tax bracket even though they are not taxed at that rate   this would only work in situations where your total capital gains and ordinary income kept you in the 0 longterm capital gains bracket you ca n't realize a million dollars in capital gains and have no tax burden due to lack of ordinary income you can potentially save some money by realizing capital gains strategically giving up income in an attempt to save on taxes rarely makes sense

you did n't specify where in the world you account is scotiabank operates in many countries however for large amounts where there is a currency conversion involved you are almost guaranteed to be better off going to a specialist currency broker or payments firm rather than using a direct method with your bank such as a wire transfer based on my assumption that your account is in canada one provider who i have personally used with success in transferwise but the best place to compare where is the best venue for you is in the off chance that this is an account with scotiabank in the united states any domestic payment method such as a domestic wire transfer should do the job perfectly well the fees do n't matter for larger amounts as they are a single fee versus a percentage fee like you see with currency conversions

in my opinion it depends on the type of product i would get a warranty for a washing machine or tumble dryer or other product with lots of moving parts that is liable to break down i also take into account my luck the one washing machine i did n't get covered broke down 2 weeks outside the normal warranty period i would not get a warranty for a consumer electronics product like a tv pc or ipod because they devalue so quickly as a rule of thumb if the model you buy today is going to be on sale for the next few years for around the same price and has moving parts it is worth considering a warranty if it will be worth a small percentage of its value because newer faster models come along to replace it do n't bother i would also not get the warranty from the shop i bought the product from you can get warranties for consumer products from specialist third parties that will allow you to cover multiple products for a discount these work out a lot cheaper than the one the shop will give you for example in the uk will cover 3 appliances for £ and 6 for £

exxon mobil is one of the most profitable corporations in the world   their annual earnings are typically in the $ 10s of billions of dollars   they have revenues in the hundreds of billions of dollars per year   they also return $ 10 + billion dollars to their stockholders each year in dividends and stock purchases   that 's with $ market capitalization meaning they return 3 of their total market cap each year to their shareholders aside from any movement in the stock itself on the other hand their total current liabilities are around $   that 's what six months revenue   who 'd you rather lend to exxon or anyone else   aapl and goog maybe better risks but not by much   almost every other company on the planet is a more dangerous risk judging them solely by assets is silly they do n't exactly sit on the oil they extract   they take it out of the ground and sell it to people
