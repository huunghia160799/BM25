you have currency risk either way   the only question is deal with it now or later   no one can tell you which action is better until we look at it in hindsight   you could hedge and move some now some later   invest your usd in us equities and move some to eur and invest that in eur companies i 'd suggest having your money in the same currency as where you are living since for the most part you 'll be in the same boat as your peers and neighbors   if you have high inflation so will your friends and neighbors and you wo n't feel so bad   and if your currency gets stronger then so will the currency of the people you are hanging out with it 's similar to betting on do n't pass in craps   if you bet against the rest of the table you could win when they lose but then all your friends will be sad and you 'll be happy and vice versa when your friends are high you 'll be in the dumps i 'd say it 's better to be in the same boat as your peers since that 's usually how we judge our happiness when we compare our situation to others

so long as you do n't hate what you are doing i 'd say the price is somewhere in the neighborhood of $ 100 200 year of income to be worth the bookkeeping i 'd only say more than that if you have a ridiculously complex tax situation you have an irrational hatred of filling out a few forms once a year or if you just have such a stupidly large amount of money that even having a few hundred dollars a year to donate to people in desperate need just does n't mean anything to you or if you are under special income limits and just a few dollars of income would put you in a bad situation like a loss of medical benefits etc the reason is actually quite simple the taxes are n't really that hard or time consuming i 've handled three self employment businesses in my life and unless you are trying to itemize every last dollar of business deductions and expenses or you really want to scrape out every last cent from minor deductions that require considerable extra paperwork it 's a few extra forms on your taxes most of the extra taxes are as a percentage so it reduces the benefits but really not by much you do n't have to make it extra complicated if the extra complexity does n't give you a big payoff in benefit i would suggest you pick the simplest imaginable possible system for accounting for this so that you might only spend an extra few hours per year on the books and taxes do n't keep $ 10 sheet music receipts if you feel it 's a burden to try to itemize expenses etc instead the decision should be if you or in this case your wife would enjoy doing it and bringing in money can just be nice in it 's own way i 'd suggest she keep some out for little extra niceties earmark some for feel good charitable giving and then of course sock away the rest do n't let extra income be an unnecessary burden that prevents you from getting it in the first place

it really depends on the tasks and how things are going   well allocated work probably takes less than 40 hours a week most of the time but might take a lot more than that sometimes   it really depends   being in a really small company leaves little room for and then there is ambition   do you really want to dominate your industry   then there is the kind of work   truly creative work might be so intense that it tops out around 20 hours a week and everything above that is   that was what i meant by not fitting neatly into standard arrangements   it also has a lot to do what else there is in your life competing   it might be necessary to leave earlier than most to make time for afternoon activities or time with children   defining desirable intervals outside work may be the most important part of knowing what work hours make sense   ultimately it is necessary to understand that balancing work and life is complicated and may have no good answers   sometimes work may be life and other times it may compete vigorously with good living   simply saying anything over a standard 40 hour work week is too much might be a good place to draw the line or that might be a way of avoiding really thinking through where you want to be since that arrangement is only going to be idea for a subset of people   maybe for some 45 is the breaking point and for others 35 is right or maybe just it and leaving after a certain number of things are done is right   this emphasis on time drops away completely under results only work environment rowe arrangements but that leads directly to legal issues because we treat time as sacred no mater how much is spent at the desk or water cooler

have her pay something like a friendly monthly rent this should be less than half of the monthly mortgage cost since you are assuming the risk and benefits of a mortgage and closer to the rent of similar places near you for when you get married and she is to have half the apartment have a pre agreed way to calculate a lump sum that she needs to provide to match your own contributions up to that time as if you two had equal contributions from the beginning the financially precise way to do it would be to have her pay more than the mere sum of the amount since she will be providing the amount at a later time than you but i would be generous and skip this in your place if the difference is not too big if you break up she will have payed what would be a fair amount of rent as if you two were renting so in this sense it is fair that she would not have a claim on the apartment in case that you two would like that she keeps the apartment you can just sell it to her having her pay this same amount as above and assume responsibility for the rest of the mortgage

this would clear out a lot more 1 leverage is the act of taking on debt in lieu of the equity you hold not always related to firms it applies to personal situations too when you take a loan you get a certain age of the loan the bank establishes your equity by looking at your past financial records and then decides the amount it is going to lend deciding on the safest leverage in the current action leverage is the whole act of borrowing yen and profiting from it the leverage factor mentions the amount of leverage happening 10000 yen being borrowed with an equity of 1000 yen 2 commercial banks 10 to 1 > they do n't deal in complicated investments derivatives except for hedging and are under stricter controls of the government they have to have certain amount of liquidity and can loan out the rest for business investment banks 30 to 1 > their main idea is making money and trade heavily their deposits are limited by the amount clients have deposited and as their main motive is to get maximum returns from the available amount they trade heavily derivatives one of the instruments are structured on underlyings and sometimes in multiple layers which build up quite a bit of leverage and all of the trades happen on margins you do n't invest $ 10k to buy $ 10k of a traded stock you put in maybe $ 500 to take up the position and borrow the rest of the amount per se it improves liquidity in the markets and increases efficiency else you could do only with what you have so these margins add up to the leverage the bank is taking on

the problem with your profession is that it is hard to distinguish those activities as services rendered or just a pastime hobby if you believe that both of those activities constitutes a service rendered in a professional capacity then you should include it into the goods and services for your own use field however should you believe that those services rendered was not in a professional capacity and it was in a personal one i.e. helping out you need not include it in the field in addition should you feel that the pro services rendered overlaps with your professional freelance work in any way you might want to consider the service rendered to your dad and yourself as a professional service and include it in goods and services for your own use such examples include but not limited to it might be wise to call up the hmrc to clarify on your particular situation but what i know is this box was created to ensure that such services rendered should be considered a profit i.e. an advantage adds value and not a loss or no value

since you only own half of the house you would most likely need the cooperation of whoever owns the other half in order to use it as collateral for a loan but if you can do that there 's no reason you could n't do what you 're talking about   the complication is that if you default on the loan the bank is n't going to seize half of the house   they 'll repossess the entire house sell it and take what they 're owed out of the proceeds leaving you and whoever owns the other 50 to fight over the even if the owner of the other half is family they may be hesitant to risk losing the house if you do n't pay your mortgage so this could be a conversation

there is one other factor that i have n't seen mentioned here   it 's easy to assume that if you buy a stock then someone else another stock owner must have sold it to you   this is not true however because there are people called market makers whose basic job is to always be available to buy shares from those who wish to sell and sell shares to those who wish to buy   they could be selling you shares they just bought from someone else but they also could simply be issuing shares from the company itself that have never been bought before this is a super oversimplified explanation but hopefully it illustrates my point

gt you ca n't find anyone else who would pay you more or you would have left that 's a reflection of what you have to offer the world   your comment was thoughtful and this last bit in particular i feel is like something that i 've been wrestling with for a while    it 's a very libertarian view as you probably know it makes a lot of sense to me but i ca n't help to think of some possible flaws and wonder what you think   1 availability of work if somebody has a choice between no job and being grossly underpaid would n't the choice be between having no money and a little money at that point does n't that run the risk of exploitation would n't exploitation be working for less than what you 're worth   2 value unskilled pretty much means replaceable they do n't give a shit if you come or go and vice versa that 's not a reflection of a job 's worth to the company nor is a real reflection of how difficult it is there 's no competition for wages eventually workers get sick of it and leave not expecting improved wages elsewhere but a job they can deal with for 40 hours per week but there are always more people in need to take their place so the company has no incentive to raise wages     like you said it is a reflection of what you have to offer to the world in a sense that your skills are not uncommon however is this everything the world needs unskilled labor to run is there something wrong with being a cashier a a guy who the trucks that carry the things we all use no the world needs these people should people who are needed have jobs that do n't allow for them to meet basic living standards     3 expectation the only reason why most people wo n't work for less than 8 or 9 dollars hr expect reasonable flexibility to balance work and personal life do n't expect to be forced to work more than 8 9 hours per day have weekends off and those working 40 hrs week demand holiday pay sick days access to insurance vacation time is because that 's what people expect out of a job in this day and age none of these things are law i think people used to be treated considerably worse by their employers and likely there will be a time when people will think that the people of our day were stupid for settling for less the labor movement has done much in this regard   gt maybe instead of bitching that you are paid shit wages you should ask why you ever expected to earn more after failing to acquire any skill a teenager could n't master in a week    4 everyone 's solution let 's say everyone learns to do a skilled job who will be left to do the unskilled jobs someone will have to do them some countries have hordes of college educated workers working unskilled jobs because of the high that go to college ok so then leave it to merit does merit always work though what about nepotism personality when it does n't matter for the job age race sex ethnicity think these play any part in the hiring process    if all else fails not everyone can be expected to be a successful entrepreneur   5 life life can throw you some and people make mistakes some tend to pay for them more than others some have talent others do n't some are born with money some not some have a large and caring family others have no family at all     again i 'm not saying these things necessarily invalidate your original point but it 's something to consider your thoughts
# 317945
whether or not you choose to buy is a complicated question   i will answer as what you should consider think about as i do n't think what should i do is on topic first off renting tends to look expensive compared to mortgages until you factor in the other costs that are included in your rent property taxes   these are a few grand a year even in the worst areas and tend to be more   find out what the taxes are ahead of time   even though you can often deduct them and your interest you 're giving up your standard deduction to do so and with the low interest regime currently unless your taxes are high you may not end up being better off deducting them home insurance this depends on home and area but is at least hundreds of dollars per year and could easily run a thousand   so another hundred a month on your bill and it 's more than renter 's insurance by quite a lot upkeep costs for the property   you 've got a lot of up front costs buy a etc types of things plus a lot of ongoing costs general repair plumbing breaks electrical breaks whatnot    sales commission as scott notes in comments   when you sell you 're paying about 6 commission so you wo n't be above water if housing prices stay flat until you 've paid off 6 of your loan value plus closing costs another couple of percent   you hit the 90 point on a 15 year about year 2 but on a 30 year you do n't hit it until about year 5 so you might not be above water when you want to sell risk of decrease in value whenever you buy property you take on the risk of losing value as well as the potential of gaining value   do n't assume that because prices are going up they will continue to remember that a lot of investors are well aware of possible profits from rising prices and will be buying and driving prices up themselves   2008 was a shock to a lot of people even in areas where it seemed like prices should 've still gone up you never know what 's going to happen   if you buy a house for 20 or so down you have a bit of a safety net if it drops 10 20 in value you 're still above water though you do of course lose money while if you buy it for 0 down and it drops 20 in value you wo n't be able to sell at all for years all that together means you should really take a hard look at the costs and benefits make a realistic calculation including all actual costs and then make a decision i would not buy simply because it seems like a good idea to not pay rent   if you 're unable to make any down payment then you 're also unable to deal with the risks in home ownership not just decrease in value but when your pipe bursts and ruins your basement or when the roof needs a replacement because a tree falls on it   yes home insurance helps but not always and the deductible will still get you just to have some numbers for my area we pay about $ 8000 a year in property taxes on a $ 280k house $ 200k mortgage $ 1k a year in home insurance so our escrow payment is about $ 750 a month   a 15 year for $ 200k is about $ 1400 a month so $ 2200 or so total cost   we do live in a high property tax area so someone in lower tax regimes would pay less say 1800 1900 but not that cheap   a 30 year would save you 500 or so a month but you 're still not all that much lower than rent

it seems that you 're asking for a legal tax advice and i vote to close the question as off topic for that this is not the place but on the second thought i will share some of the ideas i have provided of course that you will not consider them as any sort of tax advice whatsoever and will not rely on it for any tax planning without verifying with a licensed professional taking 401k money out just like that means that you are going to pay your taxes on that money plus additional 10 penalty as @joetaxpayer said this rarely makes economic sense however taking 401 k money out to pay your medical bills which would otherwise be deductible pay attention to the nuances does n't trigger the penalty it looks like in your case you might unfortunately have a chance to use this provision another case when you can withdraw money without penalty is disability which according to what you describe is unfortunately a situation you 're very likely to find yourself in also you can withdraw funds as income for a substantial period of time and under certain conditions it will not be subject to the 10 penalty of course leaving it to the beneficiaries as mentioned by others is another and very valid option see publication 575 for specific details and be sure to consult a tax professional before doing anything

you 'd have to check the terms of your contract on most installment loans i think they calculate interest monthly not daily that is if you make 3 payments of $ 96 over the course of the month instead of one payment of $ at the end of the month but before the due date it makes absolutely zero difference to their interest calculation they just total up your payments for the month that 's how my mortgage works and how some past loans i 've had worked all you 'd accomplish is to cost yourself some time postage if you 're mailing payments and waste the bank 's time processing multiple payments if the loan allows you to make pre payments which i think most loans today do then what does work is to make an extra payment or an overpayment if you have a few hundred extra dollars make an extra payment this reduces your principle and reduces the amount of interest you pay every month for the remainder of the loan and if you 're paying $ 1 less in interest then that extra dollar goes against principle which further reduces the amount you pay in interest the next month this and can save you a lot in the long run better still instead of paying $ each month pay say $ 300 then every month you 're away at the principle faster and faster for example i calculate that if you 're paying $ per month you 'll pay the loan off in 72 months and pay a total of $ in interest pay $ 300 per month and you 'll pay it off in 67 months with a total of $ interest okay not a huge deal pay $ 350 per month and you pay it off in 55 months with $ interest i just did quick calculations with a spreadsheet not accurate to the penny but close enough for comparison ps this is different from revolving credit like credit cards where interest is calculated on the average daily balance with a credit card making multiple payments would indeed reduce your interest but not by much if you pay $ 100 every 10 days instead of $ 300 at the end then you 're saving the interest on 20 days x $ 100 + 10 days x $ 100 so 12.5 = 0.03 per day so 0.03 x $ = 90 cents if you 're mailing your payments the postage is 49 cents x 2 extra payments = 98 cents you 're losing 8 cents per month by doing this

funds which track the same index may have different nominal prices   from an investors point of view this is not important   what is important is that when the underlying index moves by a given percentage the price of the tracking funds also move by an equal percentage   in other words if the s&p500 rises by 5 then the price of those funds tracking the s&p500 will also rise by 5   therefore investing a given amount in any of the tracking funds will produce the same profit or loss regardless of the nominal prices at which the individual funds are trading to see this use the compare function available on the popular online charting services for example in google finance call up a chart of the s&p500 index then use the compare to enter the codes for the various etfs tracking the s&p500   you will see that they all track the s&p500 equally so that your relative returns will be equal from each of the tracking funds   any small difference in total returns will be attributable to management fees and expenses which is why low fees are so important in passive investing

from 26 cfr if a taxpayer sells or transfers shares of stock in a corporation that the taxpayer purchased or acquired on different dates or at different prices and the taxpayer does not adequately identify the lot from which the stock is sold or transferred the stock sold or transferred is charged against the earliest lot the taxpayer purchased or acquired to determine the basis and holding period of the stock from 26 cfr i where the stock is left in the custody of a broker or other agent an adequate identification is made    a at the time of the sale or transfer the taxpayer specifies to such broker or other agent having custody of the stock the particular stock to be sold or transferred and so if you do n't specify the first share bought for $ 100 is the one sold and you have a capital gain of $ 800 but you can specify to the broker if you would rather sell the stock bought later and thus have a lower gain this can either be done for the individual sale no later than the settlement date of the trade or via standing order 26 cfr a standing order or instruction for the specific identification of stock is treated as an adequate identification made at the time of sale transfer delivery or distribution

it really is dependent upon your goals   what are your short term needs   do you need a car clothing high cost apartment equipment when you start your career   for those kinds of things a savings account might be best as you will need to have quick access to cash many have said that people need two careers the one they work in and being an investor   you can start on that second career now   open up some small accounts to get the feel for investing   this can be index funds or something more specialized   i would put money earmarked for a home purchase in funds with a lower beta fluctuation and some in index funds   you probably would want to get a feel for what and where you will actually be doing in your career prior to making a leap into a home purchase   so figure you have about 5 years   that gives you time to ride out the waves in the market btw good job on your financial situation   you are set up to succeed

congratulations on keeping better track of your finances typically there will be a class of accounts labelled income under which you will have a separate account for each type of income stock dividends paychecks home appreciation etc in that case showing your income would be a transfer from the paycheck account to your checking account   note that as there are no offsetting transactions this means your income account will steadily accrue a balance over time just ignore this number it 's only the sum of all your paychecks   there are methods of dealing with that number and making the income account have a zero balance but you do n't need to worry about it at this stage   just learning to properly track expenses is the major accomplishment

very interesting article thanks for posting it 's going to get really interesting really fast if investors force governments to raise taxes to pay investors regardless of who 's right in the situation    on a related note i read awhile back that many us cities have sold the rights to various public areas to foreigners for example i believe chicago sold the rights to collect parking fees along certain streets for 75 years to a company in the middle east some cities then found that if they wanted to have a parade down that street they had to compensate the company that owned the parking rights because they would n't collect any revenue the day of the parade    i ca n't see how this ends well for the us economy

if you want a ~12 rate of return on your investments too bad for returns which even begin to approach that you need to be looking at some of the riskiest stuff think emerging markets even funds like vanguard emerging markets etf mutual fund or fidelity advisor emerging markets income trust seem to have yields which only push 11 or so   but inflation is about nil so if you 're used to normal 2 inflation or so these yields are like 13 or so and there 's no tax on that last 2 yay remember that these investments are very risky they go up lots because they can go down lots too do n't put any money in there unless you can afford to have it go missing because sooner or later you 're likely to lose something half your money and it might not come back for a decade or ever investments like these should only be a small part of your overall portfolio so that said sites which make investing in these risky markets easy there are a good number but you should probably just go with their funds have low fees which wo n't erode your returns you can actually get lower expense ratios by using their brokerage account to trade the etf versions of their funds commission free though you 'll have to worry more about the actual number of shares you want to buy instead of just in and out dollar amounts you can also trade vanguard etfs and other etfs at almost any brokerage just like stocks and most brokerages will also offer you access to a variety of mutual funds as well though often for a hefty fee of $ which you should avoid or you can sign up for another fund providers account but remember that the fund fees add up quickly   and the better plan just stuff most of your money in something like vti vanguard total stock market index instead

if you are in it for the long run and are not worried about intra day fluctuations and buying within + or 1 you would be better off going for a market order as this will make sure you buy it on the day   if you use limit orders you risk missing out on the order if prices gap and start rising in the morning another option is to employ stop buy trigger orders if offered by your broker so you would have to sum up and decide which type of order would suit your strategy the best are you looking to buy the security because you are looking for long term growth and gains or are you after getting the best price possible to help your short term gains

there are no rules about how the price should act after an ipo so there are no guarantee that a pop would appear at the opening day but when an ipo is done it 's typically underpriced on average the shares are 10 up at the end of the first day after the ipo i do n't have the source that i just remember that from some finance course also after the ipo the underwriter can be asked to support the trading of the share for a certain period of time that is the so called stabilizing agent they have few obligations like this price support in often done by a repurchase of some of the shares of poorly performing ipo edit about the pool when the ipo is done a certain number of client buy the shares issued by the company the underwriter with the clients can decide to create an pool where the clients would get a little more shares hence but this time the shares are not issued by the company but by the underwriter to put it another way the underwriter and becomes short by a certain number of shares limited to 15 of the ipo in exchange for the risk taken by this the underwriter gets a option from the clients that will allows the underwriter to buy back the oversold shares at the price of the ipo from the clients the idea behind this option is to avoid a market exposure for the underwriter so after the ipo if the price goes down the underwriter buys back on the market the shares and makes a profits if the price goes up the company exercise the option buy the shares at the ipo prices the pool that is the additional shares that the clients wanted to avoid suffering a loss

the choices given are either leave after some reasonable hours or put in endless crunch time until you drop dead   the reality as usual is between those extremes   most people are hired to get a job done   that is likely to require some extra work and if you really care about the job then that is n't really so bad and is not going to scale up to suicidal levels     crunch time as such is increasingly rare because the downsides are so obvious   it generates inferior work and burns out critical assets   at the same time there is no reason to believe that significant professional challenges will necessarily fit neatly into standardized work time arrangements   sometimes difficult problems come up and need to be handled or innovative products wo n't be released in time to make a difference in the marketplace

the simple answer for the so called rule of x would be found by in your case update   if you want an approximation closer to the nominal rule of 72 value use this equation that incorporates a better approximation for the natural log the rule of 72 fits this for an interest rate of for a growth multiple of 2 the rule of 72 comes from by the natural as such the 2 is the multiple of growth the rate r here is not in percent so to change to percent say r you have to multiply by 100 the number 72 is often used because it is easier to divide evenly than and is a better fit approximation for the natural log and common interest rates   if you need more you can find all this on wikipedia

let me give you some advice from someone who has experience at both ends had student loan issues myself and parents ran financial aid department at local university quick story of my student loan   i graduated in debt and could not pay at first due to having kids way too early   i deferred   schools will have rules for   there are also federal guidelines lets not get specific on this though since these change every year it seems    so basically there is an initial deferment period in which any student can request for the repayments to be deferred and it is granted   then there is an extended deferment   here someone has to ok it   this is really rather arbitrary and up to the school lender   my school decided to not extend mine after i filled out a of paperwork and showed that even without paying i had basically $ 200 a month for the family to live off past housing fixed expenses eventually they had to cave because i had no money so they gave me an extended deferment   after the 5 years i started paying   since my school had a very complex way to pay i decided to give them 6 months at a time   you would think they would love that right   on the check it was clearly stated what months i was paying for to show that i was not prepaying the loan off well i was in collections 4 months later   their billing messed up set me up for prepayment   they then played dumb and acted like i did n't but i had a picture of the check and their bank 's stamp on the back they could n't get my loan out of collections even though they messed up   this is probably some lower level employee trying to cover their mistake   so this office tells creditors to leave me alone but i also cannot pay my loan because the credit collection agency has slapped a 5k fee on the 7k loan   so my loan spent 5 years kid you not like this   it was interest free since the employee stopped the loan processing point being is that if you do n't pay the lender will either put your loan into deferment automatically or go after you   most not all schools will opt for deferment which i believe is 2 years at most places   then after that you have the optional deferment   so if you keep not paying they might throw you into that bucket    however if you stop paying and you never communicate with them the chances of you getting the optional deferment are almost none unless school does n't know where you live   basically if you do n't respond to their mail emails you get swept into their credit collection process   so just filling out the deferment stuff when you get it even if they deny it could buy you up to 10 years kid you not    now once you go into the collection process anything is game   as long as you do n't need a home car loan you can play this game   what the collection agency does depends on size of loan and the rules   if you are at a major university the rules are usually more lax but if you are at the smaller schools especially the advertised trade online schools boom better watch out   wages will be garnished very soon   expect to go to court might have to hire an attorney because some corrupt lenders start on fees think of the 5k mine on me    so the moral of the story is you will pay it off   if you act nice fill out paperwork talk to school and so on you can probably push this off quite a few years   but you are still paying and you will pay interest on everything   so factor in that to the equation   i had a 2.3 loan but they are much higher now    defaulting is n't always a bad thing   if you do n't have the money then you do n't have it   and using credit cards to help is not the thing to do   but you need to try to work with the school so you do n't incur penalties fees and so that your job does n't have creditors calling them    my story ended year 4 that my loan was in collection   a higher up was reviewing my case and called me   told her the story and emailed her a picture of their cashed check   she was completely embarrassed when she was trying to work out a plan for me and i am like how about i come down tomorrow with the 7k   but even though lender admitted fault this took 20 + calls to agencies to clear up my credit so i could buy a house    so your goal should be

in general you can only be charged for services if there is some kind of contract the contract does n't have to be written but you have to have agreed to it somehow however it is possible that you entered into a contract due to some clause in the home purchase contract or the contract with the home owners association there are also sometimes services you are legally required to get such as regular inspection of heating furnaces though i do n't think this translates to automatic contracts but in any case you would not be liable for services rendered before you entered into the contract which sounds like it 's the case here

negative yields on bonds is opposite of getting profit on your investment this is some kind of new practice from world wide financial institute   the interest rate is for ten years so a $ 100,000 bond under    those terms would be discounted to $ give or take no actually what you are going to get out from this investment is after 10 years when this investment is mature for liquidation you will get return not even your principle $ 100,000 but principle $ 100,000 minus negative yields times 10 years assume the rates are on simple annual rate   now anyone may wander why should someone going to buy this kind of investment where i am actually giving away not only possible profit also losing some of principle amount   this might looks real odd but there is other valid reason for issuing investing on such kind of bond   from investor prospective every asset has its own expense for keeping ownership of it this is also true for money currency depending on its size and other investment possibility and risk factor the same way people maintain checking account with virtually no visible income vs. savings account where bank issue some positive rate of interest with various time factor like annually half yearly monthly people with lower level of income but steady on flow choose savings where business go for checking one think of millions of ideal money with no secure investment opportunity have to option in real option one to keeping this large amount of money in hand arranging all kind of security which involve extra expense risk and headache where option two is invest on bond issued by government of country owner of that amount will go for second one even with negative yields on bonds where he is paying in return of security and risk free of getting it back on time   on issuing government prospective here government actually want people not to keep money idle investing bonds but find any possible sector to invest which might profitable for both investor + community ultimately country   this is a basic understanding on issue buy selling of negative interest bearing bond on market    hope i could explain it here not to mention english is not my 1st language at all so ignore my typo grammatical error and welcome to fix it   cheers

while i agree with the existing bulk of comments and answers that you ca n't tell the lender the $ 7k is a gift i do think you might have luck finding a mortgage broker who can help you get a loan as a group   you might consider as an llc or other form of corporation if no one will take you otherwise   that is each of you will be an owner of the house and appear on the mortgage   iirc as long as the downpayment only comes from the collective group and the income to debt ratio of the group as a whole is acceptable and the strongest credit rating of the group is good you should be able to find a loan   you may need a formal ownership agreement to get this accepted by the lender   that said i do n't know if your income will trump your brother 's situation presumably high debt ratio or lower than 100 multiplier on his income dues to its source but it will certainly help as to how to structure the deal for fairness i think whatever the two of you agree to and put down in writing is fine   if you each think you 're helping the other than a 50/50 split on profits at the sale of the property seems reasonable to me    i 'd recommend that you actually include in your write up a defined maximum period for ownership e.g. or 10yr etc and explain how things will be resolved if one side does n't want to sell at that point but the other side does just remember that whatever percentages you agree to as ownership wo n't effect the lender 's view of payment requirements   the lender will consider each member of the group fully and independently responsible for the loan   that is if something happens to your brother or he just out on you you will be on the hook for 100 of the loan   and vice versa   your write up ought to document what happens if one of you out on paying agreed upon amounts but still expects there ownership share at the time of sale that said if you 're trying to be mathematically fair about ownership you could do something like the below to try and factor in the various issues into the money flow the above has the benefit that you can start with a different ownership split etc if one of you wants to own more of the property

you have actually asked several questions so i think what i 'll do is give you an intuition about risk neutral pricing to get you started   then i think the answer to many of your questions will become clear physical probability there is some probability of every event out there actually occurring including the price of a stock going up   that 's what we call the physical probability   it 's very intuitive but not directly useful for finding the price of something because price is not the weighted average of future outcomes    for example if you have a stock that is highly correlated with the market and has 50 chance of being worth $ 20 dollars tomorrow and a 50 chance of being worth $ 10 it 's value today is not $ 15   it will be worth less because it 's a risky stock and must earn a premium   when you are dealing with physical probabilities if you want to compute value you have to take the probability weighted average of all the prices it could have tomorrow and then add in some kind of compensation for risk which may be hard to compute risk neutral probability finance theory has shown that instead of computing values this way we can embed risk compensation into our probabilities   that is we can create a new set up probabilities by adjusting the probability of good market outcomes downward and increasing the probability of bad market outcomes   this may sound crazy because these probabilities are no longer physical but it has the desirable property that we then use this set of probabilities to price of every asset out there all of them equity options bonds savings accounts etc   we call these adjusted probabilities that risk neutral probabilities   when i say price i mean that you can multiply every outcome by its risk neutral probability and discount at the risk free rate to find its correct price     to be clear we have changed the probability of the market going up and down not our probability of a particular stock moving independent of the market   because moves that are independent of the market do not affect prices we do n't have to adjust the probabilities of them happening in order to get risk neutral probabilities anyway the best way to think of risk neutral probabilities is as a set of bogus probabilities that consistently give the correct price of every asset in the economy without having to add a risk premium if we just take the risk neutral probability weighted average of all outcomes and discount at the risk free rate we get the price   very handy if you have them risk neutral pricing we ca n't get risk neutral probabilities from research about how likely a stock is to actually go up or down   that would be the physical probability   instead we can figure out the risk neutral probabilities from prices if a stock has only two possible prices tomorrow u and d and the risk neutral probability of u is q then price = + the exponential there is just discounting by the risk free rate   this is the beginning of the equations you have mentioned   the main thing to remember is that q is not the physical probability it 's the risk neutral one   i ca n't emphasize that enough   if you have what u and d can be then there is only one unknown in that equation q. that means you can look at the stock price and solve for the risk neutral probability of the stock going up    the reason this is useful is that you can same risk neutral probability to price the associated option   in the case of the option you do n't know its price today yet but you do know how much money it will be worth if the stock moves up or down   use those values and the risk neutral probability you computed from the stock to compute the option 's price   that 's what 's going on here   to remember the same risk neutral probability measure prices everything out there   that is if you choose an asset multiply each possibly outcome by its risk neutral probability and discount at the risk free rate you get its price   in general we use prices of things we know to infer things about the risk neutral probability measure in order to get prices we do not know

a straddle is an options strategy in which one buys or sells options of the same maturity expiry date that allow the buyer or seller to profit based on how much the price of the underlying security moves regardless of the direction of price movement ie a long straddle would be you buy a call and a put at the same strike price and the same expiration date your profit would be if the underlying stock moves far enough down or then the premiums you paid for the put + call options in case one waits till expiry profit = expiry level strike price premium paid for bought options straddle

let 's simplify things by assuming you only own 2 stocks by owning voo and vti you 're overweight on and mid cap stocks relative to the market composition likewise by owning vti and vt you 're overweight on u.s. stocks conversely by owning and vt you 're overweight on non u.s. stocks these are all perfectly fine positions to take if that 's what you intend and have justification for for example if you 're in the u.s. it may be a good idea to hold more u.s. stocks than vt because of currency risk but 4 equity index etfs is probably things it is perfectly fine to hold only vti and because these funds comprise thousands of stocks and thus give you sufficient diversification i would recommend holding those 2 etfs based on a domestic international allocation that makes sense to you vanguard recommends 40 of your stock allocation to be international and if for some reason you want to be overweight in and mid cap companies throw in voo you can use morningstar x ray to look at your proposed portfolio and find your optimal mix of geographic and stock style allocation

yes they 're often a beneficial choice because it means you are earning the interest on the money instead of the government you wo n't necessarily pay taxes on it you have many options once you reach the point of wanting to do something with the money many people accumulate the wealth and then pass it down to subsequent generations without paying tax which is perfectly legal if done right others make donations to charity   those are just a couple examples but the point is that you accumulated the wealth over a long period of time and bought yourself time to decide what to do with it edit no if the investor decides to cash the money out all at once at the end it would not be equivalent assuming you had $ 1,000 to put in an account and could get a 5 return on your money and you were in the 25 tax rate the tax free account ends up with more in the end mostly by virtue of the compounding being tax free

here 's another way that i look at it   say you and me were 50 50 partners in a small business suppose we wanted to expand our business but that needed money someone let 's call him warren has the money we need hence in return for the money we offer warren an equal stake in the business   i.e. all three of us own 33 stake now for both you and me our stake reduced from   50 that it was before warren 's entry to only 33 now   while that reduction in our share may seem at first sight a bad deal for us we both agreed to give warren his share consciously not out of altruism but because it made business sense to helps us expand   ergo what matters is not just your share of the pie but the size of the pie itself and hence dilution of stake can make sense under certain circumstances   two small points a this does n't   in any way show the dilution must make sense only that it can sometimes make sense b of course in the case of a large corporation they do not need your personal approval for the dilution but hey neither do they ask you when they buy a new plant or start a new product

yes this will reduce your total interest but not by much scenario 1 you run up bills for the month totaling $ 750 and then at the end of the month you get paid and pay $ 750 scenario 2 you pay $ 750 at the beginning of the month then over the course of the month you run up bills totaling $ 750 assume you have carryover debt of over $ 750 so you do n't have a credit balance at any point either way the net change in your balance for the month is zero assuming you spent about the same amount of money each day the difference in your average daily balance will be $ 750 if you 're paying 18 i think that 's a fairly typical credit card rate that 's 1 1/2 per month so the difference in interest will be about $ 10 note this is the most extreme case the difference between paying on the first day of the billing period and paying on the last day of the billing period and assuming that you pay all your bills by credit card so in real life the difference in the interest will probably be less you 're talking about a technique to save maybe five bucks a month i suppose every dollar helps but the real solution is to get your credit cards paid off so you 're not paying any interest

a company 's return on equity roe is its net income divided by its shareholder 's equity   the shareholder 's equity is the difference between total assets and total liabilities and is not dependent on the stock price what it takes to have a roe over 100 is to have the income be greater than the equity   this might happen for a variety of reasons but one way a high roe happens is if the shareholder 's equity the divisor is small which can occur if past losses have eroded the company 's capital the original invested cash and retained earnings   if the equity has become a small value the income for some period might exceed it and so the roe would be over 100 operating margin is not closely related to roe   although operating income is related to net income to calculate the margin you divide by sales which is completely unrelated to shareholder 's equity   so there is no relationship with roe to be expected   operating margin is primarily dependent on market conditions and can be substantially different in different industries

why would a bank buy government bonds why could n't they just deposit their money in another bank instead   generally banks are limited by laws and regulations about how much they must set aside as reserves of the money they receive as deposits they may loan a certain amount but must keep some as a reserve this is called fractional reserve banking different countries have a different amount that they must set aside in reserves   in countries where bank deposits are guaranteed there is almost always some upper limit to how much is guaranteed the amount of money that a bank would deposit in another bank would be far greater than the guarantee

yes exactly var is just a single confidence interval   to go from model to strategy you need to design some kind of indicator i.e. when to buy and when to short or stay out in practice this will look like a large matrix with values ranging from -1 to 1 corresponding to shorting and holding respectively for each security and each day or hour or minute or tick etc which you then just multiply with the matrix of the stock returns the resulting matrix will be your daily returns for each stock you can then just row sum for daily returns of a portfolio or calculate a cumulative product for cumulative returns   a simple example of an indicator would be something like a value of 1 when the price of the stock is below the 30 day moving average and 0 otherwise you can use a battery of econometric models to design these indicators but the rest of the strategy design is essentially the same and it 's relatively easy to build a one size fits all back testing code   i 'll try to edit this post later and link a blog that goes through some of the code   edit simple machine learning model trade is a post that discusses implementing a simple ml strategy you can ignore most of the content but if you go through the github you 'll see how the ml model is implemented as a strategy   an even easier example can be found from the github connected to this how to measure the performance of a trading where the author is just using a totally arbitrary signal as you can see deriving a signal can be a ton of work but once you have actually simulating the strategy can be done in just a few lines of code   hopefully the author wo n't mind me linking his page here but i find his coding style to be very clean and good for educational purposes

strange it works for me here 's the only part that matters   gt in september 2016 a managing director at new york office sent an email seen by the financial times explaining that the two banks have agreed to a 1-year ban on hiring any employee by barclays in key areas such as in corporate and investment banking   gt the email sent to more than 20 senior colleagues goes on to say that following a review of pending offers by barclays to jpmorgan staff one unfortunately will be pulled from wealth uk   gt however five days after the initial email the same new york based barclays managing director sent a six line message telling recipients to disregard the original email   so basically all just conjecture as to which email was their real stance on the poaching issue was the first one the real thing and the second just a cya or was the first one a huge mistake by a managing director and the second probably included the phrase will be spending more time with his family

i really like rocky 's answer some more info keep in mind there is no limit on punitive damages   you could sue for the pants 160 + the filling fee 50 + a reasonable hourly rate to compensate your time assume 200 + punitive damages of   assume 5000 limit on small claims court   when facing a suit of 5000 it could be much cheaper to settle for 160 keep in mind you do n't have to take it   once you file you may only settle for the pants plus filling fee   once you actually get to court you may only settle for the pants + filling fee + some time compensation if you have the claim ticket you will win   the question becomes how much punitive damages could you also win   filling fee easy   the compensation for your time very likely    once the owner is served a summons they will probably go to a lawyer   the lawyer will tell them to settle asap   use that to your advantage    one thing you might be able to settle for is free dry cleaning   they might give you the $ 160 plus another $ 160 in free dry cleaning if you are willing to use them again

there are several ways that the issuers profit from cfds if the broker has trades on both sides buy and sell they can net the volumes off against each other and profit off the spread whilst using the posted margins to cover p&l from both sides because settlement for most securities is not on the same day that the order is placed they can also buy the security with no intention of taking delivery and simply sell it off at the end of day to pass delivery on to someone else here again they profit from the spread and that their volumes give them really low commissions so their costs are much lower than the value of the spread if they have to do this rather than netting the position out the spreads will be wider   sometimes that may be forced to buy the security outright but that is rare and the spreads will be even wider so that they can make a decent profit

that 's right it is the far right that have fought medicare and single payer health insurance from the 70s    ronald reagan famously recorded a lp medicare as the slippery slope to socialism   health insurance is a tool large corporations use to 1 keep employees of losing their job and 2 discouraging employees from leaving their organization and starting a small business that will compete with them   it is anything but a poorly thought out policy if large corporations felt it was bad for business they would join the fight for single payer which would relieve them of one hell of an expense   they could save billions but they do n't because they want it this way it must be worth a lot of money to them

in the case of reward cards different cards may offer different rewards for different kind of purchases for example in the uk one of the amex cards offers 1.25 cashback on all purchases whereas one of the santander cards offers 3 on fuel 2 or 1 on certain other transactions and nothing on others of course you then have to remember to use the right card another reason is that a person may use a card for a while build up a good credit limit and then move to a different card perhaps because it has better rewards or a lower interest rate etc without cancelling the first if it costs nothing to keep the first card then it can be useful to have it as a spare

so couple of things firstly every international etf includes risk disclosure language in the prospectus covering both market disruption events as well as geopolitical risk so the sponsor would be pretty well insulated from direct liability for anything if the russian market were truly shut down there are true up mechanisms in place but in the scenario you 're describing the market is still open it 's just only a few participants can trade in it   first thing to do is shut down that is allow no new money to come into the fund this at least prevents your problem from getting bigger    second you 're going to switch all redemptions to in kind only itself ca n't trade in the underlying so they 're kind of here an etf sponsor ca n't really refuse your redemption request can delay but only for a short time but they can control the form in which they respond to it     what theoretically should happen here is an ap not subject to sanctions will step in and handle redemptions   issue is they 'll probably charge for this so you should expect the fund to start trading at a discount to nav you as an investor sell to them cheaply they submit a redemption request then sell the stocks locally someone else has pointed that market makers will start stat the fund using correlated substitute instruments which totally will help keep things in line but my guess is that you 'd still see the name trading away from nav regardless driver of this will be the amount of money desperate to get out if investors are content to wait the sanctions out who knows

there are several causes of inflation one is called cost push that is if the price of e.g. oil goes up sharply as it did in the 1970s it creates inflation by making everything cost more another is called demand pull if labor unions bargain for higher wages as they did in the 1960s their wage costs push up prices especially after they start buying the kind of inflation that the banks cause is monetary inflation that is for every dollar of deposits they can make $ 5 or $ 10 of loans so even though they do n't print money the fed does it 's as if they did the result could be the kind of inflation called too much money chasing too few goods

i would like to first point out that there is nothing special about a self managed investment portfolio as compared to one managed by someone else with some exceptions you can put together exactly the same investment portfolio yourself as a professional investor could put together for you not too at a lower cost and remember that cost is among the if not the best of how your investment portfolio will perform over time diversification is the concept of not putting all your eggs in one basket the idea here is that there are things that happen together because they have a common cause and by spreading your investments in ways such that not all of your investments have the same underlying risks you reduce your overall risk the technical term for risk is generally volatility meaning how much in this case the price of something fluctuates over a given period of time a stock that falls 30 one month and then climbs 40 the next month is more volatile than one that falls 3 the first month and climbs 4 the second month the former is riskier because if for some reason you need to sell when it is down you lose a larger portion of your original investment with the former stock than with the latter diversification thus is reducing between your investments generally but not necessarily in an attempt to reduce the risk of all investments moving in the same direction by the same amount at the same time you can diversify in various ways do you see where i am going with this a well portfolio will tend to have a mix of equity in your own country and a variety of other countries spread out over different types of equity company stock corporate bonds government bonds in different sectors of the economy in countries with differing growth patterns it may contain uncommon classes of investments such as precious metals a poorly diversified portfolio will likely be restricted to either some particular geographical area type of equity or investment focus on some particular sector of the economy such as medicine or vehicle manufacturers or so on the poorly diversified portfolio can do better in the short term if you time it just right and happen to pick exactly the right thing to buy or sell this is incredibly hard to do as you are basically working against everyone who gets paid to do that kind of work full time plus computer algorithm based trading which is programmed to look for any patterns it is virtually impossible to do for any real length of time thus the well diversified portfolio tends to do better over time

yeah no worries it 's tough right because uber provides an incredibly valuable service but i 'm amazed at how they 're able to get away with not vetting their drivers but at the same time that sort of lack of regulation is what allowed them to expand so rapidly and provide a usually good service austin tx banned uber and drunk driving rates went up   clearly this needs to be worked out and it 's been pretty clear that the management at uber has been incapable of making mature decisions in a lot of areas but it 's also a positive because it allows a lot of people who are between jobs or out of work to be able to continue to bring in an income without being beholden to the cab companies that hold the medallions and charge the drivers for use of the cars and licensing   i do n't know the answer i think that by providing the service there is a level of accountability that is required for uber 's vetting of drivers that has n't yet been reached but at the same time i think that the primary burden of liability should fall on the drivers themselves unless there 's a reorganization and the drivers become employees instead of contractors

q will i have to submit the accounts for the swiss business even though i m not on the payroll and the business makes hardly any profit each year i can of course get our accounts each year but they will be in swiss german you will have to submit on your income from the business   the term partnership refers to a specific business entity type in the u.s.   i 'm not sure if you 're using it the same way   in a partnership in the u.s. you pay income tax on your share of the partnership 's income whether or not you actually receive income in your personal account   there 's not enough information here to know if that applies in your case in the u.s. the partnership itself does not pay income tax it is a disregarded entity for tax purposes with the tax liability passed through to the partners as individuals q will i need to have this translated is there any format procedure to this will it have to be translated by my swiss accountants and if so which parts of the documentation need to be translated as regards language you will file a tax return on a u.s. form presumably in english   you will not have to submit your account information on any other form so the fact that your documentation is in german does not matter   the only exception that comes to mind is that you could potentially get audited just like anyone else filing taxes in the u.s. in which case you might need to produce your documentation   that situation is rare enough that i would n't worry about it though   i 'm not sure if they 'd take it in german or force you to get a translation i was told that if i sell the business and property after i a that i will be liable to 15 tax of the profit i 'd made i also understand that any tax paid on selling in switzerland will be deducted from the 15 q is this correct the long term capital gains rate is 15 for most people at very high incomes it is 20   it sounds like you would qualify for long term held for greater than 1 year capital gains in this case although the details might matter there is a foreign tax credit but i 'm not completely sure if it would apply in this case if forced to guess i would say that it does   if you search for foreign tax credit and irs you should get to the information that you need pretty quickly i will effectively have all the paperwork for this as we 'll need to do the same in switzerland but again it will be in swiss german q would this be a problem if its presented in swiss german even in this case you will not need to submit any of your paperwork to the irs unless you get audited   see earlier comments

the advice to invest in yourself is good advice but the stock market can be very rewarding over the long pull you have about 45 years to retirement now and that is plenty long enough that each dollar put into the market now will be many dollars then a simple way to do this might be to open a brokerage account at a reputable broker and put a grand into a very broad based all market etf and then doing nothing with it the price of the etf will go up and down with the usual market gyrations but over the decades it will grow nicely make sure the etf has low fees so that you are n't being overcharged    it 's good that you are thinking about investing at a young age a rational and consistent investment strategy will lead to wealth over the long pull

these cars are generally considered out of date and are less prone to be victims of car theft while being reasonably safe make sure you pick a model with a good reliability reputation see what comes up at your local junk yard the common old models have survived long enough to not end up there until now servicing your car takes some effort and some initial investments but learning how to fix simple problems by yourself will save you a lot of money in the long run start by learning how to locate some simple faults diagnosing issues is a very costly process if done professionally but some you may be able to find by yourself all cars sold in usa from 1996 are required to have this connection below the steering rack as a consequence most cars manufactured 1995 will have this connector world wide if you connect your to this port your car will be able to tell you what 's wrong through an app on your phone and you will be able to clear fault codes by yourself to make sure the problem really is solved this is what you mechanic should use when servicing your car while a new print can be expensive you can find used manuals getting thrown out of service centers or at yard sales these will include service notes and sometimes had written notes to help you out the majority of parts on cars are still in working condition and may not ever see significant wear and tear if you put some time into removing the part yourself you will have a good idea of how difficult it is to replace the part on your car and outsource the work to a professional if needed this of course assumes you bring good parts the main income should come from the work performed on your car not the markup of spare parts generally speaking specialized mechanics working with one or few brands of cars are preferable as these will not only be familiar with your car but are also more likely to get original spare parts not pirate parts made to be compatible at a cheaper price this will make sure the part works as intended and not cause wear and tear of other parts for example you 'd much rather replace a broken instead of cleaning up the aftermath of fried electronics turn off the ac when it 's not needed there should be a button labeled econ or similar which will disable the ac compressor while keeping the rest of the systems running the compressor is usually driven by a belt from the and will eat up some of the power your engine produces just remember that while it saves gas uncomfortable driving conditions may shorten your patience and reduces your attention accelerate up to speed quickly contrary to popular belief this saves more gas than accelerating slowly because the time your engine is under increased load is shorter combined with higher efficiency at medium engine speeds allow your speed to decline on you will regain that speed once the road levels out unless you 're in heavy traffic driving a bit slower should n't harm the flow do n't let go of the gas pedal just avoid compensating as much your target should be to not lose more than 20 of your speed over the entire and have a constant or you will start interfering with traffic make sure your car is healthy as obvious as it may sound worn out parts may harm your mileage increased friction in due to broken protective covers or reduced pressure from a broken exhaust are just examples if things that will ruin the efficiency of you by themselves they may not do much but they add up into both gas consumption and reliability issues really do read your owners manual nobody knows your car better than the people who built it what 's best for my car may not be best for your car and the best way to make sure your car is working as intended is to take an afternoon with your manual and a cup of your favorite beverage afterwards you will know how all the features of your car works take care of your car and it takes care of you is the principle i 'm working with a car you 're happy with will make you more calm behind the wheel and leads to higher quality of your driving decisions both you and your fellow commuters will benefit from this even if they may never take the time to thank you

this is a technical term referring to the double entry book keeping of trades by brokers suppose a client executes a buy order with their broker   the broker 's accounting for this trade will be recorded as two different deals one deal showing the client as buyer and the broker as seller and a second deal showing the broker as buyer and the clearing house as seller   the net result of these two deals is that the broker has no net position while the client has a net buy and the clearing house has a net sell with respect to this broker 's account as accounted for internally by the broker and the same methods apply for a client sell order the client broker deal record i.e. the client side of the trade is called the client side booking while the broker clearing house deal record is called the street side booking

i am voting you up because this is a legitimate question with a correct possible answer yes you should n't buy penny stocks yes you should n't speculate yes people will be jealous that you have money to burn your question how to maximize expected return there are several definitions of return and the correct one will determine the correct answer for your situation $ 1,000 sounds like disposable income and that you have the human capital to make more income in the future with your productive years so we will not assume you want to take this money and reinvest the remains until you are dead this rules out 2 it sounds like you are the sole beneficiary of this fund and that your value proposition is regardless of asset class and competition to other investment opportunities in other words you are committed to blowing this $ 1,000 and would not consider instead putting the money towards paying down credit card debt or other valuable uses this rules out 3 you are left with 1 expected value now there is already evidence that penny stocks are a losing proposition in fact some people have been successful in setting up email accounts and waiting for penny stock spam then shorting those stocks so to maximize expected return invest 0 of your bankroll but that 's boring let 's ignore it as you have correctly identified the transaction costs are significant $ 14 in tolls on crossing the bridge both ways on a $ 1,000 investment already exceeds the 5-year us bond rate diversification will affect the correlation and overall risk kelly criterion of your portfolio but it has no effect on your expected return   in summary diversification has zero effect on your expected return and is not justified by the cost

well again i think you 're grasping at straws to try to justify monopoly   it 's entirely possible that in a free market there will be some rich individuals who choose to risk it all and hire a small army to attack their enemies or destroy property   but the whole point is that their armies will be far less powerful than the militaries governments currently have and they wo n't have popular acceptance as legitimate   i 'm well aware that anarchy would n't be a cake walk   the only claim i 'm making is that it would be superior to what we currently have a system whereby a monopolist millions of people each year for 1/3 of their income and their children for the first 18 years of their lives   that kind of centralization of power is extremely dangerous   gt;your security will have to be handled somehow do you think calling something a fee perhaps fundamental nature of the payment   of course not   we believe that people should pay for their security voluntarily just like they pay for their food and clothes   most people probably would n't even need security just some cameras a fence and a small gun   some societies are more violent than others naturally   we do n't expect to spring up in a particularly violent society as they tend to property rights anyway   we think its will happen in a first world atheist non violent country like denmark or new zealand   gt;again explicitly how are you going to handle security   i take with the way you 've phrased this   i will not be handling anything   it is up to consumers to decide what is best for them and entrepreneurs to experiment to determine the best way to do things   the market is a system of trial and error like the scientific process   here 's a video of one possible way it could be done

of course credit cards are viewed as credit if you 're using money on a credit card you are not directly paying for your transactions on goods services immediately this is the act of borrowing credit to pay for them debit cards on the other hand work where the funds are taken from an account immediately or subject to a small delay but usually no more than 24 hours depending on various factors you should never miss credit card payments as that will affect your credit rating if you have unpaid money on your card this is debt plain and simple but to answer your question succinctly yes credit cards are a form of credit as the name suggests when you apply for a mortgage any unpaid credit debt is considered and would adversely affect you if you have such debts the level to which it affects you depends on the amount of debt this is how it works in the uk but to my knowledge it is the same in the us and most other countries please clarify if you think this is incorrect

in my experience buy to let mortgages charge a higher rate of interest than an personal residential mortgage   they are regarded as a business enterprise and presumably the banks calculate that they carry a higher risk   a bank would probably take action if the property on an ordinary mortgage was rented out as you would be breaking their terms   policies could be rendered void   the terms on an ordinary mortgage disallow renting out the property

i think precious metals as an investment might set one up for disappointment   why does it seem to continually decline despite the variance   as many have noted there is n't much productive use for precious metals and no major wars are taking place so they are n't being used as currency substitutes not to mention that more is being pulled out of the ground every day the real reason why this graph shows silver to decline in real value over time is because its using a suboptimal price index   an optimal one would most likely show a stable price over the long run silver is a great speculation if one can determine with high confidence the direction

first i would recommend getting rid of this ridiculous debt or remember this day and this answer you will be living this way for many years to come and maybe worse no not enough retirement   hold off on any retirement savings right now so that the money can be used to crush this debt without knowing all of your specifics health insurance deductions etc and without any retirement contribution given $ 190,000 you should probably be taking home around $ 12,000 per month total   assuming a $ 2,000 mortgage payment 30 year term that is $ 10,000 left per month   if you were serious about paying this off you could easily live off of $ 3,000 per month probably less and have $ 7,000 left to throw at the student loan debt   this assumes that you have n't financed automobiles especially expensive ones or have other significant debt payments that 's around 3 years until the entire $ 300,000 is paid i have personally used and endorse the snowball method pay off smallest to largest regardless of interest rate though i did adjust it slightly to pay off some debts first that had a very high monthly payment so that i would then have this large payment to throw at the next debt after the debt is gone you now have the extra $ 7,000 per month probably more if you get raises bonuses etc to enjoy and start saving for retirement and kid 's college   you may have 20 25 years to save for retirement at $ 4,000 per month that 's $ 1 million in just savings not including the growth with moderate growth this could easily double or more   you 'll also have about 14 years to save for college for this one kid at $ 1,500 per month that 's $ 250,000 not including investment growth this is probably overkill for one kid so adjust accordingly then there 's at least $ 1,500 per month left to pay off the mortgage in less than half the time of the original term so in this scenario conservatively you might have obviously i do n't know your financials or circumstances so build a good budget and play with the numbers   if you sacrifice for a short time you 'll be way better off trust me from experience as a side note   assuming the loan debt is 50/50 you and your husband you made a good investment and he made a poor one   unless he is a public or charity attorney why is he making $ 60,000 when you are both attorneys and both have huge student loan debt   if it were me i would consider a job change   at least until the debt was cleaned up   if he can make $ 100,000 to $ 130,000 or more then your debt may be gone in under 2 years   then he can go back to the charity gig

i would n't give it a second thought i 'd get rid of the extra car and do everything i could in the following months to repay the emergency fund even without the interest payments i 'd consider getting rid of an unused car due to the very nature of a car being a depreciating asset that has insurance expenses and annual registration fees on top of that depreciation the one exception to the above would be a classic car that was purchased for an investment that is always and does n't need to be registered for road use i take it for granted that most people who can afford such investments do n't need my advice about when to sell

interest rates are always given annually to make them comparable if you prefer to calculate the rate or the total interest for the complete time like 10 years or 15 years or 30 years it is simple math and it tells you the total you will pay but it is not helpful for picking the better or even the right offer for your situation compare it to your car 's gas what sense does it make to provide the information that a car will use 5000 gallons of gas over its lifetime is that better than a car that uses 6000 gallons but may live 2 years longer

i had this happen to me with parking ticket when i was still in school   the tickets were issued by the school police and later dismissed because i had purchased a year long parking pass   3 years later i got a letter alleging that i had unpaid parking ticket   so they lost the record of dismissal   but they did not lose the record of having issued the ticket    i am fairly certain this happens because legal entities either lose electronic records and restore data from backups without realizing that some corrupted data remains lost or because they transition to a new system and certain real world events do n't get transferred properly to the new system   of course the people with whom you end up interacting at that point have no idea of any potential technical problems because they may occur only in some technical one off cases   in my case i was able to show that i had received a judgement of dismissal   i actually kept the paperwork the question is what do you do if you lost the records and the state had lost all electronic records of your payments   let 's assume the collections agency has a record produced by the state that you owed the ticket amount but the state claims that no record exists of you having paid the tickets   what do you do then carefully compile the list of all possible banks which you could have possibly used   then request duplicate statements from all the banks which you have on that list   assuming you were a regular consumer and not running a business this should not amount to more than 100 pages or so   if you do manage to find the transactions in those bank records you are in luck   states unlike the federal government are not immune from law suits   so you can consult a lawyer    by fraudulently claiming that you defaulted on payments the state caused you material harm by lowering your credit rating and increasing your cost of borrowing   once you have all the paperwork in hand you still will have difficult time finding anyone in the state to listen to you   and even if you do you will not be compensated for the time and expenses you expanded to obtain these records if you indeed paid the tickets then you are being asked to prove your innocence and you are assumed guilty until you do   again a good lawyer should be able to do something with that to get you a proper compensation for this

there are two types of credit checks first is the hard pull which is typically done when you apply for a credit line the lender will hard pull your file and make his her decision based on that this affects your score negatively you might lose few points for one hard inquiry second type is soft pull which is done as a background check typically done by credit card companies to send you a pre approved offer or renting an apartment etc this does not affect your score one thing to keep in mind is a company will not do a hard pull without your permission where as they can do soft pulls without you even knowing   soft inquiries vs hard inquiries

i am in complete agreement with you   the place i have found with the sort of charts you are looking for is    to compare the percentage increase of several stocks over a period of 2 market open days or more which is quite useful to follow the changes in various stocks etc an example   here the tickers are aa to otc and $ gold $ silver for the spot gold silver price that is n't really a ticker   it is set to show the last 6 market days one the 6 in   you can change it in the url above or change it on the site for the stocks you want up to 25 in one chart but it gets really hard to tell them apart   by moving the slider just left of the at the bottom right corner of the chart you can look at 2 days or more   for a specific time period in days highlight the and type any number of market open days you want 21 days = about one month etc   by setting a time period in days and moving the entire slider you can see how your stocks did in the last bull bear run as an example the site has a full how to for this and the other types of charts they offer the only problem is that many otc stocks are not charted save the comparison charts you use regularly in a folder in your browser bookmarks     i see the entire needed link is n't in blue but you need it all

i consider speculation to be a security purchase where the point is to sell it to someone for a higher price   day trading is completely speculative i consider investment to be a purchase you make for its underlying value you are buying it at that price because you believe the present value of the future payments is higher than the price you are paying i may sell an investment if a higher price is offered than i think it 's worth or if the business situation changes but i do n't plan on it    hedging is a third type of security purchase where you are decreasing your overall risk   if you are a hog farmer selling hog futures on the cme is hedging because it locks in the amount you get per hog regardless of what the price of does commodities markets only have and speculators   investors do n't make sense it does n't have an underlying value

yes digital can definitely technically a higher quality but sometimes it 's just not that pleasurable hearing a digital files pristine sounds right next to moments of perfect silence    you rarely ever heard perfect silence in nature there is always some kind of background noise i think this is a big part of why people say vinyl is warmer because there is plenty of white noise and all of the sounds are n't always perfectly crystal clear   of course it 's a matter of taste i 'm just saying for certain recordings that crystal clear instruments at every frequency can be kinda in the same way that being seated too close to the brass section of an could be unpleasant     a lot of music production software has low bit filters specifically because less perfect sounds can be more pleasing sometimes distortion and different treatments to sounds would be other examples of when musicians purposely create lo fi sound

the owner of a long futures contract does not receive dividends hence this is a disadvantage compared to owning the underlying stock if the dividend is increased and the future price would not change there is an arbitrage possibility for the sake of simplicity assume that the stock suddenly starts paying a dividend and that the risk free rate is zero so interest does not play a role one can expect that the future price is equal to the stock price before the dividend if the future price would not change an investor could buy the stock and short a futures contract on the stock at expiration he has to deliver the stock for the price set in the contract which is under the assumptions here equal to the price he bought the stock for but because he owned the stock he receives the announced dividend hence he can make a risk free profit consisting of the if interest do play a role the argument is similar

you are correct that a share of stock in a company has zero intrinsic value   even if the company typically pays dividends there 's no guarantee that it will continue to do so   a share 's only worth comes from so that 's one step better than a ponzi scheme because in a ponzi scheme there 's not actually any value present behind the scenes making option 2 literally impossible in this way company stock is similar to paper money   it 's only worth something because people believe it 's worth something slightly better than company stock is company bonds   since a bond is a contract between you and the company if the company should go out of business then bondholders at least get to stand near the front of the line when the company 's assets are liquidated i work in finance and the vast majority of my colleagues agree that the secondary stock market what the average citizen simply calls the stock market is a giant confidence game   and yet it 's so profitable to believe in the value of equities the way everyone else does that we all happily pretend these ones and zeroes we move around have actual value

gt but the buying power of that money can be significantly reduced to the point where it 's fundamentally useless i.e. inter war germany and many countries in south and central america   that 's true but how does that come about the effect on buying power stems from the level of spending in the present period too little leaves you anywhere from outright deflation and contraction to weaker growth falling short of capacity too much reaches capacity and keeps spending bidding up prices and driving down purchasing power   it has nothing to do with debt gdp or interest payments   gt germany managed to skate by by creating a new in a confidence trick and it worked because germany is a solid iron clad manufacturing powerhouse of a lot of stuff    there are two important differences between inter war germany and the us first is that inter war germany lost a this real shock is kind of important when you 're talking about buying power of money one side of it is the amount of money in circulation but the other side of it is how much real output there is to buy and german real output capacity collapsed after the war their most productive regions were occupied territory and they were no longer a powerhouse manufacturing a lot of stuff driving down the value of their currency   so lesson number one from germany real output collapse harms your currency   the second problem is that losing a war left germany saddled with war denominated in foreign currency when you 're on the hook for something you do n't print you 're in a situation where you can run out of money and that 's exactly what happened to them they tried printing more of their own currency to buy the foreign stuff with but that quickly drove down the value of german currency   so lesson number two from germany is you do n't want to be on the hook for a currency you do n't issue   put the two together and you have a real supply shock + foreign denominated debt the buying power of german currency it was n't debt gdp but the real basis for their economy collapsing out from under them pushed along by a need for foreign currency   gt;my question is at what point do we engage washington 's unlimited money printing presses until we reach that point   in answer to your question the printing presses are what funds the real economy the worry in terms of avoiding that point is in making sure we keep that real economy productive and fully funded ironically taking our eye off the ball to focus on budget balance at the expense of real output pushes the economy in the direction you 're afraid of going see also the euro zone today

asset = equity + income expense + liability everything could be cancelled out in double entry accounting   by your logic if the owner contributes capital as asset equity is very similar to asset   you will end up cancelling everything i.e. 0 = 0   you do not understate liability by cancelling them with asset   say you have $ 10000 debtors and $ 10000 creditors you do not say net debtors = $ 0 on the balance sheet   you are challenging the fundamental concepts of accounting   certain accounts are contra accounts for example accumulated depreciation is contra asset retained loss and unrealized revaluation loss is contra equity

i like this part   gt;because insurance companies are required to take all applicants healthy people especially the young would be wise to pay the penalty rather than buy the insurance this makes the pool of insured individuals and more costly on average and their premiums will higher with higher premiums more people will choose to pay the penalty and a downward spiral will unfold   which is the exact opposite of reality   if you have more people in an insurance pool premium costs go down which is the whole point of the individual mandate   it 's like they 're trying to scare people to not buy health insurance and waste it on a fine instead   real nice

why does selling a bond drive up the yield the bond will pay back a fixed amount when it comes due the yield is a comparison of what you pay for the bond and what will be repaid when it matures assuming no default why does the yield go up if the country is economically unstable if the country 's economy is unstable that increases the chance that they will default and not pay the full value of the bonds when they mature people are selling them now at a loss instead of waiting for a default later for a greater loss so if you think greece is not going to default as it 's highly likely a country would completely default would n't it make sense to hold onto the bonds only if you also think that they will pay back the full value at maturity it 's possible that they pay some but not all it 's also possible that they will default it 's also possible that they will get kicked out of the euro and start printing drachmas again and try to pay the bonds back with those which could devalue the bonds through inflation the market is made of lots of smart people if they think there are reasons to worry there probably are that does n't mean they can predict the future it just means that they are pricing the risk with good information if you are smarter than the herd by all means bet against them and buy the bonds now it can indeed be lucrative if you are right and they are wrong

great question there are several reasons i 'm going to list the few that i can think of off the top of my head right now first even if institutional bank holdings in such a term account are covered by deposit insurance this as well as the amount covered varies geographically the amount covered is generally trivial when seen in the context of bank holdings an individual might have on the order of $ 1,000 $ 10,000 in such an account for a bank that 's basically chump change and you are looking more at numbers in the millions of dollars range sometimes a lot more than that for a large bank even hundreds of millions of dollars might be a relatively small portion of their holdings the 2011 goldman sachs annual report i just pulled a big bank out of thin air here no affiliation with them that i know of states that as of december 2011 their excess liquidity was million us dollars over 170 billion dollars with a bottom line total assets of $ million a shade under a trillion dollars book value good luck finding a bank that will pay you 4 interest on even a fraction of such an amount gs income before tax in 2011 was a shade under 6.2 billion dollars 4 on 170 billion dollars is 6.8 billion dollars that is the interest payments at such a rate on their excess liquidity alone would have cost more than they themselves made in the entire year which is completely unsustainable government bonds are as guaranteed as deposit insurance covered bank accounts it 'll be the government that steps in and pays the guaranteed amount quite possibly issuing bonds to cover the cost but assuming the country does not default on its debt which happens from time to time you will get back the entire amount plus interest for a deposit insured bank account of any kind you are only guaranteed to the extent that one can guarantee anything the maximum amount in the country 's bank deposit insurance i believe in most countries this is at best on the order of $ 100,000 if the bank where the money is kept goes bankrupt for holdings on the order of what banks deal with you would be extremely lucky to recover even a few percent of the principal government bonds are also generally accepted as collateral for the bank 's own loans which can make a difference when you need to raise more money in short order because a large customer decided to withdraw a big pile of cash from their account maybe to buy stocks or bonds themselves government bonds are generally liquid that is they are n't just issued by the government held to maturity while paying interest and then returned electronically these days in return for their face value in cash government bonds are bought and sold on the secondary market as well where they are traded in very much the same way as public company stocks if banks started simply depositing money with each other all else aside then what would happen keep in mind that the interest rate is basically the price of money supply and demand would dictate that if you get a huge inflow of capital you can lower the interest rate paid on that capital banks do n't pay high interest and certainly would n't do so to each other because of their good will they pay high interest because they can not secure capital funding at lower rates this is a large reason why the large banks will generally pay much lower interest rates than smaller niche banks the larger banks are seen as more reliable in the bond market so are able to get funding more cheaply by issuing bonds individuals will often buy bonds for the perceived safety depending on how much money you are dealing with sold a large house recently it is quite possible even for individuals to hit the ceiling on deposit insurance and for any of a number of reasons they might not feel comfortable putting the money in the stock market buying government bonds then becomes a relatively attractive option you get a slightly lower return than you might be able to get in a high interest savings account but you are virtually guaranteed return of the entire principal if the bond is held to maturity on the other hand it might not be the case that you will get the entire principal back if the bank paying the high interest gets into financial trouble or even bankruptcy some people have personal or systemic objections toward banks limiting their willingness to deposit large amounts of money with them and of course in some cases such as for example retirement savings it might not even be possible to simply stash the money in a savings account in which case bonds of some kind is your only option if you want a purely interest bearing investment

in undergrad business you will have a broad scope of information to cover and schools and professors will vary widely in how they approach it   it will be hard to say for certain how you can edge out your peers before knowing what they are looking for however finance and business are intellectually nebulous especially at the undergrad level your best bet is to maintain a broad set of interests and stay well read on them   i would recommend watching bloomberg fairly regularly opening a brokerage account and taking advantage of the reps you can talk to and reading news like the atlantic and washington post   among others as long as they are well reasoned and contemporary accounts classic and modern economics books will give you superior frameworks in which to look at the smaller world of finance which should set you apart from your peers as well

the best advice i can give you is to ignore gold right now you really do n't and ca n't have all the information you would need to support an argument for shorting gold   how much fiat cash have the central banks injected into the word economy billions trillions tens of trillions maybe not much at all as the banks repay overnight    anyway without going on a full on rant why would you touch gold on a short i can understand speculating on long position based on all the news out there but i 'd hesitate to be a in this market   just find a nice little company that makes money has a good product and a pretty little balance sheet it will take longer to research but fuck if i 'm betting on a huge drop in gold any time soon   what reasons do you have to believe gold is headed for any significant slide

first off leaving money in a 529 account is not that bad since you may always change the beneficiary to most any blood relative   so if you have leftovers you do n't have to pay the 10 penalty if you have a for instance that can use it   but if you would rather have the money out then you need a strategy to get it out that is tax efficient my prescription for managing a situation like this is not to pay directly out of the 529 account but instead calculate your cost of education up front and withdraw that money at the beginning of the school year   you can keep it in a separate account but that 's not necessary   the amount you withdraw should be equal to what the education costs which may be estimated by taking the budget that the school publishes minus grants and scholarships   you should have all of those numbers before the first day of school   this is amount $ x. during the year write all the checks out of your regular account   at the end of the school year you should expect to have no money left in the account   i presume that the budget is exactly what you will spend   if not you might need to make a few adjustments but this answer will presume you spend exactly $ x during the fall and the spring of the next year in order to get more out of the 529 without paying penalties you are allowed to remove money without penalty but having the gains taxed $ y + $ z   you have the choice of having the 529 funds directed to the educational institution the student or yourself   if you direct the funds to the student the gains portion would be taxed at the student 's rate   everyone 's tax situation is different and of course there is a between the parent 's taxes and student 's taxes but it may be efficient to have the 529 funds directed to the student   for instance if the student does n't have much income they might not even be required to file income tax   if that 's the case they may be able to remove an amount $ y from the 529 account and still not need to file   for instance let 's say the student has no unearned income and the gains in the 529 account were 50   the student could get a check for $ 2,000 $ 1,000 would be gains but that low amount may mean the student was not required to file or if it 's more important to get more money out of the account the student could remove the total amount of the grants plus scholarships $ y + $ z   no penalty would be due just the taxes on the gains   and at the student 's tax rate generally but check your own situation finally if you really want the money out of the account you could remove a check $ y + $ z + $ p   you 'd pay tax on the gains of the sum but penalty of 10 only on the $ p portion this answer does not include the math that goes along with securing some tax credits so if those credits still are around as you 're working through this consider this article which requires site sign up   in part this article says how much to withdraw     for most parents it will be 100 of the beneficiary ’s qualified higher education expenses paid this year tuition fees books supplies equipment and room and board less $ 4,000 the $ 4,000 is redirected to the american opportunity tax credit when to withdraw it     take withdrawals in the same calendar year that the qualified expenses were paid designating the     since it is usually best that the form be issued to the beneficiary and show the beneficiary ’s social security number i prefer to use either option 2 or 3 2 a check made out to the account beneficiary or 3 a check made out to the educational institution what about scholarships     the 10 percent penalty on a non qualified distribution from a 529 plan is waived when the excess distribution can be attributed to tax free scholarships while there is no direct guidance from the irs many tax experts believe the distribution and the scholarship do not have to match up in the same calendar year when applying the penalty waiver if you 're curious about timing taking non penalty grants and scholarship money out there is this link which says you probably are allowed to accumulate grants and scholarship totals for tax purposes over multiple years

this depends strongly on what you mean by stock trading   it is n't a single game but a huge number of games grouped under a single name you can invest in individual stocks if you 're willing to make the large effort needed to research the companies and their current position and this can yield large returns at high risk or moderate returns at moderate risk you need to diversify across multiple stocks and multiple kinds of stocks and probably bonds and other investment vehicles as well to manage that risk or you can invest in managed mutual funds where someone picks and balances the stocks for you they charge a fee for that service which has to be subtracted from their stated returns you need to decide how much you trust them you will usually need to diversify across multiple funds to get the balance of risk you 're looking for with a few exceptions like target date funds or you can invest in index funds which automate the stock picking process to take a wide view of the market and count on the fact that over time the market as a whole moves upward these may not produce the same returns on paper but their fees are much lower enough so that the actual returns to the investor can be as good as or better than managed funds the same point about diversification remains true with the same exceptions or you can invest in a mixture of these plus bonds and other investment vehicles to suit your own level of confidence in your abilities confidence in the market as a whole risk tolerance and so on having said all that there 's also a huge difference between trading and investing at least as i use the terms stock trading on a short term basis is much closer to pure gambling unless you do the work to deeply research the stocks in question so you know their value better than other people do and you 're playing against pros you know the rule about poker if you look around the table and do n't see the sucker he 's sitting in your seat well that 's true to some degree in short term trading too this is n't quite a zero sum game but it takes more work to play well than i consider worth the effort investing for the long term defining a balanced mixture of investments and maintaining that mixture for years with purchases and sales chosen to keep things balanced is a positive sum game since the market does drift upward over time at a long term average of about if you 're sufficiently diversified which is one reason i like index funds you 're basically riding that rise this puts you in the position of betting with the pros rather than against them which is a lower risk position of course the potential returns are reduced too but i 've found that market rate of return has been entirely adequate though not exciting of course there 's risk here too if the market dips for some reason such as the great recession we just went through but if you 're planning for the long term you can usually ride out such dips and perhaps even see them as opportunities to buy at a discount others can tell you more about the details of each of these and may disagree with my but that 's the approach i 've taken based on advice i trust i could probably increase my returns if i was willing to invest more time and effort in doing so but i do n't especially like playing games for money and i 'm getting quite enough for my purposes and spending near zero effort on it which is exactly what i want

square use ssn to verify identity and they only ask for the last 4 digits for that purpose if she entered the full ssn then she entered it into the tax i d field which was a wrong thing to do it is also worth mentioning that since you mentioned a business partner that should have taken care of taxes that you should have a tax adviser whose job would be to take care of taxes and ensure that your interests are well represented i would suggest not to try interacting with the irs on your own hire a tax adviser ea cpa licensed in your state to do that that tax adviser will be able to fix the problem there are different ways of doing it depending on the circumstances and also verify that the business taxes were properly taken care of when dealing with business partners assume that what they 've supposedly did was not done until you see it with your own eyes saying that supposedly her business partner took care of all tax issues means in this case that you 've been caught with unreported income that you tried to conceal it is your your sister 's responsibility to prove otherwise it is a very weak defense when the irs comes knocking on the door for their money

lots of good advice on investing already you may also want to think about two things a bausparvertrag you can set this up for different monthly saving rates you 'll get a modest interest payment and once you have saved up enough the contract is you will be eligible for a loan at a low rate however you can only use the loan for building buying or renovating real estate with interest rates as low as they are right now this is not overly attractive however depending on your salary you may qualify for subsidies and these could indeed be rather attractive this may be helpful in german a this is a subsidized saving scheme you save something every year and again get subsidies at the end of the year i think the salary thresholds where you qualify for a subsidy are a bit higher for the than for a bausparvertrag and even if you do n't qualify for a subsidy your contributions will be deducted from your taxable income i would n't invest all my leftover money in these considering that you commit yourself for the medium to long term but they might well be attractive options for at least part of your money say 20 25 of what you aim at saving every month finally as others have written banks and insurance companies exist to make money and they live off their provisions get an independent financial advisor you pay by the hour who does n't get provisions and have him help you

i 'm a long way from an expert on this but it seems to me you can loan your fiance enough money to pay off her loans and that incurs no tax penalty when you are married you can write off the loan without a tax penalty since she is your spouse i would expect that you can a gift as a loan for a tax year you have n't yet filed for or she can give you the money back and you immediately make her a loan for the same amount as the comments and this question would indicate a loan at below an approved rate would be considered a gift however you do appear to be able to loan her the money at an approved rate and gift her the interest payments which should be less than the gift tax limit you would need to write up a loan document once you are married you should be able to make another gift to pay off the loan

options reflect expectations about the underlying asset and options are commonly priced using the black scholes model   and are probability functions s is the spot current price of the asset k is the strike price r is the risk free rate and t t represents time to maturity   without getting into the mathematics it to say that higher volatility or expectation of volatility increases the perceived riskiness of the asset so call options are priced lower   and put options are priced higher think about it intuitively if the stock is more likely to go downwards then there 's an increased chance that the call option expires worthless so call options must be priced lower to accommodate the relative change in expected value of the option   puts are priced similarly but they move inversely with respect to call option prices due to put call parity so if call option prices are falling then put option prices are rising note however that call prices falling does not cause put prices to rise the inverse relationship exists because of changes in the underlying factors and how pricing works so the option action signifies that the market believes the stock is headed lower in the given time frame that does not mean it will go lower and option traders assume risk whenever they take a particular position bottom line got ta do your own homework best of luck

i think the idea here is that because of the way mortgages are amortized you can drop additional principal payments in the early years of the mortgage and significantly lower the overall interest expense over the life of the loan a heloc accrues interest like a credit card so if you make a large principal payment using a heloc you will be able to retire those chunks of debt quicker than if you made normal mortgage payments i have n't worked out the numbers but i suspect that you could achieve similar results by simply paying ahead making even one extra payment per year will take 7 9 years off of a 30 year loan i think that the advantage of the heloc approach is that if you borrow enough you may be able to recalculate lower the payment of the mortgage

not to mention that what they were doing was the right way to do it for many decades it was simply seen as the norm that you would have a job take part of your savings and put that into a 401k because it was the only way to really provide for a safe future   so that 's what we did oops   the other big difference between gen x and the surrounding generations in regards to retirement is social security the baby boomers will have social security for most of the rest of their lives it 's funded and it wo n't be a problem millenials have mostly come of age knowing that 's a joke gen x on the other hand grew up and worked at least part of their lives under the assumption that social security while having problems would at least provide some help however with the way the economy and government is going it 's very possible that wo n't be a guarantee without major adjustments decreased payout increased retirement age etc so they 're going to be taking it there as well   that 's not even to get started on the mortgage situation for a lot of us x'ers we bought homes near or at the top of the bubble again because everyone was telling our generation that we were foolish for renting why with the tax incentives in place and the way housing prices have been rising the last 20 years you 're just throwing your money away by renting so again the baby boomers enjoyed 20 30 years of rising home prices giving them a chance to build up a lot of equity and refinance at lower and lower rates the millenials again were shielded simply by not being at the point in their lives where it would be a problem once again it 's gen x that was just trying to do what they had observed as working their entire life   i think generation x will rise out of everything that has happened much wiser most of us have been through enough at this point that i think we 're beginning to become very of the way things are and that will have heavy ramifications as the reigns of power fall from the boomers to the x'ers   may you live in interesting times

i had this problem when i finished my job in canada in sept 2013    you 'll likely have to open the account in person in canada at least if you do n't already have a relationship with a broker there do not go to virtual brokers   they told me that my us citizenship was no problem but right before i left canada to double check   it was n't until i asked specifically which us states they were licensed in that they realized they were licensed in no us states they told me that they 'd freeze my account when i left i then moved my former pension to a locked in rrsp at bmo   as of september 2010 bmo could handle residents of most us states but it took some tooth pulling to get the list out of them   however after i flew to the usa bmo called to demand more id   my account was frozen until i flew back to canada in person just to show id annoyed i closed the bmo account and moved it to td waterhouse   td waterhouse can handle accounts for residents of all the us states except virginia louisiana and nebraska   i only got the complete list of exceptions when i made my first trade since the guys at the trading desk are much more knowledgeable about such things than the guys in the branch   td was extremely friendly about my usa citizenship residence   many canadian brokers simply wo n't accept us residents at least as of the end of 2013 whichever broker you choose bring lots more id than they require   insist that they it all make sure to include your social security card   you do n't want them to demand more id after you 've left the country like bmo did   they may even make such a move simply to get rid of us customers because the fatca is a pain for foreign banks

it depends how deep in the money it is compared to the dividend   even an in the money call has some time premium as the call holder if i exercise instead of selling the call i am trading the potential for a dividend which i wo n't receive for getting that time premium back by selling   given the above you 'll notice a slight distortion in options pricing as a dividend date approaches as the option will reflect not just the time premium but the fact that exercising with grab the dividend   edit to address your comment $ 10 stock $ 9 strike 50 cent div if the option price is high say $ 2 because there 's a year till expiration exercising makes no sense if it 's just $ 1.10 i gain 40 cents by exercising and selling after the dividend

the problem with a little bit of deflation is that it can turn into a lot of deflation very quickly   that i d the risk of the so called liquidity trap   a place where the fed truly does lose its power and depressions become possible   the us housing market is in a secular depression   people are n't buying despite record low rates because they assume the house will be cheaper next year   now imagine that across the entire economy   the longer you wait the cheaper things get   it sounds but the problem is that it is n't just you waiting it is everyone waiting all at the same time   so the economy such as it is grinds to a halt and jobs vanish and things get even cheaper   it is a cycle that is extremely costly to get out of   the last time we fell into a depression it took massive new government spending programs plus a world war to fully pull us out of it   some people might make the argument that you need a good long depression every now and then   they may say that in fact the great depression was the catalyst for policies that set america up for 70 years of solid economic growth   i 'm not so sure   i do look at our current situation with bailed out zombie banks and i have to wonder if just letting them all fail may have been better even though the short term pain would have been severe   we 'll probably know in about 5 years if they did the right thing

bad areas are tough to value as a owner occupied property because the business model for being a slumlord is to rent apartments in usually to tenants receiving goverment subsidies such as section 8 vouchers the vouchers are based on a prevailing rent which are often on par with nice suburban apartment complexes due to how that prevailing rate is calculated so the value of the house is really an annuity calculation you figure out the potential rental cash flow and apply whatever your local market premium is the point is doing an apples to apples comparison is going to be tough and justifying the cost of repairs that are n't health and safety issues probably wo n't be recoverable from a home valuation standpoint a buyer would probably rip out your central air conditioner and sell it if i were in your shoes i 'd look at the time horizon that you think you 're going to be there and amortize the cost over that period assuming your mortgage is small and you 're staying for about 5 years spending $ 10k costs you about $ 170 a month your reward is a modern a c and heating system compare that cost to the cost of moving and your desires and see if it 's worth it to you

there seems to be a disconnect between brands and channels in which brands advertise while i see and agree the point of the article it treats all media channels as equal where there are clear differences between them and as an extension the level of confidence given to a brand as a result    the author does focuses on the millennials as a target group that is less receptive to advertising but neglects to take into account the sheer volume of advertising that is around us compared to ten or even twenty years ago the increase has been exponential today it ’s almost impossible to even go to even a family without having it sponsored by your local dentist real estate agent and pizza chain   the fact that millennial are performing more due diligence is not just a reflection on the group as a whole but speaks volumes of the sheer quantity of many low quality options of media and advertising we come across on a daily basis

i think   the cleanest way to do this is to rent the house from your father for 2 years possibly adding an option to buy at a set price to the lease agreement   that takes care of any gift issues and avoids complications like you living in a house that you could n't afford to own otherwise   if when you are able to afford a mortgage get a mortgage on the house and buy it from your father    will a bank be willing to take out a mortgage on a house that i technically own for the full amount i would not take out a mortgage for anything more than 80 of the house 's market value   anything more than that and you need to pay mortgage insurance which will increase your monthly payment for no benefit to you    my biggest concern is that you wo n't be able to afford an 80 mortgage after 2 years   if your father really wants to keep the house in the family then he should either keep the house and rent it to you or give you the down payment as a gift keeping under the maximum gift to avoid taxes if neither you or your father can not afford the house you may have no choice but to sell it   i would not advise you make a bad financial decision purely for sentimental reasons

does this make sense i 'm concerned that by buying shares with post tax income i 'll have ended up being taxed twice or have increased my taxable income the company will then re reimburse me for the difference in stock price between the vesting and the purchase share price sure   assuming you received a rsu for shares worth $ 10 and your marginal tax rate is 30 all made up numbers either or so you 're in the same spot either way   you paid $ 300 to get $ 1,000 worth of stock taxes are the same as well   the full value of the rsu will count as income either way and you 'll either pay tax on the gains of the 100 shares in your rsu our you 'll pay tax on gains on the 70 shares in your rsu and the 30 shares you bought   since they 're reimbursing you for any difference the cost basis will be the same although you might get taxed on the reimbursement but that should be a relatively small amount this first year i wanted to keep all of the shares due to tax reasons and because believe the share price will go up i do n't see how this would make a difference from a tax standpoint you 're going to pay tax on the rsu either way either in shares or in cash   how does the value of the shares going up make a difference in tax additionally i 'm concerned that by doing this i 'm going to be hit by my bank for exchange fees foreign money transfer charges broker purchase fees etc   that might be true if that 's the case then you need to decide whether to keep fighting or decide if it 's worth the transaction costs

all shares of the same class are considered equal each class of shares may have a different preference in order of repayment   after all company liabilities have been paid off including bank debt wages owing taxes outstanding etc etc the remaining cash value in a company is distributed to the shareholders in general there are 2 types of shares preferred shares and common shares   preferred shares generally have 3 characteristics 1 they get a stated dividend rate every year sometimes regardless of company performance 2 they get paid out first on liquidation and 3 they can only receive their stated value on liquidation that is $ 1 m of preferred shares will be redeemed for at most $ 1 m on liquidation assuming the corporation has at least that much cash left common shares generally have 4 characteristics 1 their dividends are not guaranteed or may be based on a calculation relative to company performance 2 they can vote for members of the board of directors who ultimately hire the ceo and make similar high level business decisions 3 they get paid last on liquidation and 4 they get all value remaining in the company once everyone else has been paid so it is not the order of share subscription that matters it is the class once you know how much each class gets based on the terms listed in that share subscription you simply divide the total class payout by number of shares and pay that much for each share a person holds for companies organized other than as corporations ie partnerships the calculation of who gets what will be both simpler and more complex simpler in that generally speaking a partnership interest can not be of a different class like shares can meaning all partners are equal relative to the size of their partnership interest more complex in that if the initiation of the company was done in an informal way it could easily become a legal fight as to who contributed what to the company

when you buy a put on a stock you buy the right to sell the stock at fixed price f that his usually different from the market price m. you paid a price p for the put   your potential profit going forward is represented by the difference you get to collect between your fixed price f and that market price m plus the price you paid for the put or this assumes that p is fixed but the smaller m gets the larger the term and therefore the higher your potential profit from owning the put so when m tanks the put goes higher   the $ put is already in the money if it were settled today the value would be $ or $ 19 this minus the cost of the put itself represents your profit the $ 365 put is out of the money the stock has to fall $ 11 more before the put is exercised but if the stock went down 8 points today that is less than the $ 19 difference at the start of the day because there is time between now and october there is a chance for the stock to go down further thereby going into the money the current value of the put is represented by this chance obviously the chances of the stock going down $ 11 more from today is greater than the chance of it going down $ 19 more on the other hand the closer it gets to the expiration date the less an out of the money put is worth it 's a race between the stock 's fall and the time to expiration

gt make reddit more profitable   seriously come on   reddit is plenty accessible to the base that loves it me included   making it more like facebook and twitter will only drive existing users unprofitable users away and bring in or try to bring in more profitable users   it 's like kitchen we 're the old school customers we love our microwaved and potatoes but that is n't making money for the restaurant   now we only come here for those things it 's familiar comforting we 're not your typical customer   but for the restaurant to stay open they need to be more accessible to the average customer have new and exciting things   so the menu needs to be changed   they 'll get new customers one 's who like the new menu but at the expense of loosing us   which is fine because we do n't pay the bills   we do n't matter   that 's what you do n't get   we 're not paying for reddit and that is a problem   that 's why there 's been more rounds of funding diluting the already existing shares because without this influx reddit would sink   they 're trying to stay open with the old menu but at some point they need to make a buck and a new menu is what is going to happen   being in denial is n't going to stop that   gt;do you think companies like uber who absolutely money are thinking that profit is their top priority   uber is forcing traditional taxi companies out of their own market   they can ride on losses for a very long time because they are clearly the future much like amazon   reddit is not doing anything like that     gt;no it 's about growing the user base there 's arguably more value in that these days for tech companies   reddit is n't a tech company it 's a social media company it 's technology is neat but does n't produce a profit mostly because reddit users are savvy enough to run ad block and we do n't buy reddit gold enough to care   notice the privacy policy changes and the do not track abandonment   selling our data is the next attempt to make money and better targeted marketing   but for that to work we need facebook and twitter users meaning we need to be dumbed down to be more like them

having stock options means that you have worked for and rightfully earned a part of the company 's capital appreciation takeover of the company would indicate someone is interested in the company something should be valuable it would be unwise to not strike before the period since the strike price is always lower than market price and takeovers generally increases stock values it is capital gains all the way my friend good luck observations not in professional capacity pls consult a professional for investment related advice

you just disclosed that you are new investor to the stock market i 'd advise that you first understand investing a bit better as most will advise that investors need to be above a certain level before picking individual stocks   that said most stocks trade in high enough volume and have low enough short interest that they do n't fall under the category you seek you want to first ask your broker if they have such a process not all do if so they would need to provide you with the stocks that fall into this odd situation specifically the shares that have traders seeking to short the stock but the stock is unavailable even then the broker may have requirements that you do n't fall into minimum history with broker minimum size account etc worse they are not likely to offer this for 100 shares but may have a 1000 or higher share requirement are you willing to buy some obscure $ priced stock to lend out at the guy trying to short it is far smarter than both you and i at least regarding this particular stock this strategy is more appropriate for the 7 figure net worth investor   if any reader has actual experience with this i 'm happy to hear it this response is from my recollection of two articles i read about 3 years ago coincidence they both were published within weeks of each other

taxi regulations exist to protect the public it 's not some racket to keep people out of the market   insurance uber lyft only insure their drivers while they are loaded meaning any other time they are driving around even if they are driving to a call they are n't insured if they get in a wreck their own car insurance wo n't cover it because they do n't have taxi insurance which is a shit load more expensive than regular car insurance   red lining red lining is where taxi companies will not server certain neighborhoods meaning they will neither pick up nor drop off in the area   discrimination all classes are protected under taxi regulations with serious repercussions for discrimination this also includes people with disabilities like the blind and those in wheel chairs   rates taxi rates are typically approved by the city so that companies ca n't constantly change them this is a big one as far as uber lyft goes   really what it comes down to is uber lyft need to operate on a level playing field they are a taxi service there is absolutely no question about this and it is n't up for dispute they need to obey the same laws that taxi companies are still held to or be fined into oblivion if you actually bother to read the taxi regs for your city you will see they are there to protect you as a customer and have little benefit to taxi companies about the only rule i can think of are the regulations regarding paying your fare for all the rest the taxi companies would be better off without because they would n't be forced to serve people they do n't want to   in my experience the cab companies do n't care about additional competition because it 's the nature of the business the fact that uber lyft completely disregard all the regulations is what they have a problem with   8 years in the taxi industry

the first part of your comment is clearly copy pasted or from a cnn type news source i will however grant you the gop has done an exceptional job with their misinformation regarding the aca the left has done so as well the 20 million people added to healthcare is a number they boast and brag about when they do nt realize from a study i m having a hard time so take it with a grain of salt roughly 65 of those people could afford health insurance prior to the aca just chose not to buy and because of the mandate were forced to i also know that for me health insurance prior to the aca was significantly lower roughly 50 cheaper and that does nt even begin to touch the hikes a lot of people i know saw so the big difference here is preference because we can both   pull information supporting our arguments and you may think you re morally superior to me for wanting to get everyone healthcare by any means necessary whereas i want to make it cheaper and give people the tools and resources to afford it instead of being reliant on theft to receive it    gt;however i do n't think they are the low tax haven that you think they are   they have some of the lowest income tax rates in the world yes i would love to see 0 income tax rates but lower is always better   gt;i am now owner of a company that does r&amp;d and works with the government a lot of my knowledge about inventions and how commercial works with government comes from my own personal experiences   while i do not own my own company or have anything to do with r&amp;d i can for a fact disprove your theory that    comes to this game with the that government ca n't get anything done as well as commercial quickly learns that is not true   as i have and do work on many government contracted sites i m in construction and i can tell you from first hand experience the amount of wasted time and money on these sites is absolutely astounding for instance i worked on a   government building a year and a half ago in the western half of the country this building was meant to service veterans not only was this building over budget by 100 it was also 2 years behind schedule many people would say that this is the contractors fault but that s only partly true because in a private sector site these contractors would nt have lasted more than a month before being replaced we have both seen the opposite side of the same coin we both acknowledge the private sector does everything better for the most part the only difference is you like the funding to be public of course you do you make a fucking killing on these government contracts whereas i want the funding to be private the private sector will always have a need to innovate and that need will always be filled with or without the government the only difference is the private sector wo nt keep throwing money at an unsustainable rate like the government does because if they do nt see results its not worth funding   i d also like to add you are near the same age as my father who also served in the military and i thank you for your service

what is the right way to handle this did you check the forms did the form state $ 0 tax due on the ftb llc corp form i 'm guessing you operate as llc corp since you 're dealing with the franchise tax the responsibility is ultimately yours you should cross check all the numbers and verify that they 're correct that said if the cpa filled the forms incorrectly based on your correct data then she made a mistake and can be held liable cpa filing forms from a jurisdiction on the other end of the country without proper research and knowledge may be held negligent if she made a grave mistake you can file a law suit against the cpa which will probably trigger her insurance carrier who 'll try to settle if there 's a good chance for your lawsuit to not be thrown away outright or complain to the state regulatory agency overseeing cpas in the state of her license or both am i wrong for expecting the cpa should have properly filled out and filed my taxes no but it does n't shift the responsibility from you how can i find out if the cpa has missed anything else same as with doctors and lawyers get a second opinion preferably from a cpa licensed in california you and only you are responsible for your taxes you may try to pin the penalties and interest on the cpa if she really made a mistake california is notorious for very high llc corp franchise tax cost of registering to do business in the state it 's $ 800 a year you should have read the forms and the instructions carefully it is very prominent it is also very well discussed all over the internet any search engine would pop it up for you with a simple california franchise tax for llc corp search ca ftb is also very aggressive in assessing and collecting the fee and the rules of establishing nexus in ca are very broad from your description it sounds like you were liable for the franchise tax in ca since you had a storage facility in ca you may also be liable for sales taxes for that period

to me the most important thing for young people to learn about personal finance is the connection between service and income   most rightly look for a way to earn money and advance the lifestyle of their home life   how does one do that   grinding it out in a 9 5 does not seem attractive while living the lifestyles of those on tv would be awesome    the temptation is to try all these tricks to get money but absent from their plan is how they serve their fellow man in order to receive that money stars like the are a marketing machine despite the life displayed on the tv   they have served many budding companies well by selling their products to certain demographics   most young people do not make that connection    so they try things like trading forex gold or whatever the latest thing is   it does not work as there is no service to their fellow man   they get a job at a fast food chain and complain about their pay in accordance with their work   well sure but again they are serving such few people that one can only expect a small income    the better and more people one can serve in general the higher a person 's income

with forex trading physical currency is not involved you 're playing with the live exchange rates and it is not designed for purchasing selling physical currency most forex trading is based on leveraging thus you 're not only buying money that you 're not going to physically receive you 're also paying with money that you do not physically have the investment is in fact a speculation and is akin to gambling which if i remember correctly is strictly forbidden under the islam rules that said the positions you have are yours and technically you can demand the physical currency to be delivered to you no broker will allow online trading on these conditions though similarly to the stocks almost no broker allows using physical certificates for stocks trading anymore

determine an investment strategy and that will likely answer this for you different people have different approaches and you need to determine for yourself what buy and sell criteria you want to have again depending on the strategy there can be a wide range here as some may trade index funds though this can backfire in some cases in others there can be a lot of buy and hold if one finds an index fund to hold forever which depending on the strategy is possible returns can vary widely as an index can be everything from buying gold stocks in russia to investing in short term treasuries as there are many different indices as any given market can have an index which could be stocks bonds a combination of the two or something else in some cases so please consider asset allocation types of accounts risk tolerance and time horizon in making decisions or consider using a financial planner to assist in drawing up a plan with allocations and how frequently you want to rebalance as my suggestion here

is this subreddit anti mba i think this notion written by the author is nothing new it 's been said a hundred times by those in the valley and has been by thousands more who are not really sure why they are saying it    personally i think when you make such a comment or even support it you need to think about the industry the person wishes to enter if they are going for something in the tech industry fine i 'm not going to argue against that because that industry is build on that seems to run around ridiculous business models aimed at fast exits   did i offend someone in the tech industry with that comment i hope so   now if you 're going into other fields that require some serious capital e.g. medical energy telecommunications then the chances that the person running the company does n't have some sort of advanced degree is very very small these days notice i said these days   chances are that person will have an mba     i have met scores of c suite folks in these startups in the of this country and find it ridiculously rare for anyone to not have an mba or equivalent experience leading a company that has acquired investment   that only exists in the tech industry and even the founders are generally replaced by more experienced personnel   this notion of being against advanced degrees is ridiculous and not supported by any data whatsoever everyone always in on the success stories of entrepreneurs who were able to do it but what folks fail to realize is those stories are a tiny fraction of the entrepreneurs who are able to lead a company through it 's development    long story short if an entrepreneur is looking for serious capital in a non tech related industry they will need to have an mba or advanced degree and/or years of experience in the industry before any investor will take them seriously if they do n't then the investors will request that they do bring on someone who does per the terms of the agreement

mortgage is a secured debt a combination of a promissory note and a security interest providing the mortage holder a secured interest in the property yes you are in debt but that depends upon whether you define the term in debt as a debt appearing on the balance sheet or the net of assets liabilities is less than zero whether you have a debt expense on the income statement budget or whether the net of income expenses is less than zero one person might look at their budget find the monthly mortgage payment listed and judge that they have a debt payment and thus are in debt or they might look at their expenses find they exceed their income and judge that they are in debt another person might look at their balance sheet compare assets to liabilities and only say they were in debt when their liabilities exceeded their assets some people view mortgage debt as good debt as they view certain debts as good and others as bad trust me having a high mortgage payment higher 30 of your net income is hard and over 40 is bad consider you balance sheet and your income statement   on your balance sheet the house appears on the asset side with an estimated value while the mortgage really the promissory note part of the mortgage appears on the liability side on your income statement your house does not appear on the income side but the mortgage promissory note payment appears on the expense side so you clearly have both a liability with a clearly defined value and an expense with a clearly defined payment but do you have an asset according to an accountant you have an asset and a liability but you do not have a business asset that is producing revenue income nor do you have a business asset that can be amortized and expensed to reduce taxable income when we think about an asset does the word have the connotation of some thing with value something that produces income   well by that measure a house only provides income when we rent it out and only has value when we consider selling it as millions of families discovered during the housing price collapse when the market price of your asset falls substantially your personal financial status can fall negative and you can be broke

your question is based on incorrect assumptions generally there 's no penalty per se to make a withdrawal from your rrsp even if you make a withdrawal earlier than retirement however you define it a precise meaning for retirement with respect to rrsps is largely irrelevant our u.s. neighbours have a 10 penalty on non hardship early withdrawals before age 59 half from retirement accounts like the 401k and ira it 's an additional measure designed to discourage early withdrawals and raise more tax   yet in canada there is no similar penalty individual investments inside your rrsp may have associated penalties such as the dreaded deferred sales charge of some back end loaded mutual funds or such as funds that generated additional special tax credits that could get clawed back   yet these early withdrawal penalties are distinct from the rrsp nature of your account   choose your investments carefully to avoid these kinds of surprises rather an rrsp is a tax deferred account and it works like this   the government allows you to claim a nice juicy tax deduction which can reduce your income tax at your marginal rate in the year you make a contribution or later if you should choose to defer the deduction the resulting pre tax money accumulated in your rrsp benefits from further tax deferral assets can grow without attracting annual income tax on earned interest dividends or capital gains you do n't need to declare on your income tax return any of the income earned inside your rrsp unlike a regular investment account here 's the rub once you decide to withdraw money from your rrsp the entire amount withdrawn is considered regular income in the year in which you make the withdrawal   thus your withdrawals are subject to income tax and yes at your marginal rate   this is always the case whether before or after retirement you mentioned two special programs the home buyers plan hbp and the lifelong learning plan llp   neither the hbp nor the llp permit tax free withdrawals   rather each of these programs are special kinds of loans that you can borrow from your own rrsp hbp and llp loan money is n't taxed when you get it because you are required to pay it back and you pay it back into your own rrsp you always pay income tax at your marginal rate on your rrsp withdrawals above i said a precise meaning for retirement with respect to rrsps is largely irrelevant   yet there are ages that matter   by the end of the year in which you turn 71 you are required to convert your rrsp to a it 's similar but you can no longer contribute and you must withdraw a minimum amount each year other circumstances related to age may qualify for minor tax relief intended for retirees such as the age amount or the pension income credit   generally such measures do n't significantly change the fact that you pay income tax on rrsp withdrawals at your marginal rate these measures raise the minimum you can take out without attracting tax but most do nothing at the margin exception one might split eligible pension income with a spouse or common law partner which may reduce tax at the margin

how much money do you have in your money market fund and what in your mind is the purpose of this money if it is your six months of living expenses emergency fund then you   might want to consider bank cds in addition to bond funds as an alternative to   your money market fund investment most though not necessarily all so be sure to check bank cds can be cashed in at any time with a penalty of three months of interest and so unless you anticipate being laid off very soon you might get a slightly better rate of interest fdic insurance which mutual funds do not have and with any luck you may never have to break a cd and lose the interest building a ladder of cds with one maturing each month might be another way to reduce the risk of loss   on the other hand bond mutual funds are a risky bet now because your investment will lose value if interest rate go up and as johnfx points out interest rates have nowhere to go but up   finally the amount of the investment is something that you might want to consider before making changes if you have $ 50 k put away as your six month fund you are talking of $ 500 versus $ 350 per annum in changing to a riskier investment with a 1 yield from a safer investment with a 0.7 yield whether bragging rights at neighborhood parties are worth the trouble is something for you to decide

the general argument put forward by gold lovers is n't that you get the same gold per dollar or dollars per ounce of gold but that you get the same consumable product per ounce of gold in other words the claim is that the inflation adjusted price of gold is more or less constant see link for a chart of gold in 2010 gbp all the way from in 2010 gbp means its an inflation adjusted chart as you can see there is plenty of fluctuation in there but it just so happens that gold is worth about the same now as it was in see link for a series of anecdotes of the buying power of gold and silver going back some 3000 years what this means to you if you think the stock market is volatile and want to de risk your holdings for the next 2 years gold is just as risky if you want to invest some wealth such that it will be worth more in real terms when you take it out in 40 years time than today the stock market has historically given better returns than gold if you want to put money aside and it to not lose value for a few hundred years then gold might be a sensible place to store your wealth as per comment from it might be possible to use gold as a partial hedge against the stock market as the two supposedly have very low correlation

's response is pretty cynical i 'm not a wall street analyst but i do read some of the research and there is a lot of respectable analysis out there there are many smart analysts who consistently get from the equity research departments to join the buy side i 'd also contend that level of accuracy is an incomplete measure of performance it does nt matter if you 're right or wrong what matters is how much you make when you are right and how much you lose when you are wrong soros is purported to have a 30 average but the guy makes a killing when he 's right source inside the house of money

commercial banks are not allowed to create real money   the confusion comes from the different ways money is counted   in m2 deposits count as money   so if you take $ 100 and deposit it in the bank m2 will count the $ 100 deposit as money as well as the $ 100 cash the bank has from the deposit   so under m2 the money supply has increased by $ 100 but no real money was created   commercial banks ca n't create real money out of thin air and they ca n't loan out money they do n't have

smartphone gps if you have really absurd rules your might require you to put up several signs to notify others about your policing of absurd acts like possessing dried plants in public or whatever   humans being smart and reactive not passive animals will naturally towards the most reasonable rules and perhaps change their own to match the prevailing norms because those who had absurd rules would not be dealt with much perhaps package deliveries would not be allowed to any house that allows murder rape theft and nobody would want to do any business with someone who allowed violent crimes they 'd be if humans can establish a complex internet system complete with tubes and pics we can establish a way to let every property owner establish their own rules and then innovate from there with social and trade consequences for those who have stupid rules   the basic premise is that if you own your own house you should have control over it but you must pay the consequences if your rules make others not want to come or do any business with you no monopoly should be able to apply their own rules against you a like george bush should have no power over a new york city resident and vice versa

you know what   the failure of any technological system is always the fault of humans   you know what a smart network designer does   he puts systems that may be vulnerable completely out of the reach of people who can fuck them up   iran fucked up   do n't try to apply that logic universally   your argument rests on assumptions and you do n't know what you 're talking about   what 's your it background by the way

honestly probably just banks and it 's not that they deserve it more that it 's in the public interest i dunno i do n't think is has to be a slippery slope i think that 's why we need higher penalties to keep us out of this scenario in the first place

the goal of the kelly criterion strategy is to find a balance between preservation of starting capital and returns one of extreme you could bet the entirety of your account on one trade which would maximize your returns if you win but leave you unable to further invest if you lose on the other extreme you could bet the smallest amount of capital possible over the course of several trades to increase the probability that you 'll even out to 70 accuracy over time but this method would be extremely slow   so for your case investing 40 each time is one way to find an optimal balance between these two extremes use this as a rule of thumb though because your own situation and investing goals may differ from the goal of   optimal growth

any large stockbroker will offer trading in us securities as a foreign national you will be required to register with the us tax authorities irs by completing and filing a w-8ben form and pay us withholding taxes on any dividend income you receive   us dividends are paid net of withholding taxes so you do not need to file a us tax return   capital gains are not subject to us taxes   also each year you are holding us securities you will receive a form from the irs which you are required to complete and return you will also be required to complete and file forms for each of the exchanges you wish to received market price data from trading will be restricted to us trading hours which i believe is 6 hours ahead of denmark for the new york markets   you will simply submit an order to the desired market using your broker 's online trading software or your broker 's telephone dealing service you can expect to pay significantly higher commissions for trading us securities when compared to domestic securities you will also face potentially large foreign exchange fees when your funds from eur to usd all in all you will probably be better off using your local market to trade us index or sector etfs

market capitalization is the equity value of a company it measures the total value of the shares available for trade in public markets if they were immediately sold at the last traded market price some people think it is a measure of a company 's net worth but it can be a misleading for a number of reasons share price will be biased toward recent earnings and the earnings per share eps metric the most recent market price only reflects the lowest price one market participant is willing to sell for and the highest price another market participant is willing to buy for though in a liquid market it does generally reflect the current consensus in an imperfect market for example with a large institutional purchase or sale prices can diverge widely from the consensus price and when multiplied by outstanding shares can show a very distorted market capitalization it is also a misleading number when comparing two companies market capitalization because while some companies raise the money they need by selling shares on the markets others might prefer debt financing from private lenders or sell bonds on the market or some other capital structure some companies sell preferred shares or non voting shares along with the traditional shares that exist all of these factors have to be considered when valuing a company large cap companies tend to have lower but more stable growth than small cap companies which are still expanding into new markets because of their smaller size

the majority of illegal immigrants do not work in the field of agriculture that being said work visas to fill needed niches such as field farm work can be applied for and permitted so that farmers can have the legal foreign workers they need allowed into the country given any legitimate demonstrated need for that industry the problem is that then these workers would be much more protected then a class of workers who are essentially illegal immigrants and who do work off the books and out of sight and management of the federal government 's ability to track them and if need be offer them actual protections as foreign workers on a visa work permit

this is an advanced fee scam you do not have any money in a foreign account nor will paying any taxes or fees get that money a clue is that the constitution of the united kingdom has no mention of taxes and is also not organized into sections in a manner like if you really want to confirm this you should be able to contact the uk branch of bank they would be able to confirm the means that they would use to contact individuals with account issues

i have n't done these types of problems in a while so wo n't be able to help with the actual problem   but to answer your question those types of problems are notorious for including extra information that is not needed to solve the problem   so if you are think you doing it right i would n't second guess it because they gave you an extra number

when you buy a stock and sell a covered call the call ca n't be valued higher than the stock right how can a call on a $ 10 stock sell for more than the stock   so the initial position of a covered call will cost you something the transaction is a debit   to you the net amount of the deal usually prices as per stock option single share   for the image showing net credit it 's as if you expect to get paid for you to take this deal
