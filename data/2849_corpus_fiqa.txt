the retailer can sell for whatever price they like with the caveats that if they consistently sell at a loss they will go out of business and if they set the price too high they will not sell anything as you mentioned rrp is only a recommended price the manufacturer can not it at all for legal reasons having said that i used to work in retail not cars and if we discounted a certain manufacturers products and they found out about it we would find they had suddenly run out of stock when we tried to order more so manufacturers do have some control over this type of thing depending on how they want to be about it my background is in retail management but not selling cars but my understanding is the law regards rrp is the same

i 'm guessing you 're in the us if so yes you can be prosecuted but it 's unlikely   fraud crimes are up to a prosecutor to pursue there are a lot of fraud cases and take low priority i 'm assuming you 're passively complicit not actively   if this is the case it 's best to work with the bank to get your situation cleaned up and move on   these days most banks have dealt with wire fraud at least once and they 're familiar with cashiers check fraud    a fair warning the bank will report you if they think you 're involved so if you are not a complete bystander you may want to lawyer up   so hopefully you did n't try to spend any of the fraudulent money and hopefully you have proof of a third party because they will want a connection to that person name number other to file their report

good analysis point except you 're missing the fact that most pensions allocate only a tiny fraction of their overall portfolios to hedge funds so say you have a $ 2 billion pension fund maybe $ 50 million of that is hedge funds so basically yes the pools of money will get smaller but there 's a lot of the overall pie that the hedge funds are n't eating yet

one rule of thumb is that having regular activity on at least three different revolving accounts will improve your score i agree that it may not be a great idea to have too many open credit accounts trade lines reporting on your credit report but if you do n’t have enough active accounts it will   prevent you from being approved for a home mortgage both conventional fannie mae and freddie mac mortgage loans and government loans such as fha and va require that you have a minimum number of reporting trade lines that are active or have been active within the most recent 24 month period of time an example of meeting the mortgage loan requirement is having a revolving account credit card that has been reporting activity for the past 24 months plus 2 other trade lines that have had activity reported for 12 months each both within the past 24 months

the key to understanding a mortgage is to look at an amortization schedule   put in 100k 4.5 interest 30 years 360 monthly payments and look at the results   you should get roughly monthly p&i payment   amortization is only the loan portion escrow for taxes and insurance and additional payments for pmi are extra you 'll get a list of all the payments to match the numbers you enter   these wo n't exactly match what you really get in a mortgage but they 're close enough to demonstrate the way amortization works and to plan a budget   for those terms with equal monthly payments you 'll start paying 74 interest from the first payment   each payment thereafter that percentage drops the way this is all calculated is through the time value of money equations     read slowly understand how the equations work then look at the formula for repeating payment and present value   that is used to find the monthly payment    you can validate that the formula works by using their answer and making a spreadsheet that has these columns   previous balance payment interest new balance   each line represents a month   calculate interest as previous balance   calculate new balance as previous balance minus payment plus interest work through all this for a 1 year loan and you will understand a lot better

i 'm surprised nobody else has suggested this yet before you start investing in stocks or bonds buy a house not just any house but the house you want to live in 20 years from now in a place where you want to live 20 years from now but you also have to be savvy about which part of the country or world you buy in i 'm also assuming that you are in the usa although my suggestion tends to apply equally anywhere in the world why simple as long as you own a house you wo n't ever have to pay rent you do have to pay taxes and maintenance of course you have a guaranteed return on investment and the best part is because it 's not money you earn but money you do n't have to spend it 's tax free even if the house loses value over time you still come out ahead and if you live abroad temporarily you can rent out the house and add the rent to your savings although that does make various things more complicated you only asked for options so that is mine i 'll add some caveats ok now here are the caveats

i have a job and would like to buy equipment for producing music at home and it would be easier for me to pay for the equipment monthly i just want to address your contention that it would be easier to pay monthly with an interest calculation   lets say you get a credit card with a very reasonable rate of 12 and you buy $ 2,500 of equipment   a typical credit card minimum payment is interest charges + 1 of the principle you can see how this is going   you 've paid nearly $ 200 to clear about $ 100 off your principle   obviously paying the minimum payment will take forever to wipe out this debt   so you pay more or maybe you get 0 interest for a while and take advantage of that paying $ 100 per month against $ 2,500 at 12 per year will take 29 months and cost about $ 390 in interest   at $ 200 per month it 'll take 14 months and cost $ 184 in interest   also note you 'll probably get an interest rate closer to 16 or 17 it 's always easier to pay small amounts frequently than it is to pay a lot of money all at once that ease has a cost   if you 're buying the gear to start a little business or you already have a little business going and want to upgrade some gear great disciplined debt handling is a wonderful skill to have in business   if you want to start yourself in to a new hobby you should not do that with debt   if interest rates are low enough financing something can make sense   0.9 apr on a car sure 15 apr on a mixing board no   credit card interest rates are significant and really should not be with

split transactions are to anybody interested in accurately tracking their spending if i go to the big box pharmacy down the road to pick up a prescription and then also grab a loaf of bread and a of milk while there then i 'd want to enter the transaction into my software as i desire entering precise data into the software so that i can rely on the reports it produces often i do n't need an exact amount and estimated category totals would have been fine e.g. to inform budgeting or compare to a prior period however in other cases the expenses i 'm tracking must be tracked accurately because i 'd be using the total to claim an income tax deduction or credit   consider how internet access might be commingled on the same bill with the home 's cable tv service   one is a reasonable business expense and deduction for the work at home web developer whereas the other is a personal non deductible expense were split transaction capability not available the somewhat unattractive alternatives are ignore the category difference and say categorize the entire transaction as the larger or more important category   but this deliberately introduces error in the tracked data rendering it useless for cases where the category totals need to be accurate or split the transaction manually this does n't introduce error into the tracked data but suffers another problem it makes a lot of work first one would need to manually enter two or more top level transactions instead of the single one with sub amounts   perhaps not that much more work than if a split were entered worse is when it comes time to reconcile   now there are two or more transactions in the register but the credit card statement has only one   reconciling would require manually adding up those transactions from the register just to confirm the amount on the statement is correct   major pain i 'd place split transaction capability near the top of the list of must have features for any finance management software

seems to me you do n't have a ton of great choices but of them keep going as you are   if when the car becomes unusable without significant expenses stop using it   buy another junker and use that to get by until your loan is paid off   from now until then put aside a few hundred or whatever you can if more each month towards the anticipated purchase   when you do buy this junker pay in cash no loan   just get something that will take you to work and that includes bike if that 's a possibility   when you can sell the no longer usable car to finish paying off the loan start aggressively paying off the current loan with the eye of getting it down to where you 're not underwater anymore   then sell the car and dispose of the loan and buy a better replacement   scrimp and save and cut everything eat cheaply and never out cut your personal expenses everywhere you can   if you get another $ 250 a month towards principal you can probably be no longer underwater in about a year get a personal loan today for the amount that you 're underwater and immediately sell the car   this gets you out of the loan and car the quickest and if you think the car will devalue significantly between now and when you might be not underwater anymore this might be the best option   but it 's the most expensive likely you 'll pay 12 to 20 on the difference   now 12 of $ 5000 is less than 5 of 15000 so it might actually be a good financial deal but you 'll probably have to shop around to get 12 15 with a 660 though it 's probably possible   you 'll still be without a car at this point though so you 'd have to buy another one or live without for a while and you 'd still have a payment of some sort but perhaps a more manageable one $ 5000 12 5 years means something a bit over $ 100 a month for example i recommend that if you can get by without a car for a while option 2 is your best bet   all of these will require some financial care for a while and probably cutting back on expenses for a year or two but realistically you should n't expect anything else   get a budgeting app if it will help see how to do this as far as getting out of the loan without paying it i do n't recommend that at all   your credit will be ruined for at least seven years and 660 is not bad at all really and then would take   yet more years to recover   you will likely be sued for the balance plus collection costs beyond repossession   the consequences would be far far worse than just paying it off and i mean that financially as well as ethically

i 'm going to suggest a slightly different approach most answers seem to suggest paying off the lower rate card to clear it some answers comments also talk about emergency funds one risk of paying off a card is that the card issuer may choose to reduce your credit limit if they see you as high risk to prevent you re spending the money if you do n't trust yourself with the card then this could be a good thing and remember you 're always free to ask for a limit decrease but if you want access to emergency funds then i would suggest paying half onto each card that way if one card cuts you off you have a chance of still having access to the other in an emergency

first make sure you are contacting the bank directly use an old invoice you have on hand with a phone number direct to the bank and call them   do not use the provided number or you may wind up being pulled into a scam it is entirely possible that the bank is also confused at this point so you should not rely on the number provided at all second once you can confirm that your account is being closed find out when it is being closed so you know when you need to act on it it 's possible you still have access to your account and do not need to launch into a panic just yet    third get the bank to explain exactly why they are closing your account make it clear that if they can not explain you will be forced to transfer to a new account and close business with them permanently this is not a threat this is a matter of fact because finally if you can not keep your account open find a different bank and open up a new account   frankly if your current bank is closing your account and only managed to get a letter out to you a month late you should probably find a new bank   if instead they simply can not figure out if your bank account is closed or not this is also a bad sign and you may want a new bank account anyway    but please go through these steps in order because you need to verify with your bank what is going on    keep 's answer in mind as well in case you need to get your money out of your account quickly

unless you are a client with of money i do n't think service like you are asking about is very common and i kind of assume that if you did have the of money you would already have had such a relationship with a brokerage or accountant or similar financial professional when i have taken money from brokerage accounts i have had to call them to ask for it or requested it online for both the only option was to receive a check in the mail made out to the account holder me this usually takes about a week although that does include waiting for the funds to settle after a stock sale which itself is about 3 business days i know a lot of brokerages do have banks affiliated with them and one of the benefits of having a bank account with that affiliated bank is quicker transfers in and out of your bank account but if you are n't willing to do that i do n't think you have many other choices other than receive a check in the mail

there is a difference between an owner and a signer an owner is the legal owner of the funds a signer has access to withdraw the funds in most cases when a new personal account is opened the name is added as an however that is not always the case a person could be an owner but not a signer in a custodial arrangement for example a minor child may be an owner only on their account with a custodial parent listed as a signer the minor could not withdraw from the account a person could be a signer but not an owner in a business or estate trust account the business or estate would be the owner with individuals listed as signers only the business employees do not own the funds they are only allowed to withdraw and disburse the funds on behalf of the company the creditor can only garnish withhold funds that are owned by the indebted if the second person on the account is only a signer those funds can not be withheld as part of a judgment against the second person they do n't own those funds however simply the second person as a signer only is not sufficient if you share access with the second person and allow them to spend the money for their own benefit they are no longer just a signer they have become an owner because you are sharing your funds with them think of the business relationship as an example the employee is a signer so they can withdraw funds and pay business expenses like the electric bill if the employee withdrew funds and bought herself a new dress she is stealing because she does not own those funds if the second person on the account buys things for themselves or transfers some of the money into their own account they are demonstrating that more than a signer only relationship exists a true signer only relationship is where the individual can only withdraw funds on the owner 's behalf for example the owner is out of town and needs a bill paid the signer can write a check and pay the bill for the owner a limited power of attorney may be worth looking into with a limited poa the owner can define the scope and expiration of the power of attorney with this arrangement the second person becomes an executor of the owner under certain circumstances for example you could write a power of attorney that states something like john smith is hereby granted the limited power to withdraw funds from account on deposit at bank for the purpose of paying debts and obligations and otherwise maintain my estate in the event of my or inability to attend to my own affairs this power of attorney shall expire on it 's fifth anniversary unless renewed if the person you have granted the power of attorney abuses their access you could sue them and you would only have to demonstrate that they the scope of their power

you may look into covered calls   in short selling the option instead of buying it playing the house    one can do this on the buying side too e.g. let 's say you like company xyz   if you sell the put and it goes up you make money   if xyz goes down by expiration you still made the money on the put and now own the stock the one you like at a lower price   now you can immediately sell calls on xyz   if it does n't go up you make money   if it does goes up you get called out and you make even more money probably selling the call a little above current price or where it was put to you at the greatest risk is very large declines and so one needs to do some research on the company to see if they are decent e.g. have good earnings not over valued p e etc   for larger declines one has to sell the call further out   note there are now stocks that have weekly options as well as monthly options   you just have to calculate the rate of return you will get realizing that underneath the first put you need enough money available should the stock be put to you    an additional associated strategy is starting by selling the put at a higher than current market limit price   then over a couple days generally lowering the limit if it is n't reached in the stock 's fluctuation   i.e. if the stock drops in the next few days you might sell the put on a dip    same deal if the stock finally is put to you   then you can start by selling the call at a higher limit price gradually bringing it down if you are n't successful i.e. the stock does n't reach it on an upswing my friend is highly successful with this strategy good luck

first of all congratulations on being in an incredible financial position   you have done well so let 's look at the investment side first    if you put 400,000 in a decent index fund at an average 8 growth and add 75,000 every year in 10 years you 'll have about $ million $ 800k of which is capital gain more or less due to market risk of course or $ after 30 tax   if you instead put it in the whole life policy at 1.7 you 'll have about $ 1.3 million $ of which is tax free capital gain so the insurance is costing you $ 430 k in opportunity cost since you could have done something different with the money for more return    the fund you mentioned vanguard wellington has a 10-year annualized growth of   at that growth rate the opportunity cost is $ 350k   even with a portfolio with a more conservative 5 growth rate the opportunity cost is $ now the life insurance   life insurance is a highly personal product but i ran a quick quote for a old male in good health and got a premium of $ 11,000 per year for a $ 2 m 10-year term policy   so the same amount of term life insurance costs only $ 110,000   much less than the $ in opportunity cost that the whole life would cost you in addition you have a mortgage that 's costing you about $ 28 k per year now 3.5 of 800,000 why would you invest in a 1.7 insurance policy when you are paying a low 3.5 mortgage i would take as much cash as you are comfortable with and pay down the mortgage as much as possible and get it paid off quickly then you do n't need life insurance   then you can do whatever you want   retire early invest and give like crazy travel the world whatever    i see no compelling reason to have life insurance at all let alone life insurance wrapped in a bad investment vehicle

a specific strategy to make money on a potentially moderately decreasing stock price on a dividend paying stock is to write covered calls   there is a category on money se about covered call writing but in summary a covered call is a contract to sell the shares at a set price within a defined time range you gain a premium called the time value which when i 've done it can be up to an additional return on the position   with this strategy you 're collecting dividends and come out with the best return if the stock price stays in the middle if the price does not shoot up high enough that your option is called you still own the stock and made extra return if the price drops moderately you may still be positive

while i agree with the existing bulk of comments and answers that you ca n't tell the lender the $ 7k is a gift i do think you might have luck finding a mortgage broker who can help you get a loan as a group   you might consider as an llc or other form of corporation if no one will take you otherwise   that is each of you will be an owner of the house and appear on the mortgage   iirc as long as the downpayment only comes from the collective group and the income to debt ratio of the group as a whole is acceptable and the strongest credit rating of the group is good you should be able to find a loan   you may need a formal ownership agreement to get this accepted by the lender   that said i do n't know if your income will trump your brother 's situation presumably high debt ratio or lower than 100 multiplier on his income dues to its source but it will certainly help as to how to structure the deal for fairness i think whatever the two of you agree to and put down in writing is fine   if you each think you 're helping the other than a 50/50 split on profits at the sale of the property seems reasonable to me    i 'd recommend that you actually include in your write up a defined maximum period for ownership e.g. or 10yr etc and explain how things will be resolved if one side does n't want to sell at that point but the other side does just remember that whatever percentages you agree to as ownership wo n't effect the lender 's view of payment requirements   the lender will consider each member of the group fully and independently responsible for the loan   that is if something happens to your brother or he just out on you you will be on the hook for 100 of the loan   and vice versa   your write up ought to document what happens if one of you out on paying agreed upon amounts but still expects there ownership share at the time of sale that said if you 're trying to be mathematically fair about ownership you could do something like the below to try and factor in the various issues into the money flow the above has the benefit that you can start with a different ownership split etc if one of you wants to own more of the property

if the owner of the stock wants it back they call it back there are no guarantees of how long you can keep it for your short or the cost involved to hold it   usually everyone knows about a particular set up e.g. a warrant or convertible bond mispricing that is attractive for arbitrage this causes the associated stock to be in high demand thus expensive to borrow for shorting or impossible to find for any price at all

while open interest usually correlates to volume the mark of liquidity is the bid ask spread even when trading options with spreads as large as an ask 2x the bid a more realistic price that traders are willing to accept lies somewhere in the middle any option can easily be exited at intrinsic value underlying price exercise price for calls exercise price underlying price for puts   for illiquid options this will be the best price obtained   for longer term options something closer to the theoretical price is still possible if an underlying is extremely liquid yet the options are n't quite then options traders will be much more ready to trade at the theoretical price for exiting illiquid options small < 4 contracts and infrequent > 30 minute intervals orders are more likely to be filled closer to the theoretical price however if one 's sells are the only trades traders on the other side will take note and accept ever lowering implied volatilities with knowledge of what traders will accept it is always more optimal to trade out of options rather than exercise because of the added costs and uncertainty involved with exercising and liquidating

if i look to the future i see the general retail revenue growing pretty slowly but the online retailers growing fast why    first they grew historically around 20 per year for the last few years   second there 's a lot of big important innovation amazon prime tablets and phones as great sales tools and comparison they 're becoming common ebay investing heavily in logistics to enable small non u.s companies to sell onshore without big shipping costs online apparel shopping improving rapidly and maybe becoming competitive with offline shopping using social networks for shopping interesting new models to sell merchandise online like etsy subscription shopping and the the general rate of internet innovations    third people are improving in their e commerce capability and trust   on the other hand i do n't see any big growth opportunity for brick and mortar retailers so it means they 'll shrink   the problem is that retail is a low margin business that means that losing 5 15 percent of revenue   is enough to close you because you have a lot of fixed employees financing the goods

best advice is to ask your lender   that being said if you are changing jobs but keeping the same type of job you are usually ok and if the loan was approved before it would still be approved if you switch from w-2 to 1099 or vice versa permanent to contract switch industries software dev to accountant or make less money there is a strong risk of the loan being declined

i would suggest both as an investor and as someone who has some experience with a family run trust not my own that this is probably not something you should get involved with unless the money is money you 're not worried about money that otherwise would turn into trips to the movies or something like that   if you 're willing to treat it as such then i 'd say go for it first off this is not a short or medium term investment   this sort of thing will not be profitable right away and it will take quite a few years to become profitable to the point that you could take money out of it if ever   your money will be effectively if not actually locked up for years and be nearly entirely illiquid second it 's not necessarily a good investment even considering that   real estate is something people tend to feel like it should be an amazing investment that just makes you money and is better than risky things like the stock market except it 's really not   it 's quite risky vulnerable to things like the 2008 crash but also to things like a local market being a bit down or having several months with no renter    the amount your fund will have in it at most $ wo n't be enough to buy even one property for years $ 1500/month means you 're looking at what 100 150 months before you have enough and as such wo n't have enough to buy multiple properties for even longer which is where you reach some stability   having a washing machine break down or a roof leak is a big deal when you only have one property to manage having five or six properties spreads out the risk significantly you wo n't get tax breaks from this of course and that 's where the real issue is for you   you would be far better off putting your money in a roth ira or a regular ira but based on your career choice and current income i 'd strongly consider a roth   you 'll get tax free growth less risky than this fund and probably faster growing but regardless of both of those tax free   that 15 25 that uncle sam is giving you back is a huge huge deal greater than any return a fund is going to give you and if they promise that high run far and fast finally as someone who 's watched a family trust work at managing itself it 's a huge huge headache and not something i 'd recommend at least unless it comes with money in which case it 's of course a different story   you wo n't agree on investments inevitably and you 'll end up spending huge amounts of time trying to convince each other to go with your idea and it will likely end up being fairly stagnant and conservative because that 's what everyone will be able to at least not object to it might be something you all enjoy doing in which case good luck but definitely not my cup of tea

i think the discrepancy you are seeing is in the detail of what happens once you pay off your student loan   if you take your monthly payment for your student loan and apply that to your mortgage once the student loan is payed off paying the highest interest loan will out ahead    if on the other hand you take your student loan payment and do something else with it not pay down your mortgage you would be better off paying on your mortgage   say you have $ 1000 to put towards either loan and there is 5 years to pay on the student loan and 25 years to pay on the mortgage   by paying on the student loan you are roughly saving 5 years of 5 interest on that $ 1000   by paying on the mortgage you are saving 25 years of 3 interest

because it cost the insurer more obviously while this sounds snarky it 's important to realize that actual insurance companies set their insurance rates based on actual historical costs for some reason people who report low miles have cost the company more dollars per reported mile than people who report high miles in that sense insurance is not overpriced if it were truly overpriced then an insurer would specialize in such insurance and make a killing on the free market the more interesting questions is why do drivers who claim to travel very few miles cost the insurance companies so much per mile that question has a host of possible answers and it 's difficult to say which is the largest cost here are just a few

in the eu prices on consumer focussed sites are quoted inclusive of vat in the usa prices are   quoted exclusive of sales tax consumer pricing is usually driven at least partly by psychological concerns some are more appealing to certain types of buyers than others   the euro vs dollar exchange rate has fluctuated a bit over the years but it 's generally averaged somewhere around 1.2 dollars per euro over the last decade vat has varied around in most cases put these things together and the same headline price points are generally appropriate in both the usa and the eurozone otoh the pound has been worth substantially more than the dollar or the euro so it makes sense to have a lower headline price in the uk b2b focussed sites often quote prices exclusive of vat you need to be aware of this when comparing prices

ben miller 's answer is very thorough and i up voted it i believe that the ability to rebalance without tax implications is very import but there are two aspects of the question that were not covered the 401 k in many cases comes with a company match putting enough money into the fund each year to maximize the match give you free money that is not available in the non retirement accounts the presence of that match is to encourage employees to contribute even if they are tying up their funds until retirement age and they are into a plan with only a handful of investment options and they may have higher expenses in the 401k. the question also had a concern about the annual limits for the 401 k 18,000 and the ira 5,500 the use of a retirement account does n't in any way limit your ability to invest in non retirement accounts you can choose to invest from 0 to 23,500 in the retirement accounts and from 0 to unlimited into the non retirement accounts double those amounts if you are married

after the deal which is expected to close by early next year burger king and tim horton said their newly combined company would have about $ 23 billion in sales and more than 18,000 locations the corporate headquarters will be in canada but burger king will still be operated out of miami   so it can be considered an inversion     do you understand how companies avoid taxes in these deals   the us taxes all your revenue at 35 and then gives you credit for foreign taxes paid   in many other countries they just tax you for domestic revenue not world wide    so previously burger king had to pay 35 tax on all revenue world wide and then got back credits for taxes paid in say canada or england    now they will pay 35 only on us income and the foreign tax in those countries it operates which can be much less than 35

imagine the bank loaning 100 of the sum of money you needed to buy a house if the valuation of the house decreases to 90 of the original price after 3 months would it be unfair for them to ask them for 10 of the original price from you immediately i suppose the rationale for loaning 80 is so that you will fork our 20 first and so your property is protected from fluctuations in the market that they do not need to collect additional money from you as your housing valuation rarely drops below 80 of the original price banks do need to make money too as they run as a business

first thing i 'd say is do n't start with investing the foundation of solid finances is cash flow making more than you spend reliably knowing where your money goes having a system that works for you to make sure you make more than you spend until you have that your focus may as well be on getting there because you ca n't fix much else about your finances until you fix this a number you want to know is your percentage of income saved and a good goal for that is about 15 with 10 12 going to retirement savings and the rest to shorter term goals and emergency fund and so forth of course the right percentage here depends on your goals and situation but for most people this is a kind of minimum savings rate to be in good shape focus on your savings rate this is your profitability if you view yourself as a business if it 's crappy or negative your finances will be a mess two ways to improve it are to spend less or to improve your earnings power doing both is even better the book your money or your life by and robin is good for showing how to focus on cash flow even though you may not share their for early retirement a simpler exercise than what they recommend take 3 months of your checking and credit card statements go through each expenditure and put them in a spreadsheet column sum that column then add up 3 months of after tax paychecks divide both numbers by three and compare the 3 months is to average out your spending which probably varies a lot by month after positive cash flow and savings rate the next thing i 'd go through is insurance risk management for what you have this can include checking you have all the important insurance coverages renter 's auto potentially umbrella term life disability and of course health insurance are some highlights and also adjusting all your policies to be most cost effective which usually means raising the deductible if you have a good emergency fund often you can raise the deductible on policies you have and use the savings to add more catastrophe coverage such as term life if you did n't have it or boosting the liability protection on your homeowner 's or whatever remember cover catastrophes as cheaply and comprehensively as possible but do n't worry about reimbursement for non catastrophic expenses i like this book smart and simple financial strategies for busy people by jane because it covers all the main personal finance topics not just investing and because it is smart and simple all the main stuff to think about is in the one book and the advice is solid and investing can truly be dead easy most people would be fine with this advice honestly i do micro optimize and undermine my investing and i 'm guessing most people on this forum do but it 's not something i could defend objectively as a good use of time it probably is necessary to do some reading to feel financially literate and confident in an investment plan but the reading is n't really because a good plan is complicated it 's more to understand all the complicated things that you do n't need to do since that 's how you 'll know not to do them especially when salespeople and publications and tv are telling you over and over and over that you need to know a bunch of crap and do a bunch of things people who have a profitable business of me are the ones who end up with a lot of money not people who spend a lot of time screwing with investments people who get rich investing invest professionally as their business of me they do n't goof around with their 401k after work financial security is all about your savings rate i.e. your personal profitability no shortcuts other than lotteries and rich

in theory when you obtained ownership of your usd cash as a canadian resident resident for tax purposes which is generally a quicker timeline than being resident for immigration purposes it is considered to have been obtained by you for the cad equivalent on that date   for example if you on dec 31 2016 and carried $ 10k usd with you when the rate was then canada deems you to have arrived with $ cad if you converted that cad to usd when the rate was 1.39 you would have received cad a gain of $ 400 to show as income on your tax return   receiving the foreign inheritances is a little more complex those items when received may or may not have been taxable on that day however whether or not they were taxable you would calculate a further gain as above if the fx rate gave you more cad when you ultimately converted it if the rate went the other way and you lost cad value you may or may not be able to claim a loss if it was a small loss i would n't bother trying to claim it due to hassle if it 's a large loss i would be very sure to research thoroughly before claiming because something like that probably has a high chance of being audited

a company 's valuation includes its assets in addition to projected earnings aside from the obvious issue that projected earnings can be wildly inaccurate or speculative as in the case of startups and fast moving industries like technology a company 's assets are not necessarily tied to the market the company is in for the sake of illustration say the government were to ban fast food tomorrow and the market for that were to go all the way to zero   mcdonald 's would still have almost 30 billion dollars worth of real estate holdings that would surely make the company worth something even though it would have to stop selling its products similarly apple is sitting on approximately $ 200 billion dollars in cash and securities in overseas subsidiaries   even if they never make another cent selling iphones and such the company is still worth a lot because of those holdings corporate raiders back in the 70 's and 80 's made massive personal fortunes exploiting this disconnect in undervalued companies that had more assets than their market cap by getting enough ownership to liquidate the company 's assets   oliver stone even made a movie about the phenomenon so yes it 's certainly possible for a company to be worth more than the size of the market for its products

from hmrc note that the rule is when a person becomes entitled to payment of earnings this is not necessarily the same as the date on which an employee acquires a right to be paid for example an employee 's terms of service may provide for the employee to receive a bonus for the year to 31 december 2004 payable on 30 june 2005 if the employee is still in the service of the employer on 31 december 2004 if the condition is satisfied the employee becomes entitled to a payment on 31 december 2004 but is only entitled to payment of it on 30 june 2005 so paye applies to it on 30 june 2005 and it is for the date that matters is the date the employee is entitled to be paid the bonus   but why are you worried about paying tax that is your employer 's responsibility and they will do it for you ask you firm 's finance department also for further clarification hmrc are not an organization to mess with they will tie up your life in knots

having a cushion emergency fund will hopefully keep you from having to build up any more debt once your cards are paid off   i would increase your payments on the 2 cards to a point where you feel comfortable in how much of a cushion you have   keep your payments steady on the 0 card be careful and watching your statements each month often having a credit problem in another account electric bill cable bill etc will allow credit card companies to jack up your rates unexpected   if that does happen you 've still got an emergency fund to pay them down quickly in the future

using fundamental and technical analysis together is actually a good idea for longer term trading of up to 6 months or longer   the whole idea behind trading with technical analysis is to increase the probabilities of a trade going in the desired direction by using uncorrelated indicators that produce the same signal to buy or sell at the same time for example you might use a moving average ma as a buy signal when the price falls for a few days hits the ma and then reverses and starts moving back up if however you also include a stochastic oscillator so to indicate when the stock is oversold under 20 and if the price rebounds from the ma average at the same time as the stochastic is crossing over in the oversold position then this may be a higher probability trade if you also only trade stocks that are fundamentally healthy as fundamentally good stocks are more likely to go up than fundamentally bad stocks then this might increase the probabilities again then if you only buy when the market as a whole is moving up then this will increase your chances again a few weeks ago at a seminar the the men in the room to be 76 and the women in the room to be 8 he then asked what will most likely be the next person to walk in the room a man or a woman the statistics are on the side of a wan walking in next this is what we try to do with technical analysis increase our chances when we take a trade of course a woman could be the next person to walk in the room just like any trade can go against you and this is why we use money management and risk management and take a small loss when a trade does go against you lets look at an example where you could incorporate fa with ta to increase your chances of profits   above is a candlestick chart of select harvest the green line above the price is the perceived value the pink line is the 40 day ma the blue line is the eps and the white lines is the stochastic oscillator above 80 being overbought and below 20 is oversold from feb 2015 to start of aug 2015 the stock was uptrending since then the price reversed and started to downtrend the stock was determined to be fundamentally good early in 2015 with the perceived value gradually increasing and greater than the share price and the eps starting to increase regularly from mid april thus as the stock is seen as fundamentally healthy any price reversal in the vicinity of the ma could be seen as a buy opportunity in fact there where 2 such opportunities on 31st march and 11th june where price had reversed and rebounded off the ma the so crossed over in or near the oversold area the price did reverse and then rebounded off the ma again on 9th july however the so was not in or near the oversold area on this occasion so not as high in probability terms the price still rebounded and went up again however another momentum indicator not shown here shows some bearish divergence in this case so another reason to possibly keep away at this point in time a good signal to get out of the trade that is your stop loss has not already taken you out is when the price breaks and closes below the ma line this occurred on 7th august so if we had bought on the first signal on 31st march for $ and sold when the priced broke through the ma on 7th august for $ we would have made a profit of approx 59 in just over 4 months if bought on the second signal on 11th june for $ 9.98 and again sold on 7th august for $ we would have made about 18 in under 2 months so the fundamentals the price in relation to ma and the so where all lining up to provide two high probability trades of course you would need to incorporate you risk management including stops in case the price did not continue upwards after you bought if the market is also moving up on the day of the signal this will further increase your chances   unless you day trade which i would avoid a good way to enter your trades after a signal is to enter a stop buy order after market close to buy if the price moves above the high of the signal day that way if the market and the stock open and move lower during the day after the signal you avoid entering the trade altogether this can be incorporated as part of your risk management and trading rules after the price broke down through the ma we can see that a downtrend which is still current today in fact i just took a short trade on this stock yesterday we can also see that the perceived value whilst still above the price has reached a peak and is currently moving downwards and the eps after being flat for a few months has just moved down for the first time in 10 months so maybe the fundamentals are starting to a bit on this stock it may be a good stock to continue shorting into the future so basically you can continue using fundamental analysis to select which stocks to buy place them in a watch list and then use technical analysis to determine when these stocks are starting to uptrend and use a combination of uncorrelated indicators to produce higher probability signals for when to enter your trades

fwiw i 've got a printed invoice that was included in a shipment of books that i received in july 2013 in the right side side panel at the bottom and in fine print it reads   inc.    410 avenue    north seattle wa    gst registration number no tps    etc if i view the same order online at the on screen version does not have that detail   interestingly at the bottom of the online invoice page it says please note this is not a vat invoice that probably should 've said gst hst for canada and not vat which is presumably for the united kingdom   so it would appear that amazon may only print their gst hst details on the shipped invoice printout which made me wonder did you purchase something that was fulfilled electronically i.e. no physical shipment to you e.g. a kindle book an app or a service like cloud drive if no physical invoice shipped means one does n't get the required gst details then there 's still a canadian tax requirement amazon is n't fulfilling on such invoices though not as broad an issue as you suspected on the other hand if you did get a physical invoice and your comment confirmed you did then what you were seeking was most likely printed on that version just as mine was at the moment i 'm not sure why amazon would n't also include the gst number on electronic versions of invoices whether received by email or viewed on the web site but if i find out more i 'll update my answer later

question 1 yes question 2 there is no simple formula car insurance is mostly statistics because you have so many millions of cases that the variance is really low this also means that because the cost can be estimated so precisely it is difficult to make an offer better than the competitors for that reason every insurance company makes there own arbitrary segmentation of the data which leads them identify low risk groups they can offer a bonus to common ones are type of car or and driving experience but it could be anything that is not forbidden by anti discrimination laws also additional perks like towing insurance etc may give them an opportunity do differentiate themselves or to make easy profit   in fact it is a common tactic to offer prices that make close to no profit to fill up your book then raise tariffs in then following years an make you profit with those who are to lazy to switch

well it all kind of depends    the realtor is your pro and you should communicate further with him   is this a neighborhood on the decline   is there a good reason to make such a low offer   are you totally off base when you think 85 k is fair and if so why   is he just working his tail off for you a great thing one thing that is a key to this negotiation is financing   what does your financing status look like   a reasonable cash offer with no contingencies and a quick close might be less than   a person with strong financing can get a better discount then a person that is questionable it could be that the realtor is testing the waters to find the bottom price   the home selling season is closed typically the summer and the home has been on the market for a bit   offering 70 k might mean a counter at 82 k so you can work on an offer between 80 and 82    to me it sounds like this guy is working for you   you should thank him   it is pretty hard to find a realtor that is willing to negotiate his pay down in order to save you money    also he can answer the closing cost question better than us as he is more familiar with your particular market

i look for buying a call option only at the money but first understand the background above let 's suppose x stock is being traded by $ 10.00 and it 's january the call option is being traded by $ 0.20 with strike $ for february i always look for 2 prize or more i buy 100 stocks by $ 10.00 each and sell the option earning $ 0.20 for each x stock i will have to deliver my stocks by $ strike value agreed no problem for me here i took the prize plus the gain of $ 1.00 continuing from item 3 i still can sell the option for the next month with strike equal or higher than that i bought for instance i can sell a call option of strike $ 10.00 and it might be worth to deliver stocks by $ 10.00 and take the prize continuing from item 3 probably it wo n't be possible to sell a call option with strike at the price that i paid for the stock but that 's not a problem at the end of the option life in february the strike was $ but the stock 's price is $ 8.00 i got the $ 0.20 as prize and my stocks are free for trade again i 'll sell the call option for march with strike $ 9.00 taking around 2 of prize well i do n't want to sell my stocks by $ 9.00 and make loss right but i 'm selling the call option anyway then i wait till the price of the stock gets near the strike value almost atm and i re buy the option sold example where c means month = march and sell again the call option with higher strike to april example where d means month = april ps at item 9 there should be no loss between the action of re buy and sell to roll out to the next month when re buying it with the stock 's price near the strike option value for march will be lower than when selling it to april this is n't any rule to be followed this is just a conservative i think they call it hedge way to handle options and stocks few free to make money according to your goals and your style the perfect rule is the one that meet your expectation do n't take the generalized rules too serious

the interest rate is determined by your 401(k provider and your plan document   of course you may be able to influence this depending on your relationship with the provider   i 'm very certain that is not the only rate that is possible   however your provider is constrained by irc which states that the loan must be made at a reasonable rate of interest    the definition of reasonable rate of interest would probably need to go to court and i do not know if it has   the irs probably has internal guidelines that determine who gets thrown to the dogs but they would not make those public because it takes away their discretion   because of the threat of getting by the irs i think you will have a hard time getting a provider to allow super high or super low interest rate loans note i am not a lawyer

i took a second mortgage when i moved house because i had a long term fixed rate mortgage that would have incurred punitive fees if i had cancelled it rather than doing that i took a second mortgage over the same term for the difference as my second mortgage was with the same lender they still had first charge on the property this means that in the event of default they have first call on the property to recoup their losses so the interest rate was not higher actually it was slightly less than my first mortgage my case is not that usual normally a second mortgage is with a separate provider that takes a second charge on the property the interest rates are normally higher as a result as there is more chance that the lender will not recoup their money in case of a default as the first charge has priority the second mortgage may still be cheaper than an unsecured loan as the second charge provides some collateral this might make it attractive if a sudden expense needs to be covered

the average person does n't care nor are they affected by how much their employer spends in healthcare it may be true that the average person does n't care how much their employer spends on healthcare but it 's not true that we are n't affected   from an employer 's perspective healthcare wages and all other benefits are part of the cost of having an employee   when healthcare goes up it increases the total employee cost    employers can handle this in several ways   they could reduce the amount they give investors as dividends stock buybacks etc   but then the stock is worth less and they have to make up the money somewhere else   they could pass the expense on to customers   but then the loss in business can easily cost more than the revenue raised   they can cut wages or other benefits   then the average person will start caring and might get a different job    i found this article saying that 12 m households spend > = 50 of income on rent so i 'm assuming that an even greater number spend more than the recommended 30 which means rent should be weighted as high as it is in cpi according to the census that 's only about 10 of households   it also notes that of households are owner occupied   they do n't pay rent   the cpi makes up a number called owner 's equivalent rent for those households to get to the higher percentage    the cpi is intended for things like wages   this makes it a good choice for a cost of living adjustment but it does n't quite represent the overall economy   and for investments it 's the broader economy that matters   household consumption is less important    what the fed says

you want more information on what the general bond market this article is getting at something different but the first several pages are general background info on the corporate bond market     if you are trying to relate somehow the issue of federal debt a la treasuries to corporate debt you will find that you are jumping to a lot of conclusions    debt is not exactly currency only the promise of repayment at a certain date in the future the only reason that u.s. treasuries and those of certain other highly rated countries is interchangeable is because they are both very liquid and have very low risk    there is very little similarity to this in the corporate bond market companies are no where near to the risk level of a government for one they ca n't print their own money and when a corporation goes bankrupt it 's bondholder are usually recovery rates hover at around 50 of the notional debt amount this is why investors demand a premium to hold corporate debt now consider even the best of companies take ibm the spread between the interest the government must pay on a treasury bond and that which ibm must pay on a similar bond is still relatively large    but beyond that you run into a liquidity issue currency only works because it is highly liquid if you take the article about greece you posted above you can see the problem generated by lack of liquidity people have to both have currency and be willing to accept currency for trade to occur corporate bond are notoriously illiquid because people are unwilling to take on the risk involved with holding the debt there are other reasons but i 'm from them this is the other reason treasuries can be used as currency there is always someone willing to take your treasury in trade for the most part because there is almost zero risk involved you would always be much more willing to hold a treasury than an equivalent ibm bond    now take that idea down to a smaller level who would want to buy the bonds issued by the mom and pop down the street even if someone did buy them who would in turn take these bonds in trade practically speaking no one would they have no way to identify the riskiness of the bond and have no assurance that there would be anyone willing to trade for it in the future    if you read the whole post by the redditor from your first link this is precisely why government backed currency came about and why the scenario that i think you are is very unlikely

it depends on how long it will take you to pay off the personal loan the rate for the personal loan the refi rate you think you can get how much principal you will have to add to get the refi may have gone up since then since you did not provide all the necessary details the general answer is to sketch out your total payments mortgage + personal loan with and without the refi over the life of the mortgage and see if you end up with more money in your pocket with the refi my overall impression based on the details you did provide is that you will probably find it worthwhile to do the refi

the biggest problem is that the rate of return for a completely program is really low   especially now given the low rate of return the cost of such a program makes it nearly unless you assumed a ridiculously low rate of return return   as it is they 're assuming a 4.5 rate of return which is about 2 above inflation a very very conservative forecast     plus not every pension plan could their plans   all that does is shift interest rate risk btw not the only type of risk that exists there 's credit risk as well   to get rid of both you 'd be getting marginally above 0 return not something you can run a pension plan on   so you 'd have to have someone or some set of people that have a very large and very unnatural interest rate risk   if you had a large move in rates it would those people which would completely invalidate those hedges   it 's much better for the economy on whole that pension plans are able to take credit and interest rate risk

first of all the only thing they can do to force you to pay is sue you if they do n't sue you then they ca n't force you to do anything all they have right now is just a written agreement you signed promising to pay that by itself does n't have legal power to take money from you the worst they can do without suing you is put negative information on your credit report which has probably already happened anyway if they sue you within the statute of limitations they will almost certainly win and get a judgment against you because you did agree to pay with that judgment the court can force you to reveal your income and asset information and they can take the judgment to do things like seize money from your bank accounts and/or garnish your wages and the judgment does not go away however if you have no money in the bank and/or income they ca n't take any money from you because you have none they ca n't take more from you than you have in other words if you have no money or income and wo n't have money or income soon the judgment they can get by suing you and winning is n't worth the paper it 's on since serving you and suing you takes money and effort they will make a calculation on whether it is worth suing you based on the amount of debt and what amount of money they think they can get from you based on what they know about you this is the reason why you may not be sued at all if they calculate that it is not worth it and also why they may offer you a settlement for a lesser amount because is saves the cost of suing and the risk that they wo n't be able to get you to pay the amount you mentioned several thousand dollars may be small enough for it to be not worth it another thing is the statute of limitations i mentioned earlier which varies by state and is several years long if they sue you after the statute of limitations passes then you can raise the statute of limitations and get the lawsuit dismissed so basically after this amount of time passes you are pretty much free from this debt note that the statute of limitations resets if you acknowledge the debt which includes paying any amount on the debt or agreeing that you owe them this debt so if the collection agency ever offers you benefits if you just sign a promissory note or just pay a token amount do n't fall for the trap they are trying to reset the statute of limitations even though it 's true that you owe them the debt never let them hear you acknowledging it unless it 's part of a final settlement finally if they get a judgment against you and you do n't want them to have the ability to take your money indefinitely in the future until the debt is satisfied there may be the option of bankruptcy however a few thousand dollars may not be worth the cost and negative consequences of bankruptcy since as a young man you should be able to earn that amount quickly whenever you start working

when discussing buying a home i often hear people say they like having    a mortgage because they get the benefit of writing off the interest i assume this is the united states   you need to also consider that many people can take the standard deduction of about $ 12k for married couples filing jointly so even if they itemize the interest it would only make sense to write it off if you are able to itemize deductions greater than the standard deduction   source so some people will input the mortgage interest and other related deductions into the computer only to find out that their itemized deductions do n't add up where it benefits people sometimes is if they have medical bills which are greater than 10 of their income in addition to the mortgage interest so it benefits them to itemize there are other major sources of but medical bills are very common other common items are auto registration taxes or interest from student loans it is going to be situation dependent but if you are within a few years of paying off the mortgage it would make sense to make micropayments to accelerate the payoff date if you have 30 years to go it would make more sense to generate an emergency fund pay off a car or save up for other things in life than worry about paying off a mortgage take the benefit of deducting the mortgage interest if you can but i imagine that many people would be surprised to hear that it 's not always black and white

i love john 's answer but i just ca n't help myself from adding my 2 cents even though it 's over 5 years later i sold cars for a while in the late 90s and i mostly agree with john 's answer where i disagree though is that where i worked the salesperson did not have any authority to make a sale a sales manager was required to sign off on every sale that does n't mean that the manager had to interact with the buyer that could all be handled behind the scenes but the pricing and even much of the negotiating strategies were dictated by the sales managers some of the seasoned salespeople would estimate numbers on their own but occasionally you 'd hear the managers still chew them out with i wish you would n't have said that of course every dealership is different additional purchase advice there is a strategy that can work well for the buyer but only in scenarios where the salesperson is trying to prevent you from leaving they may start you as you are packing up or blocking your path to the door or even begging if this happens they are obviously desperate for whatever reason in this case if you came prepared with research on a good price that you are comfortable with then shoot lower and hold firm to the point of near exhaustion not so low that that they realize you 're too far they will let you leave at that point it needs to be within a reasonable amount perhaps at most 1 2 of the purchase price once you detect the salesperson is desperate you finally move up to your goal number or possibly a little lower typically the salesperson will be so happy to have gotten you to move at all that they 'll accept and if the managers are fed up too like 45 minutes after close they 'll accept too i saw this happen multiple times in a high pressure scenario i also used it once myself as a buyer if you are planning to purchase options that can be added at the dealer rather than from the factory keep them up your sleeve at first get your negotiations down to where you are a little further apart than the invoice price of the option then make your move for example suppose the option you want for $ 350 with an invoice of $ 300 get within about $ 400 of the dealer then offer to pay their price but only if they throw in the option you want this will throw them completely off guard because they did n't expect it and all of their calculations were based on without it if they say yes you effectively moved $ 100 and they moved $ 300 it 's much more likely that they 'll agree to this than taking $ 300 off the price of the car i 'm guessing the reason for this is partially due to how their accounting works with sticker price vs aftermarket price and partially psychological note this works best with new cars and make sure you only do this if it 's for items they can add after the fact even if they do n't have the part in stock it 's ok they can give you an iou but if the option requires a car change to something they do n't have on the lot it will probably just make them mad

i agree with mark   i was quite confuse about the short position at first but then i did a lot of learning and found out that as long as you have enough cash to cover your margin requirement you do not pay any interest since you do not have a debit on your margin balance   this is not true for a long position though supposed you have 5k cash and 5k margin balance if you buy 10 k worth of stocks then you will need to pay interest on the 5k of the margin balance since it is a debit   since shorting is done at a credit basis you actually get interest from the transaction but you still may need to pay the borrowing fees for the stocks so they could simply balance each other out   i have shorted stocks twice through two different companies and neither time i noticed any interest charges   but make sure you have enough cash to cover your margin requirement because once your margin balance is used to covered your position then interest would accrual learn

we considered similar big renovations when putting our house on the market the answer turns out to be pretty simple unless you do renovation type work as your day job or have really good friends in the residential contracting business sell as is you will virtually never get back the full price of bringing in a gen con to renovate any space in your home you do that when you want to spend the extra to make your home exactly what you wanted so you can live in it for decades and get the enjoyment out of it if you 're trying to turn a profit with the renovation like house flippers do professionally you look for easy repairs buy good looking but inexpensive materials and do the labor yourself whether you sell to the market or to a specifically interested buyer is your call but i will caution you that a specifically interested buyer is going to be looking for a deal or a steal   when marketing our house we met with three different realtors the first one was very about what we could list for basically assuming that we could get the same price as a fully upgraded version of our same floor plan with a pool out back she also had a to do list a mile long and my wife and i both noticed that she looked very apprehensive about the house when looking around even as she us that selling it would be no trouble we eventually realized why she was so apprehensive and fired her before we got even halfway through her to dos which included major landscaping new kitchen floors and etc which would have cost us thousands and would not have gotten the house price even close to the target the second one took a look at our half finished and told us to stop everything we were doing to update the minor stuff like paint and fixtures saying we were putting on a pig she would market the house to some cash buyers she knew personally for about 80 of the list price our first realtor quoted and implied that we should be kissing her boots for finding us a buyer willing to take the house off our hands at all during the tour she pointed out problems with the house that were n't even there like foundation issues such as sloping floors in an attempt to scare us into going with her strategy we that out pretty quickly showed her the door at the end of the initial consult and never called back this by the way is the kind of thing you want to avoid unless your home is really dilapidated or torn apart with unfinished major it should have decent value on the market and you should n't have to resort to a cash buyer looking for a flip or a rental property on the cheap just like our third choice was just right he saw all the same comparables our house and recommended that we offer about $ 20k less than the fully upgraded version but still about $ 20k more than the second realtor was estimating targeting a real buyer and not an investor or flipper but at a price that would make the lack of upgrades more acceptable we finished the paint and finish projects we started brought in a weekend 's worth of scheduled and our house was under contract for full price within 3 days giving us the extra $ 20k worth of down payment to put into our new house in summary i highly recommend a realtor because the one we eventually listed with worked his butt off on the business side while we fixed up the house however make sure you find the right one realtors are ultimately in business for themselves and their ultimate interest is in getting your house sold and getting you into a new one that is what gets them paid some of them will do it the right way working the deal with other realtors and their prospective buyers to get you what you need others will take the easy way out at your expense either giving you bad advice about how to present and price your home so that you end up on the market for 6 months with no offers or handing your house to their business buddies at a discount

it is a legal issue for two reasons in the united states if both names were on the title both people would have had to sign the paperwork in order to transfer the title if the car was collateral for the loan then the bank would have had to be involved in the transaction the portion of the check need to repay the loan would have had to have been made out to the bank if the car was sold to a dealership then paperwork must have been forged if the car was sold to a person then it is possible that they were too naive to know what paperwork was required but it is likely still fraud you need legal advice to protect your money and your credit score they should also be able to tell you who needs to be contacted dmv the police the dealership the bank

why not just deposit to a traditional ira and convert it to roth   if you have pretax ira money you need to pay prorated tax on what was n't yet taxed but that 's it it rarely makes sense to ask for a lower wage   does your company offer a 401(k account   to clarify the existing traditional ira balance is the problem the issue arises when you have a new deposit that otherwise is n't deductible and try to convert it absent that existing ira the immediate conversion is tax free now with that ira in place the conversion some of that pretax money and you are subject to a tax bill

first off some companies do something like this   microsoft for example was well known for consistently hitting earnings estimates every quarter nearly never missed them and most of the time did n't exceed by much either   in order to do this and not be prosecuted for accounting fraud you typically have to be a service or good company like microsoft used to be where you can manipulate the amount of product on hand and move costs fairly easily from one quarter to the next   a company like say home depot or caterpillar both of which have tangible goods they 're either or producing has less flexibility there although they will still try to move profits around to match earnings estimates more closely however you have to be consistently doing well to be able to do this   you ca n't manufacture additional total revenue so if you have one down quarter you have to either have moved some revenue into it from the previous quarter or you have to be able to move some into it from the next quarter   that obviously does n't work consistently unless you 're a fast growing company or have an extremely stable base   it 's also hard to do this in a legal seeming fashion technically this sort of manipulation is illegal so decisions have to be justifiable   companies like microsoft that are expanding can also do things to encourage slightly lower expectations   a company in need of a stock price bump issues press releases touting its inventions and products as amazing things that will drive profits through the roof and an aggressive profit forecast just as easy to issue a press release with a conservative forecast meaning the bar will be lower to hit    it 's also not really necessary to manipulate earnings to have a consistently well performing stock   this article for example shows that companies who miss earnings estimates do n't really suffer much when controlling for their actual earnings changes of course in the long run   your price might drop a bit but if your company is otherwise sound it will recover finally companies do sometimes come out with information ahead of earnings that cause expectations to be lowered   for example just lowered its earnings expectations due to various reasons   some companies choose to do this in order to dilute the effect on the market   i 'm not sure if this is ever required but it seems to me that some companies are much quicker to restate earnings expectations than others

throwaway account was a good idea   i work in government sourcing and depending on what government you work for what you 're doing is illegal as shit   federal and most state statute prevent a government employee from 1 getting paid for another job while being paid by the government for working during the same period double dipping and 2 being involved in the selection process of a vendor with whom the employee has a vested interest   additionally if you work in a position that requires you to complete an ethics form and certify it you will be further breaking the law if you do n't disclose ownership by falsifying a government document    realistically you 're probably just full of it but if you 're telling the truth what you 're doing is unethical and probably illegal   and before you get too smug you should know that government auditors are n't nearly as incompetent as you might think just overworked it might take a year or two but i 'm guessing they figure it out eventually government procurement and auditors generally have to verify things like company registration documents etc before contracts and any time a contract is renewed the auditors go back and look at those documents it wo n't be hard to figure out what 's going on especially if you were the pm for the project

really looks at the volatility within the day so you would be able to see if the stock is becoming more or less volatile in daily trading   this is often useful for charting and finding entry and exit locations    traditional historic volatility as you cited will give you a look at the long term volatility of the security   the example of this is that there could be trends up or down but the same daily volatility same there are methods that try to incorporate both intraday information along with historic volatility   as for which is a better measure of it depends on what you are using the measure for

there may be a third option the bank gives you the first mortgage of 80 and a second maybe a heloc for that missing 5 this way you get the lower rate and the money they 'd charge you for pmi goes to paying down the second loan   alternately do you have any other sources to tap to bridge this small gap a 401(k loan perhaps the rate low and for home purchase a 10 yr payback if these are n't viable options i agree that taking the pmi route while tracking the balance is the way to go

so like any market the housing market will on average trend upward but the extreme prices we 're seeing in toronto or san francisco are not part of the normal market growth there 's a lot of factors that can affect housing outside of just increased demand here 's a few of the big ones   1 low interest rates since 2008 i think interests rates have been really low meaning mortgages are really low if you can borrow money at 4 and the inflation rate is 8 you 've borrowed expensive dollars and are paying back in cheap dollars   not in my back yard if you have enough land to build 10 houses or one 100 apartment building what do you build theoretically the apartment building but in reality the people that already paid for their million dollar house do n't want a giant apartment complex bringing down the value of the neighborhood and ruining their views so they pass laws preventing new and bigger buildings meaning higher prices for the homes that already exist and as a bonus it 's easier on the city to have 10 people who make a million dollars a year than a 100 people who make 100,000 a year   foreign investment so there 's a lot of places where people have money but because of corruption or shaky economies it 's not safe to hold it there so you buy properties in the u.s. or canada because you know no one 's going to seize it and it 's generally not going to lose value so you end up with foreign dollars competing with the local markets for housing driving the price up

there are two distinct questions that may be of interest to you both questions are relevant for funds that need to buy or sell large orders that you are talking about the answer depends on your order type and the current market state such as the level 2 order book suppose there are no iceberg or hidden orders and the order book image courtesy of this question currently is   an unlimited at market buy order for 12,000 shares gets filled immediately it gets 1,100 shares at at and 1,200 at after this order the lowest ask price becomes and the highest bid is obviously still because the previous order was a market order a limited buy order for 12,000 shares with a price limit of gets the first two fills just like the market order 1,100 shares at and at however the remainder of the order will establish a new bid price level for 1,200 shares at it is possible to enter an unlimited buy order that the book however such a trade would often be considered a mis trade and either i be cancelled by the broker ii be cancelled or undone by the exchange or iii hit the maximum price move a stock is allowed per day limit up funds and banks often have to buy or sell large quantities just like you have described however they usually do not punch through order book levels as i described before instead they would spread out the order over time and buy a smaller quantity several times throughout the day simple algorithms attempt to get a price close to the time weighted average price or volume weighted average price vwap and would buy a smaller amount every n minutes despite splitting the order into smaller pieces the price usually moves against the trader for many reasons there are many models to estimate the market impact of an order before executing it and many brokers have their own model for example deutsche bank there is considerable research on market impact if you are interested i understand the general principal that when significant buy orders    comes in relative to the sell orders price goes up and when a    significant sell order comes in relative to buy orders it goes down i consider this statement wrong or at least misleading first stocks can jump in price without or with very little volume consider a company that releases a negative earnings surprise over night on the next day the stock may open 20 lower without any orders having matched for any price in between the price moved because the perception of the stocks value changed not because of buy or sell pressure second buy and sell pressure have an effect on the price because of the underlying reason and not necessarily only because of the mechanics of the market assume you were prepared to sell stock but suddenly there 's a lot of buzz and your colleagues are talking about buying it would you still sell it for the same price i would n't i would try to find out how much they are prepared to buy it for in other words buy pressure can be the consequence of successful marketing of the stock and the marketing buzz is what changes the price

you have some good points but get this it will certainly come a point of time where say 80 of the working population can provide 100 of the goods services everyone needs then this will get to 70 60 this can result in two things either huge unemployment problem or overproduction and all that comes with it spoilage lower prices cost cutting i.e. again unemployment it may not be soon but i think it 's inevitable the problem with that is so far employment is a great way to redistribute wealth a fair way let 's say which is the actual problem at hand jobs would n't matter if we had another efficient mechanism to do that in fact it would be better if humans did n't have to work at all and focus on leisure science art w e but we do n't have such a mechanism unfortunately and as the need for a labor force shrinks things are going to get ugly even than now since the supply of labor will grow with human population the price of labor inevitably will go down which means even more transfer of wealth from middle lower class to the capital owners

i can not speak for paypal specifically and i doubt anyone who does n't actually work on their internal automated payment systems could however i can speak from experiencing in working on automated forex transaction systems and tell you what many institutions do and it is often not based on live rates there is no law stating an institution must honor a specific market exchange rate institutions can determine their own rates how and when they want to however there is some useful information on their website the most readily available information on currency exchange rates is based on interbank exchange rates interbank exchange rates are established in the course of currency trading among a global network of over 1,000 banks and are not available through consumer or retail channels this leads me to believe they pull exchange rates from either oanda or xe periodically and then use these rates throughout the day to conduct business paypal does not disclose who they use to determine rates and it 's highly doubtful they do this for every transaction using live rates even if they did there would be no way for you to check and be certain of a particular exchange rate as paypal states consumers may use these rates as a reference but should not expect to use interbank rates in transactions that involve currency conversion to obtain actual retail rates contact your local financial institution or currency exchange or check the rate displayed in your paypal transaction this is partly because rates can change by the second just like stock prices or anything else which is susceptible to the open market 's variables of supply demand news events etc so even if you check the rates on oanda which you can do here you are not going to get a 100 accurate representation of what you would get by doing an exchange immediately afterwards from paypal or any other financial institution however if you want to estimate using oanda 's currency converter will likely get you close in most scenarios that is assuming paypal does n't charge a premium for the exchange which they may that is also assuming they use live rates it 's also possible they only update their rates based on market rates periodically and not for every transaction you may want to test this by checking the exchange rate on your transaction and comparing that to the oanda rates at the same time

my recommendation is to pay off your student loans as quickly as possible it sounds like you 're already doing this but do n't incur any other large debts until you have this taken care of   i 'd also recommend not buying a car especially an expensive one on credit or lease either back during the dotcom boom i and many friends bought or leased expensive cars only to lose them or struggle paying for them when the bottom dropped out a car instantly depreciates and it 's quite rare for them to ever gain value again stick with reliable older used cars that you can purchase for cash if you do borrow for a car shop around for the best deal and avoid 3 + year terms if at all possible do n't lease unless you have a business structure where this might create a clear financial advantage avoid credit cards as much as possible although if you do plan to buy a house with a mortgage you 'll need to maintain some credit history if you have the discipline to keep your balance small and paid down you can use a credit card to build credit history however these things can quickly get out of hand and you 'll wonder why you suddenly owe $ 10 k $ 20 k or even more on them so be very careful with them as for the house speaking of us markets here save up for at least a 20 down payment if you can based on what you said this would be about $ 20 25k. this will give you a lot more flexibility to take advantage of deals that might come your way even if you do n't put it all into the house stretching to buy a house that 's too expensive can quickly lead to financial ruin as for house size i recommend purchasing a 4 bedroom house even if you are n't planning on kids right away it will resell better and you 'll appreciate having the extra space for storage home office hobbies etc also life has a way of changing your plans for having kids and such

i 'll take a stab at this question and offer a disclosure i recently got in ring 5.1 asx rio and   while i wo n't add to my positions at current prices i may add other positions or more to them if they fall further   this is called catching a falling and it 's a high risk move cons let 's scare everyone away pros the ecb did n't engage in as much qe as the market hoped and look at how it reacted especially commodities   consider that the ecb 's actions were tighter than expected and the fed plans to raise rates or claims so   commodities should be falling off a cliff on that news while most american western attention is on the latest news or entertainment china has been seizing commodities around the globe like crazy and the media have failed to mention that even with its market failing china is still seizing commodities   if china was truly panicked about its market it would stop investing in other countries and commodities and just bail out its own country   yet it 's not doing that   the whole china crisis is completely oversold in the west china is saying one thing oh no but doing another using its money to snap up cheap commodities capitalism works because hard times strengthen good companies   you know how many bailouts has received compared to goldman sachs   you know who owns more real wealth   oil does n't get bailed out banks do and banks ca n't innovate to save their lives while oil   hard times strengthen good companies   this means that this harsh bust in commodities will separate the winners from the losers and history shows the winners do very well in the long run related to the above point how many bailouts from tax payers do you think mining companies will get   zero   at least you 're investing in companies that do n't steal your money through government confiscation if you 're like me you can probably find at least 9 people out of 10 who think investing in miners is a very bad idea   what do they think is a good idea   duh snapchat and twitter   then there 's the old saying be greedy when everyone 's fearful and fearful when everyone 's greedy finally miners own hard assets   benjamin graham used to point this out with the dead company strategy like finding a used cigarette with one more smoke   you 're getting assets cheap while other investors are overpaying for stocks hoping that the fed qe   think strategy here seize cheap assets begin limiting the supply of these assets if you 're the saver and not borrowing then watch as the price begins to rise for them because of low supply   remember investors are part owners in companies take more control to limit the supply   using graham 's analogy stock pile those one puff cigarettes for a day when there 's a low supply of cigarettes many miners are in trouble now because they 've borrowed too much and must sell at a low profit or in some cases must lose   when you own assets debt free you can cut the supply   this will also help the federal reserve who 's been desperately trying to figure out how to raise inflation   the new patriotic thing to do is stimulate the economy by sending inflation up and limiting the supply here is key

question 1 how do i start or the broker problem get an online broker   you can do a wire transfer to fund the account from your bank question 2 what criticism do you have for my plan dividend investing is smart   the only problem is that everyone 's currently doing it   there is an demand for yield not just individual investors but investment firms and pension funds that need to generate income to fund retirements for their clients   as more investors purchase the shares of dividend paying securities the share price goes up   as the share price goes up the dividend yield goes down   same for bonds   for example if a stock pays $ 1 per year in dividends and you purchase the shares at $ then your yearly return not including share price fluctuations would be 1/20 = 5   but if you end up having to pay $ 30 per share then your yearly return would be or 3.3 yield   the more money you invest the bigger this difference becomes with $ 100 k invested you 'd make about $ 1.6 k more at 5   btw do n't put all your money in any small group of stocks you want to diversify   etfs work the same way where new investors buying the shares cause the custodian to purchase more shares of the underlying securities thus driving up the price up and yield down   instead of etfs i 'd have a look at something called closed end funds or cefs which also hold an underlying basket of securities but often trade at a discount to their net asset value unlike etfs   cefs usually have higher yields than their etf counterparts   i ca n't fully describe the ins and outs here in this space but you 'll definately want to do some research on them to better understand what you 're buying and how to successfully buy ie make sure you 're buying at a historically steep discount to nav and where to screen regardless of whether you decide to buy stocks bonds etfs cefs sell puts or some mix the best advice i can give is to a diversify personally with a single rare exception i never let any one holding account for more than 2 of my total portfolio value and b space out your purchases over time   b is important because we 've been in a low interest rate environment since about 2009 and when the risk free rate of return is very low investors purchase stocks and bonds which results in lower yields   as the risk free rate of return is expected to finally start slowly rising in 2017 and gradually over time there should be gradual downward pressure ie selling on the prices of dividend stocks and especially bonds meaning you 'll get better yields if you wait   then again we could hit a recession and the central banks actually lower rates which is why i say you want to space your purchases out

i am neither a lawyer nor a tax accountant and if you 're dealing with serious money i suggest you consult a professional but my understanding is if you make a loan at zero interest or at below market rates the irs will consider the difference between the interest that you do charge and the market rate to be a gift that is if someone could get a loan from a bank and he 'd pay $ 1000 in interest for the year but instead you loan him the money as a friend interest free than as far as the irs is concerned you have given him a $ 1000 gift and you could potentially have to pay gift tax or they might the interest to you and tax you on $ 1000 of additional income if you have no agreement on repayment terms if it 's all hey joe just pay me back when you can then the irs is likely to consider the entire loan to be a gift there 's an annual exclusion on gifts i think it 's now $ 13,000 so if you loan your buddy fifty bucks to tide him over until next pay day the irs is n't going to get involved in that they 're worried about more serious money and yes the irs does police loan rates the irs examines exact numbers for all sorts of things if say you go on a overnight business trip and the company gives you $ 10,000 for travel expenses the irs is likely to say that this is not a tax deductible travel expense at all but a sham to hide part of your salary from taxes or if you donate a pair of old socks to charity and declare a $ 500 charitable contribution deduction the irs will say that that is not a realistic value for a pair of old socks and disallow the deduction etc a small discrepancy from market rates can be justified for any number of reasons if the book value of a used car is $ 5000 and you sell it to your neighbor for $ 4900 the irs is unlikely to question it there are any number of legitimate business reasons why you had to give a discount to make the sale but if you sell it to him for $ 50 they may declare that this is not a sale but a gift etc

inflation is good for the economy primarily because it is an incentive to invest   if inflation is occurring then keeping your holdings in cash is a net loser 5 inflation means that in a year your $ 100 is now worth $ so unless you 're getting really good interest that 's a bad thing   on the other hand if you invested that $ 100 in a business you can inflation more easily since inflation should drive the business 's profits deflation negative inflation on the other hand is bad for investing because it encourages holding cash   if deflation of 5 occurs then you can get a 5 roi by simply holding onto twenty dollar bills why would you invest in a business that was in a deflationary economy and thus would likely earn less money mild inflation also increases flexibility in the economy because businesses make a little more money in terms of denominated money that allows them more flexibility in expansion   salaries for some also go up meaning that spending goes up and often with more flexibility in how those salaries are spent inflation does n't hit all sectors exactly the same so often this leaves significant portions of the middle class with more money to spend and thus driving economic growth more than salary growth though inflation seems to drive job creation   from the new york times this article quotes a paper by george which shows that job creation tends to be more significant than rising salaries during periods of low inflation ie what we 're talking about here   salary increases will come here largely from job seeking rather than raises because businesses do n't tend to cut wages and thus are to significantly raise salaries they 'd rather just hire more people and then cut jobs when the economy weakens or inflation drops   this is even more true in low wage jobs such as minimum wage positions where wages can not be cut but salary increases have little real effect on job retention it 's easier to change the number of hours for pt employees or the number of pt ft employees deflation on the other hand leads to decreased flexibility layoffs and lower consumer spending   while it sounds good to say hey prices are going down to your average consumer you have to keep in mind that those prices are what keep the businesses going that drive our economy and pay your salary either directly or indirectly   if your employer started making 5 less per year do you think they 'd keep you employed   maybe not and at the bottom service industries fast food restaurants grocers etc there would be significant cutbacks if deflation hit them i would note that 5 inflation is probably a bit high most economists like 2 to 3 and the federal reserve has said that 2 is the right target   they 're mostly concerned with avoiding deflation as that 's a big risk to the economy the advantages of mild inflation are relatively minor compared to the damages of deflation and tend to be more correlations you get mild inflation in a good economy as much or more than you need mild inflation for a good economy most important probably is consistent inflation   consumers and businesses can act rationally if the inflation rate is relatively stable and predictable   when inflation jumps or drops it changes the potential outcomes for choices made by investors consumers and businesses meaning choices they made in the past are now suboptimal if the inflation rate is jumping around 1 one year 4 another -1 the next investors businesses and consumers will be relatively conservative in their choices which leads to a bad economy

but why ca n't two companies exchange goods directly without paying vat this would make the famous fraud scam impossible and businesses wo n't have to deal with complicated refunds sales tax in the united states works as you describe   sales tax is charged only to end customers not to businesses that themselves charge sales tax   but this means that a criminal business can charge tax and just pocket it unless someone else reports it   they can also evade income tax the same way   not to mention other issues like cross jurisdiction taxes e.g. internet sales often evade sales tax    the whole point of a value added tax vat is that they charge at each level   this creates a system where each buyer reports the tax paid to the seller so as to be able to deduct it   so the seller has to pay the vat that they charged   or the tax authorities know and can revoke their vat license    if only the end user is charged tax then fraud is easier than under a vat   so easy i doubt they have a special name for it   the fraudulent business just collects tax from end users and disappears   or simply fails to record those transactions   you could call it missing transaction record fraud but why bother   it 's just straight up tax fraud   the complexity of the fraud arises from the difficulty of evading a vat

first of all congratulations on your home purchase   the more equity you build in your house the more of the sale price you get out of it when you move to your next house   this will enable you to consume more house in the future   think of it as making early payments towards your next down payment another option is to save up a chunk of money and your mortgage paying down the principal and having the resulting amount re amortized to provide you with a lower monthly payment   you may be able to do this at least once during your time in the house and if you do it early enough it can potentially help your savings in other areas on the other hand it is possible given today 's low interest rates for mortgages that in other forms of investments such as index funds you could make more on the money you 'd be putting towards your extra payments   then you would have more money in savings when you go to sell this house and buy the next one that you would in equity if you did n't go that route   this is riskier than building equity in your home but potentially has a bigger pay off you do the trade offs

i do n't agree that the market as a whole is a ponzi scheme but there are some ponzi like aspects to it if you buy high quality stocks like coca cola johnson and johnson at&amp;t verizon kraft wells fargo the vanilla bank not one of the crazy ones ibm berkshire hathaway etc and simply hold onto them for the next 10 20 years you will make money even over the last decade when stocks went nowhere you still came out ahead through the dividend payments it was just at an unsatisfactory rate of return also the market consists of a lot more than just stocks corporate bonds are a big market and i always recommend people to look at bonds if you can not judge whether a company is credit worthy how can you invest in the common stock i 've made a lot more money myself in the bond market than in the stock market   however for many stocks they do look a lot like ponzi schemes this is true in particular with many of the tech stocks cuban was a tech investor so that is probably where his sentiment is coming from you have many of these companies that create great products however they never have positive cash flow because all the money is spent to develop new products as the share price goes up the company issues new shares to fund research stock options to employees to enrich them etc however eventually they run into a string of bad research that do not yield a new product and the share price plunges perhaps the company goes bankrupt so you have a company that developed great products but the shareholders never got a penny in dividends and the final shareholders have paper worth zero   take a look at research in motion for example creating the blackberry has to be one of the biggest successes in tech over the last decade however has the shareholders gotten any richer only if they traded amongst themselves nobody got a dividend what happened to the many billions of dollars they made during the peak popularity years of blackberry it went to executives employees and was squandered on development that did not effectively defend the phone 's dominant market position now the stock price is back down to the pre prime years and if a shareholder held onto it throughout the entire period he would not have received a single penny and this is a profitable enterprise things look even more bizarre when you start looking at the tech companies that have never had a positive earnings quarter and no plans to ever have positive earnings something like pandora comes to mind often management at these more bizarre companies run the company as a toy to play with their own ideas and to issue themselves stock as compensation and of course they sell a lot of the stock to cash in before they delve into the next risky venture they have no intention of ever enriching anybody who holds into the stock in the long run if for some reason they make money they will put it all into their next toy project until one of them fails and wipes everything out   if you invest in a profitable business with reasonable management you will generally come out ahead some businesses get displaced by unpredictable circumstances and they go bankrupt but on average if a company is good at doing something and they pay out the earnings you come out ahead you get in trouble when businesses are good at something and they take all the money they make and put it into doing something they are not good at a business might only provide good cashflow for 10 20 years when the product is popular and before competitors cut into margins if that money is squandered the long term shareholder may ultimately have very terrible results the long term shareholder ends up being the guy who keeps going all in on a to win bet that is what management is doing when they bet the company on the next unproven product but eventually he gets zeroed out on one loss   this is why if you look at buffett 's investments they are all in simple businesses that spits off cash to the owner shareholder businesses like soft drinks snacks rail roads vanilla banking utility like energy companies insurance etc you might be good at judging the odds of whether a business will succeed or not aka make more money than your original investment or not but you do n't want management of that company to make a wildly different bet for you just because they are great at operating a company does n't mean they are good enough at judging odds or disciplined enough to make those bets for you i may have predicted accurately that business x will be a great success but if manage takes those profits and goes all in on business y without giving me a chance to cash out that may have results

first i 'd like to congratulate you on your financial discipline in paying off your loans and living well within your means   i have friends who make more than twice your salary with similar debt obligations and they barely scrape by month to month if we combine your student loan debt and unallocated income each month we get about $ 1,350   you say that $ per month is the minimum payment for your loans which have an average interest rate of about 3.5   thus you have about $ 1,350 a month to invest making your loan payments is basically the same as investing with the same return as the loan interest rate when it comes down to it   an interest rate of 3.5 is not great all things considered and barely above inflation     however that 's a guaranteed return of 3.5 more or less like a bond   as noted previously the stock market historically averages 10 before inflation over the long run the us stock market is right around its historic high at this point djia is at today april 6th 2017 historic high hit just over on march 1 2017   obviously no one can predict the future but i get the feeling that a market correction may be in order especially depending on how things go in washington in the next weeks or months   if that 's the case again we have no way of knowing if it is you 'd be foolish to invest heavily in any stocks at this point what i would do given your situation is invest the $ in a portfolio that 's 50/50 stocks and bonds where the bonds here are your student loans   here you have a guaranteed return of on the bond portion and you can still hedge the other 50 on stocks continuing their run and also benefiting from dividends capital gains etc over time   i would apply the extra loan payments to the highest interest loan first paying only the minimum to the others   once the highest interest loan is paid off move onto the next one once you have all your loans paid off your portfolio will be pretty much 100 stocks at which point you may want to add in some actual bonds say a or 80/20 split depending on what you want   i 'm assuming you 're pretty young so you still have plenty of time to let the magic of compounding interest do its work even if you happen to get into the market right before it drops well that and the fact that you wo n't really have much invested anyway again let me stress that neither i nor anyone else has any way of knowing what will happen with the market i 'm just stating my opinion and what my course of action would be if i were in your shoes

i worked for a major car rental company not but comparable for quite a while taking reservations by phone i completely agree that the reservation system is terrible and is only vaguely based on the reality of their vehicles in stock at best the problem is from a strictly business perspective taking more reservations than they have cars is currently considered the most profitable model for them   to play devil 's advocate just a little switching to a take only one reservation per vehicle reserve it to 100 lock it in model is a bit more complicated than it sounds in order to guarantee a specific car for a customer at a specific time they either have to leave that car sitting on their lot until you rent it not making money or keep renting it out to other people in the interim if they rent it out to someone else before your rental comes up that removes the vehicle from their control bordering on constantly renters do n't return the vehicle within their promised schedule or return it in a damaged or otherwise unsuitable condition to be clear i 'm not trying to make excuses for the rental car company there are many reasons i no longer work there but it 's objectively hard for them to get a specific vehicle if say all but one of them were in wrecks the previous night and the person renting the last one drove it across the country without warning the rental office and refuses to come back those problems all get solved eventually but that does n't help you when you show up and ca n't get the car you reserved   so they continue to take excessive reservations and just give people whatever they happen to have when they show up if they have any cars at all    there 's definitely better ways to do it for the customer but like many businesses they 'll continue to do it whatever way they determine is best for their profits   edit words

in the u.s. publicly traded companies are under the rules of regulation fair disclosure which says that a company must release information to all investors at the same time   the company website and social media both count as fair disclosure because every investor has access to those outlets but a press release service could also be the first outlet   what is forbidden by this regulation is the practice of releasing news first to the brokers who could inform certain customers of the news early i think that the first outlet for press releases could be different for each company depending on the internal procedures of the company   some would update their website first and others would wait to update the site until the press release hits the first

for the person being hired this is a tricky situation specially with the new laws there is no real magic number that can be applied as a lot will depend on what benefits you want and what is actually available this will really shift the spectrum quite a bit   under the care act everyone has to have insurance or pay a fine were really not sure what to call this yet but there are two provisions that really mess with the numbers you look at as an employee   first the cost of heath care has skyrocketed so the same benefits that you had 5 years ago now cost maybe 10 15 times as much as they used to this gets swept under the rug a bit because the main costs of insurance has only increased a tiny amount what this actually comes down to is does your new aca approved heath plan cover exactly the benefits you need or does it cut corners   sorry this is complicated and i do n't mean it to come off as a speech against the aca so i will give an example my wife has ra she really has it under control with the help of her ra doctor this is not something she ever wants to change because she has had ra from the age of 15 and because it 's she does n't want to spend 5 years working with a new doctor to get to the same place she is with her current doctor   in addition the main drugs she takes for ra are not covered under any aca plan nor are the that her doctor makes we are trying to have kids so she has to be off the main meds and a couple of the things this doctor has tried has been meds that reduce are pregnancy safe but are not for the treatment of ra you now have to take into effect rather the cost of health insurance + the cost of the things now not covered by the heath insurance + the out of pocket expenses is worth the insurance   second the aca has set up provisions to straight up trick those people that have lower income and are not paying close attention when shopping for insurance they get quotes like $ 50 a month or $ 100 a month the truth is that the remainder of the actual cost is deducted from their tax returns this takes consideration because if you thing your paying $ 50 a month for insurance but your really paying $ 650 then you need to make sure your doing your math right finally you need to understand how messed up things are right now in the us with heath care largely this goes unreported i 'm not really sure why but in order to do this i will have to give examples   for my wife to see a specialist her ra doctor the co pay is $ 75 so she goes to the doctor he charges her $ 75 and bills the insurance $ 200 the insurance pays the doctor $ 50 with out insurance the visit costs $ 50   at first you want to blame the doctor for cheating the system but the doctor has to pay for hours of labor to get the $ 50 back from the insurance company from the doctors perspective it 's cheaper to take the $ 50 then it is to charge the insurance company and by charging the insurance company he has no control over the cost of the co pay he essentially has to charge more to make the same money and the patient gets the in the process another example i got throat last year i went to the walk in clinic paid $ 75 saw the doctor got my z pack for $ 15 went home in bed and got better my wife who still had separate insurance from before the marriage got throat that went to the same clinic they charged her $ 200 for the visit $ 50 co pay and $ 250 for the z pack $ 3 co pay the insurance paid the clinic $ 90 for the visit and $ 3 for the drugs again the patient is left out in this scenario in this case it worked better for my wife unless you account for the fact that to get that coverage she had to pay $   my point is that when comparing costs of with insurance and without out insurance its often times much cheaper for the practices to have you self pay then it is for them to go through the loops of trying to insurance to make them whole this creates two rates self pay rates and insured rates when your trying to figure out the cost of not having insurance then you need to use the self pay rates these can be vastly different   so as an employee you need to figure out your cost of heath care with insurance and your cost of heath care without insurance then user those numbers when your trying to negotiate a salary the problem is that there is no magic number to use for this because the cost will very a lot for us it was cheaper to not have insurance even with a pre existing condition that takes constant attention it 's just better if we set aside $ 500 a month then it is to try to pay $ 750 a month that might not hold true for everyone for some people or conditions it may be better to pay the $ 750 then to try to handle it themselves   so for my negotiations i would go with without insurance or with insurance   now as an employer it 's a lot simpler usually you have a group plan that offers you a pretty straight $ x per year per person or $ y per year per family so you can offer exactly that salary $ x or salary $ y. as a starting point however this is where negotiations start   if your offering me $ and insurance i would rather just have $ and no insurance of course your real cost is only $ 55,000 cause you do n't care about my heath care costs only about insurance costs so you try to negotiate down towards $ 55,000 and no insurance but that 's not good enough for me so i either go else where and you loose talent or i accept $ and insurance or somewhere in between

paid by the estate of the deceased and the heirs get what is left most estates in the us pay no estate tax whatsoever because most estates are smaller than $ 5.4 m lifetime gift and estate tax exemption but for the record even though iras pass from owner to beneficiary independent of whatever the will might say about the disposition of the iras the value of the deceased 's iras is part of the estate and if the estate is large enough that estate tax is due and there is not enough money in the rest of the estate to pay the estate tax e.g. most of the estate value is ira money and there are no other investments just a bank account with a small balance then the executor of the will can petition the probate court to claw back some of the ira money from the ira beneficiaries to pay the estate tax due second there is income tax that the estate must pay on income received from the estate 's assets e.g. mutual fund dividends paid between the date of death and the distribution of the assets to the beneficiaries or income from cashing in iras that have the estate as the beneficiary now most of op 's father 's estate is in iras which have the op 's mother as the primary beneficiary and there are no named secondary beneficiaries thus by default the estate is the ira beneficiary should the op 's mother the iras as the lawyer has suggested as @joetaxpayer says in a comment if the op 's mother the ira then the estate must distribute all the ira assets to the three beneficiaries by december 31 of the year in which the fifth anniversary of the death occurs if the estate decides to do this by itself then the distribution from the ira to the estate is taxable income to the estate best avoided if possible because of the high tax rates on trusts what is commonly done is that before december 31 of the year following the year in which the death occurred the estate as the beneficiary informs the ira custodian that the estate 's beneficiaries are the surviving spouse 50 and the two children 25 each and requests the ira custodian to divide the ira assets accordingly and let each beneficiary be responsible for meeting the requirements of the 5-year rule for his her share any assets not distributed in timely fashion are subject to a 50 excise tax as penalty each year until such time as these monies are actually withdrawn explicitly from the ira that is the excise tax is not deducted from the remaining ira assets the beneficiary has to pay the excise tax out of pocket as far as the irs is concerned there are no yearly distribution requirements to be met but the ira custodial agreement might have its own rules and so publication 590b recommends discussing the distribution requirements for the 5-year rule with the ira custodian the money distributed from the ira is taxable income to the recipients in particular the children can not roll the money over into another ira so as to avoid immediate taxation the spouse might be able to roll over the money into another ira but i am not sure about this publication 590b is very confusing on this point    all this is assuming that the deceased passed away before well before his birthday so that there are no issues with rmds the interactions of all the rules in this case is an even bigger can of worms that i will leave to someone else to on the other hand if the op 's mother does not the iras then she as the surviving spouse has the option of treating the inherited iras as her own iras and she could then name her two children as the beneficiaries of the inherited iras when she passes away   of course by the same token she could opt to make someone else the beneficiary e.g her children from a previous marriage or change her mind at any later time and make someone else the beneficiary e.g. if she or becomes very fond of the person taking care of her in a nursing home and decides to leave all her assets to this person instead of her children etc   but even if such are unlikely and the children are perfectly happy to wait to inherit till mom passes away as joetaxpayer points out by not the iras the op 's mother can delay taking distributions from the iras till age 70.5 etc which is also a good option to have the worst scenario is for the op 's mother to not the iras cash them in right away huge income tax whack on her or at least 50 of them and gift the op and his sibling half of what she withdrew or possibly after taking into account what she had to pay in income tax on the distribution gift tax need not be paid by the op 's mother if she files form 709 and reduces her lifetime combined gift and estate tax exemption and the op and his sibling do n't owe any tax income or otherwise on the gift amount   but all that money has changed from tax deferred assets to ordinary assets and any additional earnings on these assets in the future will be taxable income so unless the op and his sibling need the cash right away pay off credit card debt make a downpayment on a house etc this is not a good idea at all

if amazon paid cash for the transaction and there was no value to be unlocked then i think you 'd expect amazon 's market value to remain the same after the transaction exchange of equal value    but there 's book value inherent to the whole foods business and the various assets within it and there 's strategic value that might only be realized through an acquisition by amazon if another company bought it let 's say kroger you could argue that the market cap boost to kroger would have been less meaningful or nonexistent because kroger would n't be as well positioned to create value from the whole foods business as amazon is

you should probably get a professional tax advice as it is very specific to the tax laws and the us philippine tax treaty what i know however is that if it was the other way around you paying a foreigner coming to the us to consult you you would be withholding 30 of their pay for the irs which they would be claiming for refund on their own later so if the us does it to others i 'm not surprised to hear that others do it to the us   get a professional advice on what and how you should be doing in any case foreign taxes paid can be used to offset your us taxes using form 1116 up to some extent

from my experience and friends experiences i can say that there are advantages and disadvantages for paying off your mortgage quickly basically it depends on these factors the type of the mortgage its interest rate your financial stability your skills in making investments and other outside factors such as inflation liquidity cost etc paying it off means you save on interest ratings you decrease investment risks and your investment rates are taxable disadvantages are that you can not use this money for investing you can not use this money for tax deductions and that in a state of inflation not paying it off in advance could save you a lot of money   however i always recommend to read some more on websites that deal with mortgages and speak with the mortgage expert in your bank just acquire enough information to make a good assessment an interesting article on this topic the advantages and disadvantages of paying off your mortgage

some historical and mathematical insights as a complement to existing answers   history i found it astonishing that already in ancient roman they investigated the issue of perpetuity of almost writes in de re 3 3 in century ad about a perpetuity of principal under 6 p.a resulting in 1950 annual payment and   if   the     would   enter   this   amount   as   a   debt   against his just as a does with a debtor    so that the owner may realize the aforementioned six per cent interest on that total as a perpetual annuity   he   should   take   in   1950 every   year    by   this   reckoning   the return on seven even according to the opinion of exceeds the interest on math if we fix a scholarship at a year then it 's clear that it could be paid out infinitely if we could achieve 3.33 p.a on it   on the other side with 0 we 'll spend out the endowment in 30 years thus having the interest rate between 0 and 3.33 p.a we could vary the life of endowment between 30 years and infinity just a few numbers in between under 1 it would be years under 2 years under 3 years however 1000 $ in 78 years could be less than 10 $ today conclusion to keep it perpetual either the fund 's yield must be at the level of scholarship or re adjust the amount of scholarship depending on fund achievement or redefine the notion of perpetuity like 50 years is approximately infinite for our purpose

for your first question the general guidelines i 've seen recommended are as follows as to your second question portfolio management is something you should familiarize yourself with   if you trust it to other people do n't be surprised when they make mistakes   remember they get paid regardless of whether you make money   consider how much any degree of risk will affect you   when starting out your contributions make up most of the growth of your accounts now is the time when you can most afford to take higher risk for higher payouts still limiting your risk as much as possible of course   a 10 loss on a portfolio of $ 50k can be replaced with a good year 's contributions   once your portfolio has grown to a much larger sum it will be time to dial back the risk and focus on preserving your capital    when choosing investments always treat your as a whole including non retirement assets other investment accounts savings even your house   do n't put too many eggs from every account into the same basket or you 'll find that 30 of your is a single investment   also consider that some investments have different tax consequences and you can leverage the properties of each account to offset that

i like a devil 's advocate   gt amazon made a brick and mortar acquisition which will now have a direct effect on consumers by trying to hamper which sites their customers try to access while on wifi and can also be seen as anticompetitive   this statement assumes that amazon intends to use the patented technology despite no evidence of such intent at the time of filing at the time the patent was granted which amazon has no control over or at the time of the wf purchase announcement   your reasoning has merit the patent only became relevant when amazon acquired an opportunity to use it    however it relies on assumptions that are n't necessarily correct or complete hence it is n't an objectively correct conclusion by any means    by including only the fact that the patent was recently granted timing lined up with wf acquisition the author promoted the idea that the patent is part of amazon 's plan with wf going forward    amazon may now have plans for using it in connection with wf or it may absolutely not there is presently working from the article itself no evidence to suggest any such plans exist outside the author 's mind i have zero doubt that they have considered using it btw i refer to actual plans to implement   i may be old fashioned or but the correct way to frame the situation is always completely and accurately including all relevant information     this allows readers to review the information and draw their own conclusions even if the journalist also shares his own conclusion

there are many different kinds of sec filings with different purposes   broadly speaking what they have in common is that they are the ways that companies publicly disclose information that they are legally required to disclose   the page that you listed gives brief descriptions of many types but if you click through to the articles on individual types of filings you can get more info one of the most commonly discussed filings is the 10-k which is as wikipedia says a comprehensive summary of a company 's financial performance   this includes info like earnings and executive pay one example of a form that some people believe has potential utility for investors is form 4 which is a disclosure of insider trading   people with a privileged stake in a company executives directors and major shareholders can not legally buy or sell shares without disclosing it by filing a form 4   some people think that you can make use of this information in the sense that if for instance the ceo of google buys a bunch of twitter stock they may have some reason for thinking it will go up so maybe you should buy it too   whether such inferences are accurate and whether you can garner a practical benefit from them i.e. whether you can manage to buy before everyone else notices and drives the price up is debatable my personal opinion would be that for an average retail investor sec filings is unlikely to be useful   the reason is that an average retail investor should n't be investing in individual companies at all but rather in mutual funds or etfs which typically provide comparable returns with far less risk   sec filings are made by individual companies so it does n't generally help you to read them unless you 're going to take action related to an individual company   it does n't generally make sense to take action related to an individual company if you do n't have the time and energy to read a large number of sec filings to decide which company to take action on   if you have the time and energy to read a large number of sec filings you 're probably not an average retail investor   if you are a wheeler dealer who plays in the big leagues you might benefit from reading sec filings   however if you are n't already reading sec filings you 're probably not a wheeler dealer who plays in the big leagues that said if you 're a currently average investor with big dreams it could be to read a few filings to explore what you might do with them   you could for instance allocate a play money fund of a few thousand dollars and try your hand at following insider trades or the like   if you make some money great if not oh well   realistically though there are so many people who make a living reading sec filings and acting on them every day that you have little chance of finding a diamond in the rough unless you also make a living by doing it every day it 's sort of like asking should i read boating monthly to improve my sailing skills   if you 're asking because you want to rent a cat and go for a pleasure cruise now and then sure it ca n't hurt   if you 're asking because you want to enter the america 's cup you can still read boating monthly but it wo n't in itself meaningfully increase your chances of winning the america 's cup

the current stock price you 're referring to is actually the price of the last trade   it is a historical price but during market hours that 's usually mere seconds ago for very liquid stocks whereas the bid and ask are the best potential prices that buyers and sellers are willing to transact at the bid for the buying side and the ask for the selling side   but think of the bid and ask prices you see as tip of the iceberg prices   that is the bid is an indication that there are potential buyers bidding $ for up to 200 shares   their bids are the highest currently bid and there are others in line behind with lower bid prices   so the bid you 're seeing is actually the best bid price at that moment   if you entered a market order to sell more than 200 shares part of your order would likely be filled at a lower price the ask is an indication that there are potential sellers asking $ for up to 1000 shares   their ask prices are the lowest currently asked and there are others in line behind with higher ask prices   so the ask you 're seeing is the best asking price at that moment   if you entered a market order to buy more than 1000 shares part of your order would likely be filled at a higher price a transaction takes place when either a potential buyer is willing to pay the asking price or a potential seller is willing to accept the bid price or else they meet in the middle if both buyers and sellers change their orders note there are primarily two kinds of stock exchanges   the one i just described is a typical order driven matched bargain market and perhaps the kind you 're referring to the other kind is a quote driven over the counter market where there is a market maker as johnfx already mentioned   in those cases the spread between the bid ask goes to the market maker as compensation for making a market in a stock   for a liquid stock that is easy for the market maker to turn around and buy sell to somebody else the spread is small narrow   for illiquid stocks that are harder to deal in the spread is larger wide to compensate the market maker having to potentially carry the stock in inventory for some period of time during which there 's a risk to him if it moves in the wrong direction     finally if you wanted to buy 1000 shares you could enter a market order in which case as described above you 'll pay $   if you wanted to buy your shares at no more than $ instead i.e. the so called current price then you would enter a limit order for 1000 shares at $   and more to the point your order would become the new highest bid price until somebody else accepts your bid for their shares   of course there 's no guarantee that with a limit order that you will get filled your order could expire at the end of the day if nobody accepts your bid

so let 's assume some values to better explain this   for simplicity all of these are in thousands so in this example you 're going to destroy $ 250 in value pay off the existing $ 150 loan and have to invest $ 300 in to build the new house and this example does n't have enough equity to cover it   you typically ca n't get a loan for much more than the anticipated property value basically you need to get a construction loan to cover paying off the existing loan plus whatever you want to spend to pay for the new house minus whatever you 're planning to contribute from savings   this new loan will need to be for less than the new total market value   the only way this will work out this way is if you bring significant cash to closing or you owe less than the lot value on the current property note that this is in effect a simplification   you can spend less building a house than it 's worth when you 're done with it etc but this is the basic way it would work or not work in most cases

the price at which a stock was purchased is a sunk cost that is you can not go back in time and reverse the decision you made to purchase that stock   another example of a sunk cost would be purchasing a non refundable non transferable movie ticket   sunk costs have the tendency to create a cognitive bias in which we feel that the amount we paid at some point in the past should have some sort of bearing on the decision we make now the purchaser of the ticket feels he must go see the movie even if he no longer wishes too lest the ticket go to waste the investor to a stock for that tiny chance that just maybe some day it will return to its former glory   this is referred to as the sunk cost fallacy and is considered to be irrational behavior by economists keeping this in mind your hopes and dreams for the stock at the time you purchased it should have no bearing on the decision you make now   similarly whether the stock has risen or fallen in price since your purchase date should have no bearing   instead you must consider what you expect the stock to do from this very moment on into the future that is you must act at the margin you 've indicated that you are faced with two choices sell the stock now incur the loss but benefit from the tax break option a   this benefit is quite easily quantifiable it is your marginal tax rate multiplied by the additive inverse of the loss assuming you have will have other gains to offset   let 's just assume that you incurred a $ 1000 loss at a marginal tax rate of 20 which means your tax benefit for the loss is $ 200 the second choice to hold the stock in hopes of it rising in price option a bit harder to quantify   you must assume that today is day zero and that every cent in price the stock rises is a gain to you and every cent in price the stock looses is a loss to you   if you believe that the stock will rise to a price that will net your more than your tax benefit from option a then holding the stock is more favorable than selling it at a loss today   conversely if you believe this stock will fall even further in the future or not rise enough to net you $ 200 per the example then option a is preferable granted there are some additional complications that play into your decision   by selling the stock today you not only get a tax benefit from the loss but you 've also freed up the funds previously used to purchase that stock to be invested elsewhere in hopefully a better performing asset   if you choose to stick with your current stock then the gains you may have netted elsewhere must be considered as an opportunity cost associated with option b.   finally the tax benefit is essentially guaranteed so in our example a $ 200 risk free return while sticking with the stock in option b still comes with some risk

with your windfall you 've been given a second chance you 've become debt free again and get to start over here is what i would recommend from this point on decide that you want to remain debt free it sounds like you 've already done this since you are asking this question commit to never borrowing money again it sounds overly simplistic but if you stop using your credit cards to spend money you do n't have and you do n't take out any loans you wo n't be in debt   learn to budget here is what is going to make being debt free possible at the beginning of each month you are going to write down your income for the month then write down your expenses for the month make sure you include everything you 'll have fixed monthly expenses like rent and variable monthly expenses like electricity and phone you 'll also have ongoing expenses like food transportation and entertainment you 'll have some expenses like tuition which does n't come up every month but is predictable and needs to be paid for these you 'll can set aside part of the money for the expense each month and when the bill comes you 'll have the funds to pay it ready to go using budgeting software such as ynab which i recommend will make this whole process much easier you are allowed to change your plan if you need to at any time but do not allow yourself to spend any money that is not in the plan   take action to address any issues that become apparent from your budget as you do your budget you will probably struggle at first you will find that you do n't have enough income to cover your expenses fortunately you are now armed with data to be able to tackle this problem there are two causes either your expenses are too high or your income is too low   cut your expenses if necessary before you had a written budget it was hard to know where your money went each month now that you have a budget it might be apparent that you are spending too much on food or that you are spending too much on entertainment or even that a roommate is stealing money do what you need to do to cut back the expenses that need cutting   increase your income if necessary you might find from your budget that your expenses are n't out of line you live in as cheap a place as possible you eat you do n't go out to eat etc in this case the problem is n't your spending it is your income in order to stay out of debt you 'll need to increase your income get a job i know that you said that this will slow your studies but because you are now budgeting you have an advantage you did n't have before you now know how short you are each month you can take a part time job that will earn you just enough income to remain debt free while maximizing your study time   build up a small emergency fund emergencies that you did n't plan for in your budget happen to remain debt free you should have some money set aside to cover something like this so you do n't have to borrow when it comes up the general rule of thumb is 3 to 6 months of expenses but as a college kid with low expenses and no family to take care of you wo n't need a huge fund $ 500 to $ 1000 extra in the bank to cover an unexpected emergency expense could be all it takes to keep you debt free

check how long you have to hold the stock after buying it if you can sell reasonably soon and your company is reasonably stable you 're unlikely to lose and/or be taxed and/or pay enough in fees to lose more than the 30 free money they 're giving you   whether you hold it longer than the minimum time depends partly on whether you think you can better invest the money elsewhere and partly on how you feel about having both your salary and part of your investments tied to the company 's success the company would like you to double down that way in the theory that it may make you motivated but some investment would advise keeping that a relatively small part of your total investments basically for the same reasons you are always advised to diversify

high roi and high barriers to entry are rare to find existing together at the same time in the same market more commonly you have high margins roi in early markets but high barriers to entry are more common in mature markets the most common places to find high roi and barriers to entry is when there is something proprietary involved this is why the stem science technology engineering and math fields are so valuable industries related to these fields have an edge because they are the most likely fields to create something proprietary when something proprietary is also in high demand you have a barrier to entry and also a potential to create high margins which in turn will be high roi some people have mentioned medical devices which are an excellent example there are only a handful of companies that have went to the lengths of development to create the swan for example an essential tool used in cardiac surgeries with little competition and high demand companies that manufacture swan can put healthy margins on the product without worry   tl;dr the best way to find something high roi that also has barriers to entry is to specialize towards something proprietary that can not be or replaced but is also in high demand

in most countries you are deemed to dispose of all your assets at the fair value at that time at the moment you are considered no longer a resident ie on the day your friend leaves brazil brazil will likely consider him to have sold his btc for $ 1m.   the brazilian government will then likely want him to calculate how much it cost him to mine buy it so that they can tax him on the gain no argument about how btc is n't fiat money matters here tax laws will typically apply to all investments in a way similar to stocks etc   the us will likely be very suspicious of such a large amount of money without some level of including that he paid taxes on any relevant gains in other countries by showing the us that he paid appropriate expatriate taxes in brazil if they exist i am speaking generally and have no knowledge of brazilian taxes he is helping to prove that he does not need to pay any taxes on that money in the us typically the btc then is valued for us tax purposes as the $ 1 m it was worth when he entered the us becoming a resident there this may require tax planning prior to entering the us see additional answer here any attempt to bring the btc into the us without paying appropriate brazilian us taxes as applicable i 'm not 100 on either check with a tax lawyer knowledgeable on both us brazilian tax law because the amount of money is material will likely be considered fraud how to commit fraud is not entertained as valid subject matter on this site

some index funds offer lower expense ratios to those who invest large amounts of money for example vanguard offers admiral shares of many of its mutual funds including several index funds to individuals who invest more than $ 50 k or $ 100 k and these shares have lower expense ratios than the investor shares in the fund there are institutional shares designed for investments by pension plans 401k plans of large companies etc which have even lower expenses than admiral shares individuals working for large companies sometimes get access to institutional shares through their 401k plans   thus there is something to gained by investing in just one index fund for a particular index that offers lower expense ratios for large investments instead of diversifying into several index funds all tracking the same index of course this advantage might be offset by failure to track the index closely but this tracking should be monitored not on a daily basis but over much longer periods of time to test whether your favorite fund is trailing the index by far more than its competitors with larger expense ratios remember that the net asset value nav published by each mutual fund after the markets close already take into account the expense ratio

the really simple answer is that compound interest is compound not linear   money invested for longer earns more interest and the sooner you start investing the longer it has to earn interest   these ideas come out of pension investment where 65 is the usual retirement age and what you invest in the 1st ten years of your pension or any other compound interest fund accounts for over 50 of what you will get out 25 to 65 is forty years and $ 100 invested at 7 for 40 years is $ 1400   $ 100 invested every year for 40 years the pot would be worth just under $ 20,000 at 30 years it would be worth under $ 10,000 and at 20 years it would be worth only $   if you double your investment amount every 10 years you would have invested $ and the pot would be worth $ do exactly the same but starting at 35 instead of 25 and your pot would only be worth $

to calculate a sector or index p e ratio you need to sum the market caps of the constituent stocks and divide it by the sum of the total earnings of the constituent stocks including stocks that have negative earnings   there are no per share figures used in the calculation beware when you include an individual stock that there may be multiple issues associated with the company that are not in the index eg berkshire hathaway is in the s&p 500 but brk.a is not   in contrast google has both googl and goog included in the s&p 500 index but not its class b shares   all such shares need to be included in the market cap and figuring out the different share class ratios can be tricky

i could be wrong but i doubt you 're going to be able to roll the current mortgage into a new one the problem is that the bank is going to require that the new loan is fully collateralized by the new house   so the only way that you can ensure that is if you can construct the house cheaply enough that the difference between the construction cost and the end market value is enough to cover the current loan and keep the loan to value ltv low enough that the bank is secured so say you currently owe $ 40k on your mortgage and you want to build a house that will be worth $ 200k in order to avoid pmi you 're going to have to have an ltv of 80 or less which means that you can spend no more than $ 160k to build the house   if you want to roll the existing loan in now you have to build for less than $ 120k and there 's no way that you can build a $ 200k house for $ 120k unless you live in an area with very high land value and hire the builders directly and even then it may not be possible otherwise you 're going to have to make up the difference in cash when you tear down a house you are essentially throwing away the value of the house when you have a mortgage on the house you throw away that value plus you still owe the money which is a difficult hole to climb out of a better solution might be to try and sell the house as is perhaps to someone else who can tear down the house and rebuild with cash if that is not a viable option or you do n't want to move then you might consider a home equity loan to renovate parts of the house provided that they increase the market value enough to justify the cost e.g. modernize the kitchen add on a room remodel bathrooms etc so it all depends on what the house is worth today as is how much it will cost you to rebuild and what the value of the new house will be

if the check is written as a check to bigco it is less clear how jack can compensate himself for the equity sale it is as if the equity was owned by the corporation not by jack this is correct   if the check is written to bigco then it is bigco issuing new shares   jack does n't compensate himself for the equity sale as he did n't sell anything   the company traded shares for money which it uses for expansion   in the long term the capital gain from expansion may exceed the value of a $ 200,000 no interest loan to the company    if the value of the company before investing $ 250,000 is $ 1 million then the value after investing is $ 1.25 million   so $ 250,000 is 20 of the value of the company   bigco should not give the buyer 25 of bigco but only 20 in that example   if it does give 25 the buyer is getting a $ stake for only $ 250,000    with the other example jack sells 25 of the company for $ 250,000 from his personal shares   this does n't change the assessed value of the company just jack 's stake   jack then loans the company $ 200,000   this also does n't change the assessed value of the company at least in theory   it gains $ 200,000 but has an offsetting debt of $ 200,000   in net that 's no change   assets and liabilities balance the same    so if you know that the assessed value of the company is $ 1 million and that the buyer is paying $ 250,000 for a 25 stake at that same valuation then you know that the check is being written to jack   if the check is written to bigco then one or more of those numbers is incorrect    the buyer could be getting a 20 stake   the new value of the company after the investment is $ 1.25 million    or paying $   the new value of the company after the investment is $    or bigco could only be worth $ 750,000 before the investment   the new value of the company after the investment is $ 1 million    or jack is getting screwed selling $ in stock 25 for only $ 250,000   jack 's shares drop from being worth $ 1 million to only $   the value of the company is $ 1.25 million    or some combination of smaller changes that balances

first   great job on getting it together   this is good for your family in any respect i can think of   this is a life long process and skill but it will pay off for you and yours if you work on it your problem is that you do n't seem to know where you money goes   you ca n't decide how your expenses are until you know what they are   looking at just your committed expenses and ignore the other stuff might be the problem here   you state that you feel you live modestly but you need to be able to measure it completely to decide i would suggest an online tool like mint.com if you can get it in your country because it will go back for 90 days and get transactions for you   if you primarily work in cash this is n't helpful but based on your credit card debt i am hoping not   although a cash lifestyle would be good if you tend to overspend take the time and sort your transactions into categories   do n't setup a budget just sort them out   i like to limit the number of categories for clarity sake especially to start do n't get too crazy and do n't get too detailed at first   if you buy a magazine at the grocery store just call it groceries once you know what you spend then you can setup a budget for the categories   if somethings are important create new categories   if one category is a problem then break it down and find the specific issue the key is that you budget not be more than you earn but also representative of what you spend follow up with mint every other day or every weekend so the categorization is a quick and easy process   put it on your iphone and do it at every lunch break   share the information with your spouse and talk about it often

your wife is probably not going to be able to get a policy until all tests are complete and the doctors give her a clean bill of health    a change in your health could make your premiums 50 to 75 higher than they would be if you applied for a policy in perfect health   health history is one of the biggest factor in calculating an premium    the average age for purchasing a policy is 59   including all rate increases the average long term care insurance premium is $ per year based on my calculations from a 2015 national association of insurance report with 2014 data because of new consumer protections designed to prevent rate increases policies purchased today do cost more than older policies in 2015 the average premium for a new policy was $ per year according to a survey of most companies selling long term care insurance couples can get discounts as high as 30 percent when purchasing policies at the same time do not work with just a local insurance agent who sells many different types of insurance   only work with an insurance agent who specializes in ltc insurance and that represents at least 7 of the top companies   there are probably a couple of hundred agents in the country that specialize in ltc are independent agents representing a lot of companies and have a lot of experience   interview at least 3 different agents   get quotes from every agent you speak with and ask each of them their opinion about which policy you should get   go with the agent who seems the most knowledgeable and professional   do not buy ltc insurance from a financial advisor   they are usually limited to offering only a few companies because of their broker dealer arrangements and they rarely understand ltc underwriting   do not buy ltc insurance from the company you get auto insurance or home insurance with   and do not buy a policy just because your retirement association or alumni association recommends it   shop around   in your wife 's case it would probably be wise to apply to more than one company at the same time in case one of them denies her application    here is an article i wrote for a website owned by pbs which answers some of the most common misconceptions about ltc insurance an insurance agent ’s case for buying long term care insurance

there is no typical return for an ira understand that an ira is not an investment type it is just an account that gets special tax treatment by the federal government the money in the ira could be invested in almost anything including gold stocks bonds cash cds etc so the question as phrased is n't exactly meaningful it is kind of like asking what is the typical price of things if i use $ 10 bills as for a annualized return on your portfolio that 's not a bad return at that rate you will double your investment with compounding every 7.2 years again however some context is needed you can really only evaluate investment returns with your risk profile in mind if you are invested in super safe investments like cds that is an absolutely incredible return you compare it to several indexes which is a good way to do it if you are investing in the types of investments tracked by those indexes

it does n't make much difference in the end imagine you have $ 100 of revenue in your company you can either pay it to yourself as salary meaning that you do n't pay corporate tax on it or you can keep it in the company pay corporate tax on it then pay yourself a dividend of what is left while that dividend will be treated better than salary remember that the company already paid tax on it you paying less on what 's left does n't equate to paying less overall go ahead and run the numbers using your actual corporate tax rate and your personal income tax rate try doing your whole salary as dividends not dollar for dollar but as how much the company would have as profit to give you a dividend if it did n't spend and deduct salary money on you you are unlikely to see any difference at all the net final money in your pocket and the amount that went to the government will probably be the same if paying dividends keeps your earned income low you may find that you ca n't use rrsp or childcare deductions you are also not getting cpp credit that 's an argument for salary or at least a certain minimum amount of salary you have to deduct taxes at source on salary and send it along to the government which is an argument for dividends if you feel you could invest that money and use it well before the taxes get around to being due possibly you may discover an edge case where you move a few thousand from one marginal tax rate to another and clear a few hundred extra as a result i do n't discourage you from doing the math i just point out that the various percentages tax rates deductions etc have all been carefully chosen so that it pretty much works out the same or gives a small preference to salary we give excess money to ourselves as bonus rather than dividend having run the numbers a few times there 's no secret trick here

there is a strange puzzle today where savings account interest rates are not rising in line with the federal funds rate either customers are apathetic to their alternative uses of cash or banks have some how formed a cartel to keep their cost of funding low i 'm leaning towards the former since bank customers today likely value readily accessible cash more than the interest rate they could earn by investing in money market mutual funds

if the business is being investigated by your state 's attorney general 's office then your first call should be to that office   they will be able to help you in a few ways even if they ca n't explicitly resolve the situation and they also would undoubtedly appreciate your information to add to their case as well first they may be able to tell you how other victims have had their cases resolved particularly if any went to court on their own   while they wo n't be able to provide you with personal information of the other victims unless it is public knowledge via a court case the information about how the other victims resolved the cases may be helpful both to show what to do and what not to do second they may be able to put you in contact with an attorney who is handling other cases like yours that may reduce the cost of the attorney as they 'll have already done some of the work and may mean that the attorney is willing to work with no up front fee on the assumption of winning the case third if there are options for getting your money back without a court case the ag 's office may be able to help provide those as well if the attorney general 's office is unable to help you then your best bet is to contact an attorney on your own look for one who specializes in consumer protection and fraud   this is the purpose attorneys exist for pursuing your interests against another 's   let them do their job   do make an effort to find a good honest attorney you may find some help on how to do this on if you need it not actual recommendations mind you just help with how you would go about finding one   it sounds like your claim would be above and beyond the level of a small claims court lawsuit but verify this in your jurisdiction if small claims court goes up to $ 10,000 you may be able to pursue it there on your own but i would still get some help from an attorney at least finding out what you would need to win

i think the first misconception to clear up is that you are implying the price of a stock is set by a specific person it is not the price of a stock is equal to the value that someone most recently traded at if apple last traded at $ 100/share then apple shares are worth $ 100 if good news about apple hits the market and people holding the shares ask for more money and the most recent trade becomes $ 105 then that is now what apple shares are worth remember that generally speaking the company itself does not sell you its shares instead some other investor sells you shares they already own when a company sells you shares it is called a public offering to get to your actual question saying something is priced in implies that the market that is investors who are buying and selling shares in the company has already considered the impacts of that something for example if you open up your newspaper and read an article about ibm inventing a new type of computer chip you might want to invest in ibm but the rest of the market has also heard the news so everyone else has already traded ibm assuming that this new chip would be made that means when you buy even if sales later go up because of the new chip those sales were already considered by the person who chose the price to sell you the shares at one principle of the stock market not agreed to by all is called market efficiency generally if there were perfect market efficiency then every piece of public information about a company would be perfectly integrated into its stock price in such a scenario the only way to get real value when buying a company would be to have secret information of some sort it would mean that everyone 's collective best guess about what will happen to the company has been priced in to the most recent share trade

when you look at managed funds the expense ratios are always high they have the expense of analyzing the market deciding where to invest and then tracking the new investments the lowest expenses are with the passive investments   what you have noticed is exactly what you expect now if you want to invest in active funds that throw off dividends and capital gains the 401 k is the perfect place to do it because that income will not be immediately taxable if the money is in a roth 401 k it is even better because that income will never be taxed

in addition to all the points made in other answers in some jurisdictions including the uk where i live the consumer credit laws require the lender to allow the borrower to pay off the loan at any time if the lender charges interest and the borrower pays off the loan early then the lender loses the interest that would have been paid during the rest of the loan period however if the actual interest is baked into the sale price of an item and the loan to pay for it is nominally 0 then the borrower still pays all the interest even if they pay off the loan immediately if you think this game is being played then you can ask for a cash discount or similar wording i once had problems with a car salesman who thought i meant a suitcase full of used £ 20s meaning you want to avoid paying the interest as you are not taking a loan

great answer by only thing to add is that the option itself becomes a tradeable asset here 's my go at filling out the answer from hey kid so you have this brand new video game manic that you paid $ 50 for on jan 1st that you want to sell two months from now yes mr. video game broker but i want to lock in a price so i know how much to save for a new tickle me for my baby sister ok for $ 3 i 'll sell you a put option so you can sell the game to me for $ 40 in two months kid says ok sends $ 3 to mr game broker who sends our kid a piece of paper saying the holder of this piece of paper can sell the game manic to mr game broker for $ 40 on march 1st one month later news comes out that manic is full of bugs and the price in the shops is heavily discounted to $ 30 mr options trader realizes that our kid holds a contract written by mr game broker which effectively allows our kid to sell the game at $ 10 over the price of the new game so maybe about $ 15 over the price in the second hand market which he might be about $ 25 on march 1st he calls up our kid hey kid you know that put option that mr game broker sold to you you a month ago wanna sell it to me for $ 13 he wants to get it a couple of bucks cheaper than his $ 15 fair valuation kid thinks   hmmm that would be a $ 10 net profit for me on that put option but i would n't be able to sell the game for $ 40 next month i 'd likely only get something like $ 25 for it so i would kind of be getting $ 10 now rather than potentially getting $ 12 in a month note the $ 12 is because there could be $ 15 from exercising the put option selling for $ 40 a game worth only $ 25 in the second hand market minus the original cost of $ 3 for the put option kid likes the idea and replies done next day kid sends the put option contract to mr options trader and receives $ 13 in return our kid bought the put option and later sold it for a profit and all of this happened before the option reached its expiry date

do you have a regular job where you work for somebody else and they pay you a salary if so they should be deducting estimated taxes from your paychecks and sending them in to the government how much they deduct depends on your salary and what you put down on your w-4 assuming you filled that out accurately they will withhold an amount that should closely match the taxes you would owe if you took the standard deduction have no income besides this job and no unusual deductions if that 's the case come next april 15 you will probably get a small refund if you own a small business or are an independent contractor then you have to estimate the taxes you will owe and make quarterly payments if you 're worried that the amount they 're withholding does n't sound right then as says get a copy of last year 's tax forms or this year 's if they 're out by now paper or electronic fill them out by estimating what your total income will be for the year etc and see what the tax comes out to be

investors who are themselves canadian and already hold canadian dollars cad would be more likely to purchase the tsx listed shares that are quoted in cad thus avoiding the currency exchange fees that would be required to buy usd quoted shares listed on the nyse assuming shopify is only offering a single class of shares to the public in the ipo and shopify 's form f-1 only mentions class a subordinate voting shares as being offered then the shares that will trade on the tsx and nyse will be the same class i.e. identical consequently the primary difference will be the currency in which they are quoted and trade this adds another dimension to possible arbitrage where not only the bare price could deviate between exchanges but also due to currency fluctuation an additional implication for a company to maintain such a dual listing is that they 'll need to adhere to the requirements of both the tsx and nyse while this may have a hard cost in terms of additional filing requirements etc in theory they will benefit from the additional liquidity provided by having the multiple listings canadians in particular are more likely to invest in a canadian company when it has a tsx listing quoted in cad also for a company listed on both the tsx and nyse i would expect the tsx listing would be more likely to yield inclusion in a significant market index say one based on market capitalization and thus benefit the company by having its shares purchased by index etfs and index mutual funds that track the index i 'll also remark that this dual exchange listing is not uncommon when it comes to canadian companies that have significant business outside of canada

there are many good brokers available in the market and many spammers too personally i have been associated with since 2001 and have never faced any problem but everyone has their own personal choice and i recommend you to make your own but the question is how to find out which broker is a good broker and would provide you with a timely and reliable service online google check not really there is so much competition between brokerage firms that they keep writing rubbish about each other on blogs and websites best thing is to is check with regulator 's website for us is a regulator for all forex firms information about any regulated forex firm could be found here for uk its fsa information on all regulated uk based firm could be found here remember in many countries its not compulsory for a forex firm to be regulated but being regulated ensure that the govt has a watch on the operations of the firm also most of the firms out there provide accounts for large as well as small traders so there is nothing much to look for even if you are a small trader do keep in mind that if you are a us citizen you are restricted by the us govt to trade only with a broker within us you are not allowed to trade with any brokerage firm that is based outside the country forex trading involves a significant amount of risk make sure you study the markets well and get yourself educated properly before risking your money while i have made a lot of money trading forex i have seen a lot of people loosing everything please understand the risk and please make sure you only trade with the money which you can afford to loose

my suggestion would be to do the math that is the best advice you can get when considering any investment   there are other factors you have n't considered too like the fact that interest rates are at extremely low levels right now so borrowing money is relatively cheap if you 're outside the us though that may be less of a consideration as the mortgage lending institutions in europe only tend to give 5-year locks on loan rates without requiring a premium you may be somewhere else in the world   you will probably struggle to do the actual math about the probability of the market going down or up but what you can do is this   figure out what it would cost you to cash out the investments you say your balance is $ 53,000 in various items congrats that 's a nice chunk of money but with commissions and taxes and etc it may reduce the value of your investments by 10 25 when you try to cash out those investments paying $ 3,000 to get that money out of the investments is one thing but if you 're sending $ 10,000 to the tax man when you sell this all off that changes the economics of your investments a lot in that case you might be better off seeing what happens if the markets correct by 10 you 'd still have more than if you sold out and paid major taxes once you know your down payment calculate the amount of property you could afford you know your down payment could be somewhere around $ 50,000 after taxes and other items at an loan to value ratio that 's about $ 250,000 of a property that you can qualify for assuming you could obtain the loan for $ 200,000   what could you buy for that do some shopping and figure out what your options are   once you have two or three potential properties figure out the answer to what would the property give you is it going to be rented out are you going to live there both   if you 're living in it then you come out ahead if the costs for the mortgage debt and the ongoing maintenance and repairs are less than what you currently pay in rent figure out what you pay right now to put a roof over your head will the place you could buy need repairs will you pay more on a mortgage for $ 200,000 usd in your local currency than what you currently do for housing do n't even factor in the possible appreciation of a house you when you 're making this kind of investment decision it could just as easily burn down as go up in value   if you would rent it what kind of rental would that be long term rental expect to pay for other people to break your stuff short term rental you can collect more money per tenant per day but you 'll end up with higher vacancy rates and people still break your stuff but do the math and see if you could collect enough in rent from a tenant person or business or whatever the properties are you could buy to cover the amount you are paying in debt plus what you would pay in taxes rent is income plus what you would need for maintenance plus insurance   if the numbers make sense then real estate can be a lucrative investment i own some investment properties myself it is a great hedge against inflation you can raise rents when contracts lapse usually and it is an excellent way to own a tangible item but if you do n't know the numbers and exactly how it would make you better off than sitting and hoping that the markets go up because they generally do over time then do n't take the jump

depending on the improvement you have to amortize or depreciate it over time which effectively allows you to write off the value over a period of years even if you pay for it all up front this messes with cash flow which is different than profitability but when you span the write off over five or ten years the distinction between cash flow and profitability for a private self funded company is irrelevant if the money ai n't there the money ai n't there operating capital is life blood   taxes also alter the roi equation of the investment since you do n't keep all the money you put in   way over simplified example lets say i close out the year with some arbitrary profit ten million bucks in my war chest 3.5 could go to taxes i also know that my supplier ca n't handle my volume for next year while the season is hot so i 'd like to buy inventory in the off season last year i sold 6.5 mill worth of stuff from this supplier but i estimate i could sell 9 10 mill if i did n't have availability problems if i buy 9 10 mill in inventory i ca n't pay taxes if i pay taxes i ca n't buy enough to grow next year    sure cogs is a deductible expense but the expense is n't realized until the inventory is sold which wo n't be until long after these taxes are due   i now have taxes interfering with my expansion even though eventually i can write that off   now lets look at the manufacturer sure he could expand his capacity and make more money but he has to deduct the 5 mill machine he needs over twenty years or ten or whatever while the purchase price needs to be made today this year he 's gon na pay tax on 90 or 95 of the money he used to buy that machine which would eat into the money he needs to buy raw materials to fill orders he already has   of course the real world is much more complicated and you can leverage leasing agreements and purchasing terms to alleviate this to some extent but i wanted to illustrate a point i hope my extremely simplified example communicated what i mean   does that make sense

based on my research the answer is both you would pay taxes on the bitcoin you mine as income and then capital gains tax when you sell them for a profit or capital loss if you lose value on the sale   you can write off a portion of your electricity bill and hardware purchased for the use of mining as a business expense but it 's recommended that you consult a tax professional for determining the proper amount that is eligible for a deduction   from forbes new bitcoin are being issued by the system roughly every 10 minutes by    a process called mining in mining computers running the bitcoin    software around the world attempt to solve math problems and the first    computer to come up with the solution adds the most recent    transactions to the ledger of all bitcoin transactions plus receives    the new bitcoins created by the system called the block reward if you are a miner and win the block reward you must record the fair    market value of bitcoin that day and mark that as an addition to your    personal or business income also note the date and timestamp at which    your coins were mined later when you dispose of those bitcoin you    will subtract the date of acquisition from the date of disposal and    you will be taxed a long term capital gains rate on any bitcoin you    held for more than a year and a short term capital gains rate on any    bitcoin you held for a year or less the timestamp is n’t absolutely    necessary but is helpful to validate the order of multiple    acquisitions or within a day the amount you pay in taxes on a long term capital gain will depend on    your income tax bracket while short term capital gains are taxed the    same as ordinary income from   another clarification in the irs 's march notice was how mining should    be treated mining is income on the day of receipt of any coins and    at the fair value of those coins this means that if you mined any    bitcoins or alt coins either solo as part of a pool or through a    cloud provider you need to report any coins you received as income where it is less clear is what that dollar value might be since the    fair value is not always as easy to determine   bitcoins    are all examples of where there is a direct usd market and    so you can easily find out their value of any given day however a    newly created alt coin that was mined in its early days has no direct    market and so how do you determine its value or for any alt coin    e.g. abc coin that has no direct usd market but does have a btc    market does it have a value do you have to make a conversion from    abc to btc to usd   since there is no clarification yet from the irs on    this issue you should discuss how to proceed with your own tax    professional has taken a prudent approach and calculates    value where a fiat or btc market exists converting an alt coin to btc    to usd as necessary and from bitcoin magazine the irs also stated mined bitcoins are treated as immediate income at    the market value of those mined coins on their date of mining most do n’t know they can write off any losses they have said    founder the irs allows you to offset income by up to    $ 3,000 per year on capital losses   if you have losses and you are n’t    writing them off then it ’s like throwing money away nobody likes    doing taxes but if you can owe less or increase your return then    doing your bitcoin taxes often results in a benefit in fact the    majority of our users are filing a capital loss which means they ’ve    actually saved money by using our tool   also gives insight for miners   mining is considered income so know the price of bitcoin at the time    you mined it he said if you make money on bitcoin trading the irs    requires that you report gains with line level detail   the    appropriate form for that is 8949 a sub form of schedule d. gains and    losses as outlined above are treated like every other capital asset

this whole thread stinks of entitlement the reddit hivemind has gotten into its head this misguided notion that we all deserve to be able to borrow money from banks credit card companies the government and so forth to do things we want and that if we ca n't pay it off well so what they 're big guys i 'm a little guy screw them i should get off free   you do n't have to be an ayn rand and i 'm not to see how this kind of logic is insane if you sign a contract you have to honor it period sure the banks that try to sell you crazy loans are annoying but no one 's sticking a gun to your head and it 's certainly not their responsibility when you come up short bankruptcy is a sign that you have poorly handled your finances and/or life decisions which is precisely why it rightly your credit score if you ca n't grasp why bankruptcy has different implications and thus is handled differently for incorporated businesses then you do n't get it   this is n't to say that bankruptcy law as well as consumer debt finance could n't be better regulated improved it could but reddit loves to use this stuff as an excuse for bitching and whining about how unfair it is that we have to actually pay back student loans mortgages cards etc that we you know actually promised to pay back it 's fucking inane   tl;dr hate credit card debt do n't accumulate it in the first place

one scenario described in the original question a non insider who trades after informal conversations with friends where no insiders directly benefit from any such disclosure might not be illegal   ianal this is just my personal interpretation of articles in the news recently the appeals court said prosecutors needed to show that the person disclosing the information received a clear benefit something more than the nurturing of a friendship in a 1980 case the supreme court rejected the idea of a general duty between all participants in market transactions to forgo actions based on material nonpublic information

i do n't think you 're stupid evil bad or anything like that   i 'm sure in fact that you are an intelligent nice person who only wants the best for everyone   i just think that you are in a willful refusing to understand the difference between insurance and healthcare   it 's not that you are incapable it is that you simply refuse to do so   you are doing so to justify making the bad guy out of an industry whose goal is to make health care accessible to as many people as possible by spreading out the cost of health emergencies over time which is mis directed anger   i fully appreciate and understand that most health care is payed for via insurance   however this is entirely an artifact of business tax deductions which make it cheaper for individuals to accept part of their compensation in the form of health insurance benefits   health care and insurance are n't intrinsically they are bound together in the us due to the tax code     so what you should be arguing for is the removal of business health care tax deductions and direct financial assistance for the poor   this would make insurance and healthcare a more competitive market which would in turn drive costs down and by giving the money directly to the impoverished more of the benefit would reach them rather than creating some huge bureaucracy that it has to be filtered through first   but instead you are choosing to a industry for not handing out free health care which is misguided at best

it 's important because it shows that the amount you owe does not decrease linearly with each payment and you gain equity as a correspondingly slower rate at the beginning of the loan and faster at the end this has to be figured in when considering refinancing or when you sell the place and pay off the mortgage it also shows why making extra payments toward principal if your loan permits doing so is so advantageous unlike a normal payment that lowers the whole curve by a notch reducing the length of time over which interest is due and thus saving you money in the long run possible lost costs of course

a good question there are many good tactical points in other answers but i wanted to emphasize two strategic points to think about in your 5-year plan both of which involve around diversification expense allocation you have several potential expenses actually expenses is n't the right word it 's more like applications think of the money you have as a resource that you can pour because money has liquidity into multiple buckets depending on time horizon and risk tolerance an ultra short term cushion for extreme emergencies e.g.   things go really wrong this should be something you can access at a moment 's notice from a bank account for example your car has been and they need cash a short term cushion for emergencies something bad happens and you need the money in a few days or weeks a cd ladder is good for this it pays better interest and you can get the money out quick with a minimal penalty a long term savings cushion you might want to make a down payment on a house or a car but you know it 's some years off for this an investment account is good there are quite a few index funds out there which have very low expenses and will get you a better return than cds savings account with some risk tolerance retirement savings $ 1 now can be worth a huge amount of money to you in 40 years if you invest it wisely here 's where the ira or 401 k if you get a job comes in you need to put these in this order of priority put enough money in your short term to be 99 confident you have enough then with the remainder put most of it in an investment account but some of it in a retirement account the thing to realize is that you need to make the retirement account off limits so you do n't want to put too much money there but the earlier you can get started in a retirement account the better i 'm 38 and i started both an investment and a retirement account at age 24 they 're now to the point where i save more income on average from the returns in my investments than i can save from my salary but i wish i had started a few years earlier income you need to come up with some idea of what your range of net income after living expenses is likely to be over the next five years so that you can make decisions about your savings allocation are you in good health or bad are you single or do you have a family are you working towards law school or medical school and need to borrow money are you planning on getting a job with a dependable salary or do you plan on being self employed where there is more uncertainty in your income these are all factors that will help you decide how important short term and long term savings are to your 5-year plan in short there is no one place you should put your money but be smart about it and you 'll give yourself a good head start in your personal finances good luck

the company released its 2nd quarter revenue of $ a couple days ago however the stock did not move up in any way why if the company is making money should n't the stock go up but that result does n't indicate that the company is making money   the word for making money is profit not revenue   profit equals revenue minus costs   an increasing revenue could mean decreasing profits   for example marketing expenses could eat up the entirety of the new revenue    this is one of the most basic aspects of researching stocks   if you are having trouble with this you might find yourself better suited to invest in mutual funds where they do this research for you   in particular the safest kind of mutual funds for an inexperienced investor are index funds that track a major index like the s&p 500    another issue is that stock prices are n't based on historical results but on expected future results   many a company has reported smaller than expected profits and had their price fall even though profits increased from previous results    looking at it long term would it hurt me in anyway to buy shares which right now would run be about $ 24 including to fee and sit on it it would cost you $ 24   you might get a return some day   or you might waste your money   given the comparatively large upside the consensus seems to be that you will probably waste your money   that said it 's not a lot of money to waste   so it wo n't hurt you that much   the most likely result remains that the company will go bankrupt leaving your stock worthless

the purpose is to go public but also to generate more wealth the real money comes when market values you at a price more than your cash flow if a company brings in $ 1000 of cash flow then that is what the employees and owners have to distribute among themselves but if they are likely to increase to $ 2000 next and $ 4000 next year and they go public then the stock will do well in this case the promoters and employees with options rsus will benefit as well the increased visibility is also very useful look at google or fb they did n't need the ipo proceed when they went public they had enough cash from their business but then they would only have $ 1 10 billion a year but due to the ipo their investors and employees have a huge net worth   basically with just a small of shares in the public you can value the company at a high price valuing in the future cash flows with a discount rate etc so instead of realizing the profit over the next 15 years you get to enjoy it right away

how when does my employer find out do they get a report from their    bank stating that check for $ paid to john doe was never    deposited or does it manifest itself as an eventual accounting    discrepancy that somebody has to work to hunt down the accounting department or the payroll company they use will report that the check was not deposited the bank has no idea that a check was written but the accounting will know   the bank reports on all the checks that were cashed accounting cares because the un cashed check for $ is a liability they have to keep enough money in the bank to pay all the liabilities it should n't be hard for them to track down the discrepancy they will know what checks are outstanding can my employer punish me for refusing the money in this way do they    have any means to force me to take what i am owed they ca n't punish you but at some time in the future they will will tell their bank not to honor the check they will assume that it was lost or misplaced and they will issue a new one to you   when tax time comes and i still have not accepted the money would it    be appropriate to adjust my reported income down by the refused    amount you ca n't decide not to report it the company knows that in year x they gave you a check for the money they are required to report it since they also withheld money for federal taxes state taxes payroll taxes 401 k insurance they also count your pay as a business expense   if you try and adjust the numbers on the w-2   the irs will note the discrepancy and want more information remember the irs get a copy of every w-2   the employer has to report it because some people who are n't organized may not have cashed a december check before the company has to generate the w-2 in late january it would confuse everything if they could skip reporting income just because a check was n't cashed by the time they had to generate the w-2

i would add to this that while everyone is right on trading there are certain special situations you could look into that could turn a profit in a relatively short time frame one month say    a recent example is realty finance i bought in at $ prior to a spinoff sold half the spinoff company at $ within a month and the other half the reit has since paid a 50 cent dividend and gone up to mid $ as well within a total of just over 2 months this admittedly sounds like bragging which is n't i just want to give an example of a short term position resulting in a gain and i do n't know any off the top of my head except the one i did recently    this is n't trading but it is a short term position that would have turned a profit with $ 1800 i still would n't recommend it considering commissions eats a sizable portion but if you want to take short term positions you do n't need as much as you would to be a day trader    i would read seth klarman 's margin of safety the sections on spinoffs and bankruptcy they provide some useful information on some short term positions however also be aware that you should be willing to hold any short term position as a long term position if it does not immediately work out by way of example i believed would go up post spinoff but the spinoff company stay the same instead stayed the same and the spinoff went up but was undervalued so i held it for another month    just my advice as far as learning use play money but if you never are going to have enough money to really trade with hopefully my info on short term positions is helpful
