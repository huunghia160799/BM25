i am not a lawyer nor a tax accountant so if such in here i 'll gladly defer but my understanding is   if you 're involved and living together you 're considered a household and thus your finances are deemed shared for tax purposes any money your partner gives you toward paying the bills is not considered rent but her contribution to household expenses i do n't know the but i 'll call your partner her for convenience this is not income and is not taxed on the off chance that the irs actually investigated your arrangement do n't call any money she gives you rent call it her contribution to living expenses if you were two or more random people sharing a condo purely for economic reasons i.e. you are not a family in any sense but each of you would have trouble affording a place on your own it 's common for all the room mates to share the rent or mortgage utilities etc but for one person to collect all the money and write one check to the landlord etc tax law does not see this as the person who writes the check collecting rent from the others it 's just a book keeping convenience and so there is no taxable transaction of course the landlord owes taxes on the rental income but that 's not your problem in that case it likely would be different if one person outright owned the place and really was charging the others rent but then he could claim deductions for all the expenses of maintaining it including depreciation so if it really was a case of room mates sharing expenses the taxable income would likely be just about zero anyway so short answer if you really are a couple there are no taxable transactions here if the irs should actually question it do n't refer to it as collecting rent or any other words that imply this is a business arrangement describe it as a couple sharing expenses people sometimes have created tax problems for themselves by their choice of words in an audit but the chance that you would ever be audited over something like this is probably remote i suppose that if at some point you break up but you continue to live together for financial reasons or whatever reasons that could transform this into a business relationship and that would change my answer

i would be a fan of non cooperative game theory for life if the end result was a society would enjoy and love   but that is never the case   there is always a stronger luckier better positioned player who attempts and power structure to gain all the resources of the other players or at least his biggest opposition   we are n’t on an even playing field and the factors of influence are more numerous and varied than our simulations describe   and when one player wins everyone else loses   i love competition but only if it is limited to strengthening the players   i love cooperation but only if it is strong and able to defend itself while recognizing the usefulness and utility of expansion and achievement   the best games are the ones where even if you lose you win

when you exercise a put you get paid the strike price immediately so you can invest that money and earn some interest compared to only exercising at expiry so the benefit to exercising early is that extra interest the cost is the remaining time value of the option along with any dividend payments you miss as @joetaxpayer points out there might be tax considerations that make it better to exercise at one time rather than another but those would likely be personal to you so if the option would intrinsically have more value unexercised in many cases you could sell it on rather than exercise it the exception might be if it was n't very liquid and the transaction costs of doing that outweighed the theoretical value

as joetaxpayer notes in his comment answers to this are really just opinions so here 's mine for what it 's worth if your risk tolerance is 5 out of 5 you should n't have anything in treasuries   those are basically the most conservative of all investments   this would probably mean no tips as well   if you 're more like 4.5 out of 5 you could have some but just a little a 30 allocation to government securities is quite conservative   if you want to diversify across different asset classes you could consider a bond fund like for instance vbmfx the vanguard total bond market index fund   your portfolio does n't currently contain any non government bonds which is something to consider 20 seems like quite a large allocation to reits   most sample portfolios i 've seen allocate no more than 10 to reits often no more than 5   there are some that have more like the 20 you 're but you might want to ponder that a bit more especially in light of your concerns about reits being at an all time high as for your question about all time highs it 's reasonable to think about but i think waiting for 30 50 off all time highs is unrealistic   looking at a chart of vfinx essentially the s&p 500 i see that at the of the recent downturn in early 2009 the market was at about 50 of its pre crash all time high   at the of the dot com bust the market was about 45 off its pre crash high   if you 're waiting for it to be 50 off it 's all time high you 're not just waiting for a good time to invest you 're waiting for a major crash it could certainly make sense not to immediately put everything into us stocks but that does n't mean you should put nothing in   as commented you could put some of the money in and then gradually add the rest over time reducing the risk of buying at the peak   this can also reduce the psychological of worrying about whether you 're doing the right thing which is worth taking into account   also note that if you get rid of the treasuries you eliminate a good chunk of the stuff that you thought was too close to the peak anyway your two basic points asset allocation and low cost funds have a strong boglehead flavor   you may already have looked at the bogleheads wiki if not you should take a look   if you are comfortable with that philosophy and i think it 's a sound one you should remember that part of that philosophy is not worrying about timing the market   you pursue a buy and hold strategy if you believe the market will go up in the long term and do n't care much about what it does in the short term   that said as mentioned above you might want to ease in your investment over time rather than buying all at once if only to avoid tearing your hair out if the market goes down in the short term incidentally your proposed portfolio is similar to this one that they mention although as i said above i think this is too conservative if you are 30 years old and consider yourself a 5 out of 5 in terms of risk tolerance   i 'm not sure if you already saw that in your research but since that portfolio apparently has a name and is known you might be able to find information about its risks and benefits by searching for discussion of it by name

the primary advantage of hfts is their speed to act upon opportunities that exist for only fractions of a second the reason why they are able to do this is because they invest heavily in hardware custom software and custom algorithms   most of the fleeting advantage as they all manage to top each other 's hardware seemingly every other day is from the hardware investment   to see the extremes that hfts will go to invest in hardware one might view this it is highly likely that the trader with the market making algorithm could have been ignorant of the hide not slide order and missed out on many more opportunities while still being successful   who is very much against this order type was not so lucky if it was truly an investment bank then it was unlikely that they were actually front running which is very illegal and easily possible with much more low tech means since companies like citadel handle most orders now and they have not been successful in investment banking the reality of hft is slowly coming to light that while hft can provide extremely consistent returns with enormous sharpe ratios the capital investment is equally enormous and the amount of capital that can be employed is also as enormously limited   after all the richest people on the planet are not hft owners also when it comes to time periods longer than their results become very human

a private company certainly has the right to make hiring decisions based on whatever criteria they want the article strongly implied this company was incorporated which makes it a public institution and that changes things   my understanding is that laws about discriminatory hiring go into effect once a company reaches a certain size for example over 15 employees it can be strongly argued that once a company reaches a certain size it is more of a public institution than a private endeavor i like very much that companies like koch industries can not discriminate in hiring even if they are n't a public company to allow this would enable the systemic economic of any minority   your about half leftist is unnecessary and takes away from the valid point you were making

inflation is basically this   over time prices go up i will now address the 3 points you have listed suppose over a period of 10 years prices have doubled   now suppose 10 years ago i earned $ 100 and bought a nice pair of shoes   now today because prices have doubled i would have to earn $ 200 in order to afford the same pair of shoes   thus if i want to compare my earnings this year to 10 years ago i will need to adjust for the price of goods going up   that is i could say that my $ 100 earnings 10 years ago is the same as having earned $ 200 today or alternatively i could say that my earnings of $ 200 today is equivalent to having earned $ 100 10 years ago this is a difficult question because a car is a depreciating asset which means the real value of the car will go down in value over time let us suppose that inflation does n't exist and the car you bought for $ 100 today will depreciate to $ 90 after 1 year a 10 depreciation but because inflation does exist and all prices will be 0.5 higher in 1 years time we can calculate the true selling price of the car 1 in year as follows 0.5 of $ 90 = 0.005 90 = $ 0.45 therefore the car will be $ 90 + $ 0.45 = $ in 1 years time if inflation is low then the repayments do not get much easier to pay back over time because wages have not risen by as much   similarly the value of your underlying asset will not increase in value by as much however as compensation the interest rates on loans are usually lower when inflation is lower therefore generally it is better to get a loan in times of high inflation rather than low inflation however it really depends on how the much the interest rates are relative to the inflation rate

according to pages 6 7 of the instructions for form 1040 in 2009 amt was only temporarily for the year congress ca n't politically afford to drastically cut amt exemptions by 30 to 40 and may even retroactively change it if it is n't passed by the end of the year despite the constitution ex post facto laws what ’s new for 2009     alternative minimum tax amt exemption amount increased the amt exemption amount has increased to $ $ if married filing jointly or a qualifying $ if married filing separately what ’s new for 2010     alternative minimum tax amt exemption amount the amt exemption amount is scheduled to decrease to $ $ 45,000 if married filing jointly or a qualifying $ 22,500 if married filing separately so if you are married and several regular tax deductions push your income below the amt exemption amount of $ 45,000 it 's quite possible you would be required to pay amt even if you did n't last year there is a work sheet for amt in the instructions for line 43 but the irs also provides an amt calculator according to page 146 of the instructions for form 1040 amt is paid as the smallest amount you are allowed to report as your taxable income form 1040 line 43 it is also the smallest amount you are allowed to report as your alternative minimum taxable income    on form line 29 if the amt calculation is larger than your taxable income would otherwise be enter the amount from column c on form 1040 line 43 or form line 29   as always congress finds ways to further complicate things by making a few credits and losses deductible against the absolute minimum you 're expected to pay taxes on making the amt a misnomer

as for the letting the wise people only make the decisions i guess that would be a bit odd in the long run especially when you get more experienced or when you do n't agree with their decision what you could do is make an agreement that always 3/4 + of the partners must agree with an investment this promotes your involvement in the investments and it will also make the debate about where to invest more alive fun and educational as for the taxes i ca n't give you any good advice as i do n't know how tax business stuff works in the us here in the netherlands we have several business forms that each have their own tax savings the savings mostly depend on the amount of money that is involved some forms are better for small earnings 80k or less other forms only get interesting with large amounts of money 100k or more apart from the tax savings there could also be some legal technical reasons to choose a specific form again i do n't know the situation in your country so maybe some other folks can help a final tip if your also doing this for fun try to use this investment company to learn from this might come in handy later

dividends are paid based on who owns the security on a designated day   if a particular security pays once per year you hold days and sell on the day before the critical day you get no dividend   this is not special to 401(k or to drip   it 's just how the system works the critical day is the day before the posted ex dividend date for the security if you own at the end of that day you get the dividend   if you sell on that day or before you do not your company changing providers is not in itself relevant   the important factor is whether you can still hold your same investments in the new plan   if not you will not get the dividend on anything that you currently hold but sell due to the change in providers   if you can then you potentially get the dividend so long as there 's no glitch in the transition incidentally it works the other way too   you might end up getting a dividend through the new plan for something that you did not hold the full year

let me start by giving you a of a report that will floor you beat the market investors lag the market by so much that many call the industry a scam    this is the 2015 year end data from a report titled analysis of investor behavior by a firm dalbar it boggles the mind that the disparity could be this bad a mix of stocks and bonds over 30 years should average 8.5 or so take out fees and even 7.5 would be the result i expect the average investor return was less than half of this jack bogle founder of vanguard and considered the father of the index fund was a i got from vanguard decades ago quoted fund managers as saying that indexing is a path to mediocrity fortunately i was a numbers guy read all i could that jack wrote and got most of that less .05 down to .02 over the years to answer the question psychology people are easily scammed as they want to believe they can beat the market or that they 'll somehow find a fund that does it for them i 'm tempted to say ignorance or some other hint at lack of intelligence but that would be unfair to the professionals all of which were scammed by madoff individual funds may not be scams but investors are partly to blame buy high sell low and you get the results above i dare say an investor claiming to use index funds might not fare much better than the 30 year return above if they follow that path buying high selling low edit i am adding this line to be clear my conclusion if any is that the huge disparity can not be attributed to management a 6.7 lag from the s&p return to what the average investor sees likely comes from bad trading to the comments by dave we have a manager that consistently beats the market over any 2 3 year period you have been with him 30 years and are clearly smiling about your relationship and investing decision yet he still has flows in and out people buy at the top when reading how good he is and selling right after a 30 drop even when he actually beat by dropping just 22 by getting in and out he has a set of clients with a 30 year record of 6 returns while you have just over 11 this paragraph speaks to the behavior of the investor not managed vs indexed

if you are looking to begin living off the money now then dheer 's answer is correct it is not possible however if you are looking to grow that money and potentially additional money added at later dates then you could make this work 250 a month corresponds to 3000 per year a first approximation is that you will need a diversified portfolio of 20 25x that amount to get the required return this approximation is based on the rule of thumb for how much life insurance to buy therefore you need to determine how to grow the 4k you currently have into 60 75k these numbers however are not adjusted for inflation in the us i would like put the long term inflation adjust diversified market return at 4 per year your money doubles about every 18 years so your best approach if you have time is a diversified portfolio with rebalancing and adding additional money each year

yes there are times when co signing is the right choice one is when you know more about the person than the loan issuer does consider a young person who has just started working in a volatile field the kind of job where you can be told on friday that you only get one shift next week but things might pick up the week after and who makes maybe $ 12 an hour in that job you 've done the math and with 40 hour weeks they can easily afford the loan furthermore you know this person well and you know that after a few weeks of not enough shifts they 've got the to go out and find a second job or a different job that will give them 40 hours or more a week and you know that they have some savings they could use to ensure that no payments will be missed even on low wage weeks you can cosign for this person say for a car loan to get them a car they can drive to that job knowing that they are n't going to walk away and just stop making the payments the loan issuer does n't know any of that   or consider a young person with poor credit but good income who has recently decided to get smart about money has written out a budget and a plan to their credit and who you know will work passionately to make every payment and get the credit score up to a place where they can buy a house or whatever their goal is again you can cosign for this person to make that happen because you know something the lender does n't or consider a middle aged person who 's had some very hard knocks laid off in a plant closing perhaps marriage failure lost all their house equity when the market collapsed that sort of thing they have a chance to start over again somewhere else and you have a chance to help again you know this is n't someone who is going to their money and walk away from the payments and leave you holding the bag if you would give the person the money anyway say a car for your newly graduated child then cosigning instead gives them more of a sense of accomplishment since they paid for it and gives them a great credit rating too if you would not give the person the entire loan amount but would make their payments for many months or even a year say your brother 's mortgage for the house where he lives with a sick wife and 3 small children then cosigning is only making official what you would have done anyway   arrange with the borrower that if they ca n't make their payments any more you will backstop them and the item car house whatever is going up for sale to cover your losses if you do n't think you could enforce that just from the strength of the relationship reconsider co signing then sign what you need to sign and step away from it it 's their loan not yours you want them to pay it and to manage it and to leave you out of it until it 's all paid off and they thank you for your help if things go south you will have to pay and it may take a while for you to sell the item or otherwise stop the paying so you do need to be very confident that the borrower is going to make every single payment on time my point is just that you can have that confidence based on personal knowledge of character employment situation savings and other resources in a way that a lender really can not

while the 55 exception noted by joe and jb makes this less of a worry it 's worth noting that to retire early most people would need additional investments beyond a maxed out 401(k   as most people make more money later in life it is generally worth putting what you can in a 401(k now and later when your savings would max out a 401(k then you can start adding money to accounts that are not tax advantaged   these additional funds can be used during the bridge period run the numbers yourself as these assumptions wo n't be true for all individuals but this may be the piece you are missing

i used to trade power for a closed end hedge fund    yes weather derivatives are very important   they help power traders utilities hedge for unaccountable variables ie weather   for example lets say it costs a utility $ 50 an hour to produce power for the load when it is 80 degrees outside   lets say i trade the contract with them to guarantee the weather will be under 80 degrees   if the weather is higher than 80 degrees more people turn in their ac the load on the grid goes up and the utility has to start generating power at $ 70 an hour     under this contract i would be liable to pay the utility the net difference in their cost the additional $ 20 per hour they generate per mw   in that case i am a loser   if the power comes in under 80 degrees i make money as i priced sold the contract at a premium according to the risk i for the contract   this has many many applications but yes its not a weird thing to trade   hope this helps

yes the value of a stock is completely 100 determined by what people are willing to pay for it in conjunction with what people who have it are willing to sell it for if something really bad happened to a company like their only factory burned to the ground and the traders did n't care then i guess in that scenario the value of the stock would not change but you can spin all sorts of hypotheticals of that sort if dogs could talk would german speak german etc any answer is pretty meaningless because the premise is wildly unlikely as cqm notes traders in this context means everyone who buys or sells stock if you buy stock that includes you they 're not some cabal somewhere if you see a stock listed at whatever $ 50 and you are not willing to pay more than $ 40 for it then you refuse to buy and so you tend to force the price down if you 're not a billionaire then your impact on the market is tiny but the market is made up of millions of people each with tiny influence note that all this is true not just of the stock market but of every product on the market a product is worth whatever the owner is willing to sell it for and people are willing to pay this is what determines the price of everything from houses to it 's a little theory i 've invented that i like to call the law of supply and demand

i think others have made the key points let me just add as others have pointed out the traditional ira is better if your tax rate in retirement is lower than it is when you are building the account the roth ira is better if your tax rate in retirement is higher for most people your income in retirement will be lower than your income in most of your working years on top of that a significant percentage of your income will come from social security which is generally not taxed and so the tax rate you pay on the remaining income will be lower still if you 're just starting out if you 're in your 20s it 's likely that your income will go up significantly in the next couple of decades and so you might be making more in retirement that you are now and so the roth is probably your better bet but if you 're in your 40s or 50s you are probably making your peak income you will have much less in retirement and the traditional ira is likely better if your income is well above average and you are saving enough to have a retirement income well above average then social security may be a very small part of your retirement and my comments on that may not be relevant to you it 's true that tax rates could change in the future but will they go up or down it 's also possible that the laws about retirement accounts will change if you think you have some insight into what will happen in the future you may want to take that into account when making plans but politics is very hard to predict

i like nathan 's answer some but am horribly curious as to why you have not made payments on a $ 3500 student loan   if you are wealthy enough to afford a new car this should be paid off next week   imho above all else your financial goals should dictate if you buy a new car   what are they for you   if the goal is to build wealthy quickly then nathan 's advice may be to for you    if your goal is to impress people with the car you drive and accumulate very little real wealth then purchasing or leasing a car should be a top priority so to answer your question correctly one must understand your goals    for 2016 the average car payment is $ per month   if you invested that in a decent growth stock mutual fund in 40 years you 'll have around 2.6 million   however you do need something to drive now   if you can cut your car expense to $ 200 per month and save the other $ you will still end up with about 1.5 million in that same 40 years    personally i attempt to shoot for $ 200 ownership cost per car per month   its a bit difficult as i drive a lot   also i would not purchase a new car until my net worth exceeded 2 million   at that point my investments could mitigate the steep depreciation costs of owning a new car

it would be incredibly unusual for the same institution to offer checking and savings accounts with exactly the same features benefits including interest etc the reason is that in the usa anyways the fed makes banks keep a certain percentage of their total assets called the reserve requirement in house checking account deposits can not be re loaned of the money you put in your checking account must be held by the bank in its vaults savings accounts are not limited in this way so logic dictates that if depositing into one type of account is better for the bank than the other ie they can use more of the money to make money they will reward people for using the one that is more beneficial to their bottom line i 'm this from college finance 101 so i may be slightly mis remembering things but i 'm 99.99 sure that this is the primary reason you see checking accounts with lower interest rates banks would prefer you to use savings accounts and set up incentives so that you will sorry i know this does n't really answer your question but i think it may help you understand your options a little better i hope

there are several paths of study you could undertake if you want to learn the fundamentals of the stock market and become a financial analyst then finance economics and accounting yes accounting are all good to study either on your own or in an institution furthermore if you want to study a specific industry it ca n't hurt to know a fair amount of the science behind that particular industry for example if you want to understand the pharmaceutical or biotechnology industries knowledge of clinical trials the fda 's approval process in the us at least off label uses for drugs genetic engineering etc are all good to know you do n't have to become an expert but having a firm grasp on the science is extremely useful when evaluating a company 's prospects if you 're interested in becoming an algorithmic trader or a quant then physics certain fields of engineering signals processing applied math computer science or econometrics will get you much farther than a standard finance or accounting degree most people can learn the basics of finance not everyone can learn advanced mathematics a lot of the above applies to learning about the forex market as well economics is certainly helpful especially central bank policy but since the forex market is so massive and liquid many mathematical tools are necessary because algorithms play a key role as well per littleadv 's suggestion an mba with a concentration in finance may be an option for someone who already has a degree also an msf master of science in finance or a degree in financial engineering called an mfe or for operations research and financial engineering are other potentially better options for someone pursuing a more technical career a high trading firm may not care that you 've taken marketing and management classes they want to hire someone who can understand complex algorithms and design and implement new ones quickly   some msf programs are pre experience programs which means that in exchange for taking more time to complete they do n't expect you to have significant work experience in the financial industry an mba might require such experience however

thanks for your reply sarah   i am sure there is no significance in the washington post disclosing that it is owned by jeff bezos but my point is that if the patent was created for a plan i highly doubt jeff would have let the cat out of the bag in this way especially by a newspaper organization that he owns as the other individual mentioned i just think this is bezos 's his muscles to other competitors heck he may even attempt to sell the innovation for a whopping amount of money   believe me i love innovation as well i think it plays an instrumental role in society however there are some innovations that are detrimental to us as a people even if it may seem at the moment if you have n't noticed but the more technology that is created the less privacy we have the dumber we become and the more jobs we lose to automation    if amazon succeeds and generates profit from operations at whole foods via electronic automation means i see wal mart coming back harder with automation services which will prove detrimental to jobs

housing eh housing costs are driven by salaries and land availability over in the bay area $ for a nice apartment is a good deal but a decent software engineer with ~4 years experience can get $ 120k easily the standard benchmark of affordability of housing is spending a third of your income on it a year that guy can afford about $ on housing if you do n't away the money and can keep your cost of living down and save money you can really clean up especially if you move elsewhere later so to stop thinking about it in terms of dollar value first try to think of it in terms of time 33 of someone 's salary or a third of their time at work going for housing is pretty nominal beyond that think about it in terms of opportunity cost if you saved that extra $ 20 what exactly would you use it for and how much of that goal does it represent

debt increases your exposure to risk   what happens if you lose your job or a major expense comes up and you have to make a hard decision about skipping a loan payment   being debt free means you are n't paying money to the bank in interest and that 's money that can go into your pocket debt can be a useful tool however   it 's all about what you do with the money you borrow   will you be able to get something back that is worth more than the interest of the loan a good example is your education   how much more money will you make with a college degree   is it more than you will be paying in interest over the life of the loan   then it was probably worth it instead of paying down your loans can you invest that money into something with a better rate of rate of return than the interest rate of the loan   for example why pay off your 3 student loan if you can invest in a stock with a 6 return   the money goes to better use if it is invested   note that most investments count as taxable income so you have to factor taxes into your effective rate of return the caveat to this is that most investments have at least some risk associated with them   stocks do n't always go up   you have to weigh this when deciding to invest vs pay down debts   paying down the debt is more of a sure thing another thing to consider if you have a long term loan several years paying extra principal on a loan early on can turn into a huge savings over the life of the loan due to power of compound interest   extra payments on a mortgage or student loan can be a wise move   just make sure you are paying down the principal not the interest   and check for early repayment penalties

ulip insurance plan ulip is unit linked insurance plan the premium you pay a small part goes towards covering life insurance the balance is invested into stock markets most ulip would give you an option to choose from debt funds 100 safe buy low returns 5 7 or equity high risks returns can be around 15 or a mix of both ulip are not a good way to save money there are quite a few hidden fees that actually reduce the return so notionally even if returns shown are great in effect it is quite less for example the premium you pay in first year say rs 10,000/- rs goes towards commission and say rs 100 goes towards insurance balance rs units are purchased in your account even if these grow by 20 you are still in loss the commissions go down year after year and stop at 5 then there is fund management fees that you do n't get to see there is maintenance fee that is from your balance   thus the entire method of charging is not transparent life insurance from there are broadly 2 types of life insurance plans money back endowment plan the concept here is again same you pay a premium and part of it goes toward insurance the balance invests in safe bonds every year a bonus is declared generally less than bank rate at the end of the plan you get more than what you paid in premium however if you had kept the same in bank fd you would have got more money back so if you die your nominee would get insurance plus bonus if you survive you get all the accumulated bonus pure term plan here the premium is quite less for the sum insured here if you die your nominee would get insurance if you survive you do n't get anything

in singapore this is sufficiently common that the singapore irs has a page on their website dedicated to informing employers of how to properly pay this under of an employer    specifically tax paid by employer is taxable income for the employee as it 's really the employee 's responsibility so they must pay tax for that tax   a tax on tax is computed for the tax paid which also would be owed by the employer if they were paying the full tax rate for the employee as a clarification this is not the employer being truly responsible for the employee 's income this is the employer compensating the employee further to offset their taxable income   this is effectively a fringe benefit although it may be particularly useful in countries where either tax evasion is common and thus an employer must compete with employers willing to pay under the table or where employers are competing with others in nearby countries with lower tax rates   it is not the same thing as the employer making your income nontaxable though and has implications for your tax filing significantly it is likely that if you have additional income beyond income from that employer it is likely to be taxed at your highest tax rate as the employer will likely calculate the tax due based on their income being the only income you have in that year edit based on emphasis in question i 'm not from singapore nor am i a lawyer but based on my reading of the iras website it looks like you do not have to file if you have no other source of income because they have a no filing service which takes income information from your employer automatically and generates a tax bill which presumably would be fully paid in your case   this only if you have no other sources of income however you still have to file if you have other sources of income since your employer would not know about them if you are eligible for this service you should get a letter informing you as such   they also have a tool to check your filing status on their website

taxing wealth is an easy idea but i do n't think it can ever work wealth is too easily hidden transformed or taxing actual cash flows works because two parties have to declare it taxing wealth would cause huge conflicts as to how wealth is measured that said i 'm a big fan of the idea that the estate tax should be massively increased and would only involve a single evaluation per taxpayer rather than every year taxing more measurable forms of wealth like stocks would cause wealth to flow from stocks into property which would then be valued as low as possible causing a general market crash and another great depression   i 'm most curious about a tax scheme which is where taxes are levied on un improved property per wikipedia based on the belief that people should own the value they produce themselves but that the economic value derived from land including natural resources should belong equally to all members of society    so most taxes in society would be generated by those who owned property as a speculation and did n't invest in it incentives would be to make all property held privately be as economically productive as possible

once wealth accumulates in the hands of a few they 're less likely to spend it as opposed to when there 's smaller amounts of wealth in the hands of many that 's one of the primary arguments for more economic equality   you then also have the case of that wealth being used to generate more wealth without really adding anything of value employing hedge fund managers bankers lawyers and accountants to manage large amounts of that wealth in order to use it to generate more wealth sometimes in ways that does n't benefit society at all and sometimes even to its detriment toxic assets tax evasion etc    overall this has the effect of weakening the economy at the very least inhibiting its growth and i do n't possibly see how you could argue that a weaker economy benefits anyone especially those in the best position to take advantage of the goods produced by a stronger economy the wealthy a stronger economy means more and better goods on the market that the rich can then benefit from i do n't think the luxury goods market would go anywhere either and may even allow it to grow because of the people who are just under the wealthiest would get richer with more equality remember it 's only the top 10 who benefit from the current massive inequality

that number may be based on a long term historical view of the stock market   if you look at some long term charts for the dow   or the s&p500 you 'll see that overall the upward trend is pretty good   however there are some pretty huge flat spots in those charts and if the majority of your have been made during one of those periods you may not have seen a lot of growth if you look at periods between 10 17 years or so you can find places where it would have really sucked to be you look at the s&p chart and imagine 66 to 83 ouch and places where things were stellar    if you expand to about say 30 years or so then it 's hard to find a period without at least some good growth in there somewhere   if you panicked during a downturn and sold on the low things of course get much worse   how your own portfolio has done will depend a lot on how the funds you chose have done how much you put into equity vs fixed income and if the fixed income was in actual bonds or a bond fund    bond funds are subject to a lot more as interest rates rise or fall than something like a t bill or i bond that you own outright and plan to hold to maturity

rsu are taxed when vested based on their value at that point as salary if you do n't sell to cover you need to pay the taxes if you sell to cover you sell the portion that is worth the taxes brokers do that automatically and remit the taxes on your behalf once paid your taxes it becomes a regular stock position short term gains if you sell within a year after vesting long term if you wait for more than a year the consideration whether to wait or sell is as with any other investment them being previously restricted has no meaning you calculate the gain for each position so the fact that you have more than one position is not a problem the rsu income and the taxes paid will appear on your w2 so when the broker reports proceeds you can show the basis and thus calculate the gain see this question for some useful answers on how to report the rsu sale on your taxes

the difference is that yahoo is showing the unadjusted price that the security traded for on that date while google is adjusting for price splits this means that google is showing how much you would have had to pay to get what is now one share since 1979 jnj has split once and 2-for-1 four times = 48 if you bought 1 share at that time you would now have 48 shares today yahoo is showing a price of $ 66 for what was then 1 share $ = which google rounds to you can see this if you get the prices from may 14 21 1981 the stock split and the price dropped from 108 to yahoo 's adjusted close column has not been accurate since they re wrote the finance website it now just represents the closing price the other relevant field on yahoo is the adj close this adjusts for splits but also adjusts for dividends hence why this does n't match either the google or yahoo numbers

i agree with the other comments that you should not buy hold your company stock even if given at a discount if equity is provided as part of the compensation package options restrictive stock units this rule does not apply as a matter of diversification you should not have majority equity stake of other companies in the same sector e.g. technology as your employer asset allocation and diversification if done in the right way takes care of the returns buying and selling on the same day is generally not allowed for espp taxation headaches this is from personal experience cisco systems i had options issued in sept 2008 at 18 $ which vested regularly i exited at various points $ my friend held on to all of it hoping for 30 $ is stuck options expire if you leave your employment espp shares though remain

this probably is n't worthy of being more than a comment is not specific to your needs other answers cover that better and i am a big advocate of not owning property but investing the money in the markets instead potentially higher rates of return however if i were going to buy a property i would do so sooner rather than later as a rise in interest rates is not a matter of if but when borrow now when it is cheaper to do so and lock in the rate by taking out a fixed rate mortgage the rate might be higher than variable rate mortgages but their rates will go up above your fixed rate very quickly

who issued stock typically support it when the stock price go down   no not many company do that as it is uneconomical for them to do so money used up in buying back equity is a wasteful use of a firm 's capital unless it is doing a buyback to return money to shareholders does the same thing happen with government bonds   not necessarily again here bond trading is very different from equities trading there are conditions specified in the offer document on when an issuer can recall jack up the price of an oversold bond even government bonds have them   the actions of the government has a bigger ripple effect as compared to a firm the government can start buying back bonds to increase it 's price but it will inflation because of the increase in the supply of money in the market which may or may n't be desirable then again people holding the bond would have to incentivized to sell the bond even during the greek fiasco the greek government was n't buying greek bonds as it had no capital to buy printing more euros was n't an option as no assets to back the newly printed money and the ecb would have stopped them from being accepted   and generally buying back is n't useful because they have to return the might run into billions invested in long term projects by the government and can not be liquidated immediately while servicing a bond is cheaper and investing the proceeds from the bond sale is more useful while being invested in long term projects the government can just roll over the bonds with a new issue and refrain from returning the capital till it is in a position to do so

e i disagree with your logic the ipo clearly did n't go well not relative to other ipos   were it not for the stocks underwriters stepping in late in the trading day facebook would likely have closed below their opening price this story and others indicate that institution investors were given negative information by an analyst for the underwriters that other investors did n't have   this inside knowledge is certainly contributing to the drop in the stock   it 's fair to argue that many individual investors were suckered into buying the stock at the ipo price because of this incomplete disclosure it would n't surprise if what 's happens has a negative impact on future trading volume and creates reluctance to invest in the firm which would certainly be an additional negative outcome beyond the dropping stock price edit dilip mentioned a lawsuit   here 's a link to an article about it

unquestionably i think the priority should be funding retirement through roth k over hsa extra   obviously you need to fund your hsa for reasonable and expected medical expenses   also there is some floor to your more traditional retirement funding beyond that what does one do with excess dollars   given the lack of flexibility and fees it seems clear to do roth ira and 401k. beyond that what then   you may want to decide to take some money home and pay taxes on it   do you have a desire to own rental property or start purchase a business   upgrade your home etc if all those things are taken care of only then would i put money into an hsa ymmv but most people maxing a roth ira alone will have plenty of money for retirement given a reasonable rate of return

you should know when to sell your shares before you buy them this is most easily done by placing a stop loss conditional order at the same time you place your buy order there are many ways to determine at what level to place your stop losses at the easiest is to place a trailing stop loss at a percentage below the highest close price so as the price reaches new highs the trailing stop will rise if looking for short to medium term gains you might place your trailing stop at 10 below the highest close whilst if you were looking for more longer term gains you should probably place a 20 trailing stop another way to place your stops for short to medium term gains is to keep moving your trailing stop up to just below the last trough in an existing uptrend

i 'm absolutely a in economics and i wish to understand how things work around finance this is a pretty loaded question to understand finance you need the basics of economics in almost every economics school in the country you first study microeconomics and then economics so we 'll start with micro one of if not the most popular books is principles of microeconomics by this book covers the fundamentals of micro econ opportunity supply demand consumer choice production costs basic game theory and allocation of resources in a clear and effective manner it 's designed for the novice and very easy to read    like 's other book principles of macroeconomics is also top notch there is some overlap in key areas i.e. opportunity cost supply demand curves elasticity taxation because they are fundamental to economics and the overlap will always be there but from there the book goes into key macro concepts like gdp cpi employment monetary and fiscal policy and inflation an excellent intro primer indeed    now that you have the fundamentals down it 's time to learn about finance the best resource in my opinion is financial markets by robert shiller on open yale courses i 've personally taken prof shiller 's class last semester and the man is brilliant the lectures cover every single aspect of finance and can turn the complete novice into a fairly experienced finance student the first lecture also covers all the math required so you do n't get lost at any point be warned however that the course is very deep we used fabozzi 's textbook foundations of financial markets and institutions which is over 600 pages deep and we were required to know essentially all of it watch the videos and follow the readings and you 'll be a finance soon financial markets on open yale   and that 's your to what you want there are other economics books and it 's true that the first few chapters of both books are largely the same but that 's because any economics course always covers the basics first if you want to look at other books krugman has written some good books as well be sure to read reviews because some books are meant for year econ students so you do n't want to get a too advanced book at the novice level we 're interested in understanding the basic concepts so we can master fabozzi as for finance books fabozzi teaches you all the fundamentals of financial markets so you 've got a powerful foundation from there you can expand to more niche books such as books on investing or on monetary policy or whatever you want best of luck

when banks would return the actual physical cheque at least you had some printing writing from the other bank on it as some type of not easily proof now many most banks do n't return the actual cheques anyway just an image of it sometimes a low quality photocopy like image too   you 'd have to check with a lawyer or court in your area but i suspect any photocopy or image as well as a written or carbon copy duplicate would not be good enough proof for a law court since they could all be easily re written or so i do n't think there 's a real upside anyway only an official bank statement saying that the name people written actually cashed the cheque might be good evidence i 'm having doubts that the bank 's own low quality image would even qualify unless it 's verified as coming directly from the bank somehow i 'd agree with nate + 1 that a big downside could be identity theft either online or alongside phone loss theft

after learning about things that happened in the flash crash i always use limit orders in an extremely rare instance if you place a market order when there is a some glitch for example some large trader adds a zero at the end of their volume you could get an awful price   if i want to buy at the market price i just set the limit about 1 above the market price if i want to sell i set the limit 1 below the market price i should point out that your trade is not executed at the limit price if your limit price on a buy order is higher than the lowest offer you still get filled at the lowest offer if before your order is submitted someone fills all offers up to your limit price you will get your limit price if someone perhaps by accident fills all orders up to twice your limit price you wo n't end up making the purchase i have executed many purchases this way and never been filled at my limit price

the point of short selling as a separate instrument is that you can you do it when you ca n't sell the underlying asset usually because you do n't actually own any of it and in fact believe that it will go down shorting allows you to profit from a falling price another non speculative possibility is that you do n't have the underlying asset right now and thus ca n't sell it but will get it at a certain point in the future e.g. because it 's bonds that you 've used to guarantee a loan or grain that 's still growing on your fields

people have that mean they do n't have the same level of demand for luxuries every day   there might be some days when i 'm feeling a bit poor or feel like i need to save money and the price i 'm prepared to pay for a box of popcorn might be   there might be other days for example the day after i receive my wages when i feel rich and i do n't care how much i spend on things   on such a day the price i 'm prepared to pay for a box of popcorn might be $ 10 now when a supermarket sells popcorn they 're not really able to price discriminate between these two groups   people come through their doors in all kinds of mood so the profit maximising price for popcorn is going to be somewhere in the middle but the only people who go to a movie theatre are people who are already in the right mood to spend money on needless luxuries   so the very fact of being in a movie theatre means that a popcorn stall whether affiliated to the theatre or not is open only to the high spending end of the market   they have already caught me when i 'm in the mood to spend so their profit maximising price will be much higher than that of the supermarket

if there are no limit orders on the opposite side of the book when your market order gets its turn for execution it should be rejected by the market   a market order should generally not sit on the book like your question suggests waiting for another order to arrive   thus the situation that you describe should not happen in an ordinary market that is operating in an orderly fashion this is not to say that your order can not sit for a while in a queue if there is heavy volume orders will be executed in order so your your market order may have to wait for orders entered ahead of it to be processed   but once its turn comes up that 's it there are some related points to consider i should caution that my answer is biased a bit to us stock markets whereas you asked about currency markets   i believe the same basic principles apply but i 'd be swayed by someone with evidence to the contrary   i 'd also note that currency tends to be more liquid than stock so i think it 's less likely that this situation would come up   maybe possible for a weak currency or a currency that experiences a sudden crisis of some sort

that totally sucks   i use for work once a year when i 'm flown out to corporate and both times i 've done so they 've managed to fuck up in regards to my reservation     the first time i received an email from them thanking me for using their service when i still had the car and saw a new $ 300 charge on my credit card   when i called to inquire about the car i had rented 3 days earlier that was still in my possession they informed me that the vehicle had been checked into one of their 2300 miles away and they were citing a fee for returning the vehicle to another location   when i asked the agent how many miles were recorded driven on the vehicle she responded with 108   i then asked her how far she thought chicago was from san francisco and if it was possible to drive that distance in 3 days while only incurring 108 miles on the vehicle   in the end they refused to back down and i had to involve corporate to settle everything   the second issue was much less but happened a week ago when i checked out a car   i received an email 2 hours later saying they 're sorry my car had n't been available and to call them for an explanation   puzzled as i had gotten the car i had asked for i called and was told that their system says i had checked out and in the very same car i had the previous day at check in and check out were recorded as the same time same day and they charged me $ 50 for a single day 's rental   this time they recognized that it was an error and credited me back the money on my cc but i do n't know why they have so many issues with their reservation system

i do n't think you 're stupid evil bad or anything like that   i 'm sure in fact that you are an intelligent nice person who only wants the best for everyone   i just think that you are in a willful refusing to understand the difference between insurance and healthcare   it 's not that you are incapable it is that you simply refuse to do so   you are doing so to justify making the bad guy out of an industry whose goal is to make health care accessible to as many people as possible by spreading out the cost of health emergencies over time which is mis directed anger   i fully appreciate and understand that most health care is payed for via insurance   however this is entirely an artifact of business tax deductions which make it cheaper for individuals to accept part of their compensation in the form of health insurance benefits   health care and insurance are n't intrinsically they are bound together in the us due to the tax code     so what you should be arguing for is the removal of business health care tax deductions and direct financial assistance for the poor   this would make insurance and healthcare a more competitive market which would in turn drive costs down and by giving the money directly to the impoverished more of the benefit would reach them rather than creating some huge bureaucracy that it has to be filtered through first   but instead you are choosing to a industry for not handing out free health care which is misguided at best

which strategy makes more sense check your new fidelity 401k plan make sure it has a good group of funds available at very low fees if it does roll over your principal 401k to your new 401k call principal and have them transfer the funds directly to fidelity do not have them send you a check if the new plan does n't have a good fund lineup or has high fees create a rollover ira and roll your old 401k plan into it again have principal transfer the funds directly consider using vanguard or other very low cost funds in your ira taking the money out of your old 401k to pay toward your mortgage has several disadvantages you will pay taxes and a penalty your mortgage rate is very good and since you are probably in a high tax bracket and perhaps itemize deductions the effective rate is even less and you lose liquidity that might come in handy down the road you can always change your mind later but for now do n't pay down your mortgage using your 401k money as a result of being under 20 i am paying mortgage insurance of    about $ 300/mo this is wasted money save aggressively and get your mortgage down to 80 so that you can get rid of that pmi if you are earning a high salary you should be able to get there in reasonably short order if you are maxing out your 401k $ 18,000 per year you might be better off putting it on pause and instead using that money to get rid of the pmi i have no retirement plans because i enjoy working and have plans to    start a company and essentially will be happy working until i die you are young your life will change over time everyone young seems to choose one of two extremes   in the end very few choose either of these paths for now just plan on retiring somewhere close to normal retirement age you can always change your plans later

i agree with option 3 from the accepted answer his hers joint but with one caveat that my wife and i are finding out once you have children if your income is in the mid range where you are not paycheck to paycheck but are not floating in excess money either ie you can have a vacation but you have to plan for it and save up for a few months to do so the child relative expenses begin to be a huge factor in your overall budget such that particularly if one partner does more of the child related buying it can be hard to really keep up the 3 account separation because those child related expenses may end up being all of one earner 's paycheck we originally did the 3 way split where we took rent car and utilities from joint ie each transferred a reasonable portion to the joint account to cover and just bought groceries each occasionally such that it was generally a reasonable split as we both shopped for groceries and both earned close enough to each other that it worked out   but once we had kids it ended up being very different and we eventually had to more properly budget all of our funds as if they were basically joint funds   while we still do have separate accounts and largely separate credit cards etc except for one joint card it 's almost pro forma now due to the kids

my answer is similar to ben miller 's but let me make some slightly different points there is one excellent reason to get a consolidation loan you can often get a lower interest rate if you are presently paying 19 on a credit card and you can roll that into a personal loan at you 'll be saving over 5 which can add up i would definitely not consolidate a loan at into a loan at then you 're just adding 1 to your interest rate what 's the benefit in this another good reasons for a consolidation loan is psychological a consolidation loan with fixed payments forces you to pay that amount every month you say you have trouble with credit cards it 's very easy to say to yourself oh just this month i 'm going to pay just the minimum so i can use my cash for this other very important thing that i need to buy and then next month you find something else that you just absolutely have to buy and again the next month and the next and your determination to seriously pay down your debt keeps getting pushed off if you have a fixed monthly payment you ca n't you 're committed also if you have many credit cards juggling payments on all of them can get complex and confusing it 's easy to lose track of how much you owe and to budget for payments at worst when there are many bills to pay you may forget one personally i now have 3 bank cards an airline card and 2 store cards and managing them is getting out of hand i have good reasons for having so many cards the airline card and the store cards give me special discounts but it 's confusing to keep track of as to adding $ 3,000 to the consolidation loan very very bad idea you are basically saying i have to start seriously paying down my debt tomorrow today i need a some extra cash so i 'm going to borrow just a little bit more but i 'm going to get started paying it off next month this is a trap and the sort of trap that leads people into spiraling debt start paying off debt now not at some vague time in the future that never seems to come

sorry for your loss like others have said debts can not be inherited period in the us however assets sometimes can be made to stand for debts in most cases credit card debt has no collateral and thus the credit card companies will often either sell the debt to a debt collector or collections agency sue you for it or write it off collecting often takes a lot of time and money thus usually the credit card companies just sell the debt to a debt collector who tries to get you to pay up before the statute of limitations runs out that said some credit card companies will sue the debtor to obtain a judgement but many do n't in your case i would n't tell them of your loss let em do their homework and waste time do n't give them any info and consult with a lawyer regarding your father 's estate and whether his credit card will even matter often unscrupulous debt collectors will say illegal things per the fdcpa to pressure anyone related to the debtor to pay do n't cave in make sure you know your rights and record all interactions calls you have with them you can sue them back for any fdcpa some attorneys might even take up such a case on contingency i.e they get a portion of the fdcpa damages you collect do n't pay even a penny this often will extend or reset the statute of limitations time for the debt to be collectable i.e ex if in your state the statute of limitations for credit card debt is 3 years and you pay them $ 0.01 on year 2 you just bought them 3 more years to be able to collect tl;dr ianal most credit card debt has no collateral so do n't pay or give any info to the debt collectors anytime you pay it extends the statute of limitations consult an attorney for the estate matters and if the debt collectors get too aggressive and record their calls and sue them back

another factor to consider beyond the fact that growth and volatility go together is that the times when many people will need to liquidate their investments will correlate with the times that many other people need to liquidate their investments and such correlation will push down the immediate value of those investments while certificates of deposit have penalties for early withdrawal one can establish up front what the worst case penalty would be for cashing it in at the most inopportune time   by contrast stocks offer no such assurance   stocks sometimes have weird downward spikes that may be short lived but if life circumstances force one to liquidate stocks during such a downward spike the penalty can be much larger than on a cd

an important risk is that the government may decide to change the rules for example prior to 2011 over the counter drugs like aspirin tylenol etc were eligible expenses you could use your hsa money to buy as much as you wanted beginning in 2011 those rules changed now if you want to spend your hsa money on tylenol you need a prescription for it the value of hsa dollars was diminished in the sense that the universe of eligible expenses was diminished no one knows what the hsa rules will be in the future what will be eligible expenses who will be eligible providers what kind of compliance paperwork will be required what kind of fees will be imposed personally i 'm a great believer in hsas i 've saved in one for years but remember that the government makes the rules regarding their use they 've changed the rules to the detriment of hsa owners at least once i wo n't be surprised if it continues

your title question who could afford a higher premium who could n't afford a higher monthly payment contrasts premium with monthly payment but those are the same thing   in the body of your question you list monthly payment and deductible which is entirely different the deductible is paid only if you need that much medical care in any one year   most years a person in good health pays little because of the deductible   thus the higher deductible options offer catastrophic health insurance without giving much in the way of reimbursement for regular medical expenses note the original question has been edited since

gt;i think you mean 60 of all mortgages on homes in nevada are underwater not every home has a mortgage so it 's not 60 of the homes it 's 60 of the mortgages   spot on in the us typically somewhere around 30 to 40 of homes have no mortgage at all i.e. 100 equity by the owners   so if nevada follows the us average which it may not having a lot of new developments then 60 of would be somewhere between 36 to 42 of homes   that of course is still huge if even 10 of homes in a locale are distressed sales it is enough to drive prices down   but another caveat is that just because a place is underwater does not mean that it has a high negative equity point of fact is that any home bought with an ltv mortgage or a really low down payment i.e. 0 to 10 down payment is probably underwater from day one and remains pretty close to that for the first couple of years    why because typical realtor fees are around 6 and closing costs are easily another couple of percent add in that with a self amortizing loan that very little equity is built up in the first few years and any loss for aging and owner cash out equity can easily be near zero or negative   that 's one of the reasons you should n't buy unless you are planning on living somewhere for at least 5 years because it takes that long to recoup the realtor amp closing costs ergo the whole flipping is in and of itself a sign that a market is in a speculative bubble

imagine two restaurants one has prices 15 higher than the other and the owner pays this 15 to his wait staff in the form of higher wages the other has lower prices but the average customer gifts 15 to their waiter clearly in the first restaurant the 15 the wait staff receives is taxable income it is traditional salary what legitimate economic justification is their for treating the second restaurant any differently imagine a grocery store in a small town that offered long time customers a pay nothing option but made it clear that they 'd be subject to social and no longer welcome in the store if they did n't gift 85 of the usual cost of the items the customers would save on sales tax and the grocer would argue that all that money was gifts not income of course this does n't work the irs and the laws do n't care very much about what you call things they care about the underlying economic reality if the money was part of the payment for the services rendered regardless of how it was delivered what the parties called it or whether the obligation to pay was legal or social it 's still a payment for the service and it 's still taxable you would have to be able to argue to the irs that it really was a gift and was n't any form of payment for the service received otherwise it 's just a scheme to evade taxes

so you might be looking at the world of investing after tax deductions are gone buy index funds or a few stable stocks of your choice index funds have minimal turnover so you wo n't realize as many tax events throughout the year the top long term capital gains rate is presently 15 will it go up to 20 soon who knows it might that 's up to congress and obama really if you can control when you realize it say in a year when you do n't have a lot of other income the tax consequences are n't horrible it also helps if you live in a state that does n't tax the gains themselves e.g. not california or buy real estate if you do n't own the house where you live already and your lifestyle permits you should n't expect impressive capital appreciation but you do n't have to pay tax on the imputed rent the rent money you avoid paying by owning the place yourself

i think you will find it hard to do there are money laundering regulations which require you to provide proof of address when opening an account i do n't know for certain if they require an uk address but even if they do n't it 's very likely that individual banks etc will require that i doubt that they will view you as a profitable customer for them since you would not be using the account as your main account although having a job is n't a legal requirement in practice i think it 's the only way you can get an account without having been resident in the country for a while my company employs a significant number of people from abroad and they typically need support from the company to open an account when they first move one thing you could investigate is opening an account with some international bank with branches both in hungary and the uk and asking them to arrange the uk account for you one example of such a bank is hsbc however such banks will typically charge you a significant amount for the privilege for example with hsbc you need a premier account to get this kind of service

gt;i would expect to see more rent with option to buy contract for deed sales when the flipper crowd realizes they need to address the fact that buyers can be found without using banks   provided the sellers can afford to self finance the deals yes   but the plain fact is that a lot of boomers are highly leveraged they may have their name on the title deed of a mcmansion and a couple of vacation homes but these days they all too often hit retirement with significant mortgages on one or more of those properties so the reality is that a lot of them will not be able to sell without getting the bank involved and that number will be sufficient to drive the at the margin prices way down especially in the face of minimal demand

this is more of a long comment but may answer user 's situation too i have dealt with joint mortgages before in 3 states in the us   basically in all three states if one party wants to sell the home goes up for sale   this can be voluntary or it can go up via auction not a great choice in 2 of the 3 states the first person to respond to the court about the property the other party pays all legal fees   yes you read this right   in one case i had an ex who was on my mortgage she had no money invested in the house $ 0 down and still in college with no job   if she was n't on the mortgage i would n't have gotten loan old days of dumb rules when we split her lawyer was using the house as a way to extort other money from me   knowing the state 's laws i already filed a petition for the property but put it on hold with the clerk   meaning that no one else could file but if someone tried mine would no longer be on hold   my ex literally spent thousands of dollars on this attorney and they wanted to sell the house and get half the money from the house   so sale price minus loan amount divided between us   this is the law in almost every state if there is no formal contract   i was laughing because she wanted what would be maybe 50 75 k for paying no rent no money down and me paying for her college finally i broke her attorney down i did n't lawyer up but had many friends who were lawyers advising   after i told her lawyer she was n't getting anything might have said it in not a nice way her lawyer gave me her break down   to paraphrase she said we are going to file now   my assistant is in the court clerk 's office   you can tell the court whatever you want   maybe they will give you a greater percentage since you put the money down and paid for everything but you are taking that chance   but you will pay for your lawyer and you will need one   and you will pay for me the entire time   and this will be a lengthy process   you would be better served to pay my client half now her office was about 2 blocks from court   i laughed at her and simply told her to have her assistant do whatever she wanted   i then left to go to clerk 's office to take the hold off   she had beat me to the office i moved my car out of her garage   by the time i got there she was outside yelling at her assistant throwing a fit and papers were flying everywhere   we settled the next day   she got nothing other than the things she had already stolen from me   if i would n't have known about this loophole my ex would have gotten or cost me through attorney 's fees around 40 50 k for basically hiring a lawyer   my ex did n't really have any money so i am pretty sure lawyer was getting a percent moral of the story in any contract like this you always want to be the one bringing in the least amount of money   there are no laws that i know of in any country where the person with the least amount on a contract will come out worse   like i said in the us the best case scenario that i know of for joint property is that the court pays out the stakeholder all of their contributions then it splits things 50/50   this is given no formal contract that the court   do n't even get me started with hiring attorneys because i have seen the courts throw out so many property contracts it is n't even funny   one piece of advice on a contract if you do one   make it open and about percentages   party a contributes 50 k party b 10 k party a will pay this of mortgage and maintenance and will get this when home is sold   i have found the more specific things are the more loopholes for getting out of them there are goofy ass laws everywhere that make no sense   why would the person first filing get their lawyers paid for   the court systems in almost all countries can have their comical corners    you will never be able to write a contract that covers everything   if the shower handle breaks who pays for it   there is just too many one off things with a house you are in essence getting in a relationship with this person   i hear others say it is a business transaction    no   you are living with this person   there is no way to make it purely business   for you to be happy with this outcome both of you must remain somewhat friends and at the very least civil with each other    to add on to the previous point the biggest risk is this other person 's character and state of mind   they are putting in the most money so you do n't exactly have a huge money risk   you do have a time and a time cost risk   your time or the money you do have in this may be tied up in trying to get your money out or house sold   a jerk could basically say that you get nothing and make you the court system for a couple years to get a few thousand back and that is n't the worst case scenario   always know your worst case scenario   yours is this dude is in love with you   when he figures out 2 3 years later after making you feel uncomfortable the entire time that you are not in love with him he starts going nuts   so he systematically destroys your house   your house worth plummets you want out you ca n't sell the house for price of loan lenders foreclose or look to sue you you pay double rent because you ca n't live with the guy and you have to push a scooter to get to work that is just the worst case scenario   would i do this if i were 25 and had no family   yea why not if i trusted the other person and was friends with them   if it were just a co worker   that is really iffy with me     edit author said he will not be living with the person   so wording can be changed to say potentially in front of living with him in my examples

ordinarily a stock split increases all shareholders share counts so that there is no change in anybody 's voting power   for example if you owned 1 of the company before the split after the split you now have twice as many shares but there are now twice as many shares outstanding so you still own 1 of the company   also stock splits are not ordinarily triggered   usually they happen when the board decides that for one reason or another it 's desirable to increase the number of shares in circulation which causes the price of each share to decrease proportionally    i 'm not familiar with the show and in particular i do n't know what the action is that the character being addressed is thinking of taking but it sounds like they are describing something akin to a poison pill   in these arrangements the pill is triggered by some predefined condition say a party acquiring shares in excess of a defined threshold   what typically happens is that shareholders other than the ones who triggered the pill get a chance to buy shares at a substantial discount thereby diluting the shares of the party that triggered it   because the other shareholders have to buy their additional shares albeit at a discount and because it applies only to certain shares it 's not really a split but it 's close enough that the writers of the show may have felt it was worth using the term that is more familiar to the public

the answer is yes and the reason is if today 's interest rates are lower than the interest rate coupon at which the bond was issued the bond 's lifetime value is 100 cents on the dollar that 's the principal repayment that the investor will get on the maturity date but suppose the bond 's coupon rate is 4 while today 's interest rate is 3 then people who bought the bond at 100 would get 4 on their money while everyone else was getting 3 to compensate a three year bond would have to rise to almost 103 so that the so called yield to maturity would be 3 then there would be a capital loss from almost 103 to 100 that would exactly offset the extra interest that is 1 more for three years if today 's interest rates are negative as they were from time to time in the 1930s and in the present decade the negative interest rates will prevent the buyer from getting the lifetime value as defined by the op of principal plus interest over the original life of the bond this happens in a flight to quality situation where people are willing to take a small capital loss on treasuries in order to prevent a large possible loss from bank failures like those that took place in 2008

so is knowledge of products simply not considered material nonpublic information well material is relative but it certainly is nonpublic information   and trading based on that information would likely be considered illegal if it is actually material    many companies require that employees with material non public info get stock trades approved by their legal department   this protects not only the employee but the employer from sec scrutiny   if the legal department determines that the employee has non public info that is the of the stock trade they might deny the request in many cases these employees receive stock through espp iso and/or rsus and often sell while in possession of information about products just receiving stock as part of as part of a compensation program would not be illegal provided it was part of a normal compensation package and not deliberately awarded in advance of these types of events selling or outright buying stock including rsus with that kind of information would certainly be scrutinized   an employee is granted rsus they vest 7 months before announcement of a new product the employee knows the exact specifications of the product if they sell the vested stock before the announcement would this constitute insider trading or not why the law is not meant to prevent people from investing in their own company just because they know future plans   so knowledge of an announcement 7 months out may not be considered material   if however you sold stock the day or a week before some announcement that caused the stock to fall then that would probably be scrutinized   or if you traded shortly before an announcement of a new revolutionary product that was set to be released in seven months and the stock rose then you might be scrutinized so there is a lot of gray area but remember that the spirit of the law is to prevent people from benefiting unfairly with non public information   it would be hard to prove that gaining on a stock trade 7 months before a product announcement would be considered unfair gain   a lot can happen in that time

this is rather simple if you understand a trailing limit order but to be sure i am going to explain a limit trailing limit and trailing lit order i am going to use an example assuming that you already own a stock and want to sell it limit order i place an order to sell 100 pg this order will only be executed if the bid price of pg is at $ or greater trailing limit order i place an order to sell 100 cat with a trailing 5 this order will be executed when cat drops 5 below the highest point it reaches after you place this order so if you place this order at and the stock drops 5 to $ your order will be executed however if the stock jumps to $ 98 the order will not be executed until the stock falls to $ the sell point will go up with the stock and will always remain at the specified or $ amount behind the high point trailing limit if touched order i place an order to sell 100 intc with a trailing 5 if the stock touches $ 25.00 essentially this is the same as the trailing limit except that it does n't take effect until the stock first gets $ 25.00   i think the page they provide to explain this is confusing because i think they are explaining it from the shorting a stock perspective instead of the selling a stock you want to profit from i could also be wrong in how i understand it my advice would be to either call their customer support and ask for a better explanation or what i do in my finances avoid things i do n't understand

you can negotiate a no penalty for early payment loan with dealerships sometimes dealerships will often give you a better price on the car when you finance through them vs paying cash so you negotiate in a 48 month finance after you 've settled on the price then you negotiate the no penalty for early payment point they 'll be less likely to try to raise the price after you 've already come to an agreement   my dad has said he does this when buying cars but that could just be hearsay and has said he will negotiate on the basis of a long term lease nail down a price then throw that clause in then pay the car off in the first payment   disclaimer um not a great way to do business though if you plan to purchase a new car every 2 3 years from the same dealer do it once and you 'll have a note in their crm not to either a offer price reductions for financing or b offer no penalty early payment financing

beware of surrender charges also surrender charges many annuities    will impose a surrender charge if the annuity is cashed in before a    specific period of time that period may run anywhere from 1 to 12    years a typical surrender charge is one that starts at 7 in the    first year of the contract and declines by 1 per year thereafter    until it reaches zero the charge is made against the value of the    investment when the annuity is and its purpose other    than simply to make money for the insurance company is to discourage    a short term investment by the purchaser for that reason an annuity    should always be considered a long term investment in the typical    fixed annuity though this charge will not apply provided no more    than 10 of the investment is withdrawn per year source if you 've held it for 10 years as you claim you may not owe any or much in surrender charges but you definitely want to know what the situation is before you make a move

this seems like a huge advantage for a roth to the point where i ca n't    figure out why anyone would choose a traditional you are missing something called the time value of money this is the concept that a certain amount of money now has the same value as a bigger amount of money later basically you would n't be willing to give up an amount of money now and get the same amount of money later you need to get a larger amount later to be willing to exchange it for a certain amount now so that larger amount later has the same value to you than that smaller amount now this is the idea behind interest and investment returns when you make an investment and it earns interest or gains over a period of time in effect that final amount of money principal + interest has the same value as the principal when you started because that final amount was grown from the original principal so whether you are taxed on the principal in the beginning as in roth ira or on the principal + interest at the end as in traditional ira you are still taxed on the same value of money and if the tax rates are the same between now and in the future then you pay the same value in taxes in both cases roth would only be better than traditional if the tax rates are lower now than when you take it out and traditional would only be better than roth if the tax rates are higher now than when you take it out let 's consider a simple example to demonstrate that the two are equivalent if the tax rates assuming a flat tax because tax brackets introduce other complications are the same now and when you take it out in both cases you start with $ 1000 pre tax wages you invest it for 10 years in a place with guaranteed 5 returns per year adn then take it out there are no penalties for withdrawal and there is a flat 25 tax now and in the future note that you are left with the same amount of money in both cases this arises from the of multiplication note that roth ira has a higher effective limit than traditional ira because the nominal limit is the same for both but roth is post tax so if you contribute to near the limit where traditional can no longer match the value that roth can contribute then the comparison no longer applies the $ 1000 in this example is below the limit for both

if you are trying to invest in closely held private companies things that do n't trade on the stock market you will run into a variety of regulatory problems for various reasons most private companies only raise funds with accredited investors to be an accredited investor you basically have to have $ 1,000,000 in net worth not including your primary residence or you have to make over $ 200,000 a year for the last two years and expect to keep making that much this is a class distinction the federal government created you will see different but similar wealth and investment classes worldwide so your best most organized opportunities are left out unless you do qualify as an accredited investor there are tons of other companies things you will find locally that will let you invest in their smaller time operations think like a local yoga studio looking for $ 20,000 and willing to split the profits with you but the problem here is lack of accountability where partners skip town or just stop answering your calls and the legal remedies cost you more than your claim that being said there are people that provide capital to smaller publicly traded companies on the bulletin boards and pink sheets they have opportunities do much better than the actual stock market investors in these companies because you can negotiate contracts that let you cash out in their inevitable financing death with very little risk to you you can do these things as an individual or as a holding company but the holding company will limit your liability to the amount your holding company invested instead of your personal assets in case your financing starts to incur liability with the company

as long as you 're not trying to get a higher limit in order to actually spend more money or might be tempted to do so it 's generally advantageous to have a higher limit if available a large part of credit score is based on utilization rate balance due at statement closing divided by credit limit basically you want more than 0 and less than 30 or preferably less than 10 used doubling your credit limit halves your utilization rate and it can be comforting to have it there in case you need it in some sort of emergency scenario caveats there 's no right or default amount of credit that you should have at any given point in your life if you 're using credit responsibly and do n't need more credit there 's no particular reason to ask for more credit if you work at it and are patient it 's easy to eventually have tens of thousands of dollars of unused credit limits but that does n't really get you anywhere you need to be by itself

in general i 'd say yeah if you can pay cash pay cash if you pay cash then by definition you pay zero interest if you get a loan you 'll pay interest most people get a loan to buy a car because they do n't have the cash possible reasons not to pay cash when you could one technically you can pay cash but if you did you would have little or no reserve for emergencies like if the car costs say $ and you have $ in your bank account then technically you could afford to pay cash but you probably should n't because you do n't want to have just $ 10 left what if tomorrow something comes up two arguably you have a place to invest money that pays more than the interest on the loan like say you can get a car loan for whatever the going rate is today say 6 and you know a place to invest your money that is very safe and almost guaranteed to pay 10 it would make sense to borrow to buy the car invest the cash and then withdraw money from the investment to make the payments on the car you 'd end up 4 ahead there are a lot of catches to that strategy though the biggest is that the more the investment pays the more likely that it is risky if you thought the investment would pay 10 but it ends up paying only 4 then you will lose money by this strategy also there 's the psychological element many people say and fully intend to invest their money but then find other things they want to buy and so spend it instead if you pay cash you 're committed

i had a chat with a coworker whose spouse also teaches music lessons one interesting insight was that after raising prices the children were much more likely to come prepared because the parents felt more invested when it cost them more they were also less likely to cancel the lessons at the last minute this is an argument in favor of 's suggestion to charge something even if we donate the income to charity along those lines it might also make sense to give discounts if the child comes prepared having practiced daily   i agree that it 's not a lot of paperwork for some additional pay the problem is that i would also be tempted to buy a new piano and find other expenses to reduce the income that 's a discussion for another day   i think the break even point is probably somewhere around $ when i weigh record keeping time verses the income so as long as we exceed that i will probably encourage her to charge for the lessons even if she charges below the market for them i will consider setting up a charitable giving account that they can pay to instead of paying us directly

as others have pointed out the theoretical prices in each exchange rate are identical however the cost to you may vary you need to work out the opportunity cost of using each of the three currencies because you lose money every time you convert between two currencies let 's supposed for example that you live in canada and earn and spend cad there but also happen to have some hkd to keep this simple i 'll ignore the usd but you can apply the same reasoning to that if you 're not planning on visiting hong kong for a while then your holdings of hkd are just gathering dust so your choices are to convert them to cad and make the gbp purchase in cad or to spend the hkd directly on the gbp purchase probably the first option will end up costing you more in conversion fees than the second but you need to look at the precise costs to verify this if you are planning on visiting hong kong soon and will need the hkd then the choices are somewhat different you can either spend cad on the gbp purchase or you can spend the hkd on the gbp purchase and then soon convert some cad into more hkd for your trip in this case the first option will probably end up costing you less in conversion fees

it is important to remember that the stock price in principle reflects the value of the company so the market cap should drop upon issuance of the the dividend however the above reasoning neglects to consider taxes which make the question a bit more interesting the key fact is that different investors are going to get taxed on the dividend to varying degrees ranging from 20 for qualified dividends in the usa for a high income individual in a taxable account and even worse for non qualified dividends to 0 for tax exempt nonprofits retirement accounts and low income individuals the high tax investors are going to be a bit averse to paying tax on that dividend whereas the tax free investors are not hence in a tax rational market the tax free investors are going to be the ones buying right before a dividend and the tax paying investors will be buying right afterwards tax exempt investors could in principle make some amount of money buying dividends to keep them off the tax paying investors books   of course the strategy could backfire if too many people did it all at once that said the tax payers have the tax disincentive to prevent them from fully exploiting the opposite strategy of selling just before a dividend   in particular they are subject to capital gains tax when they sell at a profit unless they have enough compensating capital losses and it is to their after tax profit to defer taxation by not trading that said the stock market has well known irrationality when it comes to considering tax consequences so logic based on assumed rationality of the market does not always apply to the extent one would expect    the foremost example of tax irrationality is the so called dividend paradox which basically states that corporations should favor stock buybacks or perhaps loan repayment to the complete exclusion of dividends because capital gains are taxed less harshly than dividends in a variety of ways some of which are subtle 1 historically although not currently in the usa for qualified dividends the tax rate was higher for dividends   in canada for example dividends are taxed at twice the rate of capital gains 2 if you die holding appreciated stock then you meaning your heirs completely escape us the capital gains tax on the accrual during your lifetime 3 capital gains tax can be deferred by simply not selling   in comparison to dividends this is roughly equivalent to getting a tax free loan from the government which is invested for profit and paid at a later date after inflation has eaten away at the real value of the loan   for example if all your stock investments increase by but you sell every year in a high tax bracket situation you 're total after tax return will be only 8 per year   in contrast if you hold the same investments for many many years and then sell your total return will be nearly 10 per year because you only pay 20 once at the end 4 a capital gain can often be by a capital loss in another stock so that no tax results   if you loose money on a stock that is paying dividends you 're still going to have to pay tax on that dividend   there are companies that borrow money to pay out that taxable dividend each quarter which seems like gross tax malpractice on the part of the cfo if the dividend paradox does n't make sense first consider the case that you owned all the shares of a company   it would n't matter to you at all on a pre tax basis whether you got a $ 1000 company buyback or a $ 1000 dividend because after the buyback dividend you 'd still own the entire company and $ 1000   the number of shares would be reduced but that you owned fewer shares after the buyback would be like saying you have become shorter if your height is measured in inches rather than of course in the case of many shareholders you can get burned by failing to sell into the buyback when the share price is too high but that is another matter

debt you it weighs you down and keeps you from living your life the way you want   debt prevents you from accomplishing your goals limits your ability to do what you want have what you want and be who you want to be it your opportunities and your charity as you said   graduated in may from school   student loans are coming due here in january   bought a new car recently the added monthly expenses have me concerned that i am budgeting my money correctly awesome congratulations   you need to develop a plan to repay the student loans   buying a new car before you have planned you budget may have been premature i currently am spending around 45 50 of my monthly to cover all    my expenses and living the left over is pretty discretionary but things    like eating dinner outside the house and expenses that are abnormal would    come out of this   my question is what percentage is a safe amount to be    committing to expenses on a monthly basis great   plan 40 50 for essentials and decide to spend under 20 30 for lifestyle   be frugal here and you could allocate 30 40 for financial priorities budget create a budget divided into three broad categories control your spending and your life goals a goal is a dream with a plan organize your goals into specific items with timelines and steps to progress to your goals you should have three classes of goals what you want to have what you want to do and who you want to be ask yourself what is important to you then establish a timeline to achieve each goal   you should place specific goals or steps into three time blocks near under 3 6 months medium under 12 months and long under 24 months   it is ok to have longer term plans but establish steps to get to those goals and place those steps under one of these three timeframes example good advice i have heard includes keeping housing costs under 25 keeping vehicle costs under 10 and paying off debt quickly   some advise 10 20 for financial priorities but i prefer 30 40   if you put 10 toward retirement for now save 10 20 and pay 10 20 toward debt you should make good progress on your student loans

i 'd recommend you use an online tax calculator to see the effect it will have to your comment with @littleadv there 's fmv agreed but there 's also a rate below that one that 's a bit lower than fmv but it 's a discount for a tenant who will handle certain things on their own i had an arm 's length tenant who was below fmv i literally never met him but our agreement through a realtor was that for any repairs i was not required to arrange or meet fmv is not a fixed number but a bit of a range   if this is your first rental you need to be aware of the requirement to take depreciation simply put you separate your cost into land and house the house value gets depreciated by i.e. you divide the value by 27.5 and that 's taken as depreciation each year you may break even on cash flow the rent paying the mortgage property tax etc but the depreciation might still produce a loss this is n't optional it flows to your tax return and is limited to $ 25k yr further if your adjusted gross income   is over $ 100 k the allowed loss is phased out over the next $ 50 k of income i.e. each $ 1000 of agi reduces the allowed loss by $ 500 the losses you ca n't take are carried forward until you use them to offset profit each year or sell the property   if you offer numbers you 'll get a more detailed answer but this is the general overview in general if you are paying tax you are doing well running a profit even after depreciation

high frequency trades are intra day the would buy a stock for 100 and sell for multiple times so if you start with 100 in your broker account you buy something it takes 2 3 days to settle you sell for it takes 2 3 days to settle you again buy something for 100 it is the net value of both buys and sells that you need to look at trading on margin accounts most brokers offer margin accounts the exact leverage ratios varies what this means is that if you start with 10 or 15 or 25 in your broker you can buy stock of 100 of course legally you wo nt own the stock unless you pay the broker balance etc

working for a lot of startups i have seen this cycle really it has little to do with making the ipo look good because of number of employees and is more about making the ipo look good because of planning for the future many times an ipo is released it will be valued at $ 1.00 made up and the market will soar and spike now stock shares are valued at $ 3.00 great till after the dust settles a bit and stocks are valued at $   this is normal and good   it would be better if the stocks ended a little higher than their initial value but such is life   now the initial value of the stock is made up of basically the value of the company 's assets and employees are part of those assets and its earning power they are also a liability but that has less impact on initial value than assets sales right after ipo are based on how well a company will do part of that is growth so it looks nicer to say we have 500 employees and have been growing by 20 per month than to say we have 100 employees in other words before ipo employees may be hired to make the company look like it is growing they may be hired because the budget is projected based on expected growth and expected valuation   after ipo you get a concrete number you have your budget it may be more than you thought or it may be less in our example the real budget from capital is only 28 of the entire projected budget and 85 of the initial value it 's time to make some budget cuts   also normally there is a period of adjustment company wide as a company goes from vc funding here have as much money as you want to real world funding with stricter limits and less wiggle room

in general insurance payouts you receive in compensation for damage to your vehicle are not taxable income see for instance this nolo page however i do n't see how that is related to your three bullet points about how your sister should buy her car   you can transfer the money to her in any way that 's convenient to both of you   whether the dealership will accept cash is something you 'll have to ask them about but my impression is most dealers are eager to accept cash as long as the car you are getting from her is not worth substantially more than the $ 8500 you 're giving her i do n't see that you 'll be in trouble income tax wise   as mentioned in the question you linked to you can give each other up to $ 14k per year tax free   so if you give her a $ 8500 and she gives you a car worth roughly the same amount no problem   if you actually do it as a sale even better since then the only amount that will count as a gift to either of you is whatever one party gets above and beyond the fair value of the car   that is if the car is worth $ 10000 but she sells it to you for $ 8500 she effectively gave you a gift of $ 1500 in car value   if it 's worth $ 7000 but she sells it to you for $ 8500 you gave her a gift of $ 1500 in cash as rocky pointed out in a comment if you do a sale it may be subject to sales tax depending on what state you 're in   in practice it is very common for people to not deal with sales tax in informal transactions like this between family members but you do owe it if your state 's laws require it and the state could theoretically come after you for it another edit i see from your comment you are in michigan   according to this page from the michigan secretary of state no tax is due if you purchase a vehicle from an immediate family member   so you would not owe sales tax if you do it as a sale

the price of a company 's stock at any given moment is established by a ratio of buyers to sellers   when the sellers outnumber the buyers at a given price the stock price drops until there are enough people willing to buy the stock to balance the equation again   when there are more people wanting to purchase a stock at a given price than people willing to sell it the stock price rises until there are enough sellers to balance things again   so given this it 's easy to see that a very large fund or collection of very large funds buying or selling could drive the price of a stock in one direction or another because the sheer number of shares they trade can tip the balance one way or another    what 's important to keep in mind though is that the ratio of buyers to sellers at any given moment is determined by market sentiment and speculation   people selling a stock think the price is going down and people buying it think it 's going up and these beliefs are strongly influenced by news coverage and available information relating to the company   so in the case of your company in the example that would be expected to triple in value in the next year if everyone agreed that this was correct then the stock would triple almost instantly   the only reason the stock does n't reach this value instantly is that the market is split between people thinking this is going to happen and people who think it wo n't    over time news coverage and new information will cause one side to appear more correct than the other and the balance will shift to drive the price up or down   all this is to say that yes large funds and their movements can influence a stock 's trading value but their movements are based upon the same news information analysis and sentiment as the rest of the market   meaning that the price of a stock is much more closely tied to news and available information than day to day trading volumes   in short buying good companies at good prices is just as good as it 's ever been    also keep in mind that the fact that you can buy and sell stocks without having a huge impact on price is an advantage that you have   by slipping in or out at the right times in major market movements you can do things that a massive investment fund simply can not

most bond etfs have switched to monthly dividends paid on the first of each month in an attempt to standardize across the market   for etfs but perhaps not bond mutual funds as suggested in the above answer interest does accrue in the nav so the price of the fund does drop on ex date by an amount equal to the dividend paid a great example of this dynamic can be seen in a bond etf holding floating rate corporate bonds   as you can see in this screenshot the nav has followed a sharp up and down pattern almost like the teeth of a saw this is explained by interest accruing in the nav over the course of each month until it is paid out in a dividend dropping the nav sharply in one day the effect has been particularly pronounced recently because the floating coupon payments have increased significantly benchmark interest rates are higher and mark to market changes in credit spreads of the constituent bonds have been very muted

how to use your shares if you own common shares in a company as opposed to a fund then you have the right but not the obligation to one vote per share on questions put before the shareholders usually this occurs once a year usually these questions regard approval of auditors sometimes they involve officers such as directors on the board you will be mailed a form to fill out and mail back in   preferred shares usually are not voting shares but common shares always are   by the way i do not recommend owning shares in companies i recommend funds instead either etfs or mutual funds owning shares in companies puts you at risk of a failure of that company owning funds spreads that risk around thus reducing your exposure   there are really two purposes for owning shares 1 owning shares gives you the right to declared dividends 2 owning shares allows you to sell those shares at some time in the future hopefully at a profit   one obscure thing you can do with owned shares is to write sell covered put options but options are not something that you need to concern yourself with at this point   you may find it useful to sign up for a free daily email from

at first this seems like it makes sense assuming like you say in your question that you are perfectly confident in your ability to repay even if you need to pay the balance in full if you lose your job then this seems like a guaranteed 4 return and a reasonable part of your retirement portfolio where it falls apart though is that you 're paying yourself you 're just taking the money out of one pocket and putting it in another so really you 're getting a guaranteed 0 return you 're losing the compounding growth of the loan amount while it 's out of your accounts and the fact that you can afford the 4 interest means you could have been putting that into a requirement account as well aside from the loan so it does n't really count as interest in the sense that your money is passively making money for you so ultimately no it should n't count as part of your bond allocation

i 'd contact paypal to request clarification   in the meantime most banks will credit outgoing transfers immediately but process later and only debit incoming after it passes through a processing team so while the money will go out right away it may take a few days for your bank to actually process the withdrawal and the subsequent reversal from paypal in reality paypal does n't usually recieve the money immediately either but they extend you credit to speed up things either way it does n't hurt to contact paypal to make sure they have reverted the amount to your bank and if they confirm such you can also reach out to your bank and ask where the money is stuck usually delays like this will happen in the interface between two unrelated financial institutions

you could but the bank wo n't let you if you 're a sole proprietor then you could probably open a personal account and just use it and never tell them that is actually a business however depending on your volume of operations they may switch you on their own to business account by the pattern of your transactions for corporations you can not use a personal account since the corporation is a separate legal entity that owns the funds also you 're generally required to separate corporate and personal funds to keep the limited liability protection which is why you have the corporation to begin with generally business accounts have much higher volumes and much more transactions than personal accounts and it costs more for the banks to run them in the us some banks offer free or very low cost business accounts for small businesses that do n't need too many transactions i 'm sure if you shop around you 'll find those in canada as well

geez man you 're cutting it close to the end of the semester to be at the research stage of your project   i normally frown on posts that say lol do my project for me but i know a bit about this subject and want to share   i 'm going to focus mostly on the b2b segment here because that 's what i know many companies are n't spending as much as they used to on it products or the staff to support them they 're also looking for ways to be more productive with their budgets the consumer market is spending a lot less and is demanding products that dell ca n't make as much money on   the big things right now are the cloud virtualization and   so right now the cloud is the buzzword lots of companies are moving their stuff offsite letting someone else worry about major it infrastructure this typically costs the company less in both hardware and personnel costs companies still need a onsite presence for critical applications data and backup but they need a lot less than what was necessary 5 years ago   network have grown in scale and many metropolitan areas can now support this type of computing   you also have virtualization which means you can run multiple servers on one physical server what used to take up an entire rack years ago can now be run on a few servers   this means companies need less of the it equipment dell makes in order to grow and expand   all that means less of a demand for traditional it equipment computers and servers and more of a demand for the proper software    i see dell moving more towards personal devices and larger enterprise equipment amp servers personal devices include tablets laptops phones compact pcs the business side includes high density servers storage software and services the of computer hardware along with the cloud will allow users to access their desktop and programs from anywhere and dell will be providing products to access the cloud servers will have of memory and a large number of systems with of memory already exist but the cost is prohibitive for most companies these systems will be used to support a business needs through virtualization or provide users with the cloud dell has acquired a few software companies over the years and will most likely acquire more amp may offer software for cloud computing it management and possibly probably not virtualization   over the past few years the desktop pc market has been shrinking as and new devices have been released   they still have a long way to go but someday they will largely replace the pc in homes and businesses especially as costs come down    also dell may see lots more money from government and healthcare in the next few years   the government may choose to spend even more money than they do now on infrastructure and projects to help get us out of the recession those projects will need it resources   same goes for healthcare as the new healthcare laws go into effect they will need more it resources to get the job done   source me i 've worked in the it industry for the past 9 years the majority of our business is with dell products if you need more details about me send me message   also please do n't just copy paste my information   i 'm giving you some ideas go look them up learn about them research them   college is about learning and one of the points of this project is to expand your knowledge about a subject   tl;dr due to new technology people and companies will be buying less margins will be thinner dell will probably focus on new markets   edit after going through some of your posts it seems like you are in the it industry as well so i 'm confused and you may already know most of this information

from the way you frame the question it sounds like you more or less know the answer already yes you can make a non deductable contribution to a traditional ira and convert it to a roth ira here is wikipedia 's explanation regardless of income but subject to contribution limits contributions can be made to a traditional ira and then converted to a roth this allows for backdoor contributions where individuals are able to avoid the income limitations of the roth ira there is no limit to the frequency with which conversions can occur so this process can be repeated indefinitely one major caveat to the entire backdoor roth ira contribution process however is that it only works for people who do not have any pre tax contributed money in ira accounts at the time of the backdoor conversion to roth conversions made when other ira money exists are subject to pro rata calculations and may lead to tax liabilities on the part of the converter 9 do note the caveat in the second paragraph this article explains it more thoroughly the irs does not allow to specify which dollars are being converted as they can with shares of stock being sold for the purposes of determining taxes on conversions the irs considers a person ’s non roth ira money to be a single co sum hence if a person has any funds in any non roth ira accounts it is impossible to contribute to a traditional ira and then convert that account to a roth ira as suggested by various pundits and the wikipedia piece referenced above conversions must be performed on a pro rata basis of all ira money not on specific dollars or accounts say you have $ 20k of pre tax assets in a traditional ira and make a non deductable contribution of $ 5k the account is now 80 pre tax assets and 20 post tax assets so if you move $ 5k into a roth ira $ 4k of it would be taxed in the conversion the traditional ira would be left with $ 16k of pre tax assets and $ 4k of post tax assets

if you are looking for a simple formula or buying order strategy to guarantee a lower buying price unfortunately this does not exist   otherwise all investors would employ this strategy and the financial markets would no longer have an validity aka arbitrage   buying any investment contains a certain level of risk other than us treasuries of course having said that there are many option buying strategies that can employed to help increase your ror or hedge an existing position   most of these strategies are based a predicted future direction of a stock on the investor 's part   for example you hold the ford stock and feel they are releasing their earnings report next week   you feel that they will not meet investors expectations   you do n't want to sell your shares but what you can do is buy put options   if the stock does indeed go down then you make money on your put options here is a document on options   it is moderately technical but very good if you want a good introduction on the subject   the strategy that i described above is on pg 33

you 're not responsible for the mortgages on the property those are agreements between the lender and the borrower the risk you have is that the title search missed something   if the seller i.e. the bank or banks who foreclosed did not have full rights to sell the property and there was another party who had a lien on the property or had an interest in it in some fashion that party could make a claim that would interfere with your purchase   you would n't be responsible for the loan but you might not end up with the title to the property if that happened

i would n't go quite that far     it 's formatted and not written i 'll give you that   i 'd guess it 's written by someone who believes they they have a flair for and the dramatic and writes as they would talk   assume amy hoy is a slightly awkward gal at you and this all seems a little more tolerable     but i find her points somewhat solid     i think she 's presenting from a ideological standpoint where safety and security are paramount and the risk associated with startups is too much risk   but i think the point that s he 's making about the poisonous rhetoric associated with glorious death and working for a startup being very similar is well thought out and quite an interesting perspective   i go to a school whose idea of business is entrepreneurship   i left their business program because my career goals simply can not be sustained by entrepreneurship until a very long while into my career and i found the here 's how to have a startup focus of the bulk of the courses essentially valueless to me where i am now     having seen what the author refers to as the of successful startups great word by the by i can not help but those courses and the ways we were sold on this ideology     much was made about how much money was made by successful startups   much was made of the independence the power the glory of winning the startup lotto and making it big   the guys that did it young were and lauded as the greatest of our generation     no mention was made of the failures   no mention was made of the failure rate   no mention was made of the costs associated with failure   no mention was made of the people who got fucked as these entrepreneurial saints made their fortunes     further the ones that got the most attention were the ones who went back and did it a few more times   anyone clever who won big and cashed out and quit while ahead was mentioned as a success but their retirement or cashing out went   some sort of shameful detail maybe     the guys that won big and went back and tried again were praised for their determination and   if they set themselves back to square one betting on an unsuccessful attempt that was     vcs were praised as the greatest thing that happened to entrepreneurship   we were given no real warnings about hey those contracts can be kinda shady sometimes or they want a big cut yo instead they were the grease to our machine   it was a money making machine   a machine of winners   of the great men and women of our generation   of everything that is good about western society     and we are letting our generation down if we do n't play     seriously     i had a prof tear a strip off a kid for asking something along the lines of but what 's wrong with working for a company that already exists and can pay a steady wage   the prof got started in on how our generation is and just fall into things and accomplish little on our own   he moved into how it 's merely riding someone else 's and it 's not really achieving anything for yourself   the tl;dr of what was a fifteen minute in class of a student who asked what i thought was a reasonable question was if you 're not signing your own you are a huge failure and are contributing nothing of note to society or it 's progress     this particular rant pretty much sealed my withdrawal from the business aspect of my school   if my very goals render me a huge failure in my profs eyes i 'm not interested in what they have to say or in contributing to their employment at the university     but off that somewhat personal tangent the culture of glory of the startup that amy hoy somewhat complains about in her article certainly exists   in the form she 's complaining about     your rebuttal makes sense too it 's not that vc are or are n't a risk it 's not that people do n't have the right and the opportunity to take that risk if they see it as a valid opportunity to make money it 's not like it 's fair to expect a vc to fund you without seeing a profit in the long run     but you 're her thesis with something that does n't actually address it     the culture that she 's complaining about exists in my experience the culture glosses over so much of what you her article with that risks exist and that failures exist and that there are a lot of harsh realities associated with the startup world   the culture does indeed all the best parts of startup dom and creates a toughness challenge that renders no this may not be a good idea because failure are personal while successes are cultural    successful startups and people who have done very well by them are held up as everything startups are supposed to be and look at how their hard work paid off and if yours does n't work it is entirely that you did n't work hard enough   someone who has bought in wholesale holds that there are no bad startups any startup can be successful you just need to bust balls working harder if you fail     startups are akin to gambling   they 're not the roulette of it 's all luck but closer to five card skill plays a lot of a role but there 's still luck involved     startup culture represents all this as far closer to texas hold em where luck in minimized where skill and diligence play the greatest role   it assumes that everyone going in already knows all the things you brought up in your rebuttal without ever actually giving them that information   it keeps just work harder without really saying hey guys check the odds you 're playing with and know when to hold and when to

the comments section to dilip 's reply is overflowing   first the op is correct in that credit scoring has become a game a series of data points that predicts default probability but of course offers little chance to explain why you applied for 3 loans all refinancing to save money on home or rentals got new credit cards to get better rewards and have your average time with accounts drop like a rock well i canceled the old cards   the data does n't dig that deep   to discuss the spend more with plastic phenomenon i have no skin in the game i do n't sell credit card services so if the answer is yes you spend more with cards i 'll accept that here 's my issue the studies are all contrived give college students $ 10 cash and $ 10 gift cards and send them into the cafeteria cute but it produces no meaningful data i can tell you that when i give my old $ 20 cash it gets spent very wisely a $ 20 starbucks card and she 's treating friends and family to lattes no study needed the result is immediate and obvious any study worth looking at would first separate the population into two groups those who pay in full each month and those who carry a balance then these two groups would need to be to study their behavior if they went all cash not a simply survey and not cheap to get a study of the number of people you need for meaningful data i 've read quotes where the david claimed that card users spend 10 more than cash users while i accept that 's concern is valid that he may spend more with cards than cash there is no study that i can find which correlates to a percentage result as all studies appear to be contrived with small amounts to spend   as far as playing the game goes i can charge gas my cable bill and a few other things whose dollar amounts ca n't change regardless unless you 're convinced i 'll gas up and go joy riding last i 'd love to see any link in the comments to a meaningful study quotes where conclusions are stated but no data or methodology do n't add much to the discussion   edit do you spend more with cash or credit is an article by a fellow personal finance blogger his conclusion is subjective of course but along the same path that i 'm on with this analysis
