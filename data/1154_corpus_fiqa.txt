you should write a demand letter immediately send the letter by certified mail and then wait 30 days here is a sample demand letter for the state of california that you can send it seems like most of the demand letters assumed that you tried to cash the check and incurred a service fee personally i would n't risk incurring even most cost instead after 30 days i would take him to small claims court and show all the evidence you have checks receipts and letters of correspondence

check is an obligation to pay and is in the us checks do n't expire there are countries where they do endorsements such as void after x days are meaningless and do n't affect the obligation to pay the bank is under no obligation to honor a check that is more than 6 months old based on the date on the check of course this is from the unified commercial code 4 404 however this refers to the bank not to the person who gave you the check the bank may pay if the check is deposited in good faith and there 's nothing wrong with it or with the account so the first thing you can do is deposit the check if asked you can say that the person just wrote the wrong date which is true worst case the check bounces if the check bounces you can start with demand letters and small claim courts the obligation to pay does n't go away unless satisfied i.e. paid

find smaller payments he can make maybe a of each client he takes payment from   consult with a lawyer or google buisness contract elements and find fill them out and see what he can do if the checks are no good bouncing them is n't going to help anything nor is getting a judgment from a small claims court he can still not stays on his credit for 25 years file for bankruptcy etc

pink sheets is not a stock exchange per se and securities traded through it are not as safe as the ones on a stock exchange regulated by sec many companies are traded there because they failed to comply with the sec regulations or are bankrupt or do n't want the level of reporting to the public that the sec regulations require since you 're talking about an adr of a company traded on lse it might be much safer that other regular securities but still it means that you 're buying an unregulated security even if it is of a company regulated elsewhere notice the volume of trades mere thousands of dollars per day in a good day in some days there are no trades at all it makes it harder to sell the security when needed why not buying at lse

sounds like a poorly written piece at best the way you make money with a mortgage if you 're careful and/or lucky and/or patient is to use that loan to make leveraged investments if the return on the investments is higher than the interest on the loan you win of course if the investments do n't do well you can lose money on this deal but at current interest rates it is n't that hard to make a profit on this arrangement especially if you can get the tax deductability helping you

my entrepreneurship prof said that in most cases if you really believe in your product idea and it is differentiated from what exists already you can afford to have someone steal your idea and try to make a go of it because you should still be able to do a much better job of it than they can and their heart is nt in it the way yours is    i think ultimately it really depends on the product though you definitely do n't want to try going 2nd to market against someone with superior resources unless you can 100 beat their version of the product by a good margin either on price or quality and hopefully both and you can scale up quickly

its been years since i lived there but i found seattle to be pretty expensive   housing costs seem out of line with expected salaries   coming from puerto rico you might be shocked how expensive it is to live there and also how infrequently you see the sun your question is highly subjective   one person would need 100 k to cover those things you are talking about while others would need less then   also where you live in the seattle area makes a difference   will you be in or   housing costs vary considerably one nice thing about that part of the country is can be very inexpensive to vacation   a fishing license a packed lunch and a bit of gas is all that is necessary to really enjoy that part of the country    back in the day i used to ski steven 's pass during the week and the lift tickets were a 1/3 of the weekend rate   having hiking camping gear and or a bicycle is also a good way to enjoy life bottom line i would make a budget and go from there   if you intend on retiring in pr then you would need a lot less then if you choose to remain in seattle so even that is subjective perfect example which is way out of town so a commute would be a problem   however unlike many parts south of seattle it is safe and nice   k for a 1200 sq ft home   holy cow    here in orlando figure about 130 k for the same home with less of a commute   and you will see the sun more than 5 days per year

tldr   why ca n't banks give me my money we do n't have your money who has my money about half a dozen different people all over the world and we need to coordinate with them and their banks to get you your money i love how everyone seems to think that the securities industry has super powers   believe me even with t+3 you wo n't believe how many trades fail to settle properly   yes your trade is pretty simple but cash equity trades in general can be very complicated for the layman   your sell order will have been pushed onto an algorithmic platform aggregated with other sell order and crossed with internal buy orders the surplus would then be split out by the algo to try and get the best price based on orders on the market   finally the fills are used in settlement which could potentially have been filled in multiple trades against multiple counterparties in order to guarantee that the money can be in your account we need 3 days also remember we are n't just looking at your transaction each bank is looking to square off all the different trades between all their counter parties over a single day thousands of transactions fills may have to be processed just for a single name finally because there a many many transactions that do not settle automatically our settlements team needs to co with the other bank to make sure that you get your money bear in mind banks being banks we are working with systems that are older than i am and all of the above is the simplest case i have n't even factored in dark pools block trades auctions pre post market trading sessions foreign exchange derivatives kyc aml

putting middlemen into the equation is never going to reduce costs but this is what the u.s. did in the 1970s when they made it much easier for new to be established and grow now the middlemen insurance companies and their paid political have almost the market to death and they have no incentive to release their death grip because the status quo is profitable for them the only way out is the single payer solution and everyone business government individuals benefits from this except the middlemen and their bought and paid for representative politicians   this situation of barely functional health care in the u.s. is the perfect example of what happens when politicians are manipulated to make policy based on who gives them the most money and until the money profit element is removed from governance it is only going to get worse   wealth as free speech yelling fire in a packed theater is free speech too but we do n't allow it and for good reason

congratulations on getting married   as far as the irs is concerned you are a married couple for all of this year for tax purposes the 2014 hsa contribution limit for you and your husband together is $   this limit applies to both of you together whether you file jointly or separately   so it looks like you and your husband have excess contributions this year   you 'll need to withdraw some contributions either in your account or your husband 's account to get under $ total for the year if you choose to take this money out of your account since you have already spent this money out of your hsa you wo n't actually receive a check from the withdrawal   instead the money that you have already spent will be from a normal hsa medical distribution to an excess contribution withdrawal   when you get your 1099-sa form from your hsa bank at tax time the distributions will be coded as excess contributions distributions   in addition the form will include the amount of any earnings interest that you received on your excess contributions at tax time you 'll need to examine your w-2 form from your employer closely   if the form does not include the amount that the employer hsa contribution in your taxable income you 'll need to add this amount as other income on your taxes   you 'll also need to include any earnings on the excess contributions reported on the 1099-sa since your husband funds his own hsa and does n't have any employer contributions to it you might find it easier to withdraw the excess contributions from his hsa instead of yours   to do this you need to tell his hsa bank that the withdrawal is an excess contribution withdrawal so that it gets reported correctly on his 1099-sa   there wo n't be any changes to his w-2 and the only other income he 'll need to report is any earnings on the excess contributions from his 1099-sa the instructions for form 8889 line 13 explain what to do in the event of an excess contribution note the text here is from the 2013 version of the instructions line 13 if you or someone on your behalf or your employer contributed more to your hsa than is allowable you may have to pay an additional tax on the excess contributions figure the excess contributions using the following instructions see form 5329 additional taxes on qualified plans including iras and other tax favored accounts to figure the additional tax excess contributions you make to figure your excess contributions including those made on your behalf subtract your deductible contributions line 13 from your actual contributions line 2 however you can withdraw some or all of your excess contributions for 2013 and they will be treated as if they had not been contributed if you make the withdrawal by the due date including extensions of your 2013 tax return but see the note under excess employer contributions later you do not claim a deduction for the amount of the withdrawn contributions and you also withdraw any income earned on the withdrawn contributions and include the earnings in other income on your tax return for the year you withdraw the contributions and earnings excess employer contributions excess employer contributions are the excess if any of your employer 's contributions over your limitation on line 8 if you made a qualified hsa funding distribution line 10 during the tax year reduce your limitation line 8) by that distribution before you determine whether you have excess employer contributions if the excess was not included in income on form w-2 you must report it as other income on your tax return however you can withdraw some or all of the excess employer contributions for 2013 and they will be treated as if they had not been contributed if you make the withdrawal by the due date including extensions of your 2013 tax return but see the following note you do not claim an exclusion from income for the amount of the withdrawn contributions and you also withdraw any income earned on the withdrawn contributions and include the earnings in other income on your tax return for the year you withdraw the contributions and earnings there are further instructions on what to do if you do n't take care of this until a future year but it is much better and easier if you take care of this before the end of this year and handle it correctly on your tax return i believe that this is how it will all work however you 'll want to confirm all of this with someone who knows what they are talking about and can look at your individual situation   hopefully this answer gives you enough information to be able to ask the right questions

just skimming through the wikipedia article on i notice there is more to the story than simply 's ipo failed so they postponed it and did it anyways 3 points to keep in mind about ipos   1 an ipo is the mechanism for taking a private company and setting it up for shares to be owned by the public   2 the process of selling shares to the public often allows original owners and/or early investors to cash out most countries including member nations of the eu limit some transactions like pre ipo companies to accredited investors   3 selling shares to the public also can allow the company to access more funds for growth this is particularly important in a capital intensive business like an airline new costs > $ new costs > $ 105 m usd   ultimately the question of a successful ipo depends on how you define success initially there was a lot of concern that the ipo was set up with too much focus on goal 2 allowing the management owners to cash out   it looks like the first approach was not meeting good opinions in the market during 2006 a major concern was that the initial approach focused on management only cashing out its shares and no money actually going to the company to support its future   the investment bankers restructured the ipo including the issuance of more new shares so that more $ could end up in the company 's accounts not just in the accounts of the management   if anything it 's still a pretty successful ipo given that the shares were successfully listed the company collected the money it needed to invest and grow and the management still cashed out

assuming that a couple big players are making the majority of money in the stock market which is true it is logical to assume that most smaller players are losing    for example if one big hedge fund makes 20 a year   it means either 20 funds lost 1 or 5 funds lost 4 and etc    assuming that the economy is not drastically getting much better stocks are a zero sum game therefore the couple of funds with the most resources will be taking from the people that are n't as advanced or taking a chance

i would think that a lot of brokers would put the restriction suggested in in place or something more restrictive so that 's the first line of answer if you did get assigned on your short option then i think the t+3 settlement rules would matter for you   basically you have 3 days to deliver   you 'll get a note from your broker demanding that you provide the stock and probably threatening to liquidate assets in your account to cover their costs if you do n't comply   if you still have the long leg of the calendar spread then you can obtain the stock by exercising your long call or if you have sufficient funds available you can just buy the stock and keep your long call   if you 're planning to exercise the long call to cover the position then you need to check with your broker to see how quickly the stock so obtained will get credited to your account since it also has some settlement timeline   it 's possible that you may not be able to get the stock quickly enough especially if you act on day 3 note that this is why you must buy the call with the far date   it is your insurance against a big move against you and getting assigned on your short call at a price that you can not cover with the ira you have some additional concerns over regular cash account namely you can not freely contribute new cash any time that you want   that means that you have to have some coherent strategy in place here that ensures you can cover your obligations no matter what scenario   usually brokers put additional restrictions on trades within iras just for this reason finally in the cash account and assuming that you are assigned on your short call you could potentially could get hit with a good faith cash liquidation or free riding violation when your short call is assigned depending on how you deliver the stock and other things that you 're doing in the same account   there are other questions on that on this site and lots of information online   the rules are n't super simple so i wo n't try to reproduce them here   some related questions to those rules an external reference also on potential violations in a cash account

i completely agree with pete that a 401(k loan is not the answer but i have an alternate proposal reduce your 401(k contribution down to the 4 that you get a match on   if you are cash poor now and have debts to be cleaned up those need to be addressed before retirement savings   you 'll have plenty of time to make up the lost savings after you get the debts paid off    if your company matches 50 meaning you have to contribute 8 to get the 4 match then consider temporarily stopping your 401(k altogether a 100 match is very hard to give up but a 50 match is less difficult   you have plenty of years left ahead of you to make up the lost match   plus the pain of knowing you 're leaving money on the table will incentivize you to get the loans paid as quickly as possible   it seems to me that i would be reducing middle to high interest debt while also saving myself $ 150 per month   no you 'd be deferring $ 150 per month for an additional two years and not reducing debt at all just moving it to a different lender interest rate is not your problem   right now you 're paying less than $ 30 per month in interest on these 3 loans and about $ 270 in principal and at the current rate should have them paid off in about 2 years   you 're wanting to extend these loans to 4 years by borrowing from your retirement savings    i would buckle down reduce expenses wherever possible cable cell phone coffee movies restaurants until you get these debts paid off   you make $ 70,000 per year or almost $ 6,000 per month   i bet if you try hard enough you can come up with $ 1,100 fairly quickly then the next $ 1,200 should come twice as fast then attack the next $ 4,000 you can argue whether the $ 1,200 should come first because of the interest rate but in the end it does n't matter either one should be paid off very quickly so the interest saved is negligible maybe you can get one of them paid off get yourself some breathing room then loosen up a little bit but extending the pain for an additional two years is not wise some more drastic measures

agree with randy if debt and debt reduction was all about math nobody would be in debt   it is an emotional game if you 've taken care of the reasons you 're in debt changed your behaviors then start focusing on the math of getting it done faster    otherwise if you do n't have a handle on the behaviors that got you there you 're just going to get more rope to hang yourself with   i.e. makes sense to take a low interest home equity loan to pay off high interest credit card debt but more likely than not you 'll just re rack up the debt on the cards because you never fixed the behavior that put you into debt same thing here if you opt not to contribute to pay off the cards without fixing the debt accumulating behaviors what you 're going to do is stay in debt and not provide for retirement take the match until you 're certain you have your debt accumulation habits in check

assuming be a taxable account and you 're an above average wage earner the following seem to be biggest factors in your decision tax advantaged income w/o retirement account protection so i 'd pick a stock stocks or fund that 's designed to minimize earnings taxable at income and/or short term gains rates e.g. dividends declining risk profile make sure you periodically tweak your investment mix over the 2 3 year period   to reduce your risk exposure    you want to be near savings account risk levels by the end of your timeline   but make sure you keep 1 in mind so probably do n't adjust by selling anything until you 've hit the 1-year holding mark to get the long term capital gains rates in addition to tax sensitive stock bond funds at the major brokerages like fidelity i 'd specifically look at tax free municipal bond funds targeted for your state of residence since those generally pay better than savings on after tax basis for little increase in risk assuming you stick w/ higher rated municipalities

is right all shares are owned by someone   depending on the company they can be closely held so that nobody wants to sell at a given time   this can cause the price people are offering to rise until someone sells   that trade will cause an adjustment in the ticker price of that stock   supply and demand at work   berkshire hathaway is an example of this   the number of shares is low the demand for them is high the price per share is high

i 'm assuming that by saying i 'm a us resident now you 're referring to the residency determination for tax purposes should i file a return in the us even though there is no income here yes us taxes its residents for tax purposes which is not the same as residents for immigration or other purposes on worldwide income if yes do i get credits for the taxes i paid in india what form    would i need to submit for the same i am assuming this form has to    be issued by it dept in india or the employer in india the irs does n't require you to submit your indian tax return with your us tax return however they may ask for it later if your us tax return comes under examination generally you claim foreign tax credits using form 1116 attached to your tax return specifically for india there may also be some clause in the indo us tax treaty that might be relevant to you treaty claims are made using form attached to your tax return and i suggest having a professional ea cpa licensed in your state prepare such a return although no stock transactions were done last year should i still    declare the value of total stocks i own if so what is an approx tax    rate or the maximum tax rate yes this is done using form 8938 attached to your tax return and also form 114 fbar filed separately with fincen pay attention the forms are very similar with regard to the information you provide on them but they go to different agencies and have different filing requirements and penalties for non compliance as to tax rates that depends on the types of stocks and how you decide to   treat them generally the tax rate for pfic is very high so that if any of your stocks are classified as pfic you 'd better talk to a professional tax adviser ea cpa licensed in your state about how to deal with them non pfic stocks are dealt with the same as if they were in the us unless you match certain criteria described in the instructions to form then a different set of rules apply talk to a licensed tax adviser i will be transferring most of my stock to my father this year will    this need to be declared yes using form 709 gift tax may be due talk to a licensed tax adviser ea cpa licensed in your state i have an apartment in india this year will this need to be declared    or only when i sell the same later on if there 's no income from it then no assuming you own it directly in your own name for indirect ownership yes you do but when you sell you will have to declare the sale and pay tax on the gains again treaty may come into play talk to a tax adviser also be aware of section 121 exclusion which may make it more beneficial for you to sell earlier

institutions and market makers tend to try and stay delta neutral meaning that for every options contract they buy or write they buy or sell the equivalent underlying asset this as a theory is called max pain which is more of an observation of this behavior by retail investors this as a reality is called delta hedging done by market makers and institutional investors the is that many times a stock gets to a very even number at a particular price on options expiration days like or by closing bell at options expiration dates many options contracts are being closed and market makers are typically on the other side of those trades to keep liquidity so for every one standard 100 share contract the market maker wrote they bought 100 shares of the underlying asset to remain delta neutral when the contract closes or get rid of the option they sell that 100 shares of the underlying asset at mass volume of options traded this would cause noticeable downward pressure similarly for other trades it would cause upward pressure as institutions close their short positions against options they had bought the result is a stock right above or below an expiration that previously had a lot of open interest this tends to happen in more liquid stocks than less liquid ones to answer that question as they have more options series and more strike prices no this would not be illegal in the us attempting to mark the close is supposedly prohibited but this would n't count as it the effect of derivatives on stock prices is far beyond the sec 's current enforcement regime although an active area of research

following 's advice i am posting this as an answer so it stands apart from the question but all the credit goes to whose instructions i followed i was able to get this collection completely deleted removed from the 2 bureaus that were reporting it using only the online dispute process of course your mileage may vary but here 's some more details that may be helpful to others equifax success 3 weeks after disputing the collection using the online dispute process and uploading my scanned final account statement to show that i paid the apartment complex i received an email confirmation that it is deleted i had to go to a webpage to get the actual result transunion success although i never heard back from tu my creditkarma account now shows that the collection is no longer on my tu report either i am not sure if this is because equifax deleted it and tu just followed suit or if tu did their own investigation ideas comments could help others their online dispute process out and did n't accept my upload so they would have had to contact the apartment complex so i was supposed to receive something by mail i still have n't but it 's definitely gone from my report experian it did n't show up on this report so i ca n't give any feedback i suppose it 's also worth noting that i did not ever have any contact with the collections agency i did visit the apartment office in person in order to get a copy of my final statement while there i spoke with the new manager who said she would try to reach up the chain of command to figure something out i 'm not sure how much difference if any this may have made as the complex is now owned by an entirely different company in fact the new manager had no idea who the old management company was much less which collections agency they used also worth noting removing the collection made my score rise from to i know because after getting the collection removed from my report i re applied for the auto loan i had been denied 3 weeks prior and they gave me my equifax score both times

as the answer above states future inflation mitigates unwise for a longer term mortgage at least in financial only terms   but consider that if you lose your ability to make payments for long enough time anytime during term the lending institution has a right to repossess leaving you with nothing or worse for all the maintenance you 've had to do   you can never know but eleven years into my mortgage i lost enough of my income for just long enough time to have to sell for just enough to pay the remainder of the mortgage and walk away with empty pockets    to help clarify understanding even better contrast the mortgage with the other extreme save up and own from day one   when i did the math a few years ago buying with a 30-year mortgage would cost almost 3 times the real house value in mortgage payments with never the freedom to suspend payments when i might need to   being a freedom loving american i determined to buy a house with cash   don't forget that properties are over priced just because buyers less wise than you are so willing to borrow to buy them so i decided to buy some fixer upper that no bank would lend on   i found such a fixer upper paid cash never have to worry about repossession by a lender can continue to save up for my dream home which i 'll own a lot sooner and will have a nice increase in house value while i fix it up to help get me there and no insurance payments to some insurer who 'll tell me what i ca n't do with my property let the next buyer of your fixed up paid off house pay you the over priced amount they are willing to pay just because they can get that 30-year mortgage and you enjoy the freedom to dream and adjust your budget to the needs of the moment and end up with a house in 30 years 15 more realistically that is 2.5 times more valuable   and keep from fighting with your spouse over finances in the meantime

is there any practical reason to hold off on making payments until i receive a billing statement yes a few    as for a zero balance fico consumer affairs manager barry says the idea here is the lower the better in terms of the utilization percentage but something is better than nothing the score wants to see some kind of activity   how low should you go in a recent interview fico spokesman craig watts said if your utilization is 10 percent or lower you 're in great shape as far as utilization goes that being said there are downsides especially if you wind up forgetting to make a payment   the easiest thing to do also from a time management perspective is to get your billing statement once a month verify the purchases on it and at that time you receive the statement schedule an online bill payment so that it will be paid in full before the due date    as aganju points out you do n't have to wait for a paper bill in hand or even an e mail notification you can go online after your statement date to get the statement   this makes sure you wo n't have extra costs related to of mail if you still receive paper mail though it does require remembering to check and/or setting a recurring calendar reminder   paying much in advance of that as is your current practice might be a good idea to free up available balance if you are planning a purchase that would take you over your credit limit but this should be relatively rare and some credit card companies will raise that limit if you have been paying well and ask nicely though find out first if they do a hard pull of your credit report for that

do i get a write off for paying student loans maybe   see generally personal interest you pay other than certain mortgage interest is n't deductible on your tax return however if your modified adjusted gross income magi is less than $ 80,000 $ 160,000 if filing a joint return there is a special deduction allowed for paying interest on a student loan also known as an education loan used for higher education for most taxpayers magi is the adjusted gross income as figured on their federal income tax return before subtracting any deduction for student loan interest this deduction can reduce the amount of your income subject to tax by up to $ 2,500   read the whole document to be sure but that 's the basics    you 'll have to fill out a 1040 or 1040a to claim a student loan deduction   it wo n't be on the 1040ez   you do not have to itemize though    what kinds of write offs and credits are available for someone who is single and lives in an apartment with two roommates as a practical matter in 2016 you 'll get the standard deduction for someone who is single $ 6300 and the personal exemption $ 4050   it 's extremely unlikely that you 'll be able to deduct more by itemizing   most people who itemize are taking a mortgage interest deduction   major medical bills are another possibility but they have to be more than 10 of your adjusted gross income it 's one of the lines on your tax return   assuming you rent and are reasonably healthy you are unlikely to have enough to itemize    the most likely additional deduction would be the one for an ira individual retirement account   although you might be better off doing a roth anyway no tax deduction    if you are self employed or making more than $ 100,000 a year there are additional issues   but most people are n't   if you filled out a w-4 and will get a w-2 back you are n't self employed   hopefully you have a rough idea of your annual income    the first $ over your deductions will pay 10   after that up to $ 37,650 you pay 15   the 2016 link above has a link pdf to the full table if you need more than that   note that that is the first $ 48,000 in income with your $ 10,350 in deductions

how much should a rational investor have in individual stocks probably none an additional dollar invested in a etf or low cost index fund comprised of many stocks will be far less risky than a specific stock and you 'd need a lot more capital to make buying voting and selling in individual stocks as if you were running your own personal index fund worthwhile i think in index funds use weightings to   make it easier to track the index without constantly trading so my advice here is to allocate based not on some financial principal but just loss aversion do n't gamble with more than you can afford to lose figure out how much of that you need it does n't sound like you can actually afford to lose it all so i 'd say 5 percent and make sure that 's funded from other equity holdings or you 'll end up overweight in stocks

yes there is a lot they are leaving out and i would be extremely skeptical of them because of the reasons they give for being able to charge $ 0 commissions their reasons are that they do n't have physical locations and high overhead costs the reality is that they are burning venture capital on exchange fees until they actually start charging everyone they suckered into opening accounts they also get paid by exchanges when users provide liquidity these are called trade rebates in the maker taker model they will start offering margin accounts and charging interest they are likely selling trade data to high frequency trading firms that then fill your stock trades at worse prices robinhood users are notorious for complaining about the fills they may well be able to keep commissions low as that has been a race to the bottom for a long time but if they were doing their users any actual favors then they would be also paying users the rebates that exchanges pay them for liquidity robinhood is n't doing anything unique as all brokers do what i mentioned along with charging commissions and it is actually amazing their sales pitch $ 0 commissions because we are just a mobile app lol was enough for their customers they are just being disingenuous

lots of questions in general no market capitalization and equity represent 2 different things   equity first the equity of a firm is the value of the assets what it owns less its liabilities what it owes and consists broadly of two components share capital what the firm gets when it sells to investors as part of an ipo or subsequent share issue and retained earnings what the firm has as a result of making profits and not paying them out as dividends this is the theoretical liquidation value of the firm what it is worth if it stops trading sells all its assets and pays all its debts market capitalization is the current value of the future cash flow of the firm as perceived by the market the value today of all the dividends that the firm will pay in the future for as long as it exists this is the theoretical going concern value of the firm what it is worth as a functioning business in general market capitalization is bigger than equity if it is n't the firm is worth more as scrap than as an operating business um no if you do n't have any shares then you are by definition not an owner having shares is what makes you an owner what i think you mean is is it possible for the owner(s of a private company to sell all of its shares when it goes public the answer is yes it is uncommon for a start up owner to do this but it is standard practice for corporate raiders who buy failing companies take them private restructure them and then take them public again they have done their job and they are not interested in maintaining an ownership stake nope see above and below not at all equity is an accounting construct and market capitalization is about market sentiment consider the following hypothetical firm it has $ 1 m in equity it makes $ 4 m in profit and will do for the foreseeable future it pays all of that $ 4 m out as dividends if we work on a simple roi of 10 then this firm is worth $ 40 m dollars way more than its equity

the irs defines income quite specifically on the topic what is taxable and nontaxable income they note you can receive income in the form of money property or services this section discusses many kinds of income that are taxable or nontaxable it includes discussions on employee wages and fringe benefits and income from bartering partnerships s corporations and royalties   bartering or giving someone wages or similar in something other than currency or some other specifically defined things like fringe benefits is taxed at fair market value bartering bartering is an exchange of property or services you must include in your income at the time received the fair market value of property or services you receive in bartering for additional information refer to tax topic 420 bartering income and barter exchanges bartering is more specifically covered in topic 420 bartering income you must include in gross income in the year of receipt the fair market value of goods or services received from bartering generally you report this income on form 1040 schedule c pdf profit or loss from business sole proprietorship or form 1040 schedule c ez pdf net profit from business sole proprietorship if you failed to report this income correct your return by filing a form 1040x pdf amended u.s. individual income tax return refer to topic for information on filing an amended return more details about income in general beyond the above articles is available in publication 525 taxable and nontaxable income   it goes into great detail about different kinds of income in your example you 'd have to calculate the fair market value of an avocado and then determine how much cash equivalent you were paid in   the irs would n't necessarily tell you what that value was you 'd calculate it based on something you feel you could justify to them afterwards   the way i 'd do it would be to write down the price of at each pay period and apply a dollar cost averaging type method to determine the total pay 's fair value    while the avocado example is of course largely absurd the advent of bitcoins has made this much more relevant   publication 525 has this to say about virtual currency virtual currency    if your employer gives you virtual currency such as bitcoin as payment for your services you must include the fair market value of the currency in your income the fair market value of virtual currency such as bitcoin paid as wages is subject to federal income tax withholding federal insurance contribution act fica tax and federal unemployment tax act futa tax and must be reported on form w-2 wage and tax statement gold would be fundamentally similar although i am not sure it 's legal to pay someone in gold assuming it were though its fair market value would be again the definition of income   similarly if you 're paid in another country 's currency the us dollar equivalent of that is what you 'll pay taxes on at the fair market value of that currency in us dollars

i will attempt to answer three separate questions here the standard answer is that an emergency fund should not be in an investment that can lose value   the safest course of action is to put it in a savings account or other very low risk investment somewhere this question becomes can a reasonable and low risk investment in sweden be comparable to or better than a low risk investment in brazil inflation in brazil has averaged a little less than 6 over the last 10 years with a recent spike up above 8   a cursory search indicates interest rates on savings accounts in brazil are outpacing inflation so you might still expect a positive return on money in a savings account there by contrast sweden 's inflation rate has been around 1 over the last 10 years and has around 0 or even deflation in recent years   swedish interest rates for savings accounts right now are very low nearly 0   putting money in a savings account in sweden would likely hold its value or lose a slight amount of value based on this you might be better off leaving your emergency fund invested in in brazil the answer to this a little unclear   the brazilian stock market has been all over the place in the last 10 years with a slight trend in recent years   in comparison sweden 's stock market has shown fairly consistent growth in spite of the big dip in 2008   given this it seems like the fairest comparison would your current 13 roi investment in brazil vs. a fund or etf that tracks the swedish stock market index if we assume a consistent 13 roi on your investment in brazil and a consistent inflation rate of 6 your adjusted roi there would be around 7 per year the etf that tracks the swedish 30 index has a 10 year annualized return of   if you subtract 0.8 inflation you get an adjusted roi 9 based on this sweden may be a safer place for longer term moderate risk investments right now

i 'm not sure if you are including the use of credit cards in the intent of your   however i will give you some good reasons i use them even when i can pay cash 1 i get an interest free loan for almost 30 days as long as i do n't carry balances 2 i get a statement detailing where i am spending my money that is helpful for budgeting i 'd never keep track to this level of detail if i were using cash 3 many cards offer reward programs that can be used for cash back 4 it helps maintain my credit rating for those times i need to buy something and pay it off over time car house etc 5 not so much an issue for me personally but for people that live paycheck to paycheck it might help to time your cash outflows to match up with your inflows for a business i think it is mostly a cash flow issue that is in a lot of b2b type businesses customers can pay very slowly managing their own cash flows so your revenue can sometimes lag quite a bit behind the expenses that were associated with them e.g payroll a business line of credit can smooth out the cash flow especially for companies that do n't have a lot of cash reserves

well yes but you should also begin to understand the sectoral component of real estate as a market too in that there can be commercial property   industrial property and retail property each of which is capable of having slightly tho usually similar of course different returns yields and risks   whereas you are saving to buy and enter into the residential property market which is different again and valuation principles are often out of here because buying a home although exposing your asset base to real estate risk is nt usually considered an investment as it is often made on emotional grounds not strict investment criteria

reversing your math i am assuming you have $ k to work with   in that case i would simply shop around your local banks and/or credit unions and have them compete for your money and you might be quite surprised how much they are willing to pay a couple of months ago you would be able to get about 4.25 from israel bonds in canada on 5 years term the product with minimum investment of $ 25 k   it 's a bit lower now but you should still be able to get very good rates if you shop around banks or credit unions who are more hungry for capital than the well funded banks or you could look at preferred shares of a large corporation   they are different from common shares in the sense they are priced according to the payout rate i.e. people buy it for the dividend a quick screen from your favorite stock exchange ought to find you a few options another option is commercial bonds   you should be able to get that kind of return from investment grade and higher bonds on large corporations these days   i just did a quick glance at marketwatch 's bond section and found aaa grade bonds that will yield > 5   you will need to investigate their underlying fundamentals coupon rate and etc before investing second thought grab a introduction to bonds book from chapters first hope these helps

both us gaap and are accrual basis frameworks 99.9 of businesses report under those frameworks or their local but still accrual based usually it 's public sector entities which are cash basis in my experience    anyway accrual basis has more to do with revenue recognition not taxation so that 's not really relevant here the value date of an invoice ie in which moment it becomes taxable depends on tax legislation which sets the rules to determine the so called date of taxable event not so much on accounting principles    in many cases taxable rules are intertwined with cash collection payment however to prevent creative accounting for tax evasion purposes for example provisions for various uncertain future events might be required by accounting rules but the corresponding expenses are generally not deductible for tax purposes so you wo n't be able to deduct them until the event actually occurs and you pay

hi i 'm not sure what you 're looking for but i 'll assume you are just looking for some distinguishing characteristics of an infra deal   infra deals are typically   project financed meaning that a special purpose company spc is established to build and operate the asset project finance means that the spc is from any party and is backed by the cashflows of the project and not by the balance sheet of some parent entity   the spc 's cashflows are backed by a lengthy concession agreement e.g. a government body provides a concession to a private party to operate the infrastructure asset for say 30 years the concession agreement can best be thought of as a form of guarantee provided by the government body the exact terms of the agreement will vary but something like you can operate this toll road for 30 years and charge $ x per vehicle indexed at y% p.a should give you the idea of what a concession agreement is    because the concession agreement acts a bit like a guarantee over the cashflows of the spc it makes longer term and higher leveraged financing more plausible imagine a national asset where the aaa credit rated government body guaranteed 20 m cars a year for 30 years with a $ 5 toll charge your spc now has $ 100 m of cashflow every year for 30 years which is aaa credit rated this should enable you to get competitively priced long term capital and to gear the spc at much higher rates than non infra deals   at the end of the concession period the spc hands the asset back to the government completely debt free   so in a nutshell a government body grants a concession to a spc that guarantees its cashflows over a long term the spc is then financed based purely on this guarantee the spc then builds the asset operates it and then at the end of the concession period transfers it back to the government google build operate transfer or bot for more detail if curious     there are plenty of other distinguishing characteristics and a truck load of detail that i have completely skipped ignored so others may want to jump in ridicule me   good luck with your interview   edit formatting

i have n't seen this addressed anywhere else so i 'll make a small answer to add on to the great ones already here money is n't the only way a person can contribute to a relationship time and effort are valuable contributions who runs the household who cooks does laundry how will you share these duties my husband and i have a couple of rules one of which is that we do n't keep count i did dishes so you do laundry i made coffee last time so now it 's your turn i paid this so you pay that that 's not allowed   i happen to make as much as my husband but i work 4x the hours he 's part time at the moment so he does the dishes he cooks he does laundry he runs the household do i value him less no i value him more because he is part of the team and he feeds me coffee while i work we have our own business even though i make so much more than him we still split everything down the middle because his contribution to this relationship to this household is so much more than just money and i value him i value his contribution   at the end of the day you are a team and if you split hairs over finances you 'll find yourself splitting hairs over everything

's are pretty much the best crash course to financial modelling with excel be aware though he has two distinct types of book one is more of a walk through of financial principles in of finance with excel 2nd ed and the other could better be described as a of financial applications in oft recommended financial modeling as far as i 'm aware both contain roughly the same volume of information about the same topics could be some minor differences as the walk through style book is newer but are taught in somewhat different ways it might be useful to obtain a copy of one or the other from a library and see if you enjoy the style of the book before purchasing it i was fortunate enough to have a roommate where between us we have both but doing this individually is a 200 + dollar endeavor and you will only be duplicating identical information   if you 're interested in reading other interesting material that may help you develop different perspectives insight into investing i would suggest aside from reading the usual stuff intelligent investor random walk etc also obtaining a copy of seth klarman 's margin of safety you 'll have to do so in form as the book is entirely out of print and from what i 've heard klarman himself bought out many retailers of all of their copies and had them destroyed but it 's an interesting read that has a lot of modern relevance   perhaps best evidenced by the fact that it 's author president of one of the largest hedge funds in the world no longer wants it in print

my thoughts from the top   1 if you 're already long which not just buy write if you want to sit on the portfolio for some time with little rebalancing collecting some option premiums might not be bad   2 you can replicate this portfolio on a rolling basis through bull spreads which should hedge or at least reduce your theta and give you some of that sweet sweet convexity however you will need a large enough size to cover your transaction costs   3 i agree with maximizing mean lower semi var most kids max mean var so good move there however you need estimates of expected return not easy and semi var easier look into using or a form of it on the semi var for a better estimator   4 is this an portfolio how do you determine your weights   5 in terms of sizing leverage   remember the betting condition that equity needs to be positive for all time how are you planning to limit your max dd and how often do you plan on rebalancing

amazon has 2 different cards you can apply for a store card and a credit card the credit card is through chase the deal is not a scam i can confirm this because i applied for their credit card and got $ 70 in the form of a digital gift card by giving customers free money for signing up for their cards they get more people who are willing to give it a try once you have a card you get benefits like 3 5 percent back on amazon purchases that will entice consumers to use the card amazon likely has an agreement with chase and they are hoping to get you hooked with the free money and benefits

i would just like to point out that the actual return should be compared to your down payment not the property price after all you did n't pay $ 400 k for that property right you probably paid only 20 so you 're collecting $ 20k year on a $ 80 k investment which works out to 25   even if you 're only breaking even your equity is still growing thanks to your tenants if you 're also living in one of the units then you 're saving rent which frees up cash flow your increased savings combined with the contributions of your tenants will put you on a very fast track in a few years you should have enough to buy a second property

diamonds are intrinsically worthless and therefore have quite little resale value it may be true that de beers has a near monopoly on diamond supply but they are still a scarce resource so their supply is still very limited   they do have resale value that 's one reason why diamond jewelry is stolen so often there 's just not a huge secondary market for diamonds that i know of unlike cars for example   you can sell diamond jewelry at pawn shops or online brokers but you probably only get a fraction of their retail value they are not intrinsically worthless   they do have value in the industrial sector as powerful cutters although synthetic diamonds are much more prevalent in this market   their value in industry is much lower than their worth as jewelry think about gold it does not have a supplier but it still has a relatively very high value

so one approach would be purely mathematical look at whichever has the higher interest rate and pay it first another approach is to ignore the math since the interest savings difference between a mortgage and student loan is likely small anyways and think about what your goals are   do you like having a student loan payment   would you prefer to get rid of it as quickly as possible   how would it feel to cut the balance in half in one shot if it were me i would pay the student loan as fast as possible student loans are not or and once you get it paid off you can put that payment amount toward your house to get it paid off

the key for your friends is a robust and detailed form of budgeting there are plenty of website resources to help them through that process and you should steer them there rather than go through it with them yourself of course you should show willing to answer questions and help if asked the budgeting exercise will require quite some effort and diligence to track historical and current actual expenditure keeping a detailed spending diary is an excellent way to start this must be coupled with a lot thought about ways to trim at various degrees of severity for example it means analysing all utilities deals to make sure they 're on the most suitable package it is also an ongoing iterative process not a one off the only way in which you giving money to them would be of help is if they have borrowings and the cost of servicing that debt via interest is what 's tipping their budget from positive to negative only if they are averaging a cash surplus each month can they make headway otherwise the underlying causes of their woes are not being addressed existing spending habits continue and they are merely deferring the changes they need to make your friends have to adopt living below your means that 's simply a modern version of mr 's famous and oft quoted recipe for happiness annual income twenty pounds annual expenditure pounds and six pence result happiness annual income twenty pounds annual expenditure twenty pounds ought and six result misery discussion forums like this make interesting reading

that stranglehold is because of the small margins in the business when you put cabs on the road there are only a few models to work with the lease model where the company puts as many cabs on the road as possible the commission model where they balance fleet size and demand and the medallion model where you have a lot of individual operators    the lease model sounds nice for the customers because there 's excess cabs compared to demand but drivers are n't going to pay $ 160 300 a shift to not make any money so even still the cab company has limit the number of cabs they put on the road   in any case once you add up all your costs for gas maintenance licensing and insurance you 're left with a very small margin sure a cab company could 3x the number of cabs it normally does at night during the bar rush but the other 16 hours of the day they 're sitting on the lot not doing anything because there is n't as high of demand during the day that costs money and if the cabs are n't working they 're not paying for themselves   thus the market finds a balance between what supply there is depending on time of day and how much it costs to support a fleet of that size the only outside effect on the market equilibrium is how many taxis a city will license i really do n't like the medallion model because of this the medallion owners love it because they 're sitting on upwards of $ 500k asset in some cities

after reviewing the tax treaty between new zealand and australia i think the issue is whether or not you have an interest in a permanent establishment in australia where you do business   the bank is not relevant as it is merely the vehicle by which you collect payment and would only come into the picture if you had an income bearing account which you have indicated you do not even if you work out of the offices of the australian company you do not have a financial interest in their offices and as such would pay taxes on the income in new zealand see documentation below

i am not sure about your country but i think each country must be having some fixed time frame for reversal of the transaction which must be less than a month please inquire if that time limit has passed or not if it has n't best will be to wait for some more time before informing them   once the reversal time limit has passed no one except government agencies with court orders can withdraw money from your bank account without your written consent even if they have deposited it themselves world would have been a strange place if this restriction was not there   since you want to close the account you can approach your previous boss or executive from hr account department and tell them your intention after that either you can transfer money online to their account or give them a cheque which they can deposit in their account this way things will end faster and you will be freed from this extra account   if above process takes time another solution will be to transfer the money to your another permanent account and give them a cheque from this account here also you can use online transfers or by sending them a cheque through courier   whichever mode you choose to pay the money back make sure you have some documented proof that may be helpful in future

when considering such a major life decision with such high potential costs and high potential rewards i encourage you to consider multiple different potential options even if loans were available they might not be the best option less debt and an engineering degree is better than more debt and an engineering degree both of which are likely better than your current debt and no engineering degree i encourage you to consider revisit your aid which is not just loans cut expenses consider alternative aid sources use your engineering student status to get a better paying job including more profitable summer employment check for methods to cut down the cost of your degree and double check your plans to make sure you have a long term plan that makes sense   the first issue raised in the comments is whether or not you are getting appropriate financial aid this does not just mean loans it includes grants and other forms of assistance   you should be getting in state tuition and by searching the tuition of unc i believe you are but for future readers you should make sure you are getting in state rates and it not there are options to return to a state where you would get in state tuition rates or look into the possibility of your study for one year until you meet in state funding requirements you should also ensure your fafsa information is correct including your income family situation whether or not you are an independent study as it sounds like you probably are etc this effects how many grants you get and if you are independent this changes maximum federal loan amounts see website for details   while you do n't say what your pay is the fact that you are working two jobs and having trouble making ends meet suggests either that you have a spending issue or that your jobs pay sucks and possibly both i 've been in both situations and there are methods for dealing with both if your spending is not very carefully controlled that 's a big issue i wo n't try to rehash all the personal finance advice about this but i will just warn that when you are desperate and you know there is n't enough money even if you spend perfectly there is a strong tendency to just give up and not even try because what 's the point learned is hell but it can be overcome with effort and tightly holding on to any of hope you find to do better each day if you are in a field like engineering or computing and some other fields though i am less personally familiar with the current employment climate in those there are usually companies who want to hire you as a paid intern or part time employee in the hopes of getting you when you graduate those last two semesters of undergrad are a technicality to employers they know it does n't really change your skill set much many companies are actually more interesting in hiring someone on who has n't finished the degree yet than getting someone recently post degree because they can get you cheaper and learn if this is a good match before they have to take the big risk of full time hiring you need to use this system to your advantage its hard when you feel destitute but talk with career councilors in your school your department advisor and/or main administrative staff in your main academic department make sure you are on the right mailing lists to see the job offers many schools require you to subscribe to one because at a school like unc it easily gets way too much traffic each day you need field relevant experience not just to finish the degree but to be able to really open up your job opportunities and earning potential do not be shy about directly calling emailing a contact who reaches out to your school looking for recent graduates and especially any mention of flexibility on early start for those who are almost finished you can say you are in your final year you are and even ask if they are open to working around a light school schedule while you finish up most can end up to be no but it does n't matter the recruiting contacts want to hire people so just reaching out early means you can follow up later once you get your degree and finances sorted out and you will have an even easier time getting that opportunity in technology and engineering the importance of summer internships can not be understated especially as you are now technically at the end of your degree in engineering and tech fields internships pay often very well do n't worry about it being the job of your dreams depending on your set of skills apply to insurance companies it departments in hospitals and banks even if you thought your coding skills in engineering were minimal and of course any paying position that might be more directly in your field of interest consider ones outside your immediate area or even the more national internships from the bigger name companies where possible it is not at all uncommon for tech and engineering internships for undergraduate students to pay $ + per hour even where most non degree jobs might only pay $ 8 and i 've seen as high as $ 40 per in the high cost of living markets depending on your skill set i know many people who were paid more as a student intern than they were previously paid as a full time professional employee many schools including unc charge different tuition for distance learning and satellite campuses and often also offer university approved online classes while this is not always a possibility for every student you should consider the options it could be that one of the final classes you need towards your degree can be taken at one of these other options with reduced tuition this is not always possible with all courses but is certainly true if you have any of those general education requirements to knock out also consider if any of those final requirements have test out options such as test alternatives again not always available but sometimes you can get class credit for a general education class for    finally make sure you are n't paying unnecessarily for text books once you do get the money for tuition you can sometimes get hand me down copies rent ebooks or physical books from online companies creative searches for pdf copies get your book from off campus local stores etc it is n't tuition but money is money attend part time while working look into the option of being a half time student which is usually 6 8 credit hours if you ca n't afford full time tuition there is generally a greatly reduced rate you still qualify for aid programs and you are still working towards the degree so you still get access to student resources like internships and job listings that may not be publicly posted inquire about scholarships and school emergency assistance while this varies hugely by institution make sure you check into scholarships you can apply to even if they are just a few hundred bucks it helps a lot in your school i do n't believe the big online searches help ask the school but ymmv also inquire about any sort of possible help the school provides to students who 've had life emergencies such as your medical issues many have programs that are not advertised designed to help students finish their degree and recover from personal hard times it 's worth the inquiry if you are willing to ask any little bit of assistance can help do n't be afraid to talk with an institution 's mental health councilors either who can help you deal with the psychological difficulty of your situation as well as often being able to connect you to other potential support resources the pressure can take its and you 'll have better long term opportunities if you build up your support network and options student loan forbearance while in school if you are trying to save up every last dollar for tuition to finish the degree but you have to pay loans now call up the provider to ask about temporary delays on your student loan payments many have time limited hardship allowances and between the medical bills low income and returning to school they may be willing to give you a few months break until you get back to school and the in school provisions kick in skip a semester if necessary to save money if you can only raise enough for one semester then need to skip a semester to build up more funds that happens it 's ok be strategic and check on loan forbearance usually being out for one semester is allowed by student loan companies before you owe them payment and if you re enroll you do n't have to start making payments yet double check on credit expiration and degree requirements make sure you talk to someone who knows what they are talking about especially in terms of credit expiration policies vary and sometimes an advisor is able to put in a special request to waive you through some of these issues academia is heavily heavily reliant on developing a good relationship and clear communication with an advisor who is willing to work with you to achieve your goals written policies are sometimes very firm and sometimes all you have to do is ask the right person and poof suddenly the rules change   it 's a weird system but do n't be afraid to explain your situation and ask what can be done do n't assume a written policy is 100 ironclad sometimes it is but it often is n't inquire about other government and community based assistance being destitute is awful and having to ask for help can feel terrible in it 's own way but doing what you have to do to have a better future can mean pushing through and being willing to ask for help this can mean asking parents and close family if they can contribute to help you finish your degree but this also means checking with your local community programs to see if you qualify for anything many communities have food and related programs that will help you even if you do n't qualify for something like snap aka food stamps because they know times can get hard for anyone and they want you to spend what little money you have on building a better life your university may even run a food pantry for students in need use it get what assistance you can minimize spending in any way you can manage put all the money towards doing what you need to do to get to a better place it 's even nicely reciprocal once you work through your hard times and get things on track you can return the favor and help give back to programs like the ones that helped you make sure your long term goal makes sense finally this is all predicated on pulling out all the stops to finish your degree but this assumes that this is a good plan not all degrees are helpful for all people in all areas of the country do your own research to make sure you are n't throwing good money after bad and are pursuing a goal that will make sense for you and what you want   the cost of a degree keeps going up but it remains true that many sets of skills and degree holding candidates are in demand and can command high salaries that blow away the cost of college in comparison if you actually have a good chance of going from struggling to make $ to making $ a year based on your developed skills experience and professional network then reasonable student loan debt is a worthy investment if on the other hand you up tens of thousands of more dollars in debt just to say you did and still have to work the same kinds of jobs that 's not really much of an investment

your goals are excellent i really admire your thoughts and plans and i hold you in high esteem good credit is indeed an important thing to have and starting young is the smart idea with respect to this i see that you have as a goal the purchase of a home indeed another fine ambition wow you are a different breed from what i normally encounter on the internet that 's for sure since this wo n't happen overnight i would encourage you to think about another option at this point in your life you have what few people have options and you have lots of them the option i would like to suggest you consider is the debt free life this does not mean life without a credit card nor does it mean living with ones parents all their days in its simplest form it means that you do n't owe anybody anything today an adapted form of that with the reality of leases and so on is that you have more immediate cash in the bank than you have contractual responsibilities to pay others e.g. if the rent on a place is x and the lease is 12 months then you do n't sign until you have in the bank   that 's the idea if there is anything good that these past 10 years of recession and financial disasters have provided us as a nation it is a clear picture presented to our young people that a house is not a guaranteed way to riches indeed i just learned this week of another couple forced out by foreclosure again yes in the 1970s and 1980s the formula which anyone could follow was to take a mortgage on a single family house just about any house in any community and ten years later double your money while during those ten years paying about the same and in a few years actually less amount of money as you would for an apartment with about half the space those days were then not now and i seriously doubt that i will ever see them again in my lifetime you might at your age one day in the mean time i would like to suggest that you think about that word options again something that you have that i do n't if your mind is made up for certain that a house is the one and only thing you want okay this does not apply during this time of building your credit we 're talking more than a year i would like to encourage you to look at some of the other options that are out there waiting for you such as i also encourage you to take a calculator and a spreadsheet i would be surprised if there is no freeware out there to do this with a few clicks and compare the past 30 years of various investments for example it is especially educational if you can see line charts with the ups and downs along the way one last thing about the stock market you have an option i love that word when people your age are actually thinking called dollar cost averaging if you are not aware of this concept just ask and i will edit this post although i 'm confident it has been explained by others far better than myself on this very site hit just about any solid stock market investment plain old mutual fund even with a load and it will still work and i believe you 'll see what i 'm trying to get across still yes you need a roof and a young person should clearly plan on leaving parents in a healthy and happy way so again if the house is the one and only goal then go for it kid kid if you 're still under 18 all the best do remember that you will be fixing the pipes not the maintenance guy

when the market is n't allowed to favor one currency provider over another there must be a central authority with the power to regulate provide and insure it people do n't learn the dangers of fractional reserve banking and the resulting expansions and contractions of the money supply when the providers of the currency are n't allowed to fall taking the savings of depositors with them insuring people against the dangers of mismanaged money guarantees the mismanagement of money

if you live and work in the euro zone then even after a crash all of your income and most of your expenses will still be in euros   the only portion of your worth you need to worry about protecting is the portion you intend to spend on goods from outside the euro zone i.e. imports   in that case you may want to consider parking some of your money in short term government bonds issued by other countries such as the uk switzerland and usa or wherever else your favorite goods tend to come from   if the euro actually massively devalues an extremely unlikely scenario then you can expect foreign goods to cost a lot more than they do now   inflation might also pick up so you might also want to purchase some

i think your math is fine and also consider insurance costs and the convenience factor of each scenario moving a car frequently to avoid parking tickets will become tedious i 'd rather spend an hour renting a car 20 times in a year rather than have to spend 15 minutes moving a car every three days and if there 's no other easy parking that 15 minutes can take a lot longer plus it 'll get dirty sitting there could get for only 20 days year i do n't see how owning a car is worth the hassle i recommend using a credit card that comes with free car rental insurance

everyone has made some good points that i was going to mention but to put it in terms that might make it easier to decide as stated by others paying off debt and being free is always the goal and desirable however you must also consider the efficiency of what you do as well for example there are two common types of student loans there are others but let 's focus on these and that is subsidized and unsubsidized the main difference subsidized loans do n't earn interest on your balance while you are in school it only happens when you graduate and come out of repayment grace period unsubsidized loans begin accumulating interest the moment they are disbursed but you are not required to make payments on them until you graduate all student loans are deferred until you graduate and exhaust your grace period or other means of deferring your payment say for example a or forbearance however it is often recommended that on unsubsidized loans you pay down your principle while still in school to avoid that massive interest amount that will get added to it when you are officially in repayment on the other hand it is often if not always recommended that you hold off on paying subsidized loans until you are done and go into repayment as for all intents and purposes its not costing you anything extra to wait family and parent loans are considered and treated more like personal loans so treat them as such hope that helps also do n't forget to take advantage of the income based repayment options as they will make the payments manageable enough to avoid making them a burden while you are trying to get a job and go post education further reading   income driven plans department of education income driven repayment plans

there are some assumptions which can be made in terms of the flexibility you have i will start with the least flexible assumption and then move to more flexible assumptions if you must put down a number 1 your go to for the start period to 1 is pretty good and it 's used frequently for other divide by zero calculations like in a video game the problem i have with 1 is that it does n't allow you to handle various scales   some problems are dealt with in thousands some in fractions and some in hundreds of millions therefore you should change the start period to the smallest significantly measurable number you could reasonably have here that would take your example 0 and and give you an increase of it 's not a great result but it 's the best you can hope for if you have to put down a number   and it allows you to keep some of the meaning in the change if you absolutely must put something this is the assumption that most answers have taken you can put down a symbol a number with a notation empty space etc but there is going to be a label somewhere called growth that will exist i generally agree with what i 've seen particularly the answers from benjamin and for the sake of preservation those answers can be summarized as putting n a or possibly with a footnote and if you can avoid the measurement entirely the root of your question is what do my manager and investors expect to see i think it 's valuable to dig even further to what do my manager and investors really want to know they want to know the state of their investment growth is often a good measurement of that state but in cases where you are starting from zero or negative it just does n't tell you the right information in these situations you should avoid growth and instead talk in absolute terms which mention the time frame or starting state for example

the only card i 've seen offer this on credit card purchases is discover   i think they have a special deal with the stores so that the cash over amount is not included in the percentage fee the merchant pays   the cash part shows up broken out from the purchase amount on the statement if this was purely something the store did on its own without some collaboration with discover that would not happen the first few times i 've seen the offer i assumed it would be treated like a cash advance high apr immediate interest with no grace period etc but it is not   it is treated like a purchase you have no interest charge if you pay in full during the grace period and no transaction fee   now i very rarely go to the atm what is in it for discover   they have a higher balance to charge you interest on if you ever fail to pay in full before the grace period   and discover does n't have any debit pin option that i know of so no concern of their other business   and happier customers what is in it for the grocer   happier customers and they need to have the armored car come around less often and spend less time counting internally

none of what i say is advice directed to you it is how i would continue to analyse the situation you have were it mine first off i prefer to work in more than possibilities   saying that paying down the mortgage makes sense as i can calculate the amount i will save i also believe that rate rises are coming in the future based on the talk from the so any money i pay off now means guaranteed less interest to pay in the future also the lower my loan to value ratio the better lower interest rates i can receive in the mortgage market if i do not want to work until retirement age it 'd be nice to have as few bills as possible in the decade or so prior to retirement age i could then do early retirement or part time work in the run up to retirement i could use my savings to fund life until retirement pays out i 'd be aiming to put 15 of my gross income into future investing using isas to build up a savings pot taking advantage of retirement products that way all the money is not tied to a normal retirement age before it can accessed and it 's not by future greedy government taxation any income leftover above the 15 i 'd be throwing at the mortgage taking advantage of the 10 overpay window remortgaging as ltv comes down in theory overpaid mortgage equity is money that could still be accessed provided house prices do n't decline and remortgaging is a possibility so in short i 'd follow a plan along these lines of logic 1 make sure i have 4 6 months of living expenses as a rainy day fund insulate myself from fluctuations in my financial situation 2 put away 15 of annual gross income towards future saving isas first pension second 3 overpay the mortgage and look to remortgage as ltv drops when ltv 60 look to lock in to a longer term fix eg 2 year fixes at 90 ltv 5 year fixes at 60 4 reassess steps 2 3 as life happens circumstances change work fluctuates etc 5 once the mortgage is paid off build as much wealth as possible isas first then non tax efficient savings products aim for keeping expenses down and raising my savings rate as much as possible your analysis was thorough and shows you are thinking through consequences never forget to factor in the risk of carrying debt having no low debt as you get older means there 's more income left to build wealth ignore the american view of carrying debt for life and trusting investments to outperform the debt you have to pay monthly to keep that debt around and it ai n't a pet

financially it simply does n't make sense to go into debt here it may be that living on credit cards for a while gives you a chance to recover psychologically but financially it does n't make sense but let 's consider the larger picture here you are and and may be suffering from depression that sucks very many of us have been there i 'd write in great detail except this site is about finance so let 's limit the scope a little you 've had therapy it has n't produced meaningful change stop with that therapy it 's not cost effective financially speaking your goal should be to get back on your feet you should only be willing to take on credit card debt if it is very very directly helping you accomplish this maybe that means a different therapist maybe that means paying for medication which can often be effective heck maybe that 's a suit something you put on each morning for a couple of hours to focus on getting a job maybe that means some other approach but you should only be willing to take on debt that directly helps you get back on your feet should you be willing to continue as you are now taking on credit card debt for your living expenses no definitely not credit cards charge obscene amounts of interest and the evidence is that your current approach is not working going into debt in this case makes as much sense as it did for me to continue working for an employer who was n't paying me that is none at all financially all that said i strongly encourage you to get whatever help will work for you your finances are important but they are n't everything

if you have little investing experience you should n't involve yourself in leveraged investments or short term speculation at all   you will probably just lose money if not is there a better way to invest with a small amount of money if you have little investing experience you should not attempt to make a lot of money on a small investment at all   you will probably just lose money the best way to invest with a small amount of money is to put it in a low cost mainstream investment product like an index fund and wait and save money until you have more   by that time you may decide that leaving the money in a low cost index fund is actually the best thing to do anyway   incidentally i do n't know if fund minimums are different in the uk but in the us an amount equivalent to £ 100 might not even be enough to start so you might have to just put it in a savings account until you save enough to even buy into a mutual fund

keep in mind that the only portion of the mbs that was rated aaa was the most senior tranche it achieved this rating due to the buffer to principal losses provided by the equity and mezzanine tranches so for the principal to be at risk for the aaa senior tranche 10 of the mortgages in the pool would have to default since this number was way higher than historical default rates it seemed safe obviously looking back we know that risk management underestimated the effect that lowered lending standards would have on the default rates if they did project a rise in default rates they did not project a large enough rise   as well while the mbs is exposed to systemic risk as happened when the entire country was affected by the collapse they were packaged to avoid other risks for example the pool would spread out mortgages across the country and other various factors would be hedged so that if a natural disaster hits state x and everyone defaults on their mortgage you are only losing a small part of the underlying   i assume hope that at some point the quantitative analysis people in risk management at the major investment banks realized that the default rates would rise given the lower lending standards being employed but chose to ignore it they chose to ignore it because investors still wanted to buy it and the banks make money by collecting fees on issuing securities

the answer is that other than a small number of applications the approx 10 of gold production that goes to industrial uses gold does not have intrinsic value beyond being pretty and rare and useful for making jewelry   there are a number of industrial applications and uses for gold see other answers for a list but the volume consumed this way is fairly small especially relative to the capacity to mine new gold and reclaim existing gold if you removed investment and jewelry usage especially driven jewelry usage then there 's no way the remaining uses for industry and dentistry could sustain the price levels we currently see for gold   furthermore and perhaps more importantly the best data i can find for this shows the total number of tons consumed for industrial uses has been shrinking for several years now and that was prior to recent price increases so it is difficult to tie that reduced demand to increasing prices   and one might postulate in a collapsed society you seem to be referring to in your question that a lot of the recent industrial demand e.g. the 50 cents of gold in each cellphone could quite possibly disappear entirely    the argument many people use for gold having value is usually been used as money for thousands of years   but this confuses gold having a value of its own with the reasons why something makes a useful currency   gold has a large number of characteristics that make it an ideal currency and of all the elements available it is perhaps the best physical element to serve as a currency but just as with a dollar bill just because it is a good currency does not give it an intrinsic value any currency is only worth what someone will trade you for it   the value is set by the economy etc not the medium used as a currency    so yes people will probably always use gold as money but that does n't make the money worth anything it 's just a medium of exchange incidentally two other things should be noted   the first is that you have a problem when the medium itself used for a currency becomes worth more than the face value   hence why we stopped using silver in coins and there were concerns over pennies due to the price of copper this leads to the second point which is that currently gold is too rare to suffice as a world currency hence why all countries went off the gold standard years ago   the size of national and global economies was growing faster than the supply of gold and hence it was becoming impossible to have enough gold to back all the currencies inflation concerns aside

will the investment bank evaluate the worth of my company more than or less than 50 crs assuming the salvage value of the assets of 50 crs meaning that 's what you could sell them for to someone else that would be the minimum value of your company less any outstanding debts there are many ways to calculate the value of a company but the most common one is to look at the future potential for generating cash    the underwriters will look at what your current cash flow projections are and what they will be when you invest the proceeds from the public offering back into the company   that will then be used to determine the total value of the company and in turn the value of the portion that you are taking public and what will be the owner ’s share in the resulting public company that 's completely up to you   you 're essentially selling a part of the company in order to bring cash in presumably to invest in assets that will generate more cash in the future   if you want to keep complete control of the company then you 'll want to sell less than 50 of the company otherwise you can sell as much or as little as you want

stop orders and stop limit orders typically do not execute during extended hours after the general market session has closed stop orders are market orders and market orders especially are not executed during extended hours although there are exceptions because a broker can say one thing and do another thing with the way order types are presented to customers vs what their programming actually does the regulatory burden is a slap on the wrist so you need to ask the broker what their practices are orders created during normal market hours do not execute in extended sessions different orders would have to be made during the extended session your stop order should execute if the normal market hour price stays below your stop price so a stop limit would actually be worse here because a stop limit will create a limit order which may never get hit since it is above the best bid best ask

until the card act credit card rules required that merchants had no minimum purchase requirement to use a card new rules permit a minimum but it must be clearly posted   update stores can now refuse small credit card charges is an excellent article which clarifies the rules it appears that these rules apply to credit not debit cards so to be clear the minimum do not apply to the op as he referenced using a debit card   superiority hm i 'd be a bit embarrassed to charge such small amounts although when cash in my wallet is very low i may have little choice note and disclaimer i am 48 30 years ago when i started using cards there were no pos machines credit card transactions had a big device that got a card imprint and the merchant looked up to see if your card was stolen in a big book they got weekly monthly times have changed and debit cards may be faster especially if with cash you give the cashier $ for a $ transaction but the guy entered $ 5 already this often takes a manager to clear up

with a 401k you will be taxed when you withdraw the money upon retirement just like an ira but conventional wisdom had it that you 're likely to be in a lower tax bracket at that time that may not necessarily be the case though in which case a roth ira would be a better option because you 're paying for it with after tax dollars and distributions are untaxed if you wanted to hedge your bets you could have both an ira/401k and a roth ira   an ira has income limits above which the contributions are no longer tax deductible i do n't believe a 401k has the same limitations for completion 's sake a roth ira has income limits above which you ca n't contribute to one and like you said the employer match is free money

if upper and bollinger bands either converge or diverge does that mean the market is trending no bollinger bands measure volatility which is an measure of how much variation there is in the price of the instrument it does not indicate a trend which means that the instrument tends to move in a consistent direction   when bollinger bands are close together that means volatility is relatively low and vice versa they can   be interpreted as signals that a stock might move in one direction or the other but they are not a measure of directional movement

planned obsolescence   planned obsolescence or built in obsolescence in industrial design and economics is a policy of planning or designing a product with an artificially limited useful life so it will become obsolete that is or no longer functional after a certain period of time the rationale behind the strategy is to generate long term sales volume by reducing the time between repeat purchases referred to as shortening the replacement cycle   producers that pursue this strategy believe that the additional sales revenue it creates more than offsets the additional costs of research and development and opportunity costs of existing product line in a competitive industry this is a risky strategy because when consumers catch on to this they may decide to buy from competitors instead     artificial demand   artificial demand constitutes demand for something that in the absence of exposure to the vehicle of creating demand would not exist it has controversial applications in microeconomics pump and dump strategy and advertising   a demand is usually seen as artificial when it increases consumer utility very for example a physician unnecessary surgeries would create artificial demand government spending with the primary purpose of providing jobs rather than any other end product has been labelled artificial demand     artificial scarcity   artificial scarcity describes the scarcity of items even though either the technology and production or sharing capacity exists to create a theoretically limitless abundance as well as the use of laws to create scarcity where otherwise there would n't be the most common causes are monopoly pricing structures such as those enabled by laws that restrict competition or by high fixed costs in a particular marketplace the inefficiency associated with artificial scarcity is formally known as a loss     perverse incentive   a perverse incentive is an incentive that has an unintended and undesirable result which is contrary to the interests of the incentive makers perverse incentives are a type of negative unintended consequence or cobra effect     ^ ^pm](https://www.reddit.com message compose?to = kittens_from_space ^| ^exclude ^me](https://reddit.com message compose?to = wikitextbot&amp;message = excludeme&amp;subject = excludeme ^| ^exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com r business about banned ^| ^faq ^/ ^information](https://np.reddit.com r wikitextbot wiki index ^| ^source](https://github.com kittenswolf wikitextbot    ^ ^downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.27

in double entry bookkeeping no transaction is ever negative you only deal in positive numbers we simulate negative numbers by calling numbers debits and credits where one is the negative of the other only a balance can be negative in this case income is a credit account that means that things that increase your balance are credits and things that reduce your balance are debits so a gift from grandma is a credit it 's a positive number and you write it in the credit column you pretty much never subtract from income except to correct a mistake assets like a checking account are debit accounts increases are debits and decreases are credits you routinely have both debits and credits on a checking account i.e. you put money in and you take money out every transaction affects at least two accounts one with a debit and one with a credit so in this case the gift from grandma credits income and debits checking buying food credits checking and debits expenses

there are a few ways to look at this question assumptions per the original post 's assumptions this answer in other words if the owner paid the mortgage on its original schedule the deal could boil down to a $   40,000 up front payment in exchange for $   200,000 of equity after 30   years   or the deal could boil down to a $   40,000 up front payment in exchange for a $   810.70 monthly payment starting in 30   years while the owner is paying down the mortgage the return on equity is the principal payment divided by the equity   the principal payment is the net rent minus non financing costs and interest so it is actually a profit the initial return on equity is   apr or   apy   this is calculated by dividing the $   210.70 monthly principal payment by the initial $   40,000 equity and converting from monthly return to annual return after 30 years the return on equity is   apr or   apy   this is calculated by dividing the $   810.70 monthly cash flow which is no longer reduced by mortgage payments by the $   200,000 equity after 30 years and converting from monthly return to annual return the cap rate is the same as the return on equity in the absence of debt   in this example   apr or   apy the return on equity declines from   apy initially to   apy after 30 years this is because the cap rate exceeds the note rate   apy vs.   apy and the leverage decreases from 5x to 1x the weighted average compound annual growth rate of the equity during the 30 years is   apy   per the original poster 's answer this is computed by taking the 30th root of the increase in equity   because the owner made no extra principal payments besides those already discussed the relevant amounts are the initial $   40,000 owner payment and the final $   200,000 owner equity     apy corresponds to a   apr the internal rate of return if the owner never sells can be computed by treating the deal as a $   40,000 up front payment in exchange for an $   810.70 monthly payment starting in 30   years   the internal rate of return irr is not a very useful number because it assumes that you can somehow reinvest the eventual dividends at the same rate   in this example the irr is   apr or   apy   in this example the irr is calculated by finding an interest rate for which initial investment 1 + irr ^ number periods before dividends start = periodic dividend irr growth rate of dividend   for example $   40,000 = $   810.70 0 = $   i then converted the   monthly irr to an annual irr the deal can be thought of as a return on equity plus a return on paying down the mortgage when computing the return from paying down the mortgage the initial equity is irrelevant   it does not matter whether you start with a $ 160,000 mortgage on a $   160,000 property a $   160,000 mortgage on a $   200,000 property or a $   160,000 mortgage on a $   1,000,000 property   all that matters is the note rate on the mortgage which is the applicable compound interest rate the return on paying down the mortgage equals the note rate of the mortgage   for a 4.5 note rate this works out to a annual percentage yield apy you can confirm this by looking at your amortization schedule   suppose you have a $   160,000 mortgage with a fixed 4.5 apr note rate for 360 months   your monthly payment is $   810.70   in the first month $   600 goes toward interest and $   210.70 reduces the principal   in other words the $   210.70 principal payment eliminated the need for a $ 810.70 payment 30 years later   notice that $ 210.70 1 + = $ 210.70 = $ 210.70 = $ which is within rounding error of $   810.70 the interest rate is   per month which is an apr of 4.5 and an apy of

is it safe to invest in a portfolio of dividend stocks yielding 7 9 with the money borrowed at 3 4 from one of these brokerages yes and no it depends on your risk profile any investment has its risks of losing your capital but not investing is a guaranteed risk as you will be guaranteed to fall behind the rate of inflation regarding investing on margin this can increase your gains but can also increase your loses regarding the stock market when investing in stocks you should not only look at the dividend rate but also the capital gain or loss potential remember in regards to investing on margin if the share price drop too much you can get a margin call no matter how much dividend you are getting it is no use gaining 9 in dividend yield per year if you are losing 15 or more in capital each year also what is the risk of the dividend rate being cut back or dividends not being paid at all in the future these are some of the risks you should consider before investing and derive a risk management plan as part of your investment plan before you invest no investment is totally safe or risk free but it is less risky than not investing at all as long as you understand the risks involved and have a risk management plan in place as part of your overall investment plan

the ultimate purpose of case schiller is to build contracts that you can use to stop worrying about this for a price you or your lender might buy cash settled put options based on the index and hope that if your home falls in value the your options become in the money to make up the shortfall the major problem that i can see with this is finding people to take the other side of that contract renters would be the primary candidates but americans are on average so overweight in real estate that there really is n't anyone to real estate who would benefit from diversification and the tax advantage will give people far cheaper avenues address this viewed in this light your question has a sort of obvious answer case schiller is historical data and you need to know about the future historical data case schiller ca n't do it alone but you can use futures markets to predict it problem you 'll have is that the market itself will optimize this temporal trade if there 's a market drop anticipated the market will charge you more for market drop insurance

currency lives no more then 50 years us currency did not expire in last 100 years but it was few times last one was 2009 note that currency is not just what you hold in your hand currency is system of relations of money supply currency is not money but we forced to use standard terminology banking rules and government policy currency exists as long as government wants it to in 2009 for example us government decided it needs new currency and just printed whole new money supply so us dollar is now counting as partially fresh new currency it was not expired but today 's dollar is totally different from 90s and will it be accepted after 200 years yes probably but most likely at that time there will be totally new us dollars and new euros new pounds and so on currency is method of transfer you can have that physical coins you have but as economic agent it will die very quickly it is not only related to inflation in fact inflation is the least of your worries if you count all currencies in the world which ever existed most of them 99.99 are completely dead by now with governments which supported it not even single one currency which lived more then 100 years us dollar was in 1860 1907 1930 1973 1987 2009 and   in fact it is not single currency but dozen which were allowed to be used for compatibility reasons

the bond funds should tell you their duration my 401(k has similar choices and right now i 'm at the short maturity i.e. under 1 year the current return is awful but better than the drop the longer term funds will experience as rates come back up   not quite mathematically correct but close enough duration gives you the time weighted average maturity in a way that tells you how the value responds to a rate change if a fund has a 10 year duration a .1 rate rise will cause the fund value to drop 1.0

i read up on it and saw that the irs can charge the loan provider on    interest even if the loan provider does n't charge interest but this    is normally mitigated by the 0 interest being considered a gift and    as long as it 's below x amount your fine yes this sums it up x is the amount of the gift exemption the $ however you must differ between loan with no interest and loan with no paying back with loan with no interest you 're still giving a statutory gift of the irs mandated minimum interest however the principal is expected to be repaid to you and you must show that this expectation is reasonably fulfilled if you can not i.e. you gave a loan with no intention of it being paid back then the irs will recharacterize the whole amount as the gift and you 'll be on the hook for gift tax for the amounts above the exemption what defines a loan vs a gift in terms of the irs is it simply that    the loan will be paid back or is it only considered a loan if a    note is made as i said you must be able to show that the loan is indeed a loan even if it is with no interest i.e. it is being repaid it is treated as a loan by all parties and is not an attempt to evade gift tax promissory note is not a must but will definitely be helpful in showing that but without the de facto repayment of the loan it will be hard to argue that it is not a gift even if you have a promissory note that means you should make a loan in such a way that the borrower will begin repaying it reasonably soon so that you can show payment schedule being followed and money moving back to you reasonably soon is not of course defined in a statute so do consult with a ea cpa licensed in your state on how to structure the loan so that it will not appear as an attempt to evade the gift tax are there any limits on how big a loan can be no but keep in mind that even with statutory interest charges published by the irs monthly see the link with large enough loan you can exceed the gift tax exemption also keep in mind that interest is taxable income to you even if you gift it back i.e. the statutory interest

the below assessment is for primary residences as opposed to income properties the truth is that with the exception of a housing bubble the value of a house might outpace inflation by one or two percent   according to the us census the price of a new home per square foot only went up between 1963 and 2008 where as inflation was 4.4   since home sizes increased the price of a new home overall outpaced inflation by 1 at 5.4 source   according to case shiller inflation adjusted prices increased a measly from 1890 2004 see graph here on the other hand your down payment money and the interest towards owning that home might be in a mutual fund earning you north of eight percent   if you do n't put down enough of a down payment to avoid pmi you 'll be literally throwing away money to get yourself in a home that could also be making money upgrades to your home that increase its value unless you have crazy do it yourself skills and get good deals on the materials usually do n't return 100 on an investment   the best tend to be around 80 on top of the fact that your money is going towards an asset that is n't giving you much of a return a house has costs that a rental simply does n't have or rather it does have them but they are wrapped into your rent closing costs as a buyer realtor fees and closing costs as a seller maintenance costs and constantly escalating property taxes are examples of things that renters deal with only in an indirect sense nyt david says all this more than i ever could in there 's an interactive calculator at the nyt that helps you apply 's criteria to your own area none of this is to say that home ownership is a bad decision for all people at all times   i 'm looking to buy myself but i 'm not buying as an investment   for example i would never think that it was ok to stop funding my retirement because my house will eventually fund it for me   instead i 'm buying because home ownership brings other values than money that a rental apartment would never give me and a rental home would cost more than the same home purchase given 10 years

i think it 's worth pointing out explicitly that the biggest difference between a credit card us canada and a debit card like your french carte de is that with a credit card it 's entirely possible to not pay the bill or to pay only the minimum payment when asked this results in you owing significantly more money due to interest which can snowball into higher and higher levels of debt and end up getting rapidly out of control this is the reason why you should always pay off the entire balance every month as to in the other answers it 's not uncommon to find people in the us with thousands of dollars of debt they ca n't pay off from misuse of credit cards

it depends on the definition of earnings   a company could have revenue that nets in excess of expenses so from that perspective a good cash flow or ebitda but have debt servicing costs taxes depreciation amortization that alters that perspective so if a company is carrying a large debt load then the bondholders are in the position to capture any excess revenues through debt service payments and the company is in a negative equity positions no equity or dividends payable to shareholders and has not produced earnings if a company has valuable preferred shares issued and outstanding then depending on the earnings definition there may be no earnings for the common stock until the preferences are satisfied by the returns so while the venture itself revenues minus costs could be cash flow positive this may not be sufficient to produce earnings for shareholders whose claim on the company still entitles them to zero current liquidation value i.e. they get nothing if the company immediately all value goes to bondholders or preferred   it could also be that taxes are eating into revenue or the depreciation of key assets is greater than the excess of revenues over costs e.g. a bike rental company by the beach makes money on a weekly basis but is out half its stock every 3 months and replacement costs will overwhelm the operating revenues

in my experience working at a currency exchange money service business in the us flat fees are the because we can fee on average these can be waived on certain dollar values at some banks or and sometimes can even be   if you google eurusd as an example you also get something like $ 1.19 at 4 pm if you look at the actual conversion that you got you may find your bank hit you with $ 1.30 or something close to convert from usd to euro in other words you payed 10 more usd per euro and if you sell your euro directly back you might find you only make $ 1.07 this spread is the real fee and covers a number of things including risk or liquidity you 'll see that currencies with more volatility or less liquidity have a much wider spread some businesses even go as far as to artificially widen the spread for speculators see inr etc typically if you see a 3 surcharge on international atm or pos transactions that 's the carrier such as visa or mastercard taking their cut for processing interestingly enough you also typically get the carrier set exchange rate overseas when using your card in other words your bank has a cash eurusd of $ 1.30 but the conversion you get at the atm is visa 's rate hence the visa fee but it 's typically a nicer spread or it 's sometimes the international spot rate depending on the circumstances due to the overhead of electronic transactions you also have to consider the atm charging you a separate fee for it 's own operation in essence the fees exist to pad every player involved except you some cards do you a solid by advertising $ 0 foreign exchange fees unfortunately these cards only insulate you from the processing flat fees and you may still fall prey to the fee hidden in the spread in the scheme of things currency exchange is a retail operation they try to make money on every step that requires them to expend a resource if you pay 10 on a money transaction this differs actually very little from the mark up you pay on your groceries which varies from 3 5 on dry food to 20 on alcohol such as wine

for one thing fund managers even fund management companies own less money than their clients put together on the whole they simply can not underwrite 50 of the potential losses of the funds they manage and an offer to do so would be completely unsecured warren buffet owns about 1/3 of berkshire hathaway so i suppose maybe he could do it if he wanted to and i wo n't guess why he prefers his own business model investing in the fund he manages or used to manage over the one you propose for him keeping his money in something so secure he could use it to cover arbitrary losses on b h buffett and his investors have always felt that he has sufficient incentive to see b h do well and it 's not clear that your scheme would provide him any useful further incentive you say that the details are immaterial supposing instead of 50 it was one part in a million then it would be completely plausible for a fund manager to offer this invest 50 million lose it all and i 'll buy dinner to but would you be as attracted to it as you would be to 50 then the details are material actually a fund manager could do it by taking your money putting 50 into the fund and 50 into a cash account if you make money on the fund you only make half as much as if you 'd been fully invested so half your profit has been taken when you get back the fund value + cash if you lose money on the fund pay you back 50 of your losses using the cash worst case scenario the fund is completely wiped out but you still get back 50 of your initial investment the combined investment vehicle has covered exactly half your losses and it subtracts exactly half your profit the manager has offered the terms you asked for -50 leverage but still does n't have skin the game your proposed terms do not provide the incentive you expect why do n't fund managers offer this because with a few exceptions 50 is an absurd amount for an investment fund to keep in cash and nobody would buy it if you want to use cash for that level of inverse leverage you call the bank open an account and keep the interest for yourself you do n't expect your managed fund to do it furthermore supposing the manager did invest 100 of your subscription in the fund and cover the risk with their own capital that means the only place they actually make any profit is the return on a risk that they take with their capital on the fund 's wins losses you 've given them no incentive to invest your money as well as their own they might as well just put their capital in the fund and let you keep your money they 're better off without you since there 's less paperwork and they can invest whatever they like instead of carefully matching whatever money you send them if you think they can make better picks than you and you want them to do so on your behalf then you need to pay them for the privilege riding their for free is not a service they have any reason to offer you it turns out that you can not force someone to expose themselves to a particular risk other than by agreeing that they will expose themselves to that risk and then closely monitoring their investment portfolio otherwise they can find ways to insure hedge the risk they 're required to take on if it 's on their books but cancelled by something else then they are n't really exposed so to provide incentive what we normally want is what buffett does which is for the fund manager to be invested in the fund to keep them keen and to draw a salary in return for letting you in their investment can not precisely match yours because the fund manager 's capital does n't precisely match your capital it does n't cover your losses because it 's in the same fund so if your money vanishes the fund manager loses too and has nothing to cover you with but it does provide the incentive all right i admit it worst case scenario there 's a total banking collapse end of civilization as we know it and the cash account defaults but then even in your proposed scheme it 's possible that whatever assets the fund manager was using as security could fail to so why you might ask do individual fund managers get bonuses in return for meeting fixed targets instead of only being part paid in shares in their own fund whose value they can then maximise i honestly do n't know but i suspect lots of reasons probably the psychology of rewarding them for performance in a way that compares with other executive posts or professions they might take up instead of fund management probably the benefit to the fund itself which wants to attract more clients of beating certain benchmarks probably other things including frankly human error in setting their compensation packages

what are you using the analysis for if your analyzing your interest rate risk then you want to determine decay rates for your non maturity deposits assuming your bank uses software to produce your earnings at risk ear and economic value of equity eve metrics the decay rate assumptions make a big difference in those numbers most models have default assumptions that may not be correct for your institution and as a result are giving you ear and eve numbers that are not at all accurate    basically you want to have some analysis that proves how you are your 12 24 months are your deposits sticky or are they affected by small changes in interest rates you can look at historical numbers to determine how your deposits behave but be sure to go back more than 3 4 years as deposit behavior has been pretty abnormal since 2008 with rates near zero similarly you may want to try and identify surge deposits that came into your bank due to the low rate environment and as soon as rates rise they will move into higher earning assets stocks bond money markets

the important thing to realize is what would you do if you did n't have the call if you did n't have call options but you wanted to have a position in that particular stock you would have to actually purchase it but having purchased the shares you are at risk to lose up to the entire value of if the company folded or something like that   a call option reduces the potential loss since you are at worst only out the cost of the call and you also lose a little on the upside since you had to pay for the call which will certainly have some premium over buying the underlying share directly risk can be defined as reducing the variability of outcomes so since calls shorts etc reduce potential losses and also slightly reduce potential gains they pretty much by definition reduce risk it 's also worth noting that when you buy a call the seller could also be seen as hedging the risk of price decreases while also guaranteeing that they have a buyer at a certain price so they may be more concerned about having cash flow at the right time while at the same time reducing the cost of the share losing in value than they are losing the potential upside if you do exercise the option shorts work in the same way but opposite direction to calls and forwards and futures contracts are more about cash flow management making sure you have the right amount of money in the right currency at the right time regardless of changes in the costs of raw materials or currencies while either party may lose on the transaction due to price fluctuations both parties stand to gain by being able to know exactly what they will get and exactly what they will have to pay for it so that certainty is worth something and certainly better for some firms than leaving positions exposed of course you can use them for speculative purposes and a good number of firms people do but that 's not really why they were invented

you should not buy for the dividend the price of bhp is going down for a reason if you hold until the full years dividend is paid you will make 11 which is $ 110 if you bought $ 1000 worth of shares but if the share price keeps dropping you might lose 50 on the stock so you make $ 110 on dividends but lose $ 500 on stock price drop a perfect way to lose money

depends on how urgent your need for the emergency savings might be if the money market account allows you to get your money in the same amount of time as the savings account then there is no real downside but if the account takes a few days for you to access and you need your money sooner then you probably should n't also money market accounts do give more interest than most savings accounts but the interest rates are generally still pretty low so it might be an improvement but probably not a huge one

let me offer what i did in a similar situation two points a we were banking $ 20k yr or so to the cash fund 2 good incomes and the ability to go indefinitely on just one of the 2 b a heloc that was    the result was to mentally treat the heloc as our emergency fund but to enjoy the interest savings of over $ for the $ 100 k that had a return   when i first referenced this story i came under criticism fair enough it 's not for everyone let 's jump ahead we owe $ k we had tapped the equity line for brief periods but never over $ 20,000 when we lost our jobs both of us we had hit our number and are semi retired now our retirement budget included the current mortgage payment so we are in line for that dropping out of the budget in 12 years and starting social security after that which i did not include as part of the budget   note when we lost our jobs the severance was 6 month 's pay and we collected unemployment as well the first 12 months were covered without tapping our retirement funds at all so to nick 's point and excellent answer our first line of defense against unemployment was this combination of severance and unemployment insurance

in the us gift tax always falls on the donor never the recipient and gifts are not taxable income to the recipient the irs could raise questions if there is an employer employee relationship between donor and recipient your employer can not give you money or property e.g. a rolex watch or benefits e.g. a house to live in rent free and claim that it is a gift so that you do not have to pay income tax on that money   but your parents need to be careful that $ 14 k per person is the exemption for the whole year and once they give you that anything extra birthday present christmas present etc is subject to gift tax for them though you can still enjoy your gifts without any tax issue

i have found a good explanation here financing is calculated by taking the overall position size and multiplying it by libor + say 2 and then dividing by 365 x the amount of days the position is open for instance the interest rate applicable for overnight long positions may be 6 or 0.06 to calculate how much it would cost you to hold a long position for x number of days you would need to make this pro rata meaning that you would need to divide the 0.06 by 365 and multiply it by x days and then multiply this by the trade size so for example for a trade size of $ 20,000 held for 30 days the interest cost would be about $ it is important to note that due to financing long positions held for extended periods can reduce returns

talk about coincidence we just recieved letters from our bank saying that our interest only loans will be going up by and if we want to keep our lower rate we will need to change early to now our interest only periods end in 6 months to about 16 months anyway we have decided to change to p&i early and save on our interest expenses why because the main purpose of investing is to make money not to save on tax even if you are on the highest marginal tax rate for every extra dollar of expenses you spend and claim as a deduction you will only get about 50 cents back through tax savings if you are on the lowest marginal tax rate your tax savings will reduce to less than 20 cents for every extra dollar spent if you are investing in order to save on tax you may be investing for the wrong reasons your primary reason for investing should be to make money for wealth creation a good reason to stay with an interest only loan for an investment property would be if you require the extra cash flow you would receive compared with an loan

my answer is specific to the us because you mentioned the federal reserve but a similar system is in place in most countries do interest rates increase based on what the market is doing or do they solely increase based on what the federal reserve sets them at there are actually two rates in question here the wikipedia article on the federal funds rate has a nice description that i 'll summarize here the interest rate that 's usually referred to is the federal funds rate and it 's the rate at which banks can lend money to each other through the federal reserve the nominal federal funds rate this is a target set by the board of governors of the federal reserve at each meeting of the federal open market committee fomc when you hear in the media that the fed is changing interest rates this is almost always what they 're referring to the actual federal funds rate through the trading desk of the new york federal reserve the fomc conducts open market operations to enforce the federal funds rate thus leading to the actual rate which is the rate determined by market forces as a result of the fed 's operations open market operations involve buying and selling short term securities in order to influence the rate as an example the current nominal federal funds rate is 0 in economic parlance this is known as the zero lower bound while the actual rate is approximately 25 basis points or 0.25 why is it assumed that interest rates are going to increase when the federal reserve ends qe3 i do n't understand why interest rates are going to increase in the united states quantitative easing is actually a little different from the usual open market operations the fed conducts open market operations usually involve the buying and selling of short term treasury securities in qe however especially the latest and ongoing round qe3 the fed has been purchasing longer term treasury securities and mortgage backed securities mbs by purchasing mbs the fed is trying to reduce the overall risk of the commercial housing debt market furthermore the demand created by these purchases drives up prices on the debt which drives down interest rates in the commercial housing market to clarify the debt market i 'm referring to is the market for mortgage backed securities and other debt derivatives cdo 's for instance i 'll use mbs as an example the actual mortgages are sold to companies that securitize them by pooling them and issuing securities based on the value of the pool this process may happen numerous times since derivatives can be created based on the value of the mbs themselves which in turn are based on housing debt in other words mbs are n't exactly the same thing as housing debt but they 're based on housing debt it 's these packaged securities the fed is purchasing not the mortgages themselves   once the fed draws down qe3 however this demand will probably decrease as the fed its balance sheet over several years and demand decreases throughout the market prices will fall and interest rates in the commercial housing market will fall ideally the fed will wait until the economy is healthy enough to absorb the unloading of these securities   just to be clear the interest rates that qe3 are targeting are different from the interest rates you usually hear about it 's possible for the fed to unwind qe3 while still keeping the interest rate i.e. the federal funds rate near zero although this is considered unlikely also the fed can target long term vs. short term interest rates as well which is once again slightly different from what i talked about above this was the goal of the operation twist program in 2011 and in the 1960 's gave a great description of the program in this answer but basically the fed purchased long term securities and sold short term securities with the goal of twisting the yield curve to lower long term interest rates relative to short term rates the goal is to encourage people and businesses to take on long term debt e.g. mortgages capital investments etc my main question that i 'm trying to understand is why interest rates are what they are is it more of an arbitrary number set by central banks or is it due to market activity hopefully i addressed much of this above but i 'll give a quick summary there are many interest rates in numerous different financial markets the rate most commonly talked about is the nominal federal funds rate that i mentioned above although it 's a target set by the board of governors it 's not arbitrary there 's a reason the federal reserve hires hundreds of research economists no central bank arbitrarily sets the interest rate it 's determined as part of an effort to reach certain economic benchmarks for the foreseeable future whatever those may be   in the us current fed policy maintains that the federal funds rate should be approximately zero until the economy the unemployment and inflation benchmarks set forth by the rule named after charles the president of the federal reserve bank of chicago who pushed for the rule the effective federal funds rate as well as other rates the fed has targeted like interest rates on commercial housing debt long term rates on treasury securities etc are market driven the fed may enter the market but the same forces of supply and demand are still at work although the fed 's actions are controversial the effects of their actions are still bound by market forces so the policies and their effects are anything but arbitrary

there are interpersonal relationships risks which you should consider these are most likely to following a financial problem and depend on your existing relationship   in this answer i 'm going to focus on the financial risks   this is not financial advice but my understanding as someone who has done this this is best thought of as a loan from my parents to myself   the main financial risks for my parents the lenders to avoid these risks i need to ensure that i am sufficient ahead of loan repayments that i have the full amount of principal available to repay at any time    redraw facility while some loans may allow for redraw you should check the fine print of your loan agreement   a redraw is like borrowing from the bank using existing collateral   there could be some circumstances under which the bank does not allow redraw even though you are ahead of loan repayments   this might happen if house prices drop enough that you no longer have equity offset account to avoid this problem the loaned money is best put in an offset account   an offset account reduces the interest on the loan   importantly the money in the offset account is yours   withdrawal from the offset account does not represent a new borrowing but is a withdrawal from savings account   savings are government guaranteed to some figure

quoted from nasdaq has come up with an auction approach called the opening cross here 's how it works in the morning a computer program looks at all the orders that have come in overnight in each different stock based on those orders the program picks a price level that would be the best opening price however it also looks to see if there 's a trade imbalance for example if a company announced bad news after the market closed there might be 10 times more sell orders than buy orders nasdaq then broadcasts the price and imbalance information to its network of dealers with the goal of offsetting the imbalance it then lets dealers place orders this all happens very quickly in a time window of two minutes or so right before the market opens dealers can place orders and those orders are factored into the opening price further reading here opening price calculation

how are shareholders sure to receive a fair percentage of each company   at the time the split occurs each investor owns the same proportion of each new company that they owned in the first   what the investor does with it after that selling one for example is irrelevant from a fairness perspective suppose company a splits into companies b and c.   you own enough stock to have 1 of a.   it splits   now you have a bunch of shares of b and c.   how much   well you have 1 of b and 1 of c.   what if all the profitable projects are in b   then shares of b will be worth more than those of c.   but it should be the case that the value of your shares of b plus the value of your shares of c are equal to the original value of your shares of a.   completely fair   in fact if the split was economically justified then b + c > a.   and the gains are realized proportionally by all equityholders remember when a stock splits every share splits so that everyone owns both companies in the same proportion as everyone else   executives do n't determine what the prices of the resulting companies are that is determined by the market   a fair market will value the child companies such that together they are worth what the original was

i want to shop in the currency that will be cheapest in cad at any    given time how do you plan to do this if you are using a debit or credit card on a cad account then you will pay that bank 's exchange rate to pay for goods and services that are billed in foreign currency if you plan on buying goods and services from merchants that offer to bill you in cad for items that are priced in foreign currency e.g. buying from gbp priced goods but having amazon bill your card with equivalent cad then you will be paying that merchant 's exchange rate it is very unlikely that either of these scenarios would result in you paying mid market rates what you see on xe.com which is the average between the current ask and bid prices for any currency pair instead the business handling your transaction will set their own exchange rate which will usually be less favorable than the mid market rate and may have additional fees commission on as a separate charge   for example if i buy 100 usd worth of goods from a us vendor but use a cad credit card to pay the mid market rate on xe.com right now indicates an equivalent value of cad however the credit card company is more likely to charge closer to cad and add a foreign transaction fee of maybe $ 2 3 or a percentage of the transaction value alternatively if using something like amazon they may offer to bill the cad credit card in cad for those 100 usd goods no separate foreign transaction fee in this case but they are still likely to exchange at the less favorable rate instead of the mid market rates the only way you can choose to pay in the cheapest equivalent currency is if you already have holdings of all the different currencies then just pay using whichever currency gets you the most bang for your buck unless you are receiving payments wages in multiple currencies though you 're still going to have to refill these accounts periodically thus incurring some foreign transaction fees and being subject to the banker 's exchange rates where can i lookup accurate current exchange rates for consumers it depends on who will be handling your transaction amazon will tell you at the checkout what exchange rate they will apply if you are having them convert a bill into your local currency for you for credit debit card transactions processed in a different currency than the attached account you need to look at your specific agreement or contact the bank to see which rate they use for daily transactions and where you can obtain these rates whether they convert on the day of the transaction vs. the day it posts to your account and how much they add on $ and/or in fees and commission

the upvoted answers fail to note that dividends are the only benefit that investors collectively receive from the companies they invest in if you purchase a share for $ 100 and then later sell it for $ 150 you should note that there is always someone that purchases the same share for $ 150 so you get $ 150 immediately but somebody else has to pay $ 150 immediately so investors collectively did not receive any money from the transaction yes share repurchase can be used instead of dividends but it can be considered really another form of paying dividends the fair value of a stock is the discounted value of all future dividends the stock pays it is so simple this shows why dividends are important somebody might argue that many successful companies like berkshire hathaway do not pay dividend yes it is true that they do n't pay dividend now but they will eventually have to start paying dividend if they reinvest potential dividends continuously they will run out of things to invest in after several hundred years has passed so even in this case the value of the stock is still the discounted value of all future dividends the only difference is that the dividends are not paid now the companies will start to pay the dividends later when they run out of things to invest in it is true that in theory a stock could pay an unsustainable amount of dividend that requires financing it with debt this is obviously not a good solution if you see a company that pays dividend while at the same time obtaining more cash from taking more debt or from share issues think twice whether you want to invest in such a company what you need to do to companies fairly is to estimate the amount of dividend that can sustain the expected growth rate it is typically about 60 of the earnings because a part of the earnings needs to be invested in future growth but the exact figure may vary depending on the company furthermore to a company you need the expected growth rate of dividends and the discount rate you simply discount all future dividends correcting them up by the expected dividend growth rate and correcting them down by the discount rate

in a sentence stocks are a share of equity in the company while bonds are a share of credit to the company when you buy one share of stock you own a typically percentage of the company you are usually entitled to a share of the profits of that company and/or to participate in the business decisions of that company a particular type of stock may or may not pay dividends which is the primary way companies share profits with their stockholders the other way is simply by increasing the company 's share value by being successful and thus desirable to investors a stock also may or may not allow you to vote on company business you may hear about companies buying 20 or 30 interests in other companies they own that percentage of the company and their vote on company matters is given that same weight in the total voting pool typically a company offers two levels of stocks common stock usually has voting rights attached and may pay dividends preferred stock usually gives up the voting rights but pays a higher dividend percentage maybe double or triple that of common stock and may have payment guarantees if a promised dividend is missed in one quarter and then paid in the next the preferred stockholders get their dividend for the past and present quarters before the common shareholders see a penny governments and non profits are typically prohibited from selling their equity if a government sold stock it would basically be taxing everyone and then paying back stockholders while non profit organizations have no profits to pay out as dividends bonds on the other hand are a slice of the company 's debt load think of bonds as kind of like a corporate credit card when a company needs a lot of cash it will sell bonds a single bond may be worth $ 10 $ 100 or $ 1000 depending on the investor market being targeted this is the amount the company will pay the bondholder at the end of the term of the bond these bonds are bought by investors on the open market for less than their face value and the company uses the cash it raises for whatever purpose it wants before paying off the bondholders at term 's end usually by paying each bond at face value using money from a new package of bonds in effect rolling over the debt to the next cycle similar to you carrying a balance on your credit card the difference between the cost and payoff is the interest charge on this slice of the loan and can be expressed as a percentage of the purchase price over the remaining term of the bond as its yield or apy for example a bond worth $ 100 that was sold on jan 1 for $ 85 and is due to be paid on dec 31 of the same year has an apy of 100 = typically yields for highly rated companies are more like 4 6 a bond that would yield 17 is very risky and indicates a very low bond rating so called junk status

i 've been using ynab4 for the last few years and i like it so much that i have n't switched to the web version new ynab yet   however i have played around with the web version a little and here is what i have discovered despite the different look of the credit card account and the lengthy dissertation on the credit card differences in the transition guide credit cards are handled almost exactly the same in the new ynab as they were in ynab4 you enter credit card spending transactions in the same way as ynab4   when you enter a transaction money is pulled out of the budget category you select   the only difference is that in ynab4 this money was considered gone   now that money moves from your budget category into the new credit card category when it comes time to pay the credit card bill you also enter this transaction in the same way as before   it is entered as a transfer of money from your checking account to your credit card account   the only difference here is that with new ynab the funds are deducted from your credit card category   this is handled automatically so you do n't have to think about it if you do n't want to    if you always pay your credit card bill in full you never have to budget money manually into the credit card category   the money will already be there from when you entered the credit card spending transactions   the only time you would manually budget money into the credit card spending category is if you have old credit card debt that you are trying to pay off a quick example in pictures i start out with $ 10,000 in my checking account and no credit card debt   i 've got all $ 10,000 in my fun money category   now i spend $ 100 at the store   you can see that just like in ynab4 the credit card account is now in the red $ 100 and the checking account balance has not changed in the categories my fun money category is down $ 100 to $ 9,900 just like it would be in ynab4   the only difference is that there is now $ 100 in the new credit card payments category   when it is time to pay the bill i enter an account transfer just like in ynab4   note that the credit card balance is back to $ 0 and the checking account balance is now down to $ 9,900 the credit card payment budget category is now magically back to $ 0   the above example starts with a zero balance on the credit card   however most people will have a non zero balance on their credit card when they first start a budget   in ynab4 when you added a credit card with a negative balance the debt was shown in a budget category called pre ynab debt   you then added money to this budget category until it went to zero and then you did n't need this budget category anymore with new ynab credit card balances are not shown in budget categories   if you add a credit card account with a balance the debt is not shown in the budget categories   to pay off this debt you can fund the credit card payments category   after this existing balance amount is paid off you wo n't need to fund the credit card payments category anymore as long as you properly assign each new credit card purchase to a funded budget category

it definitely depends on the exchange you are trading on i 'm not familiar with scottrade but a standard practice is to fulfill limit orders in the order they are placed    most of the time you would n't see stocks trade significantly under your bid price but since penny stocks are very volatile it 's more likely their price could drop quickly past your bid and then return above it while only fulfilling a portion of the orders placed example 1 penny stock priced at $ 0.12 2 others place limit orders to buy at $ 0.10 3 you place limit order to buy at $ 0.10 4 stock price drops to $ 0.07 and some orders are filled anything $ 0.07 or higher based on a first come first served basis 5 due to the increase in purchases of the penny stock the price rises above $ 0.10 before your order is filled edit adding additional clarification from comment section a second example if the price drops from $ 0.12 to $ 0.07 then orders for all prices from $ 0.07 and above will start to be filled from the oldest order first that might mean that the oldest order was a limit buy order for 100 shares at $ 0.09 and since that is above the current ask price it will be filled first the next order might be for 800 shares at $ 0.07 it 's possible for a subset of these to be filled let 's say 400 before the share 's price increases from the increased demand then if the price goes above $ 0.10 your bid will not be filled during that time

there is no simple rule like you can can't spend more less than $ x per person instead there is a test there is such a thing as an audit of just your travel and entertainment expenses i know because i 've had one for my ontario corporation i 've deducted company christmas parties and going away dinners for departing employees without incident you know i presume about only deducting half of certain expenses if the reason for the entertainment is to acquire or keep either employees or clients there should n't be a problem   things are slightly trickier with very small companies microsoft can send an entire team to hawaii with their families as a reward at the end of a tough project and deduct it you probably ca n't send yourself as a similar reward if your party is strictly for your neighbours personal friends and close family with no clients potential clients employees potential employees suppliers or potential suppliers in attendance then no do n't deduct it if you imagine yourself telling an auditor why you threw the party and why the business funded it you 'll know whether it 's ok to do it or not

gt less capital tax = less pressure on the wealthy entrepreneurs since you keep bigger portion of your net income the interest to bring back business should increase = capital inflow back to the us   imo this statement makes a whole lot of assumptions that are untrue   1 the wealthy create jobs   i believe the opposite is true   i think if you want more companies jobs you should offer universal healthcare so low to middle class folks can risk leaving an established company to start on their own   2 more money to the rich means more investment in the economy my experience shows the rich will use the money to grow their own wealth not everyone 's i remember a recent bloomberg article where businessmen said they would use repatriated money for buyouts competition and growing a company 's hold on the market   3 take home money is used for investment   it is n't companies do the large investments not individuals   consider amazon looking at growing their distribution channels or apple with their iphone evolution   if you make it more profitable for corporate profits to go to compensation you leave less money for investment   4 companies struggle in the us due to this is a flat out myth cost of taxes for business in the us is one of the lowest for rich educated countries and that is before the tax kickbacks a la foxconn or loopholes   5 and the imo the us has been fed the lie that the best thing for the citizens of the country is aligned with the best things for the country 's companies the opposite is the case

the best thing for you to do will be to start using the cash flow report instead of the income and expense report go to reports > income and expense > cash flow once the report is open open the edit window and open the accounts tab   there choose your various cash accounts checking saving etc   in the general tab choose the reporting period   and then save the report settings so you do n't need to go hunting for your cash accounts each time gnucash will display for you all the inflows and outflows of money which appears to be what you really want though gnucash does n't present the cash flow in a way that matches united states accounting rules with sections for operating investing and financial cash flows separated it is certainly fine for your personal use if you want the total payment to show up as one line on the cash flow report you will need to book the accrual of interest and the payment to the mortgage bank as two separate entries normal entry for mortgage payments which shows up as a line for mortgage and a line for interest on your cash flow pair of entries to make full mortgage payment show up as one line on cash flow entry 1   interest accrual entry 2   full mortgage payment tested in gnucash

as i understand it the usual rule is that the country you are resident in taxes you on your worldwide income but gives you credit for foreign tax paid the country you are not normally resident in taxes you only on income from that one country note that residence for tax purposes can have different rules from residence for immigration purposes at least in the uk being resident in the country for more than half the tax year normally makes you tax resident and there are some other cases too i expect other countries are similar but the details of the rules and the start end of the tax years may vary i do n't know the exact rules for finland and belgium but i expect your belgian taxes will be based on your belgian income only and your finnish taxes will be based on your worldwide income but with a credit for your belgian taxes engaging accountants from both countries to confirm the exact rules and what exactly you should put on the forms is almost certainly a good idea

you are thinking about it this way the longer i wait to the more knowledge and information i 'll have thus the more confidence i can have that i 'll be able to sell at a profit minimizing risk if i exercise early and still have to wait there may never be a chance i can sell at a profit and i 'll have lost the money i paid to exercise and any tax i had to pay when i exercised all of that is true but if you exercise early the fair market value of the stock will probably be lower so you may pay less income tax when you exercise this depends on your tax situation currently iso exercises affect your amt if the company goes through a phase where the value is unusually high you 'll be able to sell and still get the tax benefits because you exercised earlier you avoid the nightmare scenario where you leave the company voluntarily or not and ca n't afford to exercise your options because of the tax implications in many realistic cases exercising earlier means less risk imagine if you 're working at a company that is privately held and you expect to be there for another year or so you are very optimistic about the company but not sure when it will ipo or get acquired and that may be several years off the fair market value of the stock is low now but may be much higher in a year in this case it makes a lot of sense to exercise now the cost is low because the fair market value is low so it wo n't result in a huge tax bill and then when you leave in a year you wo n't have to choose between forfeiting your options or borrowing money to pay the much higher taxes due to exercise them then

smart money merriam webster is simply a term that refers to the money that successful investors invest   it can also refer to the successful investors themselves   when someone tells you to follow the smart money they are generally telling you to invest in the same things that successful investors invest in   for example you might decide to invest in the same things that warren buffett invests in    however there are a couple of problems with blindly following someone else 's investments without knowing what you are doing first you are not in the same situation that the expert is in   warren buffett has a lot of money in a lot of places   he can afford to take some chances that you might not be able to take   so if you choose only one of his investments to copy and it ends up being a loser he is fine but you are not second when warren buffett makes large investments he affects the price of stocks   for example warren buffett 's company recently purchased $ 1 billion worth of apple stock   as soon as this purchase was announced the price of apple stock went up 4 from people purchasing the stock trying to follow warren buffett    that having been said it is a good idea to watch successful investors and learn from what they do   if they see a stock as something worth investing in find out what it is that they see in that company

each of us makes our own way in life making choices based upon or own needs and desires some of us choose to live simple lives others choose more complex lives where we earn and spend more there are several points which one should examine and consider consider that the market for new cars is not the entire population but only the fraction of the population that can afford to spend $ 20,000 + for a new car at $ payments you quickly realize that most people making below median income can not afford to purchase a new car they buy used cars from the pool of cars left after depreciation has reduced the price of the car by half or more one rule of thumb might be to spend < 10 of your income on transportation which might allow for a $ 400 500/month car payment for half of families and when you keep a car for 10 years that can mean two cars one payment free consider that a new honda accord or toyota camry is $ 20 30,000 which is 2/3 to 3/4 the price of a new luxury car when i purchased my used civic several years ago the price was nearly 1/2 the price of a new luxury car i recently purchased a used luxury car 7 year old 70,000 miles less than 1/3 the new price the leather interior looks new more amenities better performance than my civic the car runs well and with proper maintenance i expect to drive it for 2 3 years and pass it along to one of my children

gold 's value starts with the fact that its supply is steady and by nature it 's durable in other words the amount of gold traded each year the supply and demand is small relative to the existing total stock this acting as a bit of a throttle on its value as does the high cost of mining mines will have yields that control whether it 's profitable to run them a mine may have a $ production cost in which case it 's clear they should run full speed now with gold at $ 1200 but if it were below $ 650 or so it may not be worth it it also has a history that goes back it 's valued because it always was john maynard keynes referred to gold as an archaic relic and i tend to agree you are right the topic is controversial for short periods gold will provide a decent hedge but no better than other financial instruments we are now in an odd time where the stock market is generally flat to where it was 10 years ago and both cash or most commodities were a better choice   look at sufficiently long periods of time and gold fails in my history i graduated college in 1984 and in the summer of 82 played in the commodities market gold peaked at $ 850 or so now it 's $ 1200 50 over 30 years is hardly a of value now is it yet i recall aug 25 1987 when the dow peaked at no i did n't call the top but i did talk to a friend advising that i ignore the short term at 25 with little invested i only concerned myself with long term plans the dow crashed from there but even today just over 18,000 the return has averaged plus dividends a lengthy tangent but important to understand a gold fan will be able to produce his own observation citing that some percent of one 's holding in gold adjusted to maintain a balanced allocation would create more positive returns than i claim for a large enough portfolio that 's otherwise well diversified this may be true just not something i choose to invest in last if you wish to buy gold avoid the hard metal gld trades as 1/10 oz of gold and has a tiny commission as it trades like a stock the buy sell on a 1 oz gold piece will cost you 4 6 that 's no way to invest update 29 years after that lunch in 1987 the dow was at a return of cagr plus dividends another 6 years since this question was asked and gold has n't moved $ and 6 years worth of fees 2.4 if you buy the gld etf from the 82 high of $ 850 to now 34 years the return has a cagr of or after fees to be fair i picked a relative high that $ 850 but i did the same choosing the pre crash high on the dow

last month i spend about 3 4 days totally diving into the kindle e books drm etc   my goal was to basically replace my entire book collection online with books that i could edit etc     the result   kindle and the drm suck   the pirate experience an order of magnitude better than the kindle and drm experience   1   not all books are even available on the kindle or other drm platforms   pirated books   not a problem i can pretty much get any book i want in a matter of minutes   sometimes i have to spend a while to find them maybe 10 15 minutes   2   the quality of the drm books are horrible   for kindle they use fixed width graphics   however many of the pdf books that i 've been using use pdfs and vector graphics which means they look nice on my 30 monitor   4   i can use skim to edit and manipulate the books i can attach i can copy text out i can add bookmarks i can highlight pages   in kindle i can do this but it 's very basic and frankly the highlighting sucks and is hard to use     5   the kindle books are handicapped by the publishers and they wo n't let you actually copy text from them some of the publishers do let you do this but i want a consistent experience i do n't want to be reading a book and want to copy a paragraph to a friend only to find out that this is disabled   6   some of the magazine editions suck they are the same price as the news stand one but do n't actually include the full magazine   and no where on the site does it say this some of these do end up getting downvoted in the amazon reviews but i 've accidentally purchased a few of these and felt screwed   7   many most of the books you use do n't actually have an   they 're just flat out stripped removed   this is because the kindle pages and the book pages do n't line up however in pdf versions they are there and they 're working   i think the pdfs are the leaked master copy which they use to print the book   8   some of my kindle books are far inferior to the print edition that i actually own due to misc errors   for example one of them is missing a whole 2 chapters at the end which were author notes after the book was written but the kindle version says it 's the same edition as the one i own   9   what about bugs   if they make a mistake do they give you a new copy of the book   for example in 8 that 's clearly a bug they should have included those two chapters   do i get a new copy of the book when they fix it   will they ever fix it   do my notes highlights work with the new version do i get to keep the older version   in short i do not mind paying   in fact i allocated the money to upgrade my entire book collection to electronic   but i 'll be damned if i do that now the experience is so bad that i do n't want to give them the satisfaction of taking my money for this crap   further e books could be a revolution in the way we perceive books   why are we limiting ourselves to just text   why not interactive graphs spreadsheets charts i should be able to manipulate the examples change numbers zoom in etc     high resolution images for example that look awesome on my 30 display   video included embedded directly into the book   audio and audio commentary by the author   the entertainment industry went this way with dvds to encourage people to buy this format over the version   we need to do this with too     one could do this with html5 but it needs to be done right   some sort of simple zip with html inside which can be viewed by normal browsers    i 'll also say this i 'm not too concerned about the drm   just in terms of innovation this would be a major step forward     books and print media is dying but we could revolutionize it and embrace the digital publishing medium and really kick ass   edit   holy shit that was long the adderall must have just kicked in

look at a mixture of low fee index funds low fee bond funds and cds the exact allocation has to be tailored to your appetite for risk if you only want to park the money with essentially no risk of loss then you need fdic insured products like cds or a money market account as opposed to a money market fund which is not fdic insured however as others have said interest rates are awful now   since you are in your early 30 's and expect to keep this investment for 10 + years you can probably tolerate a bit of risk also considering speaking to a tax professional to determine the specific tax benefits drawbacks of one investment strategy funds and cds versus another e.g. real estate

i was able to attend an open discussion on illinois pensions a few years back   dick head of the illinois teacher 's retirement system spoke as did a public employee union leader governor 's budget director and who is a state   it was eye opening on many levels   some of the points that stick with me are       the state has never over 30 years followed standard practice and used an actuary to determine how much to put into the pension funds each year   the legislators just pulled numbers out of the air each year   as a result the pensions have never been properly funded    the benefits are rich but according to the people on this panel the main issue is this under funding      some years the state declared a pension holiday and put nothing into the pension funds at all   when this was brought up the largely union crowd started to turn on but she held up her hand said she had voted against that and then commented that the unions all signed off on the pension holidays   as one the crowd 's heads turned to the union rep on the board   he turned red and at the floor      2/3 of the teacher 's pension hole is for people already retired   changing benefits for current teachers will not help enough      i asked mr how much additional tax he would need to plug the hole in the system he manages   he answered double   i asked for how long   he said it does n't work like that   i 'd need double the current amount forever   i came away much better informed but deeply   like 69 of the people polled i want these teachers and public employee to get their money   i just do n't see how it can happen

i think the main question is whether the 1.5 quarterly fee is so bad that it warrants losing $ 60,000 immediately suppose they pull it out now so they have 60000 = $ 160,000   they then invest this in a low cost index fund earning say 6 per year on average over 10 years   the result alternatively they leave the $ 220,000 in but tell the manager to invest it in the same index fund now   they earn nothing because the manager 's fees eat up all the gains 4 1.5 = 6 not perfectly accurate due to compounding but close enough since 6 is only an estimate anyway   the result the same $ 220,000 they started with this back of the envelope calculation suggests they will actually come out ahead by biting the bullet and taking the money out   however i would definitely not advise them to take this major step just based on this simple calculation   many other factors are relevant e.g. taxes when selling the existing investment to buy the index fund how much of their savings was this $ 300,000   also i do n't know anything about how investment works in hong kong so there could be some wrinkles that modify or invalidate this simple calculation   but it is a starting point based on what you say here i 'd say they should take the earliest opportunity to tell everyone they know never to work with this investment manager   i would go so far as to say they should look at his credentials e.g. see what kind of financial advisor certification he has if any look up the ethical standards of their issuers and consider filing a complaint   this is not because of the performance of the investments losing 25 of your money due to market swings is a risk you have to accept but because of the exorbitant fees   unless hong kong has got some crazy kind of investment management market charging 1.5 quarterly is highway robbery charging a for withdrawal is   personally i would seriously consider withdrawing the money even if the manager 's investments had outperformed the market

i 've read this claim many times in the news banks are making less profit from the lending business when interest rates are historically low the issue with most loans is they can be satisfied at any time   when you have falling interest rates it means most of the banks loans are refinanced from nice high rates to current market low interest rates which can significantly reduce the expected return on past loans   the bank gets the money back when it wants it the least because it can only re lend the money at the current market lower interest rates   when interest rates are increasing refinance and early repayment activity reduces significantly it 's important to look at the loan from the point of view of the bank a bank must first issue out the entire principal amount   on a 60 month loan the lender has not received payments sufficient to satisfy the principal until around or month depending on the interest rate   if the bank receives payment of the outstanding amount on month 30 the expected return on that loan is reduced significantly consider a $ 10,000 60 month loan at 5 apr   the bank is expected to receive $ in total for interest income of $   if the loan is repaid on month 30 the total interest is about $ 972   that 's a 26 reduction of expected interest income and the money received can only be re lent for yet a lower interest rate add to this the tricky accounting of holding a loan which is really a discounted bond which is an asset on the books and profitability of lending while interest rates are falling gets really funky and this does n't even examine default risk cost

i can think of a few good reasons a company especially public usually wants their fourth quarter earnings to be the strongest of the year that ends each fiscal year on a high note for the company and its investors which helps public sentiment and boosts stock prices so travel agencies and airlines usually like ending their year in october or march in the between the summer and winter travel seasons with a large amount of that revenue falling within the company 's fiscal q4 oil companies sometimes do the same because fuel prices are seasonal for much the same reasons december is a really bad month to try to close out an entire year 's accounting books accountants and execs are on vacation for large parts of the month most retail stores are flooded with revenue and then contra revenue as items are returned that takes time to account at the store level and then filter up to the corporate office etc etc it also does n't tell the whole story for most retail outfits december sales are usually inflated by purchases that are then returned in january after all the as a result a fiscal year end in january or even february keeps the entire season 's revenues and expenses in one fiscal year

you should have separate files for each of the two businesses   the business that transfers money out should write check in its qb file   the business that receives money should make deposit in its qb file in qb you write check even when you make the payment by some other means like ach   neither business should have the bank accounts of the other explicitly represented    on each side you will also need to classify the payment as having originated from gone to some other account to know what 's correct there we 'd need to know why your transferring the money in the first place and how you otherwise have your books established   i think that 's probably beyond the scope of what 's on topic feasible here money into your business from your personal account is probably owner 's equity unless you have something else going on   for example on the s corp you should be paying yourself a salary   if you overpay by accident then you might write a check back to the company from your personal account to correct the mistake   that 's not equity it 's probably a negative expense in some other account that tracks the salary payments

when calculating the npv is there anything i need to do in between the project start date outlay nov 2017 and the first cash inflow july 2019 do i need to discount the cashflow to the present and if so how yes you need to discount every cash flow to the present time not just the first one    when discounting cash flows the appropriate discount rate needs to represent the opportunity cost of the initial cash outlay   meaning if you were to use that money for something else what rate of return would you expect you could be safe and assume only a risk free return like 2 3 or use the average rate of return of other investments e.g. 10 15 another common approach is to use your cost of capital if you 're raising funds for the project or would instead have use the funds to pay off existing debt once you find a relevant discount rate then just discount each cash flow by dividing them by where r is the annualized discount rate e.g. 0.10 for 10 and t is the decimal number of years between now and the cash flow e.g. 1.5 for 18 months

this is n't exactly an answer but i can not comment at the moment   i have bought a house in nz in the last year being my first there are a couple of things that you might need to watch out for with the first home subsidy the $ 5000 especially the one that says that you have to live in the house that you buy for a certain amount of time otherwise you have to pay it back   i also assume that you have been in the superannuation for at least 5 years you can only take $ 1000 for each year you have been in there up to $ 5000 you can take all of the funds except what the government has put in so if you have $ 4000 from your employer then you would probably have more in your contributions that you could use as well   you do n't have to have the 20 deposit to be able to buy a house i went through a broker and was able to get in with less not sure on the exact percentage the 20 does help to get the bank to put some extra funds in for legal fees etc my house was n't an investment property but i hope this helps

this is most likely protecting square 's relationship with visa mastercard amex etc credit card companies typically charge their customers a much higher interest rate with no grace period on cash advances withdrawals made from an atm using a credit card if you use square to generate something that looks like a merchandise transaction but instead just hand over a wad of banknotes you 're forcing the credit card company to apply their cheaper purchases interest rate on the transaction plus award any applicable cashback etc square would absolutely profit off of this but since it would result in less revenue for the partner credit card companies that would quickly sour the relationship and could even result in them terminating their agreements with square altogether this is the kind of activity they are trying to prevent   1 bill yourself $ 5,000 for merchandise but instead give yourself cash   2 earn 1.5 cashback $ 75   3 use $ of the cash and a $ 75 statement credit to pay your credit card statement   4 pocket the difference   5 repeat note the fees involved probably negate any potential gain shown in this example but i 'm sure with enough creative thinking someone would figure out a way to game the system if it was n't expressly forbidden in the terms of service

as you 're working you and your spouse were probably born after so i 'll assume that marriage allowance is relevant to you rather than married couple 's allowance the allowance applies if your husband or wife earns less than the personal allowance in salary £ and less than £ in savings interest for example it 's likely this will apply if he or she 's not working also you need to be only a basic rate taxpayer earning less than £ in that case they can register online to transfer £ of their personal allowance to you which will reduce your tax bill by £ if you yourself earn more than £ above the personal allowance this will usually work by hmrc issuing a new tax code to your employer who will then automatically withhold less of your salary you ca n't get your employer to do this directly you have to go via hmrc the allowance change will be effective as if from the start of the tax year in april 2015 so you will probably end up getting the proportion of the £ that you could have had up till now from april to august back all at once in your next pay cheque or possibly spread out over the rest of the tax year apart from that you 'll get it spread out evenly over the year i.e. about £

the june 2014 issue of barclays wealth 's compass magazine had a very nice succinct article on this topic value investing does a rules based approach work   it examines the performance of value and growth styles of investment in the msci world and s&p500 for a few decades back and reveals a surprisingly complicated picture depending on sector region and time period their summary is basically a closer look however shows that the overall success of value    strategies derives mainly from the 1970s and 1980s in the us value has underperformed growth for over 25 years    since peaking in july 1988 globally value experienced a 30 setback    in the late 1990s so that there are now periods with a length of    nearly 13 years over which growth has outperformed so the answer to does it beat the market is   it depends update in response to comment below the question of risk adjusted returns is interesting   to quote another couple of fragments from the piece since december 1974 msci world value has outperformed growth by    2.6 annually with lower risk this outperformance on a risk adjusted    basis is the so called value premium that eugene fama and kenneth    french first identified in 1992 and that outperformance has however come with more risk historical    volatility of the pure style indices has been 21 22 compared to 16    for the market from a maximum drawdown perspective the 69 drop    of pure value during the financial crisis exceeded the 51 drop of the    overall market

this is the best tl;dr i could make publication do minimum wage hikes aid workers the jury is still reduced by 85 i 'm a bot gt the nber working paper includes in their analysis all low wage workers across different industries that earn below a certain hourly wage such as $ 13 or $ 19 the authors worry that if the analysis only focused on workers who are either at or below the minimum wage it would overstate the dis employment effects if employers moved some workers to wages above the threshold minimum wage   gt in contrast the berkeley study focuses only on the food services and restaurant industry since that industry is likely to have the largest fraction of low wage workers affected by the minimum wage hike   gt in other words a control group is a group of geographic units that matches seattle so closely before the minimum wage increase that any difference in outcomes between seattle and can plausibly arise only from the minimum wage increase    extended summary**](http://np.reddit.com r autotldr | faq](http://np.reddit.com r autotldr comments/31b9fm faq_autotldr_bot/ version 1.65 tl;drs so far | feedback](http://np.reddit.com message compose?to=%23autotldr pm 's and comments are monitored constructive feedback is welcome | top keywords wage**^#1 work**^#2

tl;dr no it does n't count against the roth ira basis you can find out by looking at form 8606 part iii which is the part for distributions from roth ira line 19 is the sum of nonqualified distributions plus qualified first time homebuyer distributions you would put $ 10000 here then you would subtract $ 10000 on line 20 qualified first time homebuyer expenses to get $ 0 on line 21 you enter your basis on line 22 but since line 21 was 0 you stop you do not subtract anything from your basis if you take out more than $ 10000 then it 's only the part over $ 10000 that is subtracted from your basis

i read the book and i 'm willing to believe you 'd have a good chance of beating the market with this strategy it is a reasonable rational and mechanical investment discipline i doubt it 's overplayed and to the point that it wo n't ever work again but only if you stick to it and doing so would be very hard which is probably why it is n't overplayed and already this strategy makes you place trades in companies you often wo n't have heard of with volatile prices the best way to use the strategy would be to try to get it automated somehow and avoid looking at the individual stocks i bet to take your behavior out of it there may well be some risk factors in this strategy that you do n't have in an s&p 500 fund and those could explain some of the higher returns for example a basket of companies could be more vulnerable to economic events the strategy wo n't beat the market every year either so that can test your behavior strategies tend to work and then stop working as the book even mentions this is related to   whether other investors are piling in to the strategy and pushing up prices in part   but also outside events can just happen to line up poorly for a given strategy for example a bunch of the fundamental index etfs that looked at dividend yield launched right before all the high dividend financials investing in high dividend stocks probably is and was a reasonable strategy in general but it was n't a great strategy for a couple years there anytime you do n't buy the whole market you risk both positive and negative deviations from it here 's maybe a bigger picture point though i happen to think beating the market is a big old distraction for individual investors what you really want is predictable adequate returns who cares if the market returns 20 as long as your returns are adequate and who cares if you beat the market by 5 if the market 40 so i 'm not a huge fan of investment books that are structured around the topic of beating the market whether it 's index fund advocates saying you ca n't beat the market so buy the index or greenblatt saying here 's how to beat the market with this strategy it 's still all about beating the market and to me beating the market is just irrelevant nobody ever bought their food in retirement because they did or did not beat the market to me beating the market is a game for the kind of actively managed mutual fund that has a r squared correlation with the index often called an index hugger these funds are just trying to out a little bit better result than the market and often get a little bit worse result and overall are a lot of effort with no purpose just get the index fund rather than these if you 're getting active management involved i 'd rather see a big deviation from the index and i 'd like that deviation to be related to risk control hedging or pulling back to cash when valuations get rich or avoiding companies without a moat and margin of safety or whatever kind of risk control but something in a fund like this you are n't trying to beat the market you 're trying to increase the chances of adequate returns you 're optimizing for predictability i 'm not sure the magic formula is the best way to do that focused as it is on beating the market rather than on risk control sorry for the extra but i hope i answered the question a bit too

i went to the bank with my friends and told them that i saw the money in my account that it 's not mine and that they should investigate and send it back to wherever it came from right thing to do did you give this in writing do you have a stamped copy of the letter from bank that they accepted your complaint he has been calling with different phone number threatening me saying that he will kill me he will make sure i do n't return to my country alive and all lodge a formal police complaint and also i have not heard from the bank at all what should i do ensure that all your communication and follow up is in writing even email is fine but periodically send this via certified post with tracking number even when you call up the bank keep a track of calls after a day or two send a email saying further to calls 1 calls 2 calls 3 etc you are still a response from bank even after face to face visits record all your follow up and periodically send via email and after few email take a print of everything even if its 10 pages and send via certified mail the reason it is very important to have a written trail is if things go wrong law enforcement can accuse you to be part of fraud scam it will be difficult to establish you were the one who complained about it if not too difficult change you phone numbers yes definitely open the new bank account and do n't give this to a random stranger on internet

  gt this strategy is not for everyone borrowing against your home is psychologically difficult and if the investments do n't yield expected returns this strategy could yield negative results by re borrowing the equity in your home you are also removing your cushion of safety if the real estate or investment markets take a turn for the worse by creating an income producing portfolio in an unregistered account there can also be additional tax consequences so always consult with a professional financial advisor to determine whether this strategy is for you and if it is have it tailor made to you and your family 's personal financial situation

ah gotcha   that would be moving the country towards a more socialistic or system where the government controls more of the means of production   i think there would be a problem successful companies need to be disruptive and the larger you are the harder it is to try a different approach i think if the government did try to offer a competing product the would weigh down the offering   the only way the government could be assured a profitable business is to compete unfairly   consider one of the big government companies the post office   ups has always been seen as the higher quality delivery overnight shipping was considered impossible until fedex did it even today the usps is in serious financial trouble even though it is granted a monopoly on letter delivery it is illegal for ups and fedex to deliver letters the post office is too inefficient to make money on package delivery so they subsidize that side of their business selling stamps   gt so we could abolish income tax and lower taxes over all   imo the taxes will be paid one way or another if you cut income tax then it will be replaced with a payroll tax or sales tax or property tax or tariff or passed to you in the form of higher prices the only question is the definition of a person or group 's fair share

honestly i would look for a house you can afford and one that is below the maximum amount of what they are willing to lend you   the reason is owning a house is not a quick loan that you can pay off in a year or two unless you 're rich then i would question why are you even bothering with a loan this is a long term commitment can you honestly say your job will provide the money for the mortgage the upkeep and remodeling of the house even if it 's the perfect house you will want to change something make the bathroom bigger put in a pool table etc etc living expenses and any life throws at you like most of us that answer will be no always have money and supplies for that rainy day for those lean days for that mortgage payment and if nothing happens you can always use the money to pay the mortgage off faster or take a vacation
