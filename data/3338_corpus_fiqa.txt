since no one else answered this part of your question yet   checking your own credit score or report will not affect it in any way   it only hurts you when someone looks it up to run a credit check at your request for the purpose of possibly getting a loan for example a car dealership this only hurts it a tiny bit and is not worth worrying about unless you are going to 20 different car dealerships who each do a check however it is a good idea not to let them run your credit until you are seriously ready to buy a car in fact it is better to just get financing somewhere else and not let them run it at all

check with your bank   as of january 2015 the following banks and credit unions are offering free credit scores announced in the pipeline source banks to offer fico credit scores for free personal experience i 've been receiving free fico score from my credit union for more than 6 months now advice most people have multiple bank credit union accounts the fico score will be the same whoever offers it if none of your financial institutions offer you a free credit score then you may opt for free services like creditkarma.com or other paid services please note that a credit score is number summarizing your credit report and should not be confused   in the news

assuming you are asking about a credit score in the united states the following applies to find out your fico score navigate to the official site to help consumers receive their credit report from each of the three organizations providing these scores equifax experian and transunion   you are in many states entitled to a free copy of your credit report from each of these organizations annually    this copy of your credit report will not contain your credit score from that organization   it will however contain information that goes into your credit score the lines of credits on file any delinquencies reported etc if you decide you would like to pay for your credit score from each bureau you will have the option to receive this information while getting your credit report but you will have to pay a nominal fee for it   remember that each of the 3 bureaus gives you a different score   averaging your 3 scores should give you a good idea of your fico score   note that your report is far more important than your score once you know that you know if you 're in a good place or not these other questions are so close that they might even be considered duplicates and provide other suggestions for how to check your score as a warning do n't trust the many ads out there saying you can get your score for free   only is considered a safe place for entering the very personal information required to get a score   the ftc backs this up

unfortunately it 's not that easy not up to people up to the boards of directors at said companies if those boards see value in paying more for a ceo and less to what in their eyes are replaceable workers then ceo pay will stay where it is there needs to be real solutions set in place to accomplish anything   ex where do pay cuts stop is it just ceos because there are plenty of other executives who make millions as well even high level managers could make say $ year while the people directly under them make $ 75k so where is the cutoff point   tl;dr saying to pay higher ups less is nice but is n't a solution without a plan of how to distribute money more evenly

paying the minimum balance on a loan can be devastating and is highly un recommended it is important you understand your loan and the terms associated with it loans are given for a period of time but if you pay the minimum it does not mean you will pay it all off by the end when paying a loan money is applied to the interest first and any extra amount is then applied to the principle here 's an example if i have a $ 12 loan for 1 year the interest is 100 my minimum payment each month is $ 1 if i pay that minimum only i will be stuck paying $ 12 at the end of the loan why you ask because each month i 'm being charged $ 1 interest and the payment i am making is only going towards that interest however if i paid $ 2 instead now $ 1 goes to the principal the original $ 12 i borrowed this means that next month i will only be charged interest on $ 11 dollars instead of $ 12 you need to know how much is going towards the interest of your loan and how much is going towards the principle you can speak with your bank about this and they will help you understand in many cases they actually provide you with the numbers on your with examples of how long it would take to payoff your loan with minimum only and how long it would take if you added an extra x amount each month i recommend using the snowball method to pay of your debt it 's simple and effective how much you should add to each monthly payment depends on how much you can afford to add here are some calculators you can play around with cnn money bank rate calc edit so with the additional information you provided we can estimate that you have about 2200 free cash flow each 's your cash after you pay all your bills we can put away 500 each month for a rainy day fund just to be loss accidents or anything we ca n't predict so assuming that is all your expenses including the money you spend on entertainment that leaves you with $ 1700 you can add on to your loan payments so you can pay off your third loan in 1 month then add the remaining balance to the 2nd loan with this income it should take you less then a year to pay off all your loans

hart 's answer regarding the difference between an index and a stock aside remember that dividend yield is a passive measure   it takes the announced dividend which is a $ amount and divides it by the current market price    so you ca n't assume that if you buy a stock that had a dividend yield of 4 for $ 100 that you 're guaranteed 4 of the stock price in dividends   if the price of the stock doubles you 'd still get $ 4 but the yield would drop to 2   or the company could reduce or even suspend its dividends which would reduce the yield if the stock price stayed flat for an index like the s&p it 's easier to measure dividends on yield terms rather then $ terms since you 'd have to own shares in every single company to get that amount but on average the stocks in the s&p 500 pay x% in dividends which are typically quarterly some pay more than that some less and some none at all

i know this is heresy but if you have funds for significantly more    than 6 months of expenses let 's say 12 months how risky would it be    to put it all into stock index funds quite risky as if you do need to dip into it how fast could you get the cash also do you realize the tax implications when you do sell the shares should you have an emergency in the worst case scenario let 's say you have a financial emergency    at the same time the stock market crashes and loses half its value    you could still liquidate the rest and have sufficient funds for 6    months am i underestimating the risks of this strategy that 's not worst case scenario though worst case scenario would be another 9/11 where the markets are closed for nearly a week and you need the money but ca n't get the funds converted to cash in the bank that you can use this is in addition to the potential wait for a settlement in the case of using etfs if you choose to go that way in the case of money market funds cds and other near cash equivalents these can be accessed relatively easily which is part of the point a approach where some cash is kept in house some in accounts that can easily accessed and some in other investments may make sense though the breakdown would differ depending on how much risk people are willing to take if it truly is an emergency fund then the odds of needing it should be    very slim so why live with near zero return on that money something to consider is what is called an emergency here for some people a sudden $ 1,000 bill to fix their car that just broke down is an emergency for others there could be emergency trips to visit family that may have gotten into accidents or gotten a diagnosis that they may pass away soon consider what do you want to call an emergency here as chances are you may not be considering all that people would think is an emergency there is the question of what other sources of money do you have to cover should issues arise

you 're talking about modern portfolio theory the wiki article goes into the math here 's the gist modern portfolio theory mpt is a theory of finance that attempts to maximize portfolio expected return for a given amount of portfolio risk or equivalently minimize risk for a given level of expected return by carefully choosing the proportions of various assets at the most basic level you either a pick a level of risk standard deviation of your whole portfolio that you 're ok with and find the maximum return you can achieve while not exceeding your risk level or b pick a level of expected return that you want and minimize risk again the standard deviation of your portfolio you do n't maximize both moments at once the techniques behind actually solving them in all but the most trivial cases portfolios of two or three assets are trivial cases are basically programming because to be realistic you might have a portfolio that a does n't allow short sales for all instruments and/or b has some securities that ca n't be held in fractional amounts like etf 's or bonds then there is n't a closed form solution and you need computational techniques like mixed integer programming plenty of firms and people use these techniques even in their most basic form also your terms are a bit strange it has correlation table for i and j running from 1 to n this is usually called the covariance matrix i want to maximize 2 variables namely the expected return and the additive inverse of the standard deviation of the mixed investments like i said above you do n't maximize two moments return and inverse of risk i realize that you 're trying to minimize risk by maximizing negative risk so to speak but since risk and return are inherently a tradeoff you ca n't achieve the best of both worlds maybe i should point out that although the above sounds nice and theoretically it 's sound as one of the comments points out it 's harder to apply in practice for example it 's easy to calculate a covariance matrix between the returns of two or more assets but in the simplest case of modern portfolio theory the assumption is that those do n't change over your time horizon also coming up with a realistic measure of your level of risk can be tricky for example you may be ok with a standard deviation of 20 in the positive direction but only be ok with a standard deviation of 5 in the negative direction basically in your head the distribution of returns you want probably has negative   because on the whole you want more positive returns than negative returns like i said this can get complicated because then you start minimizing other forms of risk like value at risk for example and then modern portfolio theory does n't necessarily give you closed form solutions anymore any actively managed fund that applies this in practice since obviously a completely passive fund will just replicate the index and not try to minimize risk or anything like that will probably be using something like the above or at least something that 's more complicated than the basic undergrad portfolio optimization that i talked about above we 'll quickly get beyond what i know at this rate so maybe i should stop there

keep in mind this is an opinion piece the foreign sovereign act would have argentina from virtually all of these suits lets sovereigns opt out of its protections which argentina did argentina waived immunity from suit in new york state or federal court and its immunity from the attachment of its assets within the us to satisfy a judgement    in this particular case it also agreed this issuance of debt would rank with its other debt obligations and without any preference among themselves emphasis added 1994 bondholder agreement this is the clause the court used when deciding whether argentina could pay some bondholders and not others it is fairly that bondholders are all on equal footing it also added that these debt obligations would rank at least equally with argentina 's other unsecured debt    this was not a coincidence by issuing in new york and subjecting itself to new york us law argentina was able to obtain a much more favorable borrowing rate argentina was the of the debt agreement where it promised to treat all borrowers the same and it was the party who waived its inherent under us law it benefited greatly from the substantially lower borrowing costs it enjoyed by doing so    because argentina waived its sovereign the court looked to the language in the contract it states the debt will all be treated the same and will be subject to ny us law it is hard to say it is unfair for a new york court to enforce a contract argentina wrote and then subjected itself to new york jurisdiction law    note three us government agencies sided with argentina justice state treasury claiming should at least partially apply regardless of waiver they made mostly policy arguments about how sovereigns should enjoy at least partial immunity argentina 's debt contract was very liberal with its waiver of sovereign immunity so it is not surprising the court looked to the actual contract when deciding what rights bondholders have

wire transfers normally run through either the fedwire system or the clearing house interbank payments system chips the process generally works like this you approach a bank or other financial institution and ask to transfer money you give the bank a certain code either an international bank account number or one of several other standards which informs the bank where to send the money   the bank sends a message through a system like fedwire to the receiving bank along with settlement instructions   this is where the process can get a bit tricky for the wire transfer to work the banks must have reciprocal accounts with each other or the sending bank must send the money to a bank that does have such an account with the receiver if the sending bank sends the money to a third party bank the transaction is settled between them and the money is then sent to the receiving bank from the third party bank this last transaction may be a wire transfer ach transfer etc   the federal reserve fits into this because many banks hold accounts for this purpose with the federal reserve this allows them to use the fed as the third party bank referred to above interestingly enough this is one of the significant ways in which the fed makes a profit because it along with every other bank and routing agent in the process collects a miniscule fee on this process   you 'll often find sources that state that fedwire is only for transferring large transactions while this is technically correct it 's important to understand that financial institutions do n't settle every wire transfer or payment immediately although the orders are put in immediately the financial institutions settle their transactions in bulk at the end of the business day and even then they normally only settle the difference so if chase owes bank of america $ 1 m and bank of america owes chase $ 750 k they do n't send these as two transactions chase simply credits bac $ 250k.   you did n't specifically ask about ach transfers which as littleadv pointed out are different from wire transfers but since ach transfers can often form a part of the whole process i 'll explain that process too ach is a payment processing system that works through the federal reserve system among others the federal reserve through the and systems is by far the largest payment processor   the physical cash itself is n't transferred in simple terms the money is transferred through the ach system between the accounts each bank maintains at the federal reserve   here is a simple example of how the process works i 'm summarizing the example from wikipedia let 's say that bob has an account with chase and wants to get his paycheck from his employer stack exchange directly deposited into this account assume that stack exchange uses bank of america as their bank   bob the receiver fills out a direct deposit authorization form and gives it to his employer called the originator once the originator has the authorization they create an entry with an originating depository financial institution which acts as a middleman between a payment processor like the federal reserve and the originator the odfi ensures that the transaction complies with the relevant regulations in this example bank of america is the odfi   bank of america the odfi converts the transaction request into an ach entry and submits it through an ach operator to the receiving depository financial institution rdfi which in this case is chase bank chase credits deposits the paycheck in bob 's account   the federal reserve fits into all of this in several ways through systems like and the fed acts as an ach operator and the banks themselves also maintain accounts at the federal reserve so it 's the institution that actually performs the settling of accounts between banks

ethically you and your landlord should always report both income and expense as there technically exists a service and a rent so it is subject to taxation on the other hand it can be considered an exchange of a simple favour and if it does n't involve a money exchange or any profits i am assuming that you are not selling what you or your landlord produce on the market no value can be calculated thus no taxation can be applied this changes though if a contract is involved as a legal value can be estimated caution these subjects can vary on an extreme level of of what can and can not be claimed as income and expense which can vary per country state province and even per judge as well as the nature and sector of the work also if you intend to formalize this relationship the type of contract and reporting forms do vary per state as well so it might be best to confirm it with a local legal advisor to avoid unfortunate surprises

from your description it seems that you should have $ 75k of basis i.e. after tax amount in your traditional ira as others have mentioned in comments you might have had to report this in the year it was rolled over i will assume that you will have figured this out having after tax amounts in a traditional ira is tricky as you usually ca n't choose to take out only the after tax portion withdrawals as well as conversions to roth ira must be pro rata which means that the amount of pre tax and post tax money in the withdrawal or conversion follows the same proportion as in the ira overall so say 7.5 of your traditional ira is after tax and the other is pre tax that means any withdrawal will consist of pre tax and post tax in those proportions so e.g. if you withdraw or convert $ 1000 $ 75 will be post tax and $ will be pre tax so any withdrawal or conversion will consist overwhelmingly of pre tax amounts which will be taxed and you may not want that at this time there is one way to separate the pre tax and post tax amounts in a traditional ira but it involves having an active 401(k which i doubt you have at this point as you 're retired some 401(k plans allow people to rollover funds from traditional ira into it if they allow this then you can use it to siphon only pre tax money from the traditional ira as irs does not allow rollover of post tax money into a 401(k this way you can rollover the entire pre tax amount of the traditional ira into the traditional 401(k leaving behind only after tax money in the traditional ira which you can immediately convert to roth ira with no tax

it is not an either or decision   if you want to retire decades early then you will need to have a taxable account anyway as you wo n't be able to stuff enough money into the tax advantaged accounts to meet that goal and if you are making a huge sum then you will be in a high tax bracket and so the tax advantages of saving into a 401 k or ira will be substantial so max out your 401k ira and then save the rest into the taxable brokerage account   when you retire at 39 live off your taxable account until you are old enough to tap the other ones without penalty unless you plan to die decades early as well as retire decades early   in that case you can bypass the 401k ira

of course but then paper also has utility so do seashells and    there is no obvious reason why even in a perfect world we would go looking for a malleable highly conductive corrosion resistant metal as something to peg the value of our banknotes to    the argument in favor of a gold standard is not whether gold is intrinsically more valuable than paper or seal skins or anything else it 's that gold is fairly inelastic in terms of supply so it limits the ability of central bankers to mess up the value of the currency through funny business    if you picked up a rock and started going around telling people that we should use it as money because it 's highly malleable and conductive and can be used in computer parts they would look at you like you 're a crazy person that 's not why gold is was should be a currency    gold was the perfect currency for thousands of years because it was easy to identify easy to handle hard to and rare those were important characteristics when strangers had to carry physical money to different places without any atms credit cards or paypal accounts they are somewhat less critical today but still   the one characteristic that might still argue in favor of a gold standard is rarity since the amount of gold in the world is somewhat fixed forcing the currency supply to be restricted to the gold supply semi prevents governments and central bankers from getting into too much or at least that 's the theory    i will leave it to others to argue over whether a return to the gold standard would be a good idea but the argument has nothing to with the intrinsic utility of gold i 'm sure we can all agree that gold is a fine metal with many good qualities

depends on the level of risk in the specific p2p provider i 've looked at which secures loans against property you can select loans based on loan to value ratio etc even if a recession happens if the ltv is around 50 it would have to be a pretty awful recession for you to lose any money once they recover although there will be a delay while you wait for the recovery to happen i would thus consider this lower risk than other p2p options so i 'd be willing to put more money into it at the end of the day as others have said there 's no objective answer this is just one factor to consider which i do n't think has been pointed out yet on this discussion

in your specific case i would leave them open unless you have a specific reason for wanting to close them particularly unless you feel closing them is necessary for you to not misuse them the impact on the credit score is not why i say this though   much more important are the two competing real factors my suggestion would be to take the cards and put them in your file cabinet or whatever would cause you to not use them   in fact you could even cut them up but not close the accounts i had an account open that i did n't possess a physical card for several years for and did n't use at all and it stayed open though it 's not guaranteed they 'll keep it open for you if you never use it    in an emergency you could then ask them to send you a new copy of the card very easily   but keep them just in case you need them once you have paid off your balances on your balance carrying cards then you should consider closing some of them   keep enough to be able to live for ~4 6 months a similar amount to the ideal rainy day fund in savings basically and then close others particularly if you can do so in a way that keeps your average account age reasonably stable

the standard in such moving average crossover systems is the numbers are essentially arbitrary as long as the long term average is greater than the short term and there is some different between the averages in terms of the smoothing they provide i.e. comparing a 74 day ma to a 75 day ma is n't what the system is intended for there are plenty of software programs that will let you run through many possible values for the system over historical data i concur with the other answers in that this system indicator alone is n't very good however i disagree with their blanket off of technical analysis there are many successful traders out there the moving average cross over system is perhaps the second most primitive example of technical strategies categorized as trend following systems buying new recent highs and selling new recent lows being the most simple this particular system is n't very powerful because of its poor use of simple moving averages a simple moving average is intended to smooth out data but smoothing comes at the cost of lagging from the present a simple moving average essentially gives you an smoothing of price action for the day at that is one half of their period ago so your 200 day simple moving average shows you an smoothing of price action 100 days ago a lot can happen in 100 days and that is why this system is far from ideal

alright i will go through bullet point by bullet point and try to best figure out what you will be doing in layman 's terms please bear in mind that i do not work for a hedge fund but rather a much larger entity so a lot of the work you will be doing is pre populated   = in this role the individual will be the main point of contact for the client on all things related to understanding their trading profit amp loss and how their valuations have been sourced in addition the product controller will work with internal partner areas to ensure all required processes have been performed to verify the valuation accuracy of the client ’s portfolio   from my understanding you will act as the middle man between the client and the analyst as such here is how a real interaction may go client x calls you answer hello 's office how can i assist you client x asks hey i was curious what my capital gains were on my fb purchase ok let me pull up your account just a moment it seems as though your current capital are $ 30,000 lol on your fb purchase   client x hmm well do i have any significant loses that i may be able to sell off to off set the tax on the capital gains why yes you do it seems aapl has taken a mighty tumble would you like to sell a position to assist you in offsetting client x why that would be great thanks for your help the conversation could go on and that is a pretty deep conversation for the level you are going in but i have had conversations like these before the second part of the bullet just means that you will be checking and the grunt work of the analyst and in some places actually performing the grunt work the work will most likely be along the lines of finding returns for different time periods popular desired time periods are inception ytd 1yr etc remember all of these time periods are not good stand alone they must be compared to a relevant benchmark for instance you would not want to compare the barclays intermediate ag to an equity portfolio the most common benchmark for an equity portfolio is going to be the s&amp;p 500 but you have to look at where the portfolio is focused if it is a you may want to look more towards something like the ishares s&amp;p smallcap 600 value index in the end always remember that any number you come up with is always relative to a benchmark a plain return number is useless   skills = knowledge of cash and derivative products across various markets knowledge of pricing and valuation knowledge of profit and loss reporting and related attribution analysis   pretty much they just want to make sure that if a client asks about a forward future contract as well as any swap option that you understand what they are this bullet points i know what i am doing even though nobody knows what is going on in the economy be up on your current events have a personal conjecture about what you feel is going to happen moving forward but do not convey it if you know that the unemployment was the main driver behind today ’s poor market then you will be good for the day because that will suffice for any call in that relates to why is the market down one of my favorite quotes about the current economy is as follows anyone around here who is n't confused about what ’s going on does n't understand as scary as it is that is the honest truth nobody knows what is about to happen and if anyone tells you they do they are lying and you need to run away quickly i am assuming you know how to calculate profit and loss i do n’t really know of a special way to twist the numbers around   duties = managing the daily p&amp;l process for one or more client trading desks o daily review of quality control checks o working with trading on p&amp;l differences inquiries o working with offshore product control team india on qc process o delivering a final daily and month end p&amp;l statement to the client understanding and explaining the key drivers behind the p&amp;l movements preparing managing monthly or more frequently as required price verification process and associated reporting updating and maintaining pricing policy for each financial type that is included in the consultant ’s p&amp;l reporting ad hoc projects to meet and enhance client   all this means is that you will be sending out the due diligence to the client and you will ensure you are using the proper closing price and include any deposits withdrawals during the month into your calculation the main point is knowing the reasons the price moved throughout the day month keep up on current events and make sure that you understand a vast knowledge of economic data   for what your day to day activity may be i can walk you through it let ’s say you get in at 8 am you will get in at 8 read economic data recent news articles until about 10 from there you will update client a f p l worksheet until about noon you will eat a quick lunch until about and continue on the grind of e m until about 4 from 4 5 you will reread what happened at the end of the day and an overall economic activity report for the day you may stay until 8 or 9 if you are in a banking hub nyc but a lot of the older guys will leave at this time this is your time to shine stay as late as you can and pump out as much work as you can   as for your interview they may ask you what will be a good play for the next 6 months to a year you should respond with common themes in the market the most common theme is the dividend growth play a ton of people are not predicting large amount of growth for the next 5 10 years i believe i read something earlier that jpm lowered their growth forecasts by about 30 recently so dividends is the play dividend payers are generally well established companies blue chip that have a strong in their respective industry

paying off a loan early is n't a bad thing   having a credit card for 6 months and then closing it is probably unneeded pay it off and then keep it as an emergency card    the key is debt available credit ratio   look at this article for example which explains the different elements the only one you 're affecting here is the second your debt load   if you 're not planning on asking for another loan in the next six months none of this really matters assuming you are paying it off for sure in six months your debt will be gone and your credit score recovered from any hit it takes and if you get a $ 1500 credit card and only put $ 300 on it it might actually improve your credit but having an open $ 1500 credit card with a 0 balance will probably improve your credit rating unless you have a really high amount of available credit   it will improve your debt credit ratio ie total $ you owe divided by total $ you could put on your ccs revolving credit this is all aside from the is it a good idea to borrow money for a 3 month vacation before starting working which the answer is well not exactly   that 's not from a credit perspective just from a living within your means perspective   if you have a firm job that will easily pay off the vacation it 's probably not a bad thing but definitely a certain number of people will take this and end up in spending bad habits that last their life   be aware of that and if you 're just loaning yourself money from the future make sure you understand the terms of that loan and are certain you can pay it off

has the vix always received this much attention i feel like i never really saw articles on it until about 2 years ago and the attention has especially ramped up post election granted i 'm young and may have just not been aware   as the post to i think a big problem is people 's interpretation of vix being the market expectation of volatility in a mathematical sense that would only be valid if 1 the price of options perfectly reflects volatility and 2 investors can rationally evaluate the future    1 is arguable as volatility is just the single free parameter in bs and captures all factors in the price including supply demand 2 is debatable just because it essentially assumes that the wisdom of crowds will be true on average my prior on this is that they 're correct that often and that the vix is probably a pretty poor predictor of future realized volatility i 'll check this last claim and edit

if you wait to pay it off until you are required to in order to avoid interest the end of the grace period then you are receiving what 's known as a float basically you have some money earlier than you would otherwise   banks and other companies profit substantially from floats such as when banks take your deposited check and put a seven day hold on it by investing that money in money making activities and not allowing you to use it until later    as an individual particularly if you 're not a frequent investor you typically benefit less than a bank would from a float since you have less options for investing that money with a short turnaround   technically speaking it 's sort of like you 're getting a constant advance on your paycheck 21 40 days so in that sense you benefit because you get to have that stuff television food whatever you 're buying on credit a month or so before you have to pay for it and you get a month or so 's benefit from it so yes you get a small benefit from paying your bill when it 's due and not prepaying   whether that benefit is worth the potential downsides forgetting to pay and accruing interest depends on your habits

this is almost a question in financial engineering first i will note that a discussion of the greeks is well presented at these measures are first second and higher order derivatives or rate of change comparisons for information that is generally instantaneous bear with me for example the most popular delta compares prices of an option or other derived asset to the underlying asset price the reason we are able to do all this cool analysis is because the the value of the underlying and derived assets have a direct instantaneous relationship on each other because beta is calculated over a large period of time and because each time slice covered contributes equally to the aggregate then the difference in beta would really just be showing two pieces of information summarizing those two pieces of information into delta beta would not be useful to me for further discussion please see specifically look at the huge difference in calculation of ge 's beta using end of month returns versus calculation using day before end of month returns

i do n't have a reference but i think it depends on when you entered the workforce if you finished school at age 24 your primary goals are to pay down expensive debt and to save up enough for a down payment   so essentially not much   maybe $ 5k to $ 10k at the most on the other hand if you entered the workforce at age 20 with no debts and no significant expenses it should have been easy to sock away 20 of your income for 6 years so $ 40k to $ 50k would be reasonable the difference is that the first person 's income earning potential should be higher so eventually they 'd be able to make up the difference and pass them

ratings services stated that aaa rated and aa rated clo tranches incurred no losses at all between 1994 and 2013 loss rates for lower rated tranches meanwhile were low just 1.1 for b rated securities over that period        flying high market returns since j.p. morgan recommended buying clos last july    that does n’t prevent some conservative investors from conflating the clos with the now infamous cdos many of which were linked to subprime mortgages and spread and amplified losses in the u.s. housing market one breed of cdos are on a comeback path of their own with more investors returning to them during an aging bull market   many people were burnt by these acronyms from the crisis said head of credit fund management for europe and asia pacific at intermediate capital group he is currently recommending that clients buy senior clo tranches over investment grade bonds   clos like other types of securitizations have been subject to greater regulation since the financial crisis that includes forcing funds that manage a clo to retain 5 of the securities in an effort to align incentives with investors   that has attracted additional capital into the market said mike a principal at alternative investment manager   assets under management in the loan participation sector a proxy for funds that invest in clos have grown 21 this year to $ billion according to thomson reuters   the pickup in clos has been a boon to banks declines in trading revenues in the current low volatility environment revenue from clo related activity at the top 12 global investment banks more than doubled over the first half of 2017 from a year earlier to almost $ 1 billion according to financial consultancy coalition   clo investors have been handsomely rewarded in recent months j.p. morgan strategist recommended clients buy clos last july as he thought they looked too cheap between then and the end of september bb rated clo tranches returned compared with a return for the technology oriented nasdaq stock index according to his calculations   clos have been an absolute home run said mr. though he added such returns are n’t repeatable   analysts say clos got beaten down last year following a series of troubles in the underlying loan market including distress in the energy sector some analysts think the strong rally in clo tranches since then should give investors pause others think the market has further to run   champion head of credit strategies at paris based hedge fund la investment solutions likes aaa rated clo tranches but with a twist leverage   mr. champion says he buys senior european clo tranches and borrows money against them to increase the size of his position between five and 10 times that can amplify gains and losses significantly   the difference between now and a year ago is the availability of leverage he said   bankers say only a small proportion of clo buyers use leverage and emphasize that trades are subject to daily margin calls that means investors have to post cash to cover mark to market losses on a position which in turn limits how much they are willing to borrow   the leverage in the system today is a fraction

forget income tax they need to raise the tax on capital gains and other investment income that 's where most of the wealth is for example a ceo would get like 200k in income every year but would get hundreds of millions in stock options a higher income tax means nothing for this ceo and for the country for that matter

assuming that you accept the premise that technical analysis is legitimate and useful it makes sense that it might not work for a small market or at the very least that it would n't be the same for a small market as it is for a large market   the reason for this is that a large stock market like the u.s. stock market is as close to a perfect market as you will find compare this to a small market in a small country market information is harder to get because there are not as many media outlets covering the news there are n't as many participants and possibly it might be more expensive to participate in and there might be more regulatory intervention than with the large market   all of these things can affect the prices the closer you get to a perfect market the closer you get to a point where the prices of the stocks reflect the true value of the companies without external forces affecting prices

first check with your lender to see if the terms of the loan allow early payoff   if you are able to payoff early without penalty with the numbers you are posting i would hesitate to refinance this is simply because if you actually do pay 5k month on this loan you will have it paid off so quickly that refinancing will probably not save you much money back of the napkin math at 5k month has you paying 60k pounds a year which will payoff in about 5 years   even if you can afford 5k month i would recommend not paying extra on this debt ahead of other high interest debt or saving in a tax advantaged retirement account if these other things are being taken care of and you have liquid assets cash for emergencies i would recommend paying off the mortgage without refinancing

the financially best choice depends on which has a lower interest rate and what your other debts are if you have significant other debts with a higher interest rate it may make good sense to sign up for the longer term loan and use your extra money to pay those down first   then pay down your mortgage with large payments if you do n't have significant other debts then it is likely a good idea to take a shorter term loan because those tend to have lower interest rates in either case remember that the required loan payments are the minimum payments   you can always pay more and in many cases you should   the objective here is to pay as little interest over the course of your life as is feasible i do n't think it makes too much sense to gamble on whether or not interest rates will rise in the future   they may or may not over the life of your loan and you are not in a position to know which   they are low now so they can be compared to your existing loans   that is enough information to make rational decisions today

lets talk about price gouging laws intended to protect victims in a disaster that actually serve to make it more difficult to service the needy   allowing producers to charge a higher price for items that are in high demand water gas etc sends signals to other producers that profits are available this in turn gives them incentive   to make extraordinary efforts to service victims   no one is going to drive 200 miles to sell water if the price is limited by law there will be less water available for all   if huge profits are available to those entrepreneurs who take the risk to help people then more people will engage in the helping and more resources will be available for all the prices will eventually come down as supply is restored and as more competitors enter the area   tl;dr i would rather have expensive water in an emergency than no water

yes you can buy to let mortgages are typically lent on a combination of expected rental income plus a part of the applicants other income they also at the moment usually require a fairly hefty deposit   the exact requirements are likely to have changed by the time you apply but in basic yes there is another option you can increase your mortgage on your currently property and buy the btl with cash this gives some more flexibility as you can move faster so is great for an auction purchase it is also often cheaper to mortgage your main property and you will get a lower rate of course to do this you will need sufficient equity in your main property and income to cover the mortgage repayments so the practicality of this depends on your main property value and the amount you need

i did n't like it very much because he 's confusing money with credit money is accumulated work not debt   suppose the farmer has apples and wants meat but the hunter does n't want apples the farmer exchanges some apples for the miner 's gold and that gold for the hunter 's meat   all three of them have already worked to produce what they have there 's no debt involved only the accumulated product of work   an economy can not function on credit alone the existence of accumulated work that somebody did before is essential for the existence of credit   suppose the farmer promises a bushel of apples to the hunter and the hunter promises to get a deer for the farmer now the farmer needs a barrel to collect the apples and he promises to give some apples to the cooper the cooper promises to make the barrel for the farmer   all we have up to this point are promises but no one has done any work yet things wo n't start happening until the cooper does the work needed to make a barrel    the economy functions on work not promises the farmer may promise a million bushels of apples and the hunter may promise a million deer but that 's just fantasy   now suppose the cooper dies the farmer will have to get barrels from the neighboring town so now he must give some apples to the carter who brings the barrel the hunter will not get his full bushel of apples he 's experiencing inflation the cost of apples has gone up   no matter what the farmer and the hunter promise to each other the fact remains that the barrels must be brought from the other town   economists like paul krugman seem to believe that everything can be fixed by increasing demand but they totally ignore the costs of production there exists plenty of demand in the us economy right now but the cooper has died the barrels must be brought from china

because any nation that allows real estate to become an asset class will eventually given enough time destroy the wealth potential and social mobility of the non owner class there 's a reason that aristocracy used to be referred to as landed aristocracy    the solution is a progressively higher tax on second third and fourth properties and an elimination of tax on first properties   but such proposals are never allowed air time as they gut the class

the first part of your comment is clearly copy pasted or from a cnn type news source i will however grant you the gop has done an exceptional job with their misinformation regarding the aca the left has done so as well the 20 million people added to healthcare is a number they boast and brag about when they do nt realize from a study i m having a hard time so take it with a grain of salt roughly 65 of those people could afford health insurance prior to the aca just chose not to buy and because of the mandate were forced to i also know that for me health insurance prior to the aca was significantly lower roughly 50 cheaper and that does nt even begin to touch the hikes a lot of people i know saw so the big difference here is preference because we can both   pull information supporting our arguments and you may think you re morally superior to me for wanting to get everyone healthcare by any means necessary whereas i want to make it cheaper and give people the tools and resources to afford it instead of being reliant on theft to receive it    gt;however i do n't think they are the low tax haven that you think they are   they have some of the lowest income tax rates in the world yes i would love to see 0 income tax rates but lower is always better   gt;i am now owner of a company that does r&amp;d and works with the government a lot of my knowledge about inventions and how commercial works with government comes from my own personal experiences   while i do not own my own company or have anything to do with r&amp;d i can for a fact disprove your theory that    comes to this game with the that government ca n't get anything done as well as commercial quickly learns that is not true   as i have and do work on many government contracted sites i m in construction and i can tell you from first hand experience the amount of wasted time and money on these sites is absolutely astounding for instance i worked on a   government building a year and a half ago in the western half of the country this building was meant to service veterans not only was this building over budget by 100 it was also 2 years behind schedule many people would say that this is the contractors fault but that s only partly true because in a private sector site these contractors would nt have lasted more than a month before being replaced we have both seen the opposite side of the same coin we both acknowledge the private sector does everything better for the most part the only difference is you like the funding to be public of course you do you make a fucking killing on these government contracts whereas i want the funding to be private the private sector will always have a need to innovate and that need will always be filled with or without the government the only difference is the private sector wo nt keep throwing money at an unsustainable rate like the government does because if they do nt see results its not worth funding   i d also like to add you are near the same age as my father who also served in the military and i thank you for your service

i ca n't vouch for australian law but in the us there is actually a recognized mechanism for in family loans which ensures that it 's all fully documented for tax purposes including filing it as an official second mortgage just did that recently in my own family which is why i 'm aware of it we 're required to charge at least some interest there 's a minimum set currently around 0.3 and the interest is taxable income and it is wise to get a lawyer to draw up the paperwork there are a few services which specialize in this charging a flat fee of about us$ 700 if the loan is standard enough that they can handle it as fill in the blank but outside of that it 's pretty painless this can also be used as a way of shifting gift limits from year to year if you issue a loan and then gift the recipient with the payments each year including the payments you 've effectively spread the immediate transfer of money over multiple years of taxes of course it does cost you the legal paperwork and the tax in the interest which they 're still paying out of your gift but it can be a useful tool and it 's one that was n't well known until recently again this is all us codes posted only for comparison and for the benefit of us readers it may be completely irrelevant but it may be worth investigating whether oz has something similar

first of all never ask a realtor for advice the realtor represents the seller 's advice above is by far the most accurate of the previous answers the first step is to estimate the market look at past sales in the neighborhood over time and from them estimate the prospects for the house at different time durations based on other sales how fast do you think the house will sell at a given price 60 days 90 days a year if a house is high priced that means the seller is prepared to wait he is saying i am happy to wait a year to find somebody who will pay this next who is the owner young professional retiring couple landlord flipper who is it the more you know about the owner the better everybody has a time table you need to find out what that is next what is your timetable you need the house by the end of the month or by the end of the year or never which is it objectively rate the house and minuses good houses are those which everybody else hates and you love you will get the best price there assuming you need to find a house in 90 days based on these considerations determine the lowest price you think the owner will accept in a 30-day time frame make a written offer with an address and email no phone number if he comes back with a counter offer ignore it if for some reason a realtor has your number and calls you tell them my written offer speaks for itself i have nothing further to say it is very important not to entertain haggling or counter offers do n't even pick up the phone he has your written offer he can email or write you i accept   if the move onto your 2 choice and make a more aggressive offer if that does n't work go to choice 3 and accept the listed price this strategy may seem counter intuitive because the natural tendency for people is to want to communicate trust me the way to succeed in a negotiation is to not communicate make your offer and that is that that is the pro way to do it and will produce the best result for a short term long term situation if you are an investor flipper or have a lot of time to wait spend you can use a different strategy which involves pressuring the seller what you do here is find a property you want in which the owner is vulnerable that means someone who is old bankrupt out of work indicted and on their way to prison or already in prison etc bank owned properties fall into this category in this case you figure out the 6-month price or however long you are willing to work on it then you the person become their buddy visit them in prison take the bank officer to lunch show up on holidays invite them to thanksgiving start a relationship every two weeks you them want to sell yet want to sell yet you basically harass them until they maybe it takes 6 months maybe it takes 2 years eventually they will give in by this means you can get a much better deal than in strategy 1 above but it takes a lot more time and effort and is appropriate more for an investor

the essential difference b n adr and a common share is that adr do not have voting rights common share has   there are some adr that would in certain conditions get converted to common stock but by and large most adr 's would remain adr 's without any voting rights if you are an individual investor this difference should not matter as rarely one would hold such a large number of shares to vote on general meeting on various issues the other difference is that since many countries have regulations on who can buy common shares for example in india an non resident can not directly buy any share hence he would buy adr thus adr would be priced more in the respective market if there is demand for example technologies an india company has adr on nyse this is more expensive around 1.5 times the price of the common share available in india at current exchange rate thus if you are able to invest with equal ease in hk have broker trading account etc consider the taxation of the gains in hk as well the tax treatment in us for overseas gains then its recommended that you go for common stock in hk else it would make sense to buy in us

the all index consists of the 500 largest companies by market capitalisation listed on the australia stock exchange   each stock in the all index is given a weighting based on its market capitalisation as the price of the stocks within the all index change so does the points on the index itself   the index is more sensitive to changes in the larger stocks due to their larger weighting in the index example if a company has a weighting of 10 and its price goes up by 10 and all other stocks in the index do n't go up or down then this will cause the all index to go up by 1 10 of 10

you have some of the math right but are missing a few things here 's what i can offer if i leave anything out someone please expand or clarify rental income can be reduced by mortgage interest and maintenance costs as you mentioned but also by property tax payments association fees insurance costs landlord expenses and depreciation note that if you do n't live in the property for 3 years you 'll have to pay capital gains tax if when you sell the house you can live in it again for 2 of the last 5 years to avoid this many people recommend only assuming you will get 10 months of rental income a year to account for transitions between tenants difficult in finding new tenants and the occasional deadbeat tenant this also adds a buffer for unexpected problems you need to fix in the house if you ca n't at least break even on 10 months of income a year consider the risk i think there are also some cases where you need to repay depreciation amounts that you have deducted but i do n't know the details renting out a house can be fun and profitable but it 's very far from a sure thing i 'd always recommend preparation and caution and of course talking to professionals about the finances accounting and lease writing good luck

the first rule i follow is pretty simple get paid for what you do earn a return on what you own if you are running your company prudently you should earn a salary for the position and responsibilities you hold within the business this salary should be competitive you should be able to replace yourself in the business at this salary if your title is president or ceo look for market rate salaries for others in that position within your industry and company size if you wear multiple hats in a small business you will likely have to blend this salary based on those various positions   based on how you run your business the money left over at the end of the year after you and your team takes a competitive wage is your profit if there is n't any profit then you might want to do some work on your business model but if their is a profit then it 's a clear return on what you own and not just a payment for work completed the idea would be that you could exit the business as an operator pay someone else to do exactly what you do and you would continue to get that profit return at the end of the year this is when a business acts like a true asset   whether you take your money in salary or profit distributions or dividends depending on your structure taxes are about the same salaries get normal employee contributed taxes but then of course the company matches these it is identical if you take a guaranteed payment or distribution that gets hit with self employment taxes profits are also going to get hit with the same taxes   follow ups 1 a fair salary would be a competitive market wage for the position you hold within the business what is left over would be considered true profits and not just fabricated profits by taking a lower than market wage to boost the appearance of profitability 2 shareholders requesting salary information would be covered in your operating agreement or shareholder agreement this might be terms you set with your investors or you might simply set a term that you only need approval if a single salary exceeds a cap like $ 250,000 which would mean you would need to present why you deserve a higher salary and have your board approve if you are governed by said board via your investors profitability is a different ballpark your investors most likely have a right to see a monthly quarterly and/or annual profit loss statement which should clearly state profitability i ca n't imagine running a completely closed book company to my investors actually i ca n't really imagine ever investing in a company where i am not permitted to see the financials   something to also consider here is the threat of trying to keep your profit numbers low in order to not pay taxes or to pay yourself a higher salary if you ever plan to sell or exit the company most widely accepted valuations of a business are done from profits or you might think you are saving yourself a couple points on taxes by avoiding profits in the short term but if you exit the business and get a 3 5x or even up to in some cases multiplier on your annual profits you might be kicking yourself for trying to hide them through your accounting practices buyers will often sniff out an owner who created false profits by not paying themselves but what 's harder to do is figure out how much profits should have been when there were none on the books by saving yourself $ 100,000 in taxes this year could add up to close to $ 1,000,000 in an acquisition   good luck

index funds etfs if they are tracking the same index will be the same in an ideal world the difference would be because of the following factors expense ratio i.e. the expense the funds charge this varies and hence it would lead to a difference in performance tracking error this means that there is a small percentage of error between the actual index composition and the fund composition this is due to various reasons   effectively this would result in the difference between values demand supply with etfs the fund is traded on stock exchanges like a stock if the general feeling is that the index is rising it could lead to an increase in the price of the etf index funds on the other hand would remain the same for the day and are less liquid this results in a price increase decrease depending on the market the above explains the reason for the difference    regarding which one to buy one would need to consider other factors like a how easy is it to buy etfs do you already hold demat a c access to brokers to help you conduct the transaction or do you need to open an additional account at some cost b normally funds do not need any account but are you ok with less liquidity as it would take more time to redeem funds

the problems with ratings and the interpretation of ratings is that they are retrospective and most people read them as prospective they basically tell you that debtor is solvent right now what does that mean it means that the ratings are based on the audited financial statements of a company government or other organization issuing debt so in the best case scenario where the rating agency is acting properly they are still dependent on folks with fiduciary responsibility telling the truth and even if they are telling the truth accounting rules make it possible to obscure problems for years in some cases municipal are a great example of this the general obligation bonds cities and even states with deep structural budget problems still get good ratings because they are solvent and have sufficient operating cash to meet obligations today but towards the end of a 30-year bond 's life that may not be the case anymore unless they dramatically alter their budgets at the end of the day ratings are one aspect of due diligence they are useful screening devices but you need to understand who you are lending money to by purchasing bonds and diversify your holdings to protect your wealth   the problem of course is when the trustees of your pension fund invests in garbage assets after getting a sales pitch on the beach in hawaii then conveniently place all of the blame for that bad investment on the rating agency you unfortunately have zero control over that

when you pay cash for a car you do n't always necessarily need to pay cash you just are n't using credit or a loan is all a few options you have are obviously no dealer expects anyone to just have the cash laying around for a car worth a few thousand dollars nor would you bother going to your bank or credit union for the cash you can simply get a cashier 's check made out for the amount note that dealers may not accept personal checks as they may bounce   after negotiations at the dealer you would explain you 're paying cash likely pay a deposit depending on the price of the car but $ 500 would probably be enough again the deposit can be a check or bank deposit and then come back later on with a cashier 's check or deposit into a bank account you would be able to do this later that day or within a few days but since you 've purchased a new car you would probably want to return asap

gt   honest question without do you really believe this anti science rhetoric you must see that a good bit of that comes from a liberal media pushing an agenda what has he actually done that is to science   yes   i 've seen it in action   while there are lots of stories in the liberal media the sources i 'm following are the science oriented news   science scientific american science news   simply look at the war on climate scientists via the nasa budget for its work on atmospheric science and the epa budget down 26 for climate science for obvious examples edit   as well as the 16 cut in the budget   and all of this for a misguided notion that one should try to protect coal   which is dying on its own nat gas is cheaper and solar will be cheaper soon both industries produce more jobs that coal and remember kids   coal kills   gt   nasa funding increased 800 million nsf is up 100 million collectively agencies are up 14 million from 2015 data here   you have your information completely messed up   that said the mainstream press also seems to be pretty incompetent at this too    the fiscal year for both nasa and the nsf starts oct 1   the budget was from 2016 through sept 30 2017    specifically the fy 2017 budget request for the nsf was submitted feb 9   any changes and funding of that budget under trump 's watch are minor   the budget request formed under trump is the budget and this budget the nsf request was submitted on may 23 2017 down $ m 11   here is the history of budget requests and actual expenditures for the nsf     your nasa information was also bad   however the approved budget was only down 0.8   gt   the national space administration budget for fy 2018 is $ billion that 's a 0.8 percent decrease from current funding levels   the situation for the nasa budget as a whole does n't tell the whole story   the reason it stayed relatively level was the push for mars    what one should note about the nasa budget are the severe cuts in regard to atmospheric research or anything related to climate change   gt   ultimately you have to admit the rapid expansion of entitlements lobbied for by democrats will necessarily create budgetary pressure on non defense spending    no i do n't   why   first i simply note that you are trying to restrict attention to non defense spending when it needs to be included in the calculation too   second of all we should have the courage to call it what it is   it 's military spending and we should n't fool ourselves by calling it defense   so in the context of large increases in military budgets spending   the relatively minor expansion in entitlements is irrelevant   consider what the single trump ordered symbolic missile attack of syria cost   i say symbolic because we actually notified them of the incoming strike in advance   just the cost of the missiles was almost $ 100 m    $ 100 m for a single 1 hour symbolic gesture    that 's of the annual nsf budget   i 'm not even going to mention the fact that each trip to mar a costs $ 3 m if you include secret service     here is a reminder of the relative sizes of the components of the budgets 2015      and for all of the campaigning about getting out of foreign wars trump seems to be doing the reverse   if you look at the rise to power of the us in the 20th century you 'll realize that it was driven by science   it 's science that made america great   if you really want to maga fund science

one of the best things you can do for this purpose while getting a modest roi on a passive investment is invest in a company that profitably does whatever you want to see more of for example you could invest in a for profit company that sells needed goods to low income people at lower prices   something like wal mart which is one of the most effective anti poverty engines in the us   you might also say the same of something like aldi owner of aldi stores and trader joe 's which is a discount store chain   this is true even though a company like wal mart is seeking to make money first   its customer base tends to skew heavily towards low income consumers and historically to rural and elderly consumers   when wal mart is able to provide food clothing appliances and the like to poor people at a lower cost it is making it marginally less painful to have a low income peter can explain why wal mart is a humanitarian enterprise walmart ’s customer base is heavily concentrated in the bottom income quintile which spends heavily on food the bottom income quintile spends about 25 percent of income on food compared to just 3.5 percent for the top quintile so the benefits of walmart ’s substantially lower prices to the lowest earning cohort are huge especially on food as points out this view of wal mart dramatically lowering prices that low income people pay for food was by an obama adviser that 's just one company   you can pick the industry and company that best suits your personal preferences alternatively you could invest in something like whole foods a company with multiple missions to improve the planet and the community in addition to the more typical mission of being a prosperous retail chain of course as a general proposition a less than entirely altruistic charity inclined investment does n't need to be targeted at those with low incomes or at saving the planet   you could invest in almost anything you think is good yachts yo energy production industrial inputs music performances and the company will take care of making more of that good thing   you did n't say whether your goal was to help the poor the planet arts sciences knowledge community or whatever what i understand you to be saying is you are willing to accept a lower roi in exchange for some warm from your investment   that seems perfectly valid and reasonable to me but it makes it much more subjective and particular to your tastes   so you 'll need to pick something that 's meaningful to you   if you 're going to trade roi for positive feelings then you should pick whatever gives you your optimal blend of emotions and returns alternatively you could invest in something stable and predictable to beat inflation some sort of index or fund and then annually use some portion of those profits to simply give to the charity of your choice   your investment and your charity do not necessarily need to be the same vehicle

if you have doubts about the long term prospects at your employer or jobs in your area you may want to keep the option of moving to find a new job open while you save up for a larger down payment on a house   while there are insurance products out there that claim to cover your mortgage they often have loopholes which make them difficult to collect on insurance companies are in business to make money and premiums are high when it 's likely that people will try to collect splitting those premiums into your mortgage and your own self insured unemployment fund i.e. an emergency fund in a money market bank account will usually be a better deal as always make sure you have term life insurance for a family and long term disability insurance just in case something really bad happens in the near term buying a home is a better financial decision when you know you 'll be in an area for at least 5 years saving until you have 20 down on place that you can afford to pay off in 15 years even if you take a 30 year loan will be a lot cheaper and less stressful

i recommend reading what 's the catch in investing in real estate for rent and making a list of expenses   you have a known expense the rent and the assumption that it will rise a bit each year if not each year eventually the landlord will bump it and on average the rent should track inflation   the buy side is the complete unknown especially to us here the mortgage and taxes are just the beginning my ongoing issue in the buy rent debate is that it 's easy to buy too big or at least far bigger that what you are renting   one extreme a couple moves from their one bedroom apartment into their purchased home with far more space than they ever use no need to paint the full picture of numbers the house is a money pit and they live for the house   other end couple already renting a nice sized home and they buy a similar one they rent out the two spare bedrooms for 5 years until they have kids and want their privacy back they bought smart for less than market price and from day one the mortgage was lower than the rent they paid by year 5 having sent the extra income to pay down the mortgage they 've paid down half the loan as the kids come along they refi to a new 30 yr fixed at 3.5 and the payment is tiny compared to the rest of their budget   simply put the ratio of house price to rent for that same house is not a constant when the ratio is high it 's time to rent when it swings very low it 's worth considering a purchase but the decision is never clear until every detail is known the time may be perfect and the day after you close you lose your job or in a good scenario get a raise and are just because you bought low yesterday does n't mean the market will pay you a good price today it takes time for out of whack pricing to come back to normal   a simple question maybe but we first need a lot of details to help you understand what you are considering

   for example says the report solvency could be achieved by raising taxes or reducing benefits for new recipients by about one fifth if we started today however if policy makers wait until payroll taxes would have to be increased by nearly one third and it would be impossible to achieve solvency solely from reducing benefits for new beneficiaries     social security was enacted in medicare was enacted in 1965 life expectancy at those times was 61 and 70 respectively today average life expectancy is 80    pushing the receipt age for these benefits makes the most sense and results in a two fold savings 1 benefits put into the system through additional payroll deduction and 2 benefits are not taken out of the system

you 're going to have a huge problem getting approved for anything as long as you have an unpaid bill on your report pay it and make sure its reported as paid in full asap once that settled your credit will start to improve slowly ca n't do anything about that it will take time you can make the situation improve a bit faster by lending money to yourself and having it reported regularly on your report how easy get a secured credit card what does it mean you put x amount of money in a cd and the bank will issue you a credit card secured by that cd your credit line will be based on the amount in that cd and you 'll probably pay some fees to the bank for the service shop around you might get lucky and find a secured card without fees if you look hard enough secured cards are reported as revolving credit just as any other credit card and are easy to get because the bank does n't take the risk you do   if you default on your payments your cd goes to cover the debt and the card gets cancelled but make absolutely sure that you do not default charge between 10 and 30 of the credit limit each month not more pay the balance shown on your credit card statement in full every month and by the due date shown on your monthly statement   it will take a while but you would typically start noticing the improvement within ~6 12 months stop applying for stuff not store cards not car loans you 're not going to get anything and will just keep dragging your scores down each time you have a pull on your report the score goes down a lot of pulls frequent pulls the score goes down a lot lenders can see when one is desperate and no one wants to lend money to desperate people   optimally lenders want to lend money to people who does n't need loans but in order to keep the business running they 'll settle for slightly less people who do n't usually need loans and pay the loans they do have on time you fail on both as you 're desperate for a loan and you have unpaid bills on your report

i 've done this in az it 's important to know which lender is foreclosing because if it 's not the most senior one then your purchase can later be foreclosed a foreclosure all junior interests but can itself be extinguished by a more senior interest i may not have the correct terms here but you get the idea you should also check to be sure property taxes are current they are probably being paid by the original lender but it would n't hurt to check make sure you understand the requirements for participation in the auction in my case they required that i bring a $ 10 k cashier 's check made out to myself on winning the auction i endorsed the check over to the auction company and had to come up with the remaining funds in cash the property i bought had been previously sold at a sheriff 's sale to satisfy a judgment in favor of the homeowner 's association for delinquent dues the hoa bought the property at the auction and received a sheriff 's deed at this point the original owner 's interest in the property was extinguished nevertheless the original mortgage and deed of trust were still in place being senior to the hoa 's interest about a year later the lender foreclosed on the property and i bought it at auction at the courthouse this had the effect of the hoa 's interest a fact that took some explaining to the water utility to get the account in my name

in the us a surviving family member that inherits the entire property may also assume the mortgage   if the new mortgagee fails to uphold the terms of the mortgage i.e. make timely payments the can begin foreclosure proceedings   there is generally no requirement to pay off the mortgage quickly this is obviously the simple case where one person inherits the entire property if the estate is split and no one person inherits the house or if the house is left to a non relative things get more complicated   effectively in that case the house is either sold to pay off the mortgage or the needs to take out a new mortgage to pay off the old one

a re financing or re fi is when a debtor takes out a new loan for the express purpose of paying off an old one this can be done for several reasons usually the primary reason is that the terms of the new loan will result in a lower monthly payment debt consolidation taking out one big loan at a relatively low interest rate to pay off the smaller higher interest loans that rack up like credit card debt medical bills etc is a form of refinancing but you most commonly hear the term when referring to refinancing a home mortgage as in your example to answer your questions most of the money comes from a new bank that bank understands up front that this is a re fi and not new debt the homeowner is n't asking for any additional money but instead the money they get will pay off outstanding debt therefore the net amount of outstanding debt remains roughly equal even then a re fi can be difficult for a homeowner to get at least on terms he 'd be willing to take first off if the homeowner owes more than the home 's worth a re fi may not cover the full principal of the existing loan the bank may reject the homeowner outright as not creditworthy a new house is a huge ding on your credit score trust me or the market and the homeowner 's credit may prevent the bank offering loan terms that are worth it to the homeowner the homeowner must often pony up cash up front for the closing costs of this new mortgage which is money the homeowner hopes to recoup in reduced interest however the homeowner may not recover all the closing costs for many years or ever to answer the question of why a bank would do this there are several reasons the bank offering the re fi is usually not the bank getting payments for the current mortgage this new bank wants to take your business away from your current bank and receive the substantial amount of interest involved over the remaining life of the loan if you 've ever seen a mortgage summary statement the interest paid over the life of a 30-year loan can easily equal the principal and often it 's more like twice or three times the original amount borrowed that 's attractive to rival banks   it 's in your current bank 's best interest to try to keep your business if they know you are shopping for a re fi even if that means offering you better terms on your existing loan often the bank is itself on the hook to its own investors for the money they lent you and if you pay off early without any penalty they no longer have your interest payments to cover their own and they usually ca n't pay off early bonds which are shares of corporate debt do n't really work that way the better option is to keep those scheduled payments coming to them even if they lose a little off the top often if a homeowner is working with their current bank for a lower payment no new loan is created but the terms of the current loan are this is called a loan modification especially when the government is requiring the bank to sit down at the bargaining table or in some cases a streamlining if the bank and borrower are meeting in more circumstances without the government forcing either one to be there historically the idea of giving a homeowner a break on their contractual obligations would be comical to the bank in recent times though the threat of foreclosure the bank 's primary weapon does n't have the same teeth it used to someone facing 30 years of budget busting payments on a house that will never again be worth what he paid for it would look at foreclosure and even bankruptcy as the better option as it 's theoretically all over and done with in only 7 10 years with the government having a vested interest in keeping people in their homes making whatever payments they can to keep some measure of confidence in the entire financial system loan modifications have become much more common and the banks are usually as they 've found very quickly that they 're not getting anywhere near the purchase price for these toxic assets sometimes a re fi actually results in a higher apr but it 's still a better deal for the homeowner because the loan does n't have other associated costs lumped in such as mortgage insurance money the guarantor wants in return for underwriting the loan which is in turn required by the fdic to protect the bank in case you default the homeowner pays less the bank gets more everyone 's happy including the guarantor they do n't really want to be underwriting a loan that requires pmi in the first place as it 's a significant risk the u.s. government is spending a lot of money and putting a lot of pressure on fdic insured institutions including virtually all mortgage lenders to cut the average joe a break banks get tax breaks when they do loan modifications the fed 's buying at risk bond packages backed by distressed mortgages and where the homeowner has n't walked away completely they 're negotiating mortgage mods directly all of this can result in the homeowner facing a lienholder

you can likely use bollinger band values to recognize sideways trending stocks bollinger band averages expand during periods of volatility and then converge on the matched prices the longer there is little volatility in the asset prices also look at the bollinger band formula to see if you can glean how that indicator does it so that you can create something more custom fit to your idea

an option is freely tradable and all options of the same kind are equal if your position is 0 and you sell 1 option your new position in that option is -1 if the counterparty to your trade buys or sells more options to close open or even reopen their position afterwards that does n't matter to your position at all of course there 's also the issue with american and european options european options expire at their due date but american options expire at their due date or at any time before their due date if the holder decides they expire with american options if a holder of an american option decides to exercise the option someone who is short the same option will be assigned as the counterparty this is usually random expiry is after market close so if one of your short american options expires early you will need to reopen the position the next day keep in mind dividends for slightly increased complexity american and european options do not in any way refer to the continents they are traded on or to the location of the companies these terms simply describe the expiry rules

hobby expenses are not tax deductible   business expenses are but only if it 's a bona fide business   first they look at profitability if you reported a net profit i.e. paid taxes in your first 3 years they will believe you rant on youtube for a living    remember by the time they get around to auditing you you 'll likely be well into or through your third year    there is an exception for farms   other than that if you lose money year after year you better be able to show that you look walk and like a business and one with a reasonable business reason for delayed profitability   for instance netflix 's old business model of mailing dvds had very high fixed infrastructure expense that took years to turn profitable but was a very sensible model   they 're fine with that   pets.com into oblivion but they tried they 're fine with that too   you ca n't mix all your activities if you 're an electrician specializing in iot and smart homes can you deduct a trip to the trade show you bet   conference arguable   ses   no way   now if you had a second business of a product site which profited by ads and affiliate links then ses would be fine to deduct from that business   but if this second business loses money every year it 's a hobby and not deductible at all   that person would want separate accounting books for the electrician and businesses   that 's a basic duck test of a business vs. a hobby you need to be able to show how each business gets income and pays expense separate from every other business and your personal life   it 's a best practice to give each business a separate checking account and checkbook you do n't need to risk tax penalties on a business that may never   you can amend your taxes up to 3 years after the proper filing date   i save my expense for each tax year and if a business becomes justifiable i go back and amend past years tax forms taking those deductions   irs gives me a refund check with interest

here 's the purely mathematical answer for which fees hurt more you say taking the money out has an immediate cost of $ 60,000 we need to calculate the present value of the future fees and compare it against that number let 's assume that the investment will grow at the same rate either with or without the broker that 's actually a bit generous to the broker since they 're probably investing it in funds that in turn charge fees we can calculate the present cost of the fees by calculating the difference between as it turns out this number does n't depend on how much we should expect to get as investment returns doing the math the fees cost 1 = $ that is the cost of the fees is comparable to paying nearly $ 100,000 right now nearly half the investment if there are no other options i strongly recommend taking the one time hit and investing elsewhere preferably in low cost index funds details of the derivation for simplicity assume that both fees and growth compound continuously the growth does compound continuously we do n't know about the fees but in any case the distinction is n't very significant fees occur at a continuous rate of rf = which is negative and growth occurs at rate the ops current principal is p and the present value of the fees over time is f. we therefore have the equation p = p f t solving for f we notice that the components cancel and we obtain f = p p t = p p t = p p 1 t

many banks will let you generate a temporary credit card number to use in this situation   you can set the credit limit and the expiration date yourself so that the second transaction wo n't be accepted i do n't know of any that will let you set the credit limit to $ 0 but you can set it to a value under the monthly subscription fee an answer to this question suggests that banks sometimes let the charge go through even if it exceeds the limit or the expiration date so the plan might not work

tl;dr the difference is $ 230 just for fun and to illustrate how brackets work let 's look at the differences you could see from changing when you 're paid based on the tax bracket information that ben miller provided if you 're paid $ each year then each year you 'll pay $ for a total of $ $ + $ 25 of $ the amount over $ 37,650 if you were paid nothing one year and then double salary $ the next you 'd pay $ 0 the first year and $ the next $ + $ 28 of $ the amount over $ so the maximum difference you 'd see from shifting when you 're paid is $ total $ per year or about 4 of your average annual salary in your particular case you 'd either be paying $ total or $ followed by $ for $ total a difference of $ 230 total $ 115 per year less than 1 of average annual salary $ + $ 25 of $ the amount $ $   is over $ 37,650 $ + $ 28 of $ the amount $ + $ is over $

but how do i bring the initial deposit into the equation basically you ca n't   unless you combine two different formulas from math of finance into a single expression the single initial deposit of $ 1000 will compound for 20 years at 5 compounded annually the final amount for this part of the deposit will be = 1000 x in addition the series of 20 payments will be an ordinary annuity with a regular payment of $ 100 with the value on the occasion of the 20th payment given by   so the final total amount in the account at the end of 20 years will be the sum of these two values

tl;dr roth earnings are not necessarily tax deferred but they might be this is a great question because imho the use of the wording tax deferred is slightly misleading when talking about a roth ira and roth 401k too the phrase tax deferred actually means you save tax now and you pay tax later i.e. you defer the tax as you pointed out this is the normal terminology used for describing a traditional ira/401k earnings on a roth ira are tax free not deferred but only if your distributions are qualified for the most part distributions are considered qualified if you wait until you are 59.5 years old before taking the money out but there are some exceptions if you choose to distribute more than your contributions meaning you are now taking out earnings the earnings are tax free only if your distribution is qualified for example if you take out the earnings before you are 59.5 and no other exceptions apply then you would pay tax on the earnings and also a 10 penalty so perhaps a better way to say it is that earnings in a roth ira are tax deferred

housing eh housing costs are driven by salaries and land availability over in the bay area $ for a nice apartment is a good deal but a decent software engineer with ~4 years experience can get $ 120k easily the standard benchmark of affordability of housing is spending a third of your income on it a year that guy can afford about $ on housing if you do n't away the money and can keep your cost of living down and save money you can really clean up especially if you move elsewhere later so to stop thinking about it in terms of dollar value first try to think of it in terms of time 33 of someone 's salary or a third of their time at work going for housing is pretty nominal beyond that think about it in terms of opportunity cost if you saved that extra $ 20 what exactly would you use it for and how much of that goal does it represent

this is a great question   the irs is not 100 clear on this irs publications do however very strongly suggest that assuming your wife has a plan providing family coverage you can contribute up to your family maximum if she does not have a family coverage plan then the answer is definitively no you may only contribute the individual limit note if you have children covered by her plan then she is considered to have family coverage even if you are not covered by her plan see here question 12 from the 2012 irs publication bottom of page 4 for 2012 if you have self only hdhp coverage you can contribute up to $ if you have family hdhp coverage you can contribute up to $ this is presumably the referencing the definition which is introduced and discussed for married couples on page 6 rules for married people    if either spouse has family hdhp coverage both spouses are treated as having family hdhp coverage if each spouse has family coverage under a separate plan the contribution limit for 2012 is $ you must reduce the limit on contributions before taking into account any additional contributions by the amount contributed to both spouse 's archer msas after that reduction the contribution limit is split equally between the spouses unless you agree on a different division example for 2012 mr. auburn and his wife are both eligible individuals they each have family coverage under separate mr. auburn is 58 years old and mrs. auburn is 53 mr. and mrs. auburn can split the family contribution limit $ equally or they can agree on a different division if they split it equally mr. auburn can contribute $ to an hsa one half the maximum contribution for family coverage $ + $ 1,000 additional contribution and mrs. auburn can contribute $ to an hsa the last example is nearly the exact situation you are in assuming your wife 's plan is family coverage the only assumption beyond what is explicitly written you need to make is that you are considered to have family coverage in the example as per the rules for married people section even though your plan only is a single coverage plan   this conclusion seems to logically follow from information in the faqs here see as well as this document neither the above example nor any irs documents referenced in this answer cover your situation completely

some people believe that inflation is caused by an increase in the money supply when the banks engage in fractional reserve lending is this correct you are referring to the austrian school of thought the austrians define inflation in terms of money supply in other words inflation is defined as an increase in the aggregate money supply even if prices stay the same of fall this is not the only definition of inflation the mainstream defines inflation as a general increase in the prices of consumer goods based on the first definition then your supposition is correct by definition based on the second definition you can make a case that money supply affects prices but keep in mind it 's just one factor affecting prices furthermore economics is resistant to so it is difficult to establish causality austrian economists tend to approach the problem of proof using a tactic establish by explaining the mechanism then look for historical evidence to back up that explanation as i understand it when there is more available money in the market the price of goods will increase but will a normal merchant acknowledge the increase of money supply and raise prices immediately i posit that in the short run merchants wo n't increase prices in response to increased money supply so why does increased money supply lead to price inflation the simple answer in the austrian school of thought is that you have more money chasing the same amount of goods in other words printing money does n't actually increase the number of widgets made i believe the austrian school is consistent with your supposition that prices do n't increase in the short run in other words producers do n't increase prices immediately after observing an increase in the money supply specifically after the banks print more notes where will the money be distributed first   the austrian story goes as follows imagine that the first borrower is a home and he is borrowing freshly printed money to build new homes this will need to buy materials and hire labor to build homes and in doing so he will bid against other home the increased demand for lumber nails tools carpentry etc will ever so slightly increase the market prices for these goods and services so the money goes first to the borrower but then flows also to the people selling to the borrower and the people selling to the sellers etc it has a ripple effect who will be the first one to have a need to rise their price these producers wo n't need to increase their price but they will choose to do so if the believe that demand outstrips supply in other words if you have more orders than you can fill then you may post higher prices because you think consumers will tolerate the higher price   you might object that competition any one producer from unilaterally raising prices but in fact if all producers are failing to keep up with demand then you can unilaterally raise prices because other producers do n't have any excess inventory to undercut you with

gt said it plans to work with three more farmers to demonstrate the environmental benefits of switching from livestock to more crop production but says livestock farmers need government support in order to do so in large numbers   yes because why would you expect a european farmer ever to conduct their business in a profitable way if they can just keep their hand up 38 percent of the whole eu budget is still being spent on farms that should have gone bust decades ago i 'm not saying the market always knows best or that environmentally sound farming should not be promoted somehow but this attitude that government funding will happily keep your outdated lifestyle business alive is just pathetic

the most obvious use of a collateral is as a risk buffer just as when you borrow money to buy a house and the bank uses the house as a collateral so when people borrow money to loan financial instruments or as is more accurate gain leverage the lender keeps a percentage of that or an equivalent instrument as a collateral in the event that the borrower falls short of margin requirements brokers in most cases have the right to sell that collateral and mitigate the risk   derivatives contracts like any other financial instrument come with their risks and depending on their nature they may sometimes be much more riskier than their underlying instruments for example while a common stock 's main risk comes from the movements in its price which may itself result from many other macro micro economic factors an option in that common stock faces risks from those factors plus the volatility of the stock 's price   to cover this risk lenders apply much higher haircuts when lending against these derivatives in many cases depending upon the notional exposure of the derivative that actual dollar amount of the collateral may be more than the face value or the market value of the derivatives contract usually this collateral is deposited not as the derivatives contract itself but rather as the underlying financial instrument an equity in case of an option a bond in case of a cds and so on this allows the lender to offset the risk by executing a trade on that collateral itself

with your numbers look at it this way you borrowed $ 50 when the stock is $ 100 you are at 50 margin   what 's most important is that there 's margin interest charged so the amount owed will increase regardless of the stock price when calculating your return or loss the interest has to be accounted for or your numbers will be wrong for a small investor margin rates can run high and often will offset much of your potential gain what good is a $ 100 gain if you paid $ 125 in margin interest

you ca n't actually transfer shares directly unless they were obtained as part of an employee share scheme see the answers to questions 19 and 20 on this page q. can i put shares from my employee share scheme into my isa a. you can transfer any shares you get from into a stocks and shares component of an isa without having to pay    capital gains tax provided your isa manager agrees to take them the    value of the shares at the date of transfer counts towards the annual    limit this means you can transfer up to £ worth of shares in the tax    year 2013 14 assuming that you make no other subscriptions to isas    in those years you must transfer the shares within 90 days from the day they cease to    be subject to the plan or for approved share option schemes 90    days of the exercise of option date your employer should be able to    tell you more q. can i put windfall or inherited shares in my isa a. no you can only transfer shares you own into an isa if they have    come from an employee share scheme otherwise the isa manager must    purchase shares on the open market the situation is the same if you have shares that you have inherited    you are not able to transfer them into an isa

the interest rate of 3 and 7.5 is for funds held in regular savings account that are denominated in rupee moving these funds back to us will require compliance with indian foreign exchange act if you are not intending to move funds back to us then this would be good move however you would still need to pay tax in us on the interest generated as personal tax in us requires one to pay tax on income world wide as also pointed out by others there is a risk of fx conversion the other option is to hold funds in nre or usd denominated where funds can be moved back to us without any and are held in usd however the interest rate on these accounts is similar to what one would get in us slightly better at best so you need to figure out if you need the funds back in us then i guess keeping it in us would be a good move however if you do not need the funds back in us then moving it to india would make sense

well looking backwards there was such a thing as low skilled labor family supporting jobs right now the low skill labor market is retail which does n’t pay well but anyway in the past we used to fill factories with low skilled labor and they used to make a solid living on that those jobs have been automated outsourced etc and that leaves people with very little options this explains a lot of inner city poverty as well those neighborhoods used to have plenty of low skilled factory or manual labor jobs that would support people who wanted to work but did n’t have a lot of particular skills once those jobs disappeared what did that leave them with 5 bucks an hour at mcdonald ’s it ’s all connected    what should we do about that well i ’m not sure you can jump on the bandwagon that all of the jobs have been shipped away but that ’s not necessarily true it ’s part of it but a lot of jobs simply do n’t exist anymore i saw a fantastic old video about a book binding factory that used to employ a ton of people you ’d have people for each job binding etc but now a machine pretty much does all of the work what we could do is try to raise wages for the low skill market like retail to make them competitive but a lot of those companies are massive and they might be run out of business if they had to pay their employees more but at the same time it ’s necessary that ’s the theory anyway maybe more education for people in new industries despite what donald trump sells it ’s likely that coal jobs and factory jobs are n’t going to make a massive come back that would certainly be nice but that ’s not gon na happen we need to put a lot of time and effort into training people for new industries while they ’re young that means training people in coding computer software robotics renewable energy jobs of the future i think right now we are still working on a shifting market what we do with people beyond school at this point i do n’t know just thoughts    note low skilled does n’t mean stupid or anything it just means you ’re walking in not having done a particular job before or you ’re just kind of the average joe that ’s a lot of people

yep there just is no free lunch   so called high dividend stocks are usually from companies that have stable cash flows but relatively little or moderate growth potential utility companies come to mind let 's take telecommunications as an example   such stocks usually indeed are considered more conservative in a bull market they wo n't make high jumps and in a bear market they should n't experience deep falls i mean just because the stock market fell by 10 you 're not going to stop using your phone the stock might suffer a bit but the divided is still yielding you the same however fundamental data can have a significant impact let 's say a recession hits the country of the people might not get the newest iphone and lock in to an expensive contract anymore they might use cheaper forms of communication they might stop paying bills go bankrupt etc this will have a severe impact on the company 's cash flow and thus hit the stock in a double whammy one the dividend is gone two the price will fall even further   there are basically two scenarios after that either the recession is temporary and your stock became a regular growth stock that at some point might bounce back and re establish at the previous levels or the economy has contracted permanently but regained stability in which case you will again have a stock with a high dividend yield but based on a lower price in conclusion high dividend stocks make sense in a portfolio but never consider their income to be safe reduce your risk by diversifying

if the interest rate in both mortgages is the same then yes you will end up paying the same amount in interest if both are paid off in 15 years however in practice almost always a 15-year mortgage will have a much lower interest rate that a 30-year mortgage also if you are thinking of taking out a 30-year mortgage with the intention of paying it off early make sure it does not have an early payment penalty this is a penalty the bank will charge you if you pay back the loan early

how do we define worth to stock traders and some investors it has value either as a transaction or as a piece in an asset allocation strategy is is likely to generate long term revenues and profits that reflect the historical relationship between those factors and stock price performance unlikely   it might be a good short term play for the nimble investor but the real test of worth will be after the initial hype dies down it is what happens to the stock 90 days after it goes public that matters for the long term forgetting contributions to society knowledge and culture the markets will at that point make their determination about value

if you 're going to be a day trader you really need to know your stuff   it 's risky to say the least one of the most important elements to being successful is having access to very fast data streams so that you can make moves quickly as trends stat to develop in the markets   if you 're planning on doing this using consumer grade sites like etrade that 's not a good idea   the web systems of many of the retail brokerage firms are not good enough to give you data fast enough for you to make good timely decisions or to be able to execute trades way that day traders do in order to make their money   many of those guys are living on very thin margins sometimes just a few cents of movement one way or the other so they make up for it with a large volume of trades one of the reasons you were told you need a big chunk of money to day trade is that some firms will rent you out a desk and computer access to day trade through their systems if you 're really serious about it   they will require you to put up at least a minimum amount of money for this privilege and $ 25k may not be too far out of the ballpark if you 've never done day trading before be careful   it does n't take much to get caught looking the wrong way on a trade that you ca n't get out of without losing your shirt unless you 're willing to hold on to the stock which could be longer than a day day trading sounds very simple and easy but it is n't   you need to learn about how it works a good book to read to understand this market is flash boys by michael lewis besides being very entertaining because it is a space filled with very sophisticated well funded firms and individuals who spend huge sums of money to gain miniscule advantages in the markets be careful whatever you do   and do n't play in day trading with your retirement money or any other money you ca n't afford to walk away from i hope this helps good luck

so am i to understand that giving aaa ratings to financial instruments backed by toxic mortgages had nothing to do with this problem   that selling mortgages with one hand and betting on those mortgages to fail with other is a reasonable business practice     no doubt the push to give more poor people government backed loans exacerbated the problem but making that claim that that was the only problem seems about as valid as claiming that goldman sachs was responsible for everything

think of options as insurance an insurance company makes money by selling the policies at a rate slightly higher than the average payout   most options expire worthless this is because most options are purchased by hedge funds to hedge means taking out insurance in case your position goes against you so the sellers of options obtain a price that covers their averaged losses plus provides them with a profit for their trouble   an option has an amount that it declines in value each day called theta at the expiration date the option is worth zero if it is out of the money so it is option writers that typically make money in the options market as they are the sellers of insurance if they did n't make money selling options they would not sell them   for example the february call option on spy strike 200 traded at on since then it has in value to 0.14 the option writer currently stands to make a huge profit   so just as with insurance you generally never make money by buying insurance but the sellers of insurance tend to make money as do the writers of options   edit theta investopedia

the key to understanding where your money is going is to budget   rather than tracking your spending after the fact budgeting lets you decide up front what you want to spend your money on   this can be done with cash envelopes on paper or on excel spreadsheets however in my opinion the best most flexible and easiest way to do this is with budgeting software designed for this purpose as i explained in another answer when it comes to personal budgeting software there are two different approaches those in which you decide what to spend your money on before it is spent and those that simply show you how your money was spent after it is gone   i recommend the first approach   software designed to do this include ynab mvelopes and everydollar my personal favorite is ynab   you 'll find lots of help video tutorials and even online classes with a live teacher on ynab 's website    using one of these packages will help you manage spending whether it is done electronically or with cash   when you pay for something with a credit card you enter your purchase into the software and the software adjusts your budget as if the money is already spent even if you have n't technically paid for the purchase yet as far as strategy goes here is what i recommend   get started on one of these and set up your budget right away   assign a category to every dollar in your account   do n't worry if it is not perfect   if you find later on that you do n't have enough money in one of your categories you can move money from another category if you need to   as you work with it you 'll get better at knowing how much money you need in each category my other recommendation is this do n't wait until the end of the month to download your transactions from the bank and fit everything into categories   instead enter your spending transactions into the software manually every day as you spend   this will do two things first you 'll have the latest up to date picture of where your accounts are in your software without having to guess   second it will help you stay on top of your spending   you 'll be able to see early on if you are overspending in a particular category   ynab has a mobile app that i use quite a bit but if i do n't get a chance to enter a purchase right when i spend it i make sure to keep a receipt and enter the transaction in that evening   it only takes a couple of minutes a day and i always know how i stand financially

in theory in a perfect world what you state is almost true apart from transaction fees if you assume that the market is perfectly efficient ie public information is immediately reflected in a perfect reflection of future share value in all share prices when the information becomes available then in theory any transaction you would choose to take is opposed by a reasonable person who is not taking advantage of you just moving their position around this would make any and all transactions completely reasonable from a cost benefit perspective   ie if the future value of all dividends to be paid by apple ie the value of holding a share in apple exactly matches apple 's share price of $ 1,000 then buying a share for $ 1,000 is an even trade selling a share for $ 1,000 is also an even trade now in a perfectly efficient market which we have assumed then there is no edge to valuing a company using your own methods if you take apple 's financial statements press releases reported information and if you apply modern financial theory to evaluate the future dividends from apple you should get the same $ 1,000 share price that the market has already arrived at so in this example why would n't you just throw darts at a printout of the s&p 500 and invest in whatever it lands on because even if the perfectly efficient market agrees on the true value of something different investments have different characteristics as an example consider a simple comparison of corporate bonds corporations make bond offerings to the public allowing individual investors to effectively lend money to the corporation for a future benefit for simplicity assume a bond with a face value the amount to be repaid to the investor on maturity of $ 1,000 has these 3 defining characteristics 1 the price what the investor pays to acquire it 2 interest payments how much if any the corporation will pay to the investor before maturity and when those payments will be made and 3 a bond rating which is a third party assessment of how risky the bond is based on the health of the corporation now if the bond rating agency is perfect in its risk assessment and if the price of all bond 's is fair then why does it matter who you loan your money to it matters because different people want different things out of their investments if you are waiting to make a down payment on a house next year then you do n't want risk you want to be certain that you will get your cash back even if it means lower returns so even though a high risk bond may be perfectly priced it should only be bought by someone willing to bear that risk if you are retired and you need your bonds to pay you interest regularly as your sole source of income then of course a zero coupon bond one that pays no interest is not helpful to you if you are young and have a long time to invest then you may want risk because you have time to overcome losses and you want to get the most return possible in addition taxes are not universal between all investors some people benefit from things that would be tax heavy to their neighbors for example in canada there is a dividend tax credit which reduces the taxes owing on dividends received by a corporation this credit exists to prevent double taxation because otherwise the corporation would pay its ~30 of tax and then a wealthy investor would pay another of tax due to the mechanics of how the credit is calculated however someone who makes less money gets an even lower tax bill than they normally would this means that someone making under the top tax bracket in canada has a tax benefit by receiving dividends this means that while 2 stocks may be both fairly priced if one pays dividends and the other does n't ie if the other company instead reinvests more heavily in future projects creating even more value for shareholders down the road then someone in the bottom tax brackets may want the dividend paying stock more than the other in conclusion picking investments yourself does require some knowledge to prevent yourself from making a bad buy this is because the market is not perfectly efficient as well specific market mechanics make some trades more costly than they should be in theory consider for example transaction fees and tax mechanics finally even if you assume that all of the above is irrelevant as a theoretical idea different investors still have different needs just because $ 1,000,000 is the fair price for a factory in your home town does n't mean you might as well convert your retirement savings to buy it as your sole asset

debt collectors are just doing their job as many people want to evade payment by not responding and skipping their debts and they talk tough to force people found to make their obligated payments based on what they can afford and that ’s all i ’m in the uk but i assume the process is similar    before i begin i worked in debt collection and i presume that the debt collection agency have requested details for a source like a college and you have been returned as a possible match as you name is identical to their debtor but with differing date of birth etc college university students are very in nature and addresses are n’t very helpful when they are not current but details of a current address employer to a very similar name would be a possible lead to debtor and the debt collector is simply acting on flawed information which is fairly rare and   cases such as these are resolved when you can simply confirm your date of birth and other details so that they can eliminate you from their chasing activities   whilst you may feel uncomfortable about giving your details you are not the debtor and will have to confirm this the debt collector is only interested in collection of valid debts values and the current letter is most likely a standard letter to get you to act assuming that you are the debtor if you try to ignore this or only partly answer their contact by telling them not to contact your employer etc they will assume that you are the debtor and step up pursuit   by contacting at work by phone in person or by other means and you employer will see you in a bad light i would advise you to write to them a one time only letter confirming details of your home address and insist on correspondence in writing only to that home address in addition you should confirm your full name including full middle names date of birth that you have never attended the college in question   agreed to any such debt in writing and that you are not the correct data subject as the ss number also differs   the letter should also go on to state a range of costs which require payment before you act further ie subsequent letter $ amount attending court $ per cheap and that if they harass you or otherwise affect your standing with your credit reference or employer or anyone else that you take further action and take them to your court and pursue the costs list above and   losses as a result of their actions including pain and suffering speak tough and mean business and act and your message will win through share your details with them once and above all copy your employer in so that they know this is a case of mistaken identity you can add a large heading at the top of the letter of mistaken to prove your point

eventually you are going to need some sort of real credit history   it is possible that you will be able to evade this if you never buy a house or if you pay cash for any house condo car boat etc that you buy   even employers check credit history these days   i would n't be surprised if some medical professionals such as surgeons check it also   obviously if you have a mortgage and car loan this does n't apply but i 'd be curious how you acquired those unless you have substantial income and/or assets combine this with the fact that certain things like renting a car essentially require a credit card because they need to put a hold on more money than they are actually going to take out of your card so they can take that money if you do n't bring the car back and i think you should have a credit card unless you and your wife are individuals with zero impulse control which sounds highly improbable if your concern is the financial liability of the credit line just keep the credit line low

car rental agencies typically accept only credit cards for the rental you can pay at the end with debit but the securing during the rental must be a credit card or a high cash deposit hotel advance bookings even if many months in the future will work fine with a credit card but as explained by others on a debit card it would directly affect your cash flow you basically have to prepay instead of just leave the credit card number on file the same is sometimes true for other advance booking like cruises tours etc

in short i suggest you take a look at your w-4 form and adjust it properly and yes you can claim your self as a dependent unless someone else is claiming you but here is a more detailed explanation of how it works how income tax works while most people tend to only think about the tax system and the internal revenue service irs as the month of april approaches it 's actually a never ending process for our purposes a good way to explain how the system works is to give an example of one american income earner we will call him joe the tax process begins when joe starts his new job he and his employer agree on his compensation which will be figured into his gross income at the end of the year one of the first things he has to do when he 's hired is fill out all of his tax forms including a w-4 form the w-4 form lists all of joe 's withholding allowance information such as his number of dependents and child care expenses the information on this form tells your employer just how much money it needs to withhold from your paycheck for federal income tax the irs says that you should check this form each year as your tax situation may change from year to year once joe is hired and given a salary he can estimate how much he will pay in taxes for the year here 's the formula at the end of each pay period joe 's company takes the withheld money along with all of withheld tax money from all of its employees and deposits the money in a federal reserve bank this is how the government maintains a steady stream of income while also drawing interest on your tax dollars toward the end of the tax year joe 's company has to send him a w-2 form in the mail this happens by january 31 this form details how much money joe made during the last year and how much federal tax was withheld from his income this information can also be found on joe 's last paycheck of the year but he 'll need to send the w-2 to the irs for processing purposes at some point between the time joe receives his w-2 and april 15 joe will have to fill out and return his taxes to one of the irs service and processing centers once the irs receives joe 's tax returns an irs employee keys in every piece of information on joe 's tax forms this information is then stored in large magnetic tape machines if joe is due a tax refund he is sent a check in the mail in the next few weeks if joe uses e file or his refund can be direct deposited into his bank account

as others have already pointed out the bank is n't getting your money upfront the cash goes to the dealer and the bank will be financing you a much smaller amount they really do n't have any incentive to give you a better interest rate but it never hurts to ask the more important and question is should you do this keeping in mind that a loan with good credit could be in the 1.8 range average long term returns in the market are over 3x that so by paying upfront you 're trading the opportunity for returns for the ability to save -2 fees

this is of course a perfectly normal thing to happen people trade up to a bigger house every day when you 've found a bigger house you want to move to and a buyer for your existing one you arrange closing dates for both i.e. the date on which the sale actually happens usually you make them very close either on the same day or with an overlap of a few weeks you use the equity i.e. the difference between the house value and the mortgage in the old house as the down payment on the new house you ca n't of course use the part of the old house that is mortgaged if the day you buy the new and sell the old is the same your banks and lawyers do everything for you on that day if there is an overlap then you need something called bridge financing to cover the period when you own two houses banks are used to doing this and it 's not really that expensive when you take into account all the other costs of moving house talk to them for details as a side note it is generally not to be worth buying a house if you only intended to live there one or two years the costs involved in the process of buying selling and moving usually outweigh any gains in house value you may find yourself with a higher down payment if you rent for a year or two and save up a down payment for your bigger house instead

an accounting general ledger is based on tracking your actual assets liabilities expenses and income and gnucash is first and foremost a general ledger program while it has some simple budgeting capabilities they 're primarily based around reporting how close your actual expenses were to a planned budget not around forecasting eventual cash flow or saving a portion of assets for particular purposes i think the closest concept to what you 're trying to do is that you want to take your real checking account and segment it into portions you could use something like this as an account hierarchy the total in the checking account parent represents your actual amount of money that you might reconcile with your bank but you have it allocated in your accounting in various ways you may have deposits usually go into the available funds subaccount but when you want to save some money you transfer from that into a savings subaccount you could include that transfer as an additional split when you buy something such as transferring $ 50 from assets checking account available funds sending $ 45 to expenses groceries and $ 5 to assets checking account long term savings this can make it a little more annoying to reconcile your accounts you need to use the include subaccounts checkbox and i 'm not sure how well it 'd work if you ever imported transaction files from your bank another option may be to track your budgeting which answers how much am i allowed to spend on x right now separately from your accounting which only answers how much have i spent on x in the past and how much do i own right now using a different application or spreadsheet using gnucash to track budget envelopes is kind of twisting it in a way it 's not really designed for though it may work well enough for what you 're looking for

create a meaningful goal for yourself which would distract you from spending all your money and help you to direct it towards something more meaningful maybe you 're curious about just how little money you can live off of in one year and you 're up for a challenge maybe you want to take a whole year off from work a trip around the world or create a financial independence account the money that is put into this account should never be touched the idea is to live off of the interest that it throws off   i strongly suggest that you listen to the audio book prosperity consciousness by you can probably find a copy at your local library or buy if off of amazon

it is recommended that you get this using wire transfer the fees is slightly high it should be in the range of usd 20 30 you would get the funds faster about 3 5 days after the payment is initiated the fx conversion would be applied without your knowledge so you would have very little control over it if you are getting by paper cheque it would take around 7 10 days for the mail to arrive you would have to deposit this in local bank complete a form giving out the details as to why you received the cheque along with a letter to request the cheque to be cashed generally it takes around 25 days for the funds to get credited as you would be speaking to someone in bank you can try and negotiate a better fx rate however for such amounts bank will not go out of the way so you may not know what rate gets applied it would be the standard rate some 20 days later when the actual cheque gets processed the fees are relatively less in the range of rs 500 to rs 1000

a roth ira is simply a tax sheltered account that you deposit funds into and then invest however you choose within the limits of the firm you deposit the funds with for example you could open a roth ira account with vanguard   you could then invest the $ 3000 by purchasing shares of voo which tracks the s&p 500 index and has a very low expense ratio 0.04 as of last time i checked   fidelity has a similar option or schwab or whatever brokerage firm you prefer iras are basically just normal investment accounts except they do n't owe taxes until you withdraw them and roth do n't even owe them then though you paid taxes on the funds you deposit   they have some limitations regarding options trading and such but if you 're a novice investor just looking to do basic investments you 'll not notice    then your ira would go up or down in value as the market went up or down in value you do have some restrictions on when you can withdraw the funds roth ira has fewer than a normal ira as you can withdraw the capital the amount you deposited without penalty but the profits can not be withdrawn until you 're retirement age i wo n't put an actual year as i suspect that actual year will change by the time you 're that old but think 60s the reason not to invest in an ira is if you plan on using the money in the near future even as an emergency fund   you should have some money that is not invested aggressively that is in something very safe and very accessible for your emergency fund and if you plan to buy a house or whatever with the funds do n't start an ira   but if this is truly money you want to save for retirement that 's the best place to start note this is not investment advice and you should do your own homework prior to making any investment   you can lose some or all of the value of your account while investing

there can be the question of what objective do you have for buying the stock if you want an income stream then high yield stocks may be a way to get dividends without having additional transactions to sell shares while others may want capital appreciation and are willing to go without dividends to get this you do realize that both pfizer and are companies that the total stock value is over $ 100 billion yes thus neither is what i 'd see as a growth stock as these are giant companies that would require rather large sales to drive earnings growth though it may be interesting to see what kind of growth is expected for these companies in looking at current dividends one is paying 3 and the other 5 so i 'm not sure either would be what i 'd see as high yield reits would be more likely to have high dividends given their structure if you want something to research a bit more

yes you 've got it right   the change in price is less meaningful as the instrument is further from the price of the underlying   as the delta moves less the gamma is much less gamma is to delta as acceleration is to speed   speed is movement relative to x and acceleration is rate of change in speed   delta is movement relative to s and gamma is the rate of change in delta delta changes quickly when it is around the money which is another way of saying gamma is higher   delta is the change of the option price relative to the change in stock price   if the strike price is near the market price then the odds of being in or out of the money could appear to be changing very quickly even going back and forth repeatedly gamma is the rate of change of the delta so these sudden in pricing are by definition the gamma   this is to some extent a little mundane and even obvious   but it 's a useful heuristic for analyzing prices and movement as well as for focusing analyst attention on different pricing aspects you 've got it right   if delta is constant zero speed for the change in price then gamma is zero zero acceleration

to answer your question yes it 's often worth it to have investments that produce income do a google search for income vs growth investing and you 'll get a sense for two different approaches to investing in equities in a nutshell growth stocks think netflix etc do n't pay dividends but are poised to appreciate in price more than income stocks think banks utilities etc that tend to have less volatile prices but pay a consistent dividend in the long run decades growth stocks tend to outperform income stocks that 's why younger investors tend to pick growth stocks while those closer to retirement tend to stick with more stable income producing portfolio but there 's nothing wrong with a mixed approach either i agree with pete 's answer too

toward the philosophical side of your question it seems to me that what is most important is knowing how well your fund is performing versus it 's benchmark this is an actionable piece of information that can help you get out of an under performing fund although if you 're already using vanguard it 's likely a low cost and broadly diversified fund ultimately what you want to avoid over the long term is under performing the market due to high fees market timing poor fund selection etc and selecting a fund that closely tracks the market seems to be the best way to achieve this assuming that you intend to be a passive investor i do n't see a clear benefit to calculating a personal rate of return if the fund is performing well versus its benchmark you are likely to stay with it and if it is performing poorly you   are likely to pull out at the end of the day the complicated accounting wo n't actually change the amount you 've got in your account so i 'd recommend picking a good fund checking up on it once in a great while and putting your time to better purpose

you might have to pay a premium for the stocks on the dividend tax free exchanges for example hsbc on the nyse yields versus hsbc on the lse which yields only assuming the shares are truly identical the only reason for this aside from market fluctuations is if the taxes are more favorable in the uk versus the us thus increasing demand for hsbc on the lse raising the price and reducing the yield a difference of 0.15 in yield is pretty insignificant relative to a 30 versus 0 dividend tax but a key question is does your country have a foreign tax credit like the us does if so you usually end up getting that 30 back just delayed until you get your tax return and the question of which exchange to buy on becomes not so clear cut if your country does n't have such a tax credit then yes you 'll want to buy on an exchange where you wo n't get hit with the dividend tax note that i got this information from a great article i read several months back site requires free registration to see it all unfortunately they discuss the case of un versus both on the nyse but adrs for unilever in the netherlands and the uk respectively the logic is very similar to your situation

while there are lots of really plausible explanations for why the market moves a certain way on a certain day no one really knows for sure   in order to do that you would need to understand the minds of all the market players   these days many of these players are secret proprietary algorithms   i 'm not with the specifics of these explanations i have no better just pointing out that these are just really and if the market starts following different patterns they will be tossed into the dust bin of old thinking i think the best thing you can explain to your son is that the stock market is basically a gigantic highly complex poker game   the daily gyrations of the market are about individuals trying to predict where the herd is going to go next and then after that and then after that etc if you want to help him understand the market i suggest two things   the first is to find or create a simple market game and play it with him   the other would be to teach him about how bonds are priced and why prices move the way they do   i know this might sound weird and most people think bonds are esoteric but there are bonds have a much simpler pricing model based on fundamental financial logic   it 's much easier then to get your head around the moves of the bond markets because the part of the price based on beliefs is much more limited i.e. will the company be able pay where are rates going   once you have that understanding you can start thinking about the different ways stocks can be valued there are many and what the market movements mean about how people are valuing different companies with regard to this specific situation here 's a different take on it from the priced in explanation which is n't really different but might make more sense to your son pretend for a second that at some point these stocks did move seasonally   in the late fall and winter when sales went up the stock price increased in kind   so some smart people see this happening every year and realize that if they bought these stocks in the summer they would get them cheap and then sell them off when they go up   more and more people are doing this and making easy money   so many people are doing it that the stock starts to rise in the summer now   people now see that if they want to get in before everyone else they need to buy earlier in the spring   now the prices start rising in the spring   people start buying in the beginning of the year you can see where this is going right   essentially a strategy to take advantage of well known seasonal patterns is unstable   you ca n't profit off of the seasonal changes unless everyone else in the market is too stupid to see that you are simply anticipating their moves and react accordingly

i remember in the 19th and early 20th century was the problem of trusts set up by the wealthy to avoid taxes hence the term anti trust that 's not what antitrust means   the trusts in that case were monopolies that used their outsized influence to dominate customers and suppliers   they were n't for tax evasion purposes   trusts were actually older than a permanent income tax   antitrust law was passed around the same time as a permanent income tax becoming legal   prior to that income taxes were temporary taxes imposed to pay for wars    the primary ways to evade taxes was to move expenses out of the personal and into businesses or charities   the business could pay for travel hotels meals and expenses   or a charity could pay for a trip as a promotion activity the infamous safari to africa scheme   charities can pay salaries to employees so someone could fund a charity tax deductible and then use that money to pay people rather than giving gifts   if you declare your house as a historical landmark a charity could maintain it    subscribe to magazines at the office and set them in the waiting room after you read them   use loyalty program rewards from business expenses for personal things   sign up for a benefit for all employees at a steep discount and pay everyone a little less as a result   barter   you do something for someone else e.g. give them a free car and they return the favor   call it marketing or promotion trump is carried away from his tower in a new mercedes benz limousine    another option is to move income and expenses to another tax jurisdiction that has even fewer laws about it   where the united states increasingly cracked down on personal expenses as business expenses many jurisdictions would be happy just to see the money flow through and sit in their banks briefly    tax policy is different now than it was then   many things that would have worked then would n't work now   the irs is more aggressive about insisting that some payments be considered income even if the organization writes the check directly to someone else   it 's unclear what would happen if united states tax rates went back to the level they had in the fifties or even the   would tax evasion become again   or would it stay closer to current levels    the rich actually pay a higher percentage of the overall income taxes now than they did in the and fifties   and the rich in the united states pay a higher percentage of the taxes paid than the rich in other countries with higher marginal rates   some of this may be more rich people in the us than other countries but tax policy is part of that too   high income taxes make it hard to become rich

i 'm staring at this chart and asking myself how long a period is enough to have an average i 'd be happy with regardless of the direction the market goes   3 years 4 years clearly a lump sum investment risks a 2000 buy at 1500 not good honestly i love the question and find it interesting but there 's likely no exact answer just some back and forth analysis you 're investing about $ 40k yr anyway i 'd suggest a 4 year timeframe is a good time to invest the new money as well other folk want to offer opinions edit with the op 's additional info he expects these bonuses to continue my updated advice is to dca quarterly if going into assets with a transaction fee or monthly if into a no fee fund over just a one year period

how are shareholders sure to receive a fair percentage of each company   at the time the split occurs each investor owns the same proportion of each new company that they owned in the first   what the investor does with it after that selling one for example is irrelevant from a fairness perspective suppose company a splits into companies b and c.   you own enough stock to have 1 of a.   it splits   now you have a bunch of shares of b and c.   how much   well you have 1 of b and 1 of c.   what if all the profitable projects are in b   then shares of b will be worth more than those of c.   but it should be the case that the value of your shares of b plus the value of your shares of c are equal to the original value of your shares of a.   completely fair   in fact if the split was economically justified then b + c > a.   and the gains are realized proportionally by all equityholders remember when a stock splits every share splits so that everyone owns both companies in the same proportion as everyone else   executives do n't determine what the prices of the resulting companies are that is determined by the market   a fair market will value the child companies such that together they are worth what the original was

is that indicator can only be used for short term trade first of all indicator works perfect during trends and oscillator works perfectly in the range flat market so indicator can be used for long term as well as short term i mean if it is a range market using this or any other indicator will not help much so it you should consider market direction first if it can be used to long term trade is there something i need to change from the parameters used like only using the parameters are there to change them of course you can change them based on your trading style considering my statement above does not mean that trading is very easy i never use indicators alone to make trading decisions it is always good to use oscillator to filter out bad trading signals

this probably is a question that belongs on history but here 's the basic reason the or employee retirement income security act erisa of 1974 established that health benefits under approved plans were not taxable to the employee   if the employer were to pay for an employees non erisa approved individual plan it would be a taxable benefit the longer story is that many esp president richard nixon were concerned that public pressure was going to lead public sentiment toward nationalized health care   this made health insurance more affordable to employees and effectively made it a cheaper way to compensate employees similar to how 401 k contributions are worth more in nominal terms to the employee than an equivalent amount of cash   while the law was not signed by richard nixon due to some other stuff that was going on it was something proposed and pushed by his administration

quote driven markets are the to the modern securities market before electronic trading and hfts specifically trading was thin and onerous   today the average investor can open up a web page type in a security and buy at the spread permitted by regulators with anyone else who wants to take the other side before the lines between market maker and speculator became blurred to a market maker was one who was contractually obligated to an exchange to provide a bid and ask for a given security on said exchange even though at heart a market maker is still simply a trader despite the obligation   a market maker would simultaneously buy a large amount of securities privately and short the same amount to have no directional bias exposure to the direction of the security and commence to making the market   the market maker would estimate its cost basis for the security based upon those initial trades and provide a bid and ask appropriate for the given level of volume   if volumes were high the spread would be low and vice versa market makers who survived crashes and spikes would forgo the potential profit in always providing a steady price and spread ie increased volume otherwise known as revenue to maintain no directional bias   in other words if there were suddenly many buyers and no sellers hitting the market maker 's ask the mm would raise the ask rapidly in proportion to the increased exposure while leaving the bid somewhere below the cost basis   eventually a seller would arise and hit the mm 's bid bringing the market maker 's inventory back into balance and narrowing the spread that particular mm could provide since a responsible mm 's ask could rise very high very quickly if a lack of its volume relative to its inventory made inventory too costly   this was temporarily extremely costly to the trader if there were few market makers on the security the trader was trading or already exposed to market makers prefer to profit from the spread bidding below some predetermined price based upon the cost basis of the market maker 's inventory while asking above that same predetermined cost basis   traders profit from taking exposure to a security 's direction or lack thereof in the case of some options traders because of electronic trading liquidity rebates offered by exchanges not only to contractually obligated official market makers but also to any trader who posts a limit order that another trader hits and algorithms that become better by the day market making hfts have supplanted the traditional market maker and there are many hfts where there previously were few official market makers   this speed and diversification of risk across many many market making hfts have kept spreads to the minimum on large equities and have reduced the same for the smallest equities on major exchanges orders and quotes are essentially identical   both are double sided auction markets with bids and asks   the difference lies in that non market makers specialists etc orders are not shown to the rest of the market providing an informational advantage to mms and an informational disadvantage to the trader   before electronic trading this construct was of no consequence since trader orders were infrequent   with the prevalence of hfts the informational disadvantage has become more costly so order driven markets now prevail with much lower spreads and accelerated volumes even though market share for the major exchanges has dropped rapidly and number of trades even though the size of individual trades have fallen the worst aspect of the quote driven market was that traders could not directly trade with each other so all trades had to go between a market maker specialist etc   while this may seem to have increased cost to a trader who could only trade with another trader by being arbitraged by a mm et al paying more than what another trader was willing to sell these costs were dwarfed by the potential absence of those market makers   without a bid or ask at any given time there could be no trade so the costs were infinite in essence a quote driven market protects market makers from the competition of traders   while necessary in the days where paper receipts were from brokerage to brokerage and the trader did not dedicate itself to round the clock trading it has no place in a computerized market   it is more costly to the trader to use such a market explaining quote driven markets rapid exit

conceptually yes you need to worry about it   as a practical matter it 's less likely to be exercised until expiry or shortly prior the way to think about paying a european option is odds of paying out = odds that strike is in the money at expiry whereas the american option can be thought of as odds of paying out = odds that strike price is in the money at expiry + odds that strike price is in the money prior to expiry odds that other party will exercise early this is just a heuristic not a formal financial tool   but the point is that you need to consider the odds that it will go into the money early for how long maybe over multiple periods and how likely the counterparty is to exercise early important considerations for whether they will exercise early are the strategy of the other side long straddle quick turnaround the length of time the option is in the money early and the anticipated future movement a quick buck strategy might exercise immediately before the stock turns around   but that could leave further gains on the table so it 's usually best to wait unless the expectation is that the stock will quickly reverse its movement   this sort of counter market strategy is generally unlikely from someone who bought the option at a certain strike and is equivalent to betting against their original purchase of the option   so most of these people will wait because they expect the possibility of a bigger payoff a long strategy is usually in no hurry to exercise and in fact they would prefer to wait until the end to hold the time value of the option the choice to get out of the option if it goes back to being unprofitable   so it usually makes little sense for these people to exercise early   the same goes for a straddle if someone is buying an option for insurance or to economically exit a position so you 're really just concerned that people will exercise early and forgo the time value of the american option   that may include people who really want to close a position take their money and move on   in some cases it may include people who have become overextended or need liquidity so they close positions   but for the most part it 's less likely to happen until the expiration approaches because it leaves potential value on the table   the time value of an option at the end because the implicit option becomes less likely especially if the option is fairly deep in the money the implicit option is then fairly deep out of the money so early exercise becomes more meaningful concern as the expiration approaches   otherwise it 's usually less worrisome but more than a nonzero proposition

as an addition to chris rea 's excellent answer these tender offers are sometimes made specifically to cast doubt on the current market price for instance a large public company that contracts with a smaller supplier or service company also public might make a tender offer below market price the market will look at this price and the business relationship and wonder what the larger company knows about the smaller one that they do n't now what happens when investors lose confidence in a stock they sell it supply goes up demand goes down and the price drops the company making the tender offer can then get its shares either way directly via the offer or on the open market this is however usually not successful beyond the very short term and typically only works because the company making a tender offer is the gorilla which can dictate its own terms with practically anyone else it meets such offers are also very closely watched by the sec if there 's any hint that the larger company is acting in a predatory manner or that its management is using the power and information of the company to profit themselves the strategy will backfire as the larger company finds itself the target of sec and doj legal proceedings

you seem to underestimate the risk of this deal for the a person purchasing a residence is happy to pay $ 70 k instead of $ 150 k now and the only risk they take is that the construction company fails to build the condo whatever happens on the estate market in two years they still saved the price difference between the price of complete apartments and to be build apartments which by the way may be less than $ k since that $ 150 k is the price on a hot market in two years however an investor aiming to earn money counts on that the property will actually cost $ 150 k in two years so he 's additionally taking the risk that the estate market may drop should that happen their return on investment will be considerably lower and it 's entirely possible they will make a loss instead of a profit at this point this becomes yet another high risk investment option like financing a startup

by process i assume you mean the financial process financially this does n't look any different to me than buying an empty lot to build a rental unit with the added expense potentially significant of doing the tear down given your lack of experience and capital i would be very hesitant to jump in like this you are going to have to spend a lot of time managing the build process or pay someone else to do it for you and expect everything to take twice as long and cost twice as much as you expect if you really want to get into the landlord business i would suggest starting with a structurally sound building that needs some renovation work and start there one you have that up and running you can use the cash flow and equity to finance something more aggressive if you still think you want to do this the first thing to do is figure out if the financials make sense how much will it cost to do the tear down and rebuild plus the typical rental expenses ongoing maintenance taxes insurance vacancy rates and compare that to the expected rental rates in the area to see how long it will take to 1 achieve a positive cash flow and 2 break even there are a lot of good questions on this site related to rentals that go into much more detail about how to approach this

gt but if i have my own iphone and i volunteer to use it instead of being out of communication from 5 pm 8 am and they turn around and tell me that a device that i bought and use for personal reasons is limited to whatever they decide to allow me to use well forget that   if it 's your personal device indeed if you have confidential or proprietary company data on it such as internal emails via then it becomes very relevant for your employer to secure it

there are a few ways you can go about paying this off quickly and safely you could start paying $ monthly ie double what you 're paying now you 'll pay less interest in the long run because they can only charge you for the amount outstanding remember 6.8 of $ 12k is more than 6.8 of $ 6k however your plan sounds more sensible say you get to $ 6k paid off and $ 6k saved you 're able to pay off what 's left and that 's almost $ 200 a month you 'll have extra although what i like about this is if you become ill lose your job or whatever then you 're still able make the $ payments plus you 'll have money saved for day to day expenses food water gas electricity etc long enough to see yourself through ps they may charge you a settlement fee because if you pay early then they miss out on money but check your contract with them first hope this helps

it 's interesting how ups does n't seem to be having a problem a private company     it 's more evidence that the government is n't really good at running anything   it 's partially because they do n't have to worry about making a profit and since it 's not their money it 's ours piss it away   if they ca n't even run something simple as the post office without nearly going out of business healthcare is an impossibility

if you do not understand the volatility of the fx market you need to stop trading it immediately there are many reasons that fx is riskier than other types of investing and you bear those risks whether you understand them or not below are a number of reasons why fx trading has high levels of risk 1 fx trades on the relative exchange rate between currencies that means it is a zero sum game over time the global fx market can not grow if the us economy doubles in size and the european economy doubles in size then the exchange rate between the usd and the eur will be the same as it is today in an extreme example all else being equal yes i know that value of currency /= value of total economy but the general point stands   compare that with the stock market if the us economy doubles in size then effectively the value of your stock investments will double in size that means that stocks bonds etc tied to real world economies generally increase when the global economy increases it is a positive sum game where many players can be winners on the long term on average most people earn value without needing to get into timing of trades this allows many people to consider long term equity investing to be lower risk than day trading with fx because the value of a currency is in its relative position compared with another currency 1 player is a winner 1 player is a loser by this token most fx trading is necessarily short term day trading which by itself carries inherent risk 2 fx markets are insanely efficient i will lightly state that this is my opinion but one that i am not alone in holding firmly this means that public information about a currency ie economic news political news etc is nearly immediately acted upon by many many people so that the revised fx price of that currency will quickly adjust the more efficient a market is the harder it is to time a trade as an example if you see on a news feed that the head of a central bank authority made an announcement about interest rates in that country a common driver of fx prices you have only moments to make a trade before the large institutional investors already factor it into their bid ask prices keep in mind that the large fx players are dealing with millions and billions of dollars markets can move very quickly because of this note that some currencies trade more frequently than others the main currency pairs are typically between usd and or other country currencies jpy eur etc as you get into currencies of smaller countries trading of those currencies happens less frequently this means that there may be some additional time before public information is priced in to the market value of that currency making that currency less efficient on the flip side if something is infrequently traded pricing can be more volatile as a few relatively smaller trades can have a big impact on the market   3 uncertainty of political news if you make an fx trade based on what you believe will happen after an expected political event you are taking risk that the event actually happens politics and world events can be very hard to predict and there is a high element of chance involved see recent expected election results across the world for evidence of this for something like the stock market a particular industry may get hit every once in a while with unexpected news but the fx market is inherently tied to politics in a way that may impact exchange rates multiple times a day 4 leveraging it is very common for fx traders to borrow money to invest in fx this creates additional risk because it amplifies the impact of your positive or negative returns this applies to other investments as well but i mention it because high degrees of debt leveraging is extremely common in fx to answer your direct question there are no single individual traders who spike fx prices that is the impact you see of a very efficient market with large value traders reacting to frequent surprising news   i reiterate if you do not understand the risks associated with fx trade i recommend that you stop this activity immediately at least until you understand it better and i would recommend personally that any amateur investor never get involved in fx at all regardless of how informed you believe you are

i 'd think that liquidity and speed are prioritized even over retail brokers and in come cases over pop for institutional traders who by default have large positions   when the going gets tough these guys are out and the small guys trading through average retail brokers are the ones left holding the empty bag

i think you 're confusing risk analysis that is what you quoted as taleb distribution with arguments against taking risks altogether you need to understand that not taking a risk is by itself a risk you can lose money by not investing it because of the very same taleb distribution an unpredictable catastrophic event take an example of keeping cash in your house and not investing it anywhere in the 1998 default of the russian federation people lost money by not investing it why because had they invested the money they would have the investments properties but since they only had cash it became worthless overnight there 's no argument for or against investing on its own the arguments are always related to the investment goals and the risk analysis you 're looking for something that does n't exist

it 's definitely broken window fallacy the entire premise is that vehicle accidents cost money and productivity if they can be avoided we will be more productive if we had technology that made car insurance obsolete everyone in that industry could do another productive activity   textbook broken window fallacy

if you business is incorporated it 's up to the two of you how to do it typically you will have the company write cheques or make transfers whatever to each of the humans if you want to say that each of you gets a salary of 80 of the revenue you bring in and then tweak things with bonuses you can if one of you is contributing more to marketing and awareness and less to revenue then you may prefer to pay you each the same even though the revenue you bring are different it 's up to you it 's quite literally your business when you 're not incorporated then for tax purposes you split the income and the expenses according to your ownership share if that does n't seem fair to you then a partnership is probably not as useful to you as being incorporated in general it 's better to be incorporated once you 're past any initial phase in which the business is losing money for tax purposes acquiring depreciable assets and the partners have taxable income from elsewhere day jobs or at least income from the earlier part of the year before starting the business i would recommend that the partnership phase of the business be very short get incorporated and get a shareholder agreement

basically you need to use a time value of money equation to discount the cashflows back to today the wikipedia formula will likely work fine for you then you just need to pick an effective interest rate to use in the calculation run each of your amounts and dates though the formula there are various on line calculators to pick from and sum up the values you did not mention your location or jurisdiction but a useful proxy for the interest rate would be the average between the same duration mortgage rate and fixed deposit rate at your bank it should be close enough for your purposes although if an actual lawsuit is involved and the sums high enough to have lawyers it might be worth engaging an accountant as well to defend the of both the calculation and the interest rates chosen

when did i ever mention the constitution ever considered that i 'm not even american so basing my arguments on your constitution would n't make sense to me   capitalism is barter you do n't neither need government enforcement nor centralized currencies in fact that 's what anarcho capitalists always were speaking out against   capitalism does not require maintenance and there 's this thing called private schools loans and private security i 'm no i 'm just saying and even you yourself did not dare to put healthcare in that list apparently   are you seriously going to base your arguments on a game that has a maximum of 12 pieces a single branch of business and limited amounts of money go ahead it 's past midnight but even me realizes that that 's a terrible idea

private investors that do n't have the time or expertise for active investment   this may be known as every private investor an index fund ensures average returns the bulk of active trading is done by private institutions with of experts studying the markets and ai scraping every bit of data it can get from the news stock market the weather reports etc because of that to get above average returns an average percent of the time singular private investors have to drastically beat the average large team of individuals software now that index etf are becoming so fashionable could there be a tipping point at which the market signals that active investors send become so diluted that this index etf collapses how would this look like and would it affect only those who invest in index etf or would it affect the stock market more generally to make this question perhaps more on topic is the fact or presumption that index etf rely indirectly on active investment decisions by other market participants as explained above a known source of concern for personal investment this is a well covered topic some people think this will be an issue    others point out that it is a hard issue to bootstrap i to this view a small active market can support a large number of passive investors if the number of active investors ever got too low the gains likelihood of gains that could be made from being an active investor would rise and generate more active investors private investing makes sense in a few cases one example is ethics some people may not want to be invested even indirectly in certain companies

this comes as a consequence to the notion of an income tax   remove that and there wo n't be shenanigans like this anymore   libertarians do n't stand for the notion that government owns your property income and can determine how much you get to keep after they forcefully take some from you or threaten you with being put in a cage   rather we suggest for a consumption tax to replace it

as a common shareholder why would i want to approve an increase in the number of authorized shares because it could increase the value of your existing shares companies sell new shares to raise capital and they use capital to among other things expand if whole foods issues new shares and uses the capital to opens new stores then profit could increase enough to offset the dilution effect and your stock price will go up you should ask yourself   what areas is is your company of choice planning on expanding into will they do well there are there better ways for the company to raise capital debt cash in hand cut expenses elsewhere etc if you think that the management has a good plan for expanding then authorizing new shares makes good sense for you personally
