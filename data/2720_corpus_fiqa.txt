there are probably many correct answers to this question but for most people the main reason is qualified dividends to be a qualified dividend and therefore eligible for lower tax rates the dividend paying stock or fund must be held for more than 60 days during the period that begins 60 days before the ex dividend date since many stocks and funds pay out dividends at the end of the year that means it takes until to late february to determine if you held them and therefore made the dividend qualified brokerages do n't want to send out 1099s in january and then possibly have to send out revised versions if you decide to sell something that paid a dividend in december that otherwise would have been qualified

the simple answer is that brokerages have to close the books at the end of the year before they can send out the tax forms what this entails is off topic for this site i doubt that printing and mailing the forms takes very long it is simply the process of reconciling the books so they do n't have to send out corrected forms if errors are corrected during that reconciliation process

there are those who would suggest that due to the efficient market hypothesis stocks are always fairly valued consider if non professional posters on se here had a method that worked beyond random chance everyone seeking such a method would soon know it if everyone used that method it would lose its advantage in theory this is how stocks values remain rational   that said williams r is one such indicator it can be seen in action on yahoo finance   in the end i find such indicators far less useful than the news itself bp oil spill did anyone believe that such a huge oil company would n't recover from that disaster it recovered by nearly doubling from its bottom after that news a chart of nflx netflix offers a similar news disaster and recovery   both of these examples are not quantifiable in my opinion just gut reactions a quick look at the company and answer to one question do i feel this company will recover to be candid in the crash i felt that way about ford and gm ford returned 10x from the bottom gm went through bankruptcy that observation suggests another question i.e. where is the line drawn between investing and gambling my answer is that buying one stock hoping for its recovery is gambling being able to do this for 5 10 stocks or one every few months is investing

those are valid but i think you will see banks move into fintech as they already have and they are also moving into blockchain one thing that banks have is money and that allows them to move into new spaces in the economy even if they are late to the party when you have institutions that have been around for more than a century they do n’t just go away    i think you start to see trading revenue comeback eventually the passive versus active investing is a cycle as more and more people jump into passive investments it will inevitably change the market because suddenly everything becomes more correlated once there is enough volatility to scare people out of their passive investments then the indices are going to fall then you ’ll start seeing how active investing is better and people start to move back passive investing is good when everything is up but on the downside active investing if you have the right managers will outperform once this occurs you will start to see more volatility in the markets again and a return to active management until inevitably people start to move back to passive again

first make sure you have some money in a savings account that you can use instead of credit cards for making future purchases that go beyond what you have in your checking account $ 1000 is a good amount to start with so just take that out of the $ 5000 then pay off the best buy card you should n't be worried about the minimum payment determine what you can pay per month say $ 400 and take the minimum payments out of that then choose one card to get the rest of your $ 400 plus the remaining $ 1500 of your $ 5000 this should be the highest interest card mathematically but it may or may not be your best choice it depends on your personality some people get a psychological lift out of seeing debts disappear and it gives them more motivation to keep going those people may be better served by paying off the smallest debts first to get them out of the way i 'm an so it bothers me more to think that i 'll be paying a little more in interest over the long term by taking that route

although i do n't think you need to factor in risk tolerance to get the probabilities i agree with joetaxpayer that you will need to factor in risk tolerance in order to make a practical decision about what to do   in fact i think that to make a practical decision you will need more than the specific probability you ask for you in the question rather you would like to see the complete probability distribution of possible outcomes in other words it 's not enough to know that there is a 51 chance that investing will outperform paying down debt   you actually need to know much it outperforms when it does outperform and how much it underperforms when it underperforms   as joetaxpayer 's comment suggests you might not choose to make an investment that had a 99 chance of outperforming debt payment by 1 and a 1 chance of underperforming by 99 i think it possible to address these questions by doing simulations   this can be done even with a spreadsheet but more flexibly with simple programming   essentially you can create some kind of probabilistic model of the various factors e.g. chance that your investment will go up or down and see what actually happens how often you lose a lot of money lose a little money gain a little money or gain a lot of money   then based on that you can consult your inner spirit animal to decide whether the probability distribution of possible gains outweighs that of possible losses

there are two terms that are related but separate here broker and market maker   the former is who goes and finds a buyer seller to buy sell shares from to you    the latter market maker is a company which will agree to partner with you to complete the sale at a set price typically the market price often by definition as the market maker often is the one who determines the market price in a relatively low listing   a market maker will have as you say a pool of relatively common stock and even relatively uncommon up to a point for this purpose a broker can be a market maker or work for one also in which case he would sell you directly the shares from the market maker   this may be a bad idea for you the broker while obligated to act in your interest in theory may push you towards stocks that the brokerage acts as a market maker for

the standard answer i have heard is that if you were to purchase term life insurance and invest the difference between the cost of the policies your investments would grow larger than the cash value of the insurance also when you take cash out of the insurance value drops by a like amount so you ca n't have your cake and leave it to your heirs too either you get the cash value or they get the insurance value hopefully there could be some of both although i believe the philosophy of that answer i have two issues with it first you must be dedicated enough to invest the difference every month i can imagine that might be tough to do consistently and if you take breaks from the investing will you still accumulate more than you would have with the insurance second for the past couple of years all of my investments in mutual funds have lost value my life insurance has continued to grow cash value over the same time period hmm maybe there is n't a one size fits all solution if you need a large amount of insurance term life will certainly be more affordable however considering this as an investment i would not expect that to be a deciding factor good luck with your decision it is great that at such a young age you are concerned about investments

although this scheme is likely to get shut down rather quickly by either your broker or credit card company some points you seem to have missed out on properly timed you should be able to get days of grace period 30 day billing cycle + 25 day grace period assuming you pay everything off every month and charge immediately following the statement date   you will need to avoid certain card issuers that code all transactions with financial institutions as cash advances citibank in if it is possible it would be in your best interest to lower cash advance limits to 0 to avoid any chance of cash advance fees if your credit card attempts to process it as a cash advance the transaction will just be declined and you wo n't be out anything otherwise one cash advance fee will eat several months worth of profits as far as investments with guaranteed principal goes the only thing you can realistically do is money market accounts and maybe treasury notes anything else and the short term price fluctuation may leave you high and dry if this scheme were to work you would be much better off attempting to get rewards for the purchases than anything you could invest in if you used a 2 card and it every month you would be looking at a 24 return on credit card rewards even 1 rewards gives you a 12 annual return which is going to beat anything you could invest the money in

then the brick and mortar stores will just switch to delivery walmart could deliver pretty much anything to you in 15 minutes as well as cvs or walgreens and a few other stores they do n't though because it is much more profitable to have you come into the store and buy some shit you do n't need if it ever reaches a tipping point where online is really taking away that much then they will easily change the going into a store and shopping is n't going anywhere though because there is certain brain chemistry at play that gets you to spend more money and enjoy it more not just because of getting the item sooner but the inspection process etc   what 's probably more likely is that you will end up going into small local very close to you demo stores and checking out the items deciding what you want using your smartphone to build a cart going through a cart confirmation and then the items will be delivered to your home in ~20 minutes or so there will also be things you can buy directly at the demo store and take home such as new items that are being promoted you may even be able to select items at home that you want to checkout and have that bundled with your delivery from the demo store

i would n't focus too much on dividends itself at the end of the day what matters is total gain because you can convert capital gain into income by selling your assets they have different tax implications but generally capital gains tend to be more tax efficient     i think the more important question is how much volatility you can tolerate since your investment horizon is short your risk tolerance is low as in if you suddenly get much lower income than you planned from your investment you 'll be in trouble you probably want assets that have low volatility    to achieve that i 'd consider the following if i were you tl;dr if i were you i 'd just hold a general investment portfolio with a lower risk profile rather than focusing on dividend generating assets

full payment is always better than auto loan if you are prudent with finances i.e if you take a loan you are factoring the emi hence your savings will remain as is however if you manage well you can buy the car with cash and at the same time put aside the notional emi as savings and investments the other factor to consider is what return your cash is giving if this more than auto loan interest rate post taxes you should opt for loan for example if auto loan is 10 and you are getting a return of 15 after taxes on investment then loan is better company car lease depends on terms more often you get break on taxes on the emi component but you have to buy at the end of lease period and re register the car in your name so there is additional cost some companies give lease at very favourable rates plus if you leave the job lease has to be broken and it becomes more expensive

i 'm not talking about the cfa i 'm talking about the entire finance industry ethics make it all possible   ethics provides room for trust between entities inside and outside the industry think about it if you are a small cap private company wanting to go public you trust that the underwriter will pay equity holders fairly for their units of equity if there is no trust in the price then there will be no underwriting and no ipo for a new stock to enter the public markets   if there is no trust between fund managers and financial reports the there is no trust in estimated prospects and everything will be into speculative dangerous zones of future uncertainty   there 's always a difference between being genuinely wrong and being a liar   tl;dr industry wide standards of ethics builds a foundation for trust which everyone uses directly or indirectly in finance

the fact that some asset in this case corporate bonds has positive correlation with some other asset equity does n't mean buying both is n't a good idea   unless they are perfectly correlated the best risk reward portfolio will include both assets as they will sometimes move in opposite directions and cancel out each other 's risk   so yes you should buy corporate bonds   short term government bonds are essentially the risk free asset   you will want to include that as well if you are very risk averse otherwise you may not   long term government bonds may be default free but they are not risk free   they will make money if interest rates fall and lose if interest rates rise   because of that risk they also pay you a premium albeit a small one and should be in your portfolio so yes a passive portfolio actually any reasonable portfolio should strive to reduce risk by diversifying into all assets that it reasonably can   if you believe the capital asset pricing model the weights on portfolio assets should correspond to market weights more money in bonds than stocks   otherwise you will need to choose your weights   unfortunately we are not able to estimate the true expected returns of risky assets so no one can really agree on what the true optimal weights should be   that 's why there are so many rules of thumb and so much disagreement on the subject   but there is little or no disagreement on the fact that the optimal portfolio does include risky bonds including long term treasuries to answer your follow up question about an anchor if by that you mean a risk free asset then the answer is not really   any risk free asset is paying approximately zero right now   some assets with very little risk will earn a very little bit more than short term treasuries but overall there 's nowhere to hide the time value of money is extremely low at short horizons   you want expected returns you must take risk

gt;as a legal matter shareholders who purchase shares of stock in a   corporation own nothing more than that shares of stock similarly bondholders own only bonds and executives with employment contracts own their contracts none of these types of ownership give shareholders bondholders or executives the right to control the firm the right to control the firm ’s assets and actions rests in the hands of its board of directors and only when they act as a body and follow proper board procedures   all this says is decisions are made by the board this is not news and it does n't mean that shareholders do not own the company shareholders elect the board by the way   gt;an important consequence of this governance structure is that shareholders not only have no legal right to control the firm they also have no legal right to help themselves to the corporation ’s     assets   well that 's wrong   gt;in fact the only time shareholders receive any funds directly from the corporation ’s coffers is when they receive a dividend or the corporation repurchases their shares   or you know in the case of bankruptcy   gt;this only happens when the directors vote to declare a dividend or a corporate repurchase   the same directors who were appointed by shareholders   gt;at law a principal has a right to control her agent but shareholders ca n’t exercise direct control over corporate directors   i suppose this is true in the sense that shareholders can not practice slavery but shareholders can again vote on issues relating to the governance of the company   gt;it is thus wildly misleading to describe shareholders as the sole residual claimants in companies that are n’t actually in bankruptcy   this is only true if you 're retarded and do n't know what residual means   gt;this idea is supported by modern options theory in effect bondholders own the right to access cash flow but have sold a call to shareholders while shareholders own the right to access the cash flow but have sold a put to bondholders neither shareholders nor bondholders can claim an exclusive right to own the company ’s cash flow much less the company   this is a made up explanation that does n't mean anything the real options model of corporate assets is that corporate debt is a risk free bond with a short put option and equity is a call option there is no deal in actuality or in spirit between debt and equity owners   you can dismiss the article as shit

i have a different perspective i believe the move to roth may be beneficial to a select few but not most people i coined the phrase as i believe that 's what 's happening a relatively uninformed move based on fear and not enough analysis   let 's look at a retiree today a couple has a $ standard deduction and 2 exemptions worth $ each this is $ they can withdraw tax free it would take pretax savings of $ k to support this withdrawal at   the 10 bracket is the next $ of taxable income or another $ k in assets to produce this annual withdrawal last for today the 15 bracket is the next $ which would require $ m to produce   the punchline today 's retiree couple can have over $ 2.1 m in pretax money this includes pension value if any of course and still be in the 15 bracket   if you ca n't deposit to a roth you are in the 28 bracket now or higher are you on track to have over $ 2 m in today 's dollars at retirement   one point that few mention is there are not just the two today 's tax rate vs retirement tax rate every year offers a situation where your income may drop a job loss a spouse staying home with a new child a disability a year back at school   these are the years that you might convert to roth just enough to fill your bracket back to your average prior rate e.g. convert to a taxable income of exactly $ and pay a marginal rate of 25   i 'll be the first to congratulate those who tell me they have a defined benefit pension that will replace their income to such a level that with their investments they are retiring at a higher income level than while working roth is the answer for them   roth is great for the 80 yr old woman i help 10 years ago i observed her marginal rate to be 15 and we convert just enough to put her at the top of that bracket this year $ 34,000 in taxable income this helps slow down the effect of her rmds required minimum distributions continuing to rise and potentially put her in the 25 bracket   so to be clear i 'm not anti roth i 'm just in favor of a thorough analysis and avoiding the roth for everyone mentality   edit i was asked by a financial writer kay bell to write on this very topic and appear on her site in a guest post roth iras and your retirement income it goes into greater detail than i could offer here tell kay joe sent you

this is an answer grounded in reality not advice most states have no means of enforcing their foreign business entity registration statutes some states never even codified consequences california is a notable exception some states have business licenses that you need in order to defend your entity in court but will retroactively apply the corporate veil when you get the license the do i have to register question is analogous to asking a barber if you need a haircut but this does n't absolve you of looking in the mirror doing your research registration and income taxes are different stories if a state calls their fee a franchise tax and it is applicable and there are real consequences for not then you will have to pay that tax anyway this is n't advocating breaking the law but since it describes ignoring state chartered agencies then there are people that will disagree with this post despite being in line with business climate in the united states hope that helps

yes management fees cut directly into your profits a fund which achieves 8 growth but costs 1 to maintain delivers only 7 to you compounded over years even a relatively small difference can add up to a significant amount of money this is one of the advantages index funds have they may not be as sophisticated as human managed funds but their expense ratio is so much lower that the end result for the investor is often as good as or better than the more expensive products in fact at least one study found that for each category they researched low expense ratio was a better predictor of good return on investment than anything else they looked at that does n't mean cheapest is always best or most expensive is always worst but it does mean you should be very very sure an expensive fund really is that much better before choosing it and sticking with simple index funds may be a perfectly reasonable choice

from your description the taxes may have been withheld incorrectly you were most likely a nonresident alien during your entire stay teachers and which include anyone on j status who is not a student are exempt individuals exempt from the substantial presence test unless they have already been an exempt individual during any part of 2 of the prior 6 calendar years so if you have n't been in the u.s. as an f-1 j-1 etc for at least 6 7 years before you came on j-1 this time the first two calendar years of your time on j-1 this time does not count towards the substantial presence test you said you were there for 18 months that stretches over either 2 or 3 calendar years the first two calendar years of it would be exempt from the even if it stretched into a third calendar year an 18-month period could not stretch for more than 6 months into a 3rd calendar year so even in that case you would still not meet the substantial presence test for the 3rd year since you do not meet the presence test during any of those years you were a nonresident alien for all of those years unless you decided to file jointly with a resident spouse or something nonresident aliens on j-1 are exempt from fica taxes social security tax and medicare tax for employment as a researcher that you were authorized to do on your j-1 they should not have withheld fica taxes from you you should have informed them at the beginning when you initially noticed that they did because it is a huge pain to get it back afterwards for fica taxes withheld in error you can first ask the employer to refund them and if that fails get a written statement of their refusal and then file form 843 and form with the irs however given that irs is very underfunded these days expect it to take a long time to hear back if you ever hear back

some historical and mathematical insights as a complement to existing answers   history i found it astonishing that already in ancient roman they investigated the issue of perpetuity of almost writes in de re 3 3 in century ad about a perpetuity of principal under 6 p.a resulting in 1950 annual payment and   if   the     would   enter   this   amount   as   a   debt   against his just as a does with a debtor    so that the owner may realize the aforementioned six per cent interest on that total as a perpetual annuity   he   should   take   in   1950 every   year    by   this   reckoning   the return on seven even according to the opinion of exceeds the interest on math if we fix a scholarship at a year then it 's clear that it could be paid out infinitely if we could achieve 3.33 p.a on it   on the other side with 0 we 'll spend out the endowment in 30 years thus having the interest rate between 0 and 3.33 p.a we could vary the life of endowment between 30 years and infinity just a few numbers in between under 1 it would be years under 2 years under 3 years however 1000 $ in 78 years could be less than 10 $ today conclusion to keep it perpetual either the fund 's yield must be at the level of scholarship or re adjust the amount of scholarship depending on fund achievement or redefine the notion of perpetuity like 50 years is approximately infinite for our purpose

this solution obviously would n't work for everyone and is contingent on the circumstances of your parents finances with regards to their house but   have you considered buying your parents house   this way your parents desire for you to get a house as an investment would be satisfied they would n't have to worry about losing their home and you might even be able to work out a financing rent deal that is beneficial to everyone involved   there are definitely fewer costs going this route anyway for instance your parents wo n't have any marketing costs associated with selling the house and could pass this savings along to you   also having lived in the house for a large part of your life you will also know what you are getting in to

you should check with your broker i asked my broker a similar question just 2 weeks ago with their market orders they will be filled within 3 points from the current market bid ask if there is any remaining it will be placed as a limit order at 3 points away from the bid ask price for example if the current ask is 100 $ 1.00 followed by 500 $ 1.01 300 $ 1.02 and 100 $ 1.03 if you were to place a buy market order for 1000 shares you would get 100 filled at $ 1.00 500 filled at $ 1.01 300 filled at $ 1.02 and 100 filled at $ 1.03   if on the other hand you were to place a buy market order for 2000 shares you would get 100 filled at $ 1.00 500 filled at $ 1.01 300 filled at $ 1.02 and 100 filled at $ 1.03 with the remaining 1000 of your order being placed as a limit order at $ 1.03 again check with your broker as they may be different in how they treat their market orders

jack the mortgage professor provides a thorough analysis of a similar sounding system in addition i had the feeling that customers of mortgage relief should have gotten a spreadsheet for their $ 45 and wondered why they had n’t so i set out to develop a spreadsheet of my own that could quantify the benefits if there were any the major question i wanted the spreadsheet to answer was how large is the benefit of using the mortgage relief scheme if you do n’t have any surplus income but only just enough to make the scheduled payment this is the critical question because we know that if you use surplus income to make extra payments to principal you pay down the mortgage more quickly this is so whether you apply the income directly to the mortgage as most borrowers do or whether you follow the mortgage relief procedure where you use a credit line to pay down the mortgage and current income to pay down the credit line i spent much of my air time between philadelphia and san francisco on this project and finally gave it up once i removed surplus income from the equation i could not find a way to make the mortgage relief scheme work you may also want to read related articles by

so i want to sell my 100 shares of aapl to him at a price of 10 or    even 1 us dollar is that legal allowed of course it 's your stocks do with it what you want if the two persons are not served by a same broker you 'll have to talk to your broker about the technicalities of the transaction if the person who sell are us citizen and the person who buy are not and and vice versa since you asked specifically about us citizenship i 'll assume you 're in the us or the transaction is taking place in the us citizenship has nothing to do with it except may be for economic sanctions against russians or that may come into play what is important is the tax residency status such a transfer is essentially a gift and if you 're a us tax resident which does n't correlate to your immigration status necessarily you 'll have to deal with the gift tax consequences on the discount value for example you have 100 shares of aapl which you sold to your friend for $ 1 each when the fair market value fmv was $ 501 so essentially the friend got $ value for $ 100 i.e. $ 50 k gift since this amount is above the annual $ 14 k exemption you 'll have to deal with the gift tax and file gift tax return there are also consequences for the capital gains tax for both you and your friend i suggest you talk to a licensed tax adviser ea cpa licensed in your state about the specifics given your circumstances if you or the recipient are also a foreign citizen tax resident then that country 's laws also may affect your situation

ignoring any ethical considerations of defaulting on a mortgage obligation if your credit score fell future costs of borrowing would be greater if you could borrow money at all the true financial cost of these penalties would depend on your own intentions and circumstances the value of a credit score can not be quantified in any absolute sense because of these circumstances which will vary from person to person suppose a decision would result in your score falling from 700 to 600 as a result a future car loan would cost something like 2 more in interest per year let 's also suppose you would not be able to find a bank to give you money to buy a new home   the difficulties caused by this situation would depend on the person some people have no intention of taking out another mortgage or buying another car and to them a lowered credit score might make no difference to others it would be desirable to avoid these penalties the value of credit score would be equal to how much you would be willing to pay in the present to avoid these future penalties   if you intend to borrow money in the near future and somehow know how much more interest you will pay as a result of your lower score then you could approximate the value of the credit drop by summing all of the additional interest costs discounted into the present something a little like this year 's additional cost in interest 1 + your personal opportunity cost of funds ^ years in the future this extra interest will be paid   see time value of money explanation can you explain time value of money and compound interest and provide examples of each it could also be the case that you miss out on valuable financial opportunities as a result which could be added to the present value of the credit score drop   for example if the drop made you totally unable to purchase an investment property that would net you $ 10,000 in cash flows which would yield cash flows immediately the value of that investment would have been $ 10,000 1 + your personal opportunity cost of funds since you would not be able to make that investment in this example as a result of the decreased score the present value of the investment would be an opportunity cost of the lower score there are other hard to quantify costs of low credit to consider as well ranging from housing to employment to bragging rights   hopefully this has helped

the united states taxes nonresident aliens on two types of income first a nonresident alien who is engaged in a trade or business in the united states is taxed on income that is effectively connected with that trade or business second certain types of u.s source payments are subject to income tax withholding the determination of when a nonresident alien is engaged in a u.s. trade or business is highly fact specific and complex however keeping assets in a u.s. bank account should not be treated as a u.s. trade or business a nonresident alien 's interest income is generally subject to u.s. federal income tax withholding at a rate of 30 percent under section of the tax code interest on bank deposits however benefit from an exception under section so long as that interest is not effectively connected with a u.s. trade or business even though no tax needs to be withheld on interest on a bank deposit the bank should still report that interest each year to the irs on form the irs can then send that information to the tax authority in brazil please keep in mind that state and local tax rules are all different and whether interest on the bank deposits is subject to state or local tax will depend on which state the bank is in also the united states does tax nonresident aliens on wages paid from a u.s. company if those wages are treated as u.s source income generally wages are u.s source income if the employee provides services while physically present in the united states there are a few exceptions to this rule but they depend on the amount of wages and other factors that are specific to the employee 's situation   this is an area where you should really consult with a u.s. tax advisor before the employment starts maybe your company will pay for it

a company start with say $ 100 lets say the max it can borrow from bank is $ 100 $ 10 a year as interest after a years say on the $ 200 the company made a profit of $ 110 so it now has total $ 310 option 1 company pays back the bank $ 100 + $ 10 it further gave away the $ 100 back to shareholders as dividends the balance with company $ 100 it can again start the second year borrow from bank $ 100 10 interest and restart    option 2 company pays back the bank $ 100 + $ 10 it now has $ 200 it can now borrow $ 200 from bank $ 20 after a year it makes a profit of $ 250 economics of scale result $ 30 more quite a few companies in growth phase use option 2 as they can grow faster achieve economies of scale keep competition at bay etc now if i had a share of this company say 1 $ 1 by end of first year its value would be $ 2 at the end of year 2 it would be $ 3.3 now there is someone else who wants to buy this share at end of year 1 i would say this share gives me 100 returns every year so i will not sell at $ 2 give me $ 3 at the end of first year the buyer would think well if i buy this at $ 3 first year i would notionally get $ .3 and from then on $ 1 every year not bad this is still better than other stocks and better than bank cd etc so as long as the company is doing well and expected to do well in future its price keeps on increasing as there is someone who want to buy why would someone want to sell and not hold one 1 needs cash for buying house or other purposes close to retirement etc 2 is balancing the portfolio to make is less risk based 3 quite a few similar reasons    why would someone feel its right to buy 1 has cash and is young is open to small risk 2 believes the value will still go up further 3 quite a few similar reasons

it seems that you 're complicating things quite a bit   why would you not create a business entity open one or more bank accounts for it and then have the money wired into those accounts   if you plan on being a company then set up the appropriate structure for it in the u.s. you can form an s corporation or an llc and choose pass through taxation so that all you pay is income tax on what you receive from the business as personal income   the business itself would not have tax liability in such a case co mingling your personal banking with that of your business could create real tax headaches for you if you are n't careful so it 's not worth the trouble or risk

off the top of my head i do n't know of any publicly traded companies that routinely earmark distributions as return of capital but theoretically it 's certainly applicable to any publicly traded company the wikipedia article gives one situation in which a publicly traded company may use return of capital public business may return capital as a means to increase the debt equity ratio and increase their leverage risk profile since return of capital is a distribution it shrinks the firm 's equity thus increasing its leverage investopedia also has an article dividend facts you may not know that gives an example of when return of capital might be used sometimes especially in the case of a special large dividend part of the dividend is actually declared by the company to be a return of capital in this case instead of being taxed at the time of distribution the return of capital is used to reduce the basis of the stock making for a larger capital gain down the road assuming the selling price is higher than the basis for instance if you buy shares with a basis of $ 10 each and you get a $ 1 special dividend 55 cents of which is return of capital the taxable dividend is 45 cents the new basis is $ and you will pay capital gains tax on that 55 cents when you sell your shares sometime in the future a company may choose to earmark some or all of its distribution as return of capital in order to provide shareholders with a more beneficial tax treatment the irs describes this different tax treatment distributions that qualify as a return of capital are not dividends a return of capital is a return of some or all of your investment in the stock of the company a return of capital reduces the basis of your stock these distributions do n't necessarily count as taxable income except in some instances once the basis of your stock has been reduced to zero any further non dividend distribution is capital gain the irs also states a distribution generally qualifies as a return of capital if the corporation making the distribution does not have any accumulated or current year earnings and profits in this case the firm is lowering its equity because it 's paying distributions out of that equity instead of accumulated earnings profits a company may use return of capital to maintain a distribution even in times of financial difficulty   in the context of closed end funds however return of capital can be much more complicated and can affect the fund 's performance and reputation in numerous ways also jb king is correct in you that return of capital is not the same thing as return on the latter is a method for valuing a company and determining how efficient a company is where it comes to using its resources to quote jb king 's comment again

it 's so that your total mortgage payment stays the same every month obviously the interest due each month decreases over time as part of the principal is paid off each month and so if the proportion of interest and principal repayments were to stay the same then your first payment would be very large and your last payment would be almost nothing

the first question is essentially asking for specific investment advice which is off topic per the faq but i 'll take a stab at 2 and 3 2 if my 401k does n't change before i leave my job not planned in the    near future i should roll it over into my roth ira after i leave due    to these high expense ratios correct my advice is that you should roll over a 401 k into an ira the first chance you get usually when you leave the job 401 k plans are notorious for high expense ratios and why leave your money in a plan where you have a limited choice of investments anyway versus a self directed ira where you can invest in anything you want 3 should i still max contribute with these horrible expense ratios if they are providing a match yes even with the expense ratios it is hard to beat the immediate return of an employer match   if they are n't matching the answer is still probably yes for a few reasons you already are maxing out your ability to contribute to sheltered accounts so assuming you still want to sock away that money for retirement the tax benefits are still valuable and probably offset the expense ratios although you seem to be an exception it is hard for most people to be disciplined enough to put money in a retirement account after they have it in their hands versus auto deduction from paychecks
# 281419
there are kind of two answers here the practical reason an acquirer has to pay more for shares than their current trading price and the economic justification for the increase in price why must the acquirer must pay a premium as a practical matter   everyone has a different valuation of a company   the current trading price is the lowest price that any holder of the stock is willing to sell a little bit of stock for and the highest that anyone is willing to buy a little bit for however microsoft needs to buy a controlling share   to do this on the open market they would need to buy all the shares from people who 's personal valuation is low and then a bunch from people whose valuation is higher and so on   the act of buying that much stock would push the price up by buying all the shares from people who are really willing to sell   moreover as they buy more and more the remaining people increase their personal valuation so the price would really shoot up   avoid this situation by offering to buy a ton of stock at a substantially higher single price why is linkedin suddenly worth more than it was yesterday microsoft is expecting to be able to use its own infrastructure and tools to make more money with linkedin than linkedin would have before   in other words they believe that the linkedin division of microsoft after the merger will be worth more than linkedin alone was before the merger   this idea is the theoretical foundation for mergers in general and the main reason people use to argue for a higher price you could also argue that by expressing an interest in linkedin microsoft may be telling us something it knows about linkedin 's value that maybe we did n't realize before because we are n't as smart and informed as the people on microsoft 's board   but since it 's microsoft that 's doing the buying in this case i 'm going to go out on a limb and say this is not the main effect   given microsoft 's history the idea that they buy expensive things because they have money to burn is more compelling than the idea that they have an insight into a company 's value that we do n't

paying off your student loan before buying a house is certainly a great risk reduction move for you it will lower your debt to income ratio allowing your mortgage approval to go easier and it will free up more of your dollars to pay for the many miscellaneous projects that come with buying a house i think that if you are considering paying off your student loan before buying a house that means that your student loans are an amount you can fathom paying off and that you are motivated to be rid of your student loan debt    go for it and pay off your student loan

i do n't know why stocks in some industries tend to have lower prices per share than others it does n't really matter much whether a company has shares selling for $ 100 each or 10,000,000 shares selling for $ 10 each either way the total value is the same companies generally like to keep the share price relatively low so that if someone wants to buy a small amount they can like if the price was $ 10,000 per share than an investor with less than $ 10,000 to put in that one stock would be priced out of the market if it 's $ 10 then if someone wants $ 10 they can buy one share and if someone wants $ 10,000 they can buy 1000 shares as to why energy stocks are volatile i can think of several reasons one in our current world energy is highly susceptible to politics a lot of the world 's energy comes from the middle east which is a notoriously unstable region any time there 's conflict there energy supplies from the region become uncertain oil producing countries may embargo countries that they do n't like a war will at the very least interfere with transportation and shipping and may result in oil wells being destroyed etc two energy is consumed when you use it and most consumers have very limited ability to stockpile so you 're constantly buying the energy you need as you need it so if demand goes down it is reflected immediately compare this to say clothing most people expect to keep the same clothes for years wearing them repeatedly hopefully washing them now and then so if for some reason you decided today that you only need three red shirts instead of four this might not have any immediate impact on your buying it could be months before you would have bought a new red shirt anyway there is a tendency for the market to react rather slowly to changes in demand for shirts but with energy if you decide you only need to burn 3 gallons of gas per week instead of 4 your consumption goes down immediately within days three really adding to number two energy is highly perishable especially some forms of energy if a solar power station is capable of producing 10 but today there is only demand for 9 you ca n't save the unused for some future time when demand is higher it 's gone you can charge a battery with it but that 's pretty limited you can pile up coal or store natural gas in a tank until you need it but you ca n't save the output of a power plant note numbers two and three also apply to food which is why food production is also very volatile

us banks are often helpless with international checks so i would recommend to do a wire transfer instead otherwise you might end up being in the us with no money and a worthless piece of paper in your hand first set up your european account to allow wire transfers to the us if that needs any action speak to someone in the bank in person to make sure you can later initiate such a transfer remotely online after travelling set up your us account and then remote trigger a wire transfer costs are relatively small for example with you pay less than 30 $ and get the bank currency exchange ratio which is much better than the exchange ratio for paper money the wire transfer cost is partly proportional to the amount and partly constant so do n't split it in many pieces make one larger transfer

i guess the opposite of being hedged is being unhedged typically a hedge is an additional position that you would take on in order to mitigate the potential for losses on another position i 'll give an example say that i purchase 100 shares of stock xyz at $ 10 per share because i believe its price will increase in the future   at that point my full investment of $ 1000 is at risk so the position is not hedged if the price of xyz decreases to $ 8 then i 've lost $ 200   if the price of xyz increases to $ 12 then i 've gained $ 200 the profit loss curve has a linear relationship to the future stock price suppose that i decide to hedge my xyz position by purchasing a put option i purchase a single option contract corresponding to my 100 shares with a strike price of $ 10 and an expiration date in january 2013 for a price of $ this means that until the contract expires i can always sell my xyz shares for a minimum of $ 10   therefore if the price of xyz decreases to $ 8 then i 've only lost $ 50 the price of the option contract compared to the $ 200 that i would have lost if the position was unhedged   likewise however if the price increases to $ 12 then i 've only gained a net total of $ 150 due to the money i spent on the hedge the details of how much money you would actually lose in the hedged scenario are simplified out above even out of the money options retain some value before expiration but pricing of options is outside of the scope of this post so as a more pointed answer to your question i would say that the hedged unhedged status of a position can be characterized by its potential for loss if you do n't have any other assets that will increase in value to offset losses on your position of interest i would call it unhedged

so let 's take a mortgage loan that allows prepayment without penalty say i have a 30 year mortgage and i have paid it for 15 years by the 16th year almost all the interest on the 30 year loan has been paid to the bank this is incorrect thinking   on a 30 year loan at year 15 about 2/3 's of the total interest to be paid has been paid and the principal is about 1/3 lower than the original loan amount   you may want to play with some amortization calculators that are freely available to see this in action    if you were to pay off the balance at that point you would avoid paying the remaining 1/3 of interest    consider a 100 k 30 year mortgage at 4.5 in month two the payment breaks down with $ 132 going to principal and $ going to interest   if in month one you had an extra $ 132 and directed it to principal you would save $ in interest   that is a great roi and why it is wonderful to get out of debt as soon as possible    the trouble with this is of course is that most people can barely afford the mortgage payment when it is new so lets look at the same situation in year 15 here $ would go to principal and $ 235 to interest   so you would have to come up with more money to save less interest   it is still a great roi but less dramatic    if you understand the magic of compounding interest then you can understand loans   it is just compounding interest in reverse   it works against you

that 's great that you have saved up money you are ahead of your peers i would advise against investing in an index fund the attraction of the idea is that you will get the same return as the base item for example an index fund of gold would supposedly give you the same return as if you bought gold in reality this is not true the return of an index fund is always significantly below the return of the underlying commodity your best strategy is to invest in something you know and understand there are two books that can help you learn how to do this one up on wall street by peter lynch and the intelligent investor by benjamin graham buying reading and following the guidance in these two books is your best investment of time and money

what i 've found works best when working on my personal budget is to track my income and spending two different ways bank accounts and budget categories here is what i mean when i deposit my paycheck i do two things with it it goes into my checking account so the balance of my checking account goes up by the amount of my paycheck i also deposit the money from my checking account into my various budget category balances   this is separate from my bank account balances   some of my paycheck money goes into my groceries category some goes into clothing some into car fuel entertainment mortgage phone etc   some goes into longer range bills that only happen once or twice a year such as car insurance life insurance property tax etc   some goes into savings goals of ours such as car replacement vacation furniture etc every dollar that we have in a bank account or in cash in our wallets is also accounted for in a budget category   if you add up the balances of our bank accounts and cash and you add up the balances of our budget categories they add up to the same number when we make a purchase this also gets accounted for twice the appropriate bank account or cash wallet balance gets reduced by the purchase amount the appropriate budget category gets reduced by the purchase amount in this way we do n't really need to worry about having separate bank accounts for different purposes   we do n't need to put our savings goal money in a separate bank account from our grocery money if we do n't want to   the budget category accounting keeps track of how much money is allocated to each purpose    now the budget category amounts are not spent yet the money in them is still in our bank account and we can move money around in the categories if we change our mind on how to allocate them   for example if we do n't spend all of our gas money for the month we can either keep that money in the gas category or we can move it to a different category such as the car replacement category or the vacation category   if the phone bill is more than we expect we can move money around from a different category to cover it now back to your question we allocate some money from each paycheck into our furniture category   but the money is not really spent until we actually buy some furniture   when we do the furniture category balance and bank account balance both go down by the amount of the purchase all of this can be kept track of on the computer in a spreadsheet   however it 's not easy to keep track of so many categories and bank balances   an easier solution is custom budgeting software designed for this purpose   i use and recommend ynab

i got started by reading the following two books you could probably get by with just the first of those two i have n't been a big fan of the for dummies series in the past but i found both of these were quite good particularly for people who have little understanding of investing i also rather like the site canadian couch potato that has a wealth of information on passive investing using mutual funds and etfs it 's a good next step after reading one or the other of the books above in your specific case you are investing for the fairly short term and your tolerance for risk seems to be quite low gold is a high risk investment and in my opinion is ill suited to your investment goals i 'd say you are looking at a money market account very low risk low return such as e.g. the td canadian money market fund you may also want to take a look at e.g. the td canadian bond index which is only slightly higher risk however for someone just starting out and without a whack of knowledge i rather like pointing people at the ing direct funds they offer three options balancing risk vs reward you can fill in their online fund and it 'll point you in the right direction you can pay less by buying individual stock and bond funds through your bank following e.g. one of the canadian couch potato 's model portfolios but ing direct makes things nice and simple and is a good option for people who do n't care to spend a lot of time on this note that i am not a financial adviser and i have only a limited understanding of your needs you may want to consult one though you 'll want to be careful when doing so to avoid just talking to a salesperson also note that i am biased toward passive index investing other people may recommend that you invest in gold or real estate or specific stocks i think that 's a bad idea and believe i have the science to back this up but i may be wrong

you need to track all of your expenses first all of your assets and liabilities and set financial goals for example you need to know your average monthly expenses and exactly what percentages interest each loan charges and you need to know what to save for your children retirement large purchases etc then you create an emergency fund keep between 4 to 6 months worth of your monthly expenses in a savings account that you can readily access base the size of your emergency fund on your expenses rather than your salary this also means its size changes over time for example it must increase once you have children you then pay off your loans starting with the loan charging the highest interest you do this because e.g. paying off $ x of a 7 loan is equivalent to investing $ x and getting a guaranteed 7 return the stock market does generally does not provide guarantees starting with the highest interest first is mathematically the most rewarding strategy in the long run it is not a clear whether you should pay off all loans as fast as possible particularly those with low interest rates and the mortgage you need to read up on the subject in order to make an informed decision this would be too personal advice for us to give after you 've created that emergency fund and paid of all high interest loans you can consider investing in vessels that achieve your set financial goals for example since you are thinking of having children within five years you might wish to save for college education that implies immediately that you should pick an investment vessels that is available after 20 year or so and does not carry too much risk e.g. perhaps bonds or deposits these are a few basic advices and i would recommend to look further on the internet and perhaps read a book on the topic of personal finance

as long as we 're just making up formulas i may as well just throw some numbers at it   the position at the forensic accounting firm would be paying 50 60 k likely starting salary with maybe 5 k bonus if he is super busy and busts his ass   whereas a position in banking would be paying about 75 k base with around 40 60 k in bonus let 's assume this is a boutique or mid level bank   so after year one he makes about $ 60 k more on the banking route after year 1 post graduation whereas he forfeited 10 k in summer salary plus the 5 k loan with interest which is tax deductible   pretty sure that it works out in his favor that way and that 's just after 1 year   yes i understand this simplifies things and assumes that he gets a job in banking solely due to the internship and could n't have gotten it otherwise   however if the internship significantly increases the likelihood p as you put it from .3 to it 's still wildly in his favor to do it given that the wage gap will only grow over time consider his base will be in yr 2 and in yr 3 whereas he 's looking at maybe 10 raises in the forensic accounting     look you can make up formulas all you want all i was saying is that in certain industries it 's absolutely legitimate to have unpaid internships   in this case $ payoff is a fairly high value and p is increased a significant amount

with my experience because i hate generalizations of an entire country   i 'm indian born and raised but came to the us to do my undergrad uni and now work out of the us i had a lot of the same qualms about working with my indian peers but i 've found that it also depends on the support structure that companies offer high turnover is definitely an issue but that seems to be because companies focus more on hiring and less on retention offering signing bonuses but then little to no continued progress limited growth opportunities rigid hierarchy terrible working hours   i have someone who reports to me in india now and it 's an experiment on how to better engage them and it 's worked better turns out you can expect more when you also treat them like an american employee while expecting american results there are definitely still cultural in work ethic etc but they can be overcome if you get people to stick around long enough   of course this is anecdotal but that 's my two cents

in a process called your mortgage is combined with others to form a security that other can invest in when done right this process provides liquidity more money to be lent for more loans when done wrong bad things happen   my mortgage happens to be held by the issuing bank yours was sold into such a pool of mortgages one effect of this is the reselling of the servicing of the loan i 've had other mortgages that were sold every year but i never paid ahead with this bank i 'm on my fifth refinance but the bank keeps the loan in house no matter what i do n't know if there 's any correlation it depends on the originating bank in my opinion

in general scholarship income that you receive that is not used for tuition or books must be included in your gross income and reported as such on your tax return   scholarship income you receive that is used for those kinds of expenses may be from your gross income   see this irs information and this related question i believe that as represented on the 1098-t this generally means that if box 5 scholarships and grants is greater than box 1 or 2 only one of which will be used on your 1098-t you received taxable scholarship income   if box 5 is less than or equal to box 1/2 you did not receive taxable scholarship income   this page draws the same conclusion however you should realize that the 1098-t is not what makes you have to pay or not pay taxes   you incur the taxes by receiving scholarship money and you may reduce your tax liability by paying tuition   the 1098-t is simply a record of payments that have already been made for instance if you received $ 10,000 in scholarship money that is actually received checks for that amount or had that amount deposited into your bank account then your income went up by $ 10,000   if you yourself paid tuition it is likely that you can exclude the amount of the tuition from your taxable income reducing the tax you owe see the irs page linked above   however if you received $ 10,000 in actual money and in addition your tuition was paid by the scholarship with money you never actually had in your own bank account then the entire $ 10,000 would be taxable   you do not give enough information in your question to be sure which of these situations is closer to your own   however you should be able to decide by looking at your bank account look at how much money you received and how much you spent on tuition   if you received more scholarship money than the tuition you paid out of pocket you owe taxes on the remainder   i emphasize that this is just a general rule of thumb and should not be taken as tax advice you should review the irs information and/or consult a tax professional to determine what part of your scholarship income is taxable in addition as this now rather old article from the new york society of cpas notes many colleges and universities prepare incorrectly and report tuition and related expenses   this means you should be careful to reconcile the 1098-t with your own financial records of what money you actually received and paid   when i was in grad school there was a good deal of hand wringing and hair pulling each year among the students as we tried to determine what relationship if any the 1098-t bore to the financial facts

from a purely financial standpoint psychology aside the choice between paying off debt and investing on risky investments boils down to a comparison of risk and reward   yes on average the stock market has risen an average of 10 give or take per year but the yearly returns on the s&p 500 have ranged from a high of in 1995 to a low of in 2008   so there 's a good chance that your investment in index funds will get a better return than the guaranteed return of paying off the loan but it 's not certain and you might end up much worse   you could even calculate a rough probability of coming out better with some reasonable assumptions e.g. if you assume that returns are normally distributed which historically they 're not but your chances are probably around 30 that you 'll end up worse off in one year your odds are better the longer your investment horizon is   if you can tolerate meaning you have both the desire and the ability to take that risk then you might come out ahead    the non financial factors however the psychology of debt the drain on discretionary cash flow etc can not be dismissed as irrational   paying off debt feels good   yes finance disagree with dave ramsey and his approaches but you can not deny the problems that debt causes millions of households both consumer debt and student loan debt as well   if that makes them mindless because they follow a plan that worked for them then so be it disclosure i am a and a fan but do n't agree 100 with him

i think this needs to be stressed a lot more if you ask me   as a society we seem to be falling into this weird paradigm where businesses somehow have a right to a profit and that is basically creating this odd sentiment that somehow businesses with paying a decent wage and offering benefits is ruining business if you ask me all it is doing is ruining the businesses that are n't viable anyway   if the only reason your business turns a profit is because you are gaming the part time full time employment rules for cost cutting purposes guess what your business deserves to fucking die i think far too many business men feel entitled to profit and ca n't see that maybe it is n't how high their costs are but how fucking little people want what they are selling

do you guys think it 's a good idea to put that much down on the car in my opinion it depends on a lot of factors   if you have nothing to pay and are not planning to invest in something that cost a lot soon i.e an house etc then i see no problem in put that much down on the car remember that the more you pay at first the less you will pay interest on however if you are planning on buying something big soon then you might want to pay less and keep moneys for your future investment i would honestly not finance a car with the garage as i find their interest rate to high possibilities depends a lot of your bank accounts but what i would personally do is pay it cash using my credit margin with the bank which is only 2.8 interest rate garage where i live rarely finance under 7 interest rate you may not have a credit margin but maybe you could get a loan with the bank instead many bank keep an history of your loan which will get you a better credit name when trying to buy an home later on the other side having a good credit name is not really useful in a garage what interest rate is reasonable based on my credit score i do n't think it is possible to give a real answer to this as it change a lot around the world however i would recommend to simply compare with the interest rate asked when being loan by the bank

be careful that pride is not getting in the way of making a good decision   as it stands now what difference does it make to have 200 k worth of debt and a 200 k house or 225 k of debt and a 250 k house   sure you would have a 25 k higher net worth but is that really important   some may even argue that such an increase is not real as equity in primary residence might not be a good indication of wealth while there is nothing wrong with sitting down with a banker most are likely to see your scheme as dubious   home improvements rarely have a 100 roi and almost never have a 200 roi i 'd say you 'd be pretty lucky to get a 65 roi that is not to say they will deny you   the banks are in the business of lending money and have the goal of taking as much of your hard earned paycheck as possible   they are always looking to sheer the sheep why not take a more systematic approach to improving your home   save up and pay cash as these do n't seem to cause significant discomfort   with that size budget and some elbow grease you can probably get these all done in three years so in three years you 'll have about k in debt and a home worth 250 k or more

credit card fees on a credit card used for personal expenses are not tax deductible credit card fees on a business credit card are deductible on schedule c or whatever form you 're using to report business income and expenses if you are using the same card for both business and personal well for starters this is a very bad idea because it creates exactly the question you 're asking if that 's what you 're doing stop and get separate business and personal cards if you have separate business and personal cards and use the business card only for legitimate business expenses then the answer is easy you can claim a schedule c deduction for any service charges on the business card and you can not claim any deduction for any charges on the personal card in general though if you have an expense that is partly business and partly personal you are supposed to figure out what percentage is business and that is deductible in an admittedly brief search i could n't find anything specifically about credit cards but i did find this similar idea on the irs web site generally you can not deduct personal living or family expenses however if you have an expense for something that is used partly for business and partly for personal purposes divide the total cost between the business and personal parts you can deduct the business part for example if you borrow money and use 70 of it for business and the other 30 for a family vacation you can deduct 70 of the interest as a business expense the remaining 30 is personal interest and is not deductible refer to chapter 4 of publication 535 business expenses for information on deducting interest and the allocation rules so probably you could add up all the charges you made on the card figure out how much was for business and how much for personal calculate the business percentage and then deduct this percentage of the service fees if the amount involved is not trivial you might want to talk to an accountant or a lawyer

employers are not supposed to give cash gifts to their employees even if you try to call it a gift for tax purposes presumably the reason your wife 's employer gave her cash was to be nice and save her taxes on that amount her employer already paid tax on that money so that your wife does n't have to if she plans to declare it anyway then she should instead give it back and ask for it to be added to the w2 as an end of year bonus this way her employer could then deduct the payment and pay her a larger amount of money the additional amount would be approximately their tax rate minus about for fica in fact if your wife 's tax rate is more than 15 lower than her employer 's then this is actually mathematically best for both parties

the severity of wealth more so than its is what i 'm getting at when i talk about the fed the effect is a theory that essentially states that the first recipients of stimulus are far better off than those 2 or 3 degrees of separation later   so if you look at fed policies where monetary stimulus is directed only towards the financial system and credit markets certain parties will benefit disproportionately first before others later in this case that would be those employed by the industry bankers investors etc institutions in that industry banks hedge funds pension mutual funds and owners of securities the wealthy spillover effects impact the stock market real estate art etc and they are not a result of fundamentals but rather of mis allocated capital   what i 'm getting at is we do n't need central planners i.e. the fed to make decisions regarding the market for money interest rates or pursue dubious financial experiments at best to somehow fix problems that they themselves caused in the past through extended low interest rate environments central banking could take a very serious hit if cryptocurrencies become which i do not expect for a long but it 's the best emergent to the existing paradigm

there have been studies which show that dollar cost averaging dca underperforms lump sum investing vanguard in particular has published one such study of course reading about advice in a study is one thing acting on that advice can be something else entirely we rolled over my wife 's 401(k to an ira back in early 2007 and just did it as a lump sum you know what happened after that but our horizon was 25 + years at that time so we did n't lose too much sleep over it we have n't sold or gone to cash either

if you 're in the us then no   you can not enter a binding contract therefore you will not get a loan from a bank cosigner or no cosigner anything to do with a loan and a bank will not involve you   your parents can get a loan then they can give you the money then you can pay them for their payments but none of that means the loan has anything to do with you   it 's their loan if they default it 's on them given your age you probably will ignore everyone else 's advice here about this trip being a bad idea if you ca n't afford it but you should reconsider it   you will be paying for this trip long after the fun and excitement has worn off   this is the cycle that sends alot of families into bankruptcy and it 's a horrible habit to learn so young   loan should n't even be in your vocabulary dealing with anything other than a library book

here 's your problem the debt is valid and it is your debt regardless of your arrangement with the insurance company the insurance company possibly owes you money and you owe the doctor money you are stuck in the middle and in the end it does n't matter whether the insurance company pays as to whether you owe the money do n't ignore them also disputing the debt it pointless because the truth is that you do owe the debt the insurance company may owe you money which is in dispute but the debt to your medical provider is your own you are just stuck in the middle it sucks but is pretty common i think the best you can do is keep working on the insurance company and responding to the bill collectors letting them know that you are working on it and will need to pay late in theory they deal with this a lot and probably understand not that it will make them lay off you in the meantime   in the end it is possible you might have to sue the insurance company to get the money one thing to be careful about if the debt is fairly old several years you may want to avoid making partial payments because if this goes on your credit report that payment may extend the period where the negative information can appear on your credit history

chris rea 's comment captures it most people do n't have working crystal balls unless you are a trader you address risk with diversification there are several questions on this site discussing strategies to diversify your portfolio in many ways the markets offer investors false choices we have an emotional desire to react to but that often leads to lousy outcomes for example selling your nasdaq 100 fund after its value falls is usually a bad idea

i think in such situations a good rule of thumb may be if you are asked to pay significant sums of money upfront before anything is done stop and ask yourself what would you do if they do n't do what they promised they know who you are but usually most you know is a company name and phone number both can disappear in a minute and what are you left with   if they said they 'd pay off the debt and issue the new loan fine let them do it and then you pay them if they insist on having money upfront without delivering anything unless it 's a very big and known and established company you probably better off not doing it either it 's a scam or in the minuscule chance they are legit you still risking too much you 're giving money and not getting anything in return

back in the olden days if you wanted to buy the s&p you had to have a lot of money so you can buy the shares then somebody had the bright idea of making a fund that just buys the s&p and then sells small pieces of it to investor without huge mountains of capital enter the etfs the guy running the etf of course does n't do it for free he a little bit of money off the top this is the fee the major s&p etfs all have tiny fees in the percents of a percent if you 're buying the index you 're probably looking at gains or losses to the tune of 5 10 20 unless you 're doing something really silly you would n't even notice the fee as often happens when one guy starts doing something and making money there will immediately be so now we have competing etfs all providing the same service you are technically a competitor as well since you could compete with all these funds by just buying a basket of shares yourself thereby running your own private fund for yourself the reason this stuff even started was that people said well why bother with mutual funds when they charge such huge fees and still do n't beat the index anyway so the index etfs are supposed to be a low cost alternative to mutual funds thus one thing etfs compete on is fees you can see how voo has lower fees than spy and ivv in keeping with vanguard 's philosophy of minimal management and management fees incidentally if you buy the shares directly you would n't charge yourself fees but you would have to pay commissions on each stock and it would destroy you another benefit of the etfs moreover these etfs claim they track the index but of course there is no real way to peg an asset to another so they ensure tracking by keeping a carefully curated portfolio of course nobody is perfect and there 's tracking error you can in theory compare the etfs in this respect and buy the one with the least tracking error however they all basically track very closely again the error is fractions of the percent if it is a legitimate concern in your books then you 're not doing index investing right the actual prices of each fund may vary but the price hardly matters the key metric is does it go up 20 when the index goes up 20 and they all do so what do you compare them on well typically companies offer people perks to attract them to their own product if you are a fidelity customer and you buy ivv they will waive your commission if you hold it for a month i believe vanguard will also sell voo for free but for instance fidelity will take commission from voo trades and vice versa so this would be your main factor though then again you can just make an account on robinhood and they 're all commission free a second factor is reliability of the operator frankly i doubt any of these operators are at all untrustworthy and you 'd be buying your own broker 's etf anyway and presumably you already went with the most trustworthy broker besides that like i said there 's trivial matters like fees and tracking error but you might as well just flip a coin it does n't really matter

probably a big fat no update re this edit note i 'm not suggesting that i melt the coins i 'm just suggesting that i hold onto the nickels and sell them later when they are worth more than 5 cents for example you can sell coins with silver in them for far above their face value this is silly as an investment   right up there with stockpiling cars    the increase in value will likely never be enough to make the cost hassle of storage worth it   as mrchrister states it is a fine idea as a collection but not as a stockpile edit from the comments i am surprised i did not onto this in the previous update   silver is considered a previous metal nickel and copper are not   btw the u.s. nickel is 25 nickel and 75 copper also how in the world do you plan on actually selling a stockpile of nickels

stock prices are set by the market supply and demand see apple for example which is exactly the company you described tons of earnings zero dividends the stock price goes up and down depending on what happens with the company and how investors feel about it and it can happen that the total value of the outstanding stock shares will be less than the value of the underlying assets of the company including the cash resulted from the retained earnings it can happen also that if the investors feel that the stock is not going to appreciate significantly they will vote to distribute dividends its not the company 's decision its the board 's the board is appointed by the shareholders which is exactly why the voting rights are important

for starters that site shows the first 5 levels on each side of the book which is actually quite a bit of information   when traders say the top of the book they mean just the first level   so you 're already getting 8 extra levels if you want all the details you must subscribe to the exchange 's data feeds this costs thousands of dollars per month or open an account with a broker who offers that information more important than depth however is update frequency   the bats site appears to update every 5 seconds which is nowhere near frequently enough to see what 's truly going on in the book   depending on your use case 2 levels on each side of the book updated every millisecond might be far more valuable than 20 levels on each side updated every second

i do n’t know specifics of the situation but one possibility would be that buffett may have billions in various assets etc companies he owns stocks bonds but if he does n’t sell any of those stocks or cash in any of those bonds then on paper he did n’t make any money that year because he ’s letting the assets appreciate i would say net income is the amount of income you claimed that year so if you had sold some stock the amount of money you sold them for would be your income as opposed to net worth being if they wanted to if buffett sold all of his stocks and assets he would be able to get billions for it so while he technically is worth billions on his tax returns he does n’t claim much income

similar but actually quite different   a negative income tax on the first $ has a couple of problems this scheme does n't   1 administration costs and legal complexity   are we or the stipend   how is someone supposed to get along if they lose their job unexpectedly in a rebate based system can they get their income tax withholdings back up to $   how does the government register changes in income to know when to write someone a check   2 with a negative tax up to a certain fixed level there 's effectively a changing level of subsidy depending how much of the per capita income is the break even tax level   if the per capita income is $ our current gdp per capita then the subsidy level is almost 50 and if it goes up to $ our current mean household income the subsidy level is then 33   the system i described and iirc invented fixes the subsidy percentage in relation to the mean reported income effectively fixing a relative class level as minimum rather than a particular monetary amount whose relative buying power versus inflation or other incomes can fluctuate wildly   we pick a subsidy level say 1/3   we then impose a flat income tax of that level plus a little bit more for administration costs say 35   at the end of the year everyone is taxed at that flat level and the government its administration costs off the top and now has a big pot with 1/3 of everyone 's income in it   this is divided into one portion for each taxpayer and those portions into monthly or biweekly pieces   these pieces are sent out regularly as checks to the taxpayer and these checks are not taxed as   that last bit is what makes this so nice it turns the tax progressive in fact more progressive than our current system   after taxes and after stipend only the rich will pay an effective tax rate close to the real 35   most people without incomes many many times the size of their will be looking at an effective tax rate of less than 15 including the tax paying middle class and the professional upper middle class who currently bitch so much about our tax rates being so which they are for the abysmal level of social services we receive   now to get back to the big benefits of fixing the subsidy percentage   this means that the subsidy grows with mean income effectively functioning as easy to run fair and direct wealth redistribution without the difficulty of trying to create efficient productive style jobs or imposing market distorting subsidies   it also means that we can allow things like automation to improve the productivity of our economy because everyone gets a share if automating a certain job is truly more efficient than having a worker do it the capitalist 's income gain from automation will push up the mean income and therefore the basic income further than the worker 's lesser income and the capitalist 's lesser profit would have

doing your homework means to perform what 's more accurately called fundamental analysis according to proponents of fundamental analysis fa it is possible to accurately determine how much a stock should trade for and then buy or sell the stock based on whether it trades above or below this target price this target price is based on the discounted anticipated future earnings of your stock so doing your homework means that you figure out how much future earnings you can expect from the stock and then figuring out at what rate you want to discount those future earnings are 1000 dollars that you 'll earn next year worth $ 800 today or $ 900 or only $ 500 that depends on the overall economic and political climate so does this make any sense depends i 'm aware that there are a lot of anecdotes of people researching a stock buying that stock and doing well with that stock but poor decisions can at times lead to good outcomes edit due to some criticism i want to expand on a few points so is homework completely for naught no

i am not 100 sure but i think the answer is this   you ca n't max out both   you could theoretically max out the simple ira $ 11,500 and then contribute $ 4,000 to your 401k but your total ca n't exceed the 401k limit of $ 16,500   this also means you could max out your 401k at $ 16,500 but you could n't contribute anything to the simple ira   note that no matter what you ca n't contribute more than $ 11,500 to your simple ira note that this is all independent from your traditional or roth ira which are subject to their own limits and not affected by your participation in employer sponsored plans as i understand it a 401k and a simple ira both fall under the umbrella of employer sponsored plans   just like you ca n't max out two 401k 's at two different employers you ca n't do it with the 401k and the simple ira   the only weird thing is the contribution limit differences between simple ira and 401k but i do n't think the irs could would penalize you for working two jobs enforcing the lower simple ira limit for all employer sponsored retirement accounts you should probably run the numbers factoring in the employer match and figure out which account contribution scenario makes the most financial sense for you   however i 'm not sure how the employer match helps you when you 're talking about a small business that you own run   you may also want to look at how the employer match of the simple ira affects the taxes your business pays disclaimer 1   i could n't find a definitive answer on your specific scenario at irs.gov   i the above info from a few different simple ira info sites   that 's why i 'm not 100 sure   it seems intuitively correct to me though   does your small business have an accountant   maybe you should talk to him her disclaimer 2   the $ amounts listed above are based on the irs 2010 limits

so you 've already considered relocation here are a few additional things to consider with respect to negotiating a signing bonus if any would you be leaving a position where you are eligible for an upcoming bonus profit share or other special incentive payout such as a stock option or rsu vesting date   a signing bonus can help offset the opportunity cost of leaving a previous job when an incentive payout date is near at the new company would you be required to wait some pre defined period to be eligible to participate in the pension or retirement savings plan with employer basic or matching contributions if you were receiving ongoing employer contributions in your previous company 's plan and would need to wait say six months before participating in the new company 's plan a signing bonus can offset lost employer contributions in the interim consider funding your own ira in that time would you be required to give up something else of value to you that your previous employer was providing such as an expensive laptop that is not expected to otherwise be replaced by the new company whether they offer a signing bonus and how much you can expect to negotiate is based on a lot of factors and you 'll need to play it by ear   remember what bonus means a payment or gift added to what is usual or expected in particular remember also that a signing bonus is a one time thing   in general it 's more important to consider the overall ongoing compensation package salary and incentive plans vacation retirement benefits health benefits etc and whether those meet your long term needs

littleadv 's first comment check the note is really the answer but your issue is   every mortgage i 've had over 10 in my lifetime allows early principal payments the extra principal can only be applied at the same time as the regular payment think of it this way only at that moment is there no interest owed if a week later you try to pay toward only principal the system will not handle it pretty simple extra principal with the payment due in fact any mortgage i 've had that offered a monthly bill or coupon book will have that very line extra principal by coincidence i just did this for a mortgage on my rental i make these payments through my bank 's billpay service i noted the extra principal in the notes section of the virtual check but again the note will explicitly state if there 's an issue with prepayments of principal the larger issue is that your friend wishes to treat the mortgage like a bi weekly the bank expects the full amount as a payment and likely has no obligation to accept anything less than the full amount given my first comment above here is the plan for your friend to do 99 of what she wishes tell her there 's nothing magic about bi weekly it 's a budget clever way to send the money but over a year it 's simply paying 108 of the normal payment if she wants to burn the mortgage faster tell her to add what she wishes every month even $ 10 it all adds up   final note there are two schools of thought to either extreme a pay the mortgage off as fast as you can no debt is the goal and b the mortgage is the lowest rate you 'll ever have on borrowed money pay it as slow as you can and invest any extra money i accept and respect both views for your friend and first group i 'm compelled to add be sure to deposit to your retirement account 's matched funds to gain the entire match $ 1 can pay toward your 6 mortgage or be doubled on deposit to $ 2 in your 401(k if available and pay off all high interest debt first this should stand to reason but i 've seen people keep their 18 card debt while prepaying their mortgage

is your credit history ruined or merely dinged is the blow    recoverable any bad credit rating event is recoverable given enough time money to solve the problem   as far as ruined vs dinged well that 's a matter of opinion some people think that one bad item is the end of the world others not so much   you will have an unpaid debt listed on your report   this will drop your score   the amount it impacts the score will depend on other factors in your report can the carrier try to get the money back in court i assume you 'll    wind up dealing with a debt collector   yes they could go to court but that 's unlikely at least in the short term   far more likely is that the debt ends up sold to a debt collection agency for pennies on the dollar   the debt collection agency will harass you until you pay and they might file in court if they think the debt is more than enough to cover the court costs will this affect any other relationships you have possibly   a bad rating may make it more difficult to get credit in the future   however that depends on numerous other factors such as your entire history   it could even prevent you from being hired from certain jobs not many of them but some    is it criminal read this   the us does not have a debtors prison   however if the company decides to file a court case and you fail to appear or fail to abide by the court ruling then in some states you could be committing a crime and may be thrown in jail   at which point you are on the hook not just for the original fee but potentially a plethora of other costs   never mind the loss of reputation when your friends family and coworkers find out that you are sitting in jail at the end of the day just pay the debt   if you agreed to the plan and the plan has an early cancellation fee then the moral and ethical thing to do is pay it   trying to see how bad it would be to ignore it is n't the right way to live

no that return on equity number is a target that the regulators consider when approving price hikes if pg&e tried to get a 20 roe the regulator would deny the request utilities are basically compelled to accept price regulation in return for a   monopoly on utility business in a geographic area there are obviously no guarantees that a utility will make money but these good utilities are good stable investments that generally speaking will not make you rich but appreciate nicely over time due to deregulation however they are a more complex investment than they once were basically the utility builds and maintains a bunch of physical infrastructure buys fuel and turns it into electricity so they have fixed costs regulated pricing market driven costs for fuel and market driven demand for electricity   also consider that the marginal cost of adding capacity to the electric grid is incredibly high so uneven demand growth or economic disruption in the utility service area can hurt the firms return on equity and thus the stock price compare the stock performance of he the hawaiian electric to ed consolidated edison the nyc utility to so southern companies the utility for much of the south you can see that the severe impact of the recession on he really damaged the stock location matters buying strategy is key as well during bad market conditions money flows into these stocks which are considered to be low risk defensive investments and inflates the price you do n't want to buy utilities at a peak you need to dollar cost average a position over a period of years and hold it focus on the high quality utilities or quality local utilities if you understand your local market look at southern co progress energy duke energy or american electric power as high quality benchmarks to compare with other utilities

ownership of the debt is irrelevant if puerto rico tells the investors to kick rocks which it already has    puerto rico created the debt by accepting the loans it could n't pay and under terms that caused full repayment in the event of one default which spoiler alert happens when you accrue $ in debt with $ in unsecured pension liabilities created by bloated government pensions    they also gave the middle finger to the investors whose money they happily took when things were good only to flush it down the toilet and cry foul after they ran out of free money the teacher 's union and police officers unions opted out of ss so that they could reap these pension benefits    the reality is that puerto rico buried itself in social programs that never really got an economy that never had much going on to experience any growth it does n't matter who owns the debt this guy from the article sees a potential payday if the us in and saves them from their crisis

this is why we tell people not to co sign unless they are able and willing to risk that money becoming a gift or are able and willing to treat it as business rather than family unfortunately that advice is a bit late now to help you when you cosigned you promised the bank that you would make any payments he did n't the bank does n't care why he did n't they just want their money on time getting him to repay you for covering this is strictly between the two of you and unless you signed paperwork at the time establishing a contract other than the promise to cover his loan this becomes extremely messy first step is to make the payments so the loan does n't continue acquiring fees and hurting your credit rating and keep it from falling behind again then you have to convince him to repay the money you have effectively given him depending on your relationship and financial situations you may decide to carry him for a while and trust that he 'll pay you back when he can or sic a lawyer on him you need to make that decision recognizing that it may be a matter of how much family drama you are willing to tolerate

when i was younger i had a problem with washington mutual   someone had deposited a check in to my account then ran my account negative with a dupe of my debit card   tied up my account for three months while they investigated because it was n't simply a debit card fraud issue this was check fraud so they claimed   at the time all the money i had in the world was in that account and the ordeal was extremely disruptive to my life   since the i never spend on my debit card(s and i keep more than one checking account to disperse the risk and avoid disruption in the event anything ever happens again now one of the accounts contains just enough money plus a small buffer to pay my general monthly expenses and the other is my actual checking account    there 's no harm in having more than one checking account and if you think it will enhance your finances do it though there 's no reason to get a business account unless you 've actually formed a business

if ordinary income tax rates and contribution rates to tax advantaged retirement accounts are held constant it 's net negative to the extent that the average retirement account return exceeds the risk free rate rather than pushing money into roth accounts the government could leave traditional 401(k)s unchanged borrow the difference in up front tax revenue that it 's foregoing by doing so and repay that debt as the tax revenue from traditional 401(k disbursements comes in net of interest on the additional debt the latter strategy would increase the government 's total tax revenue by an amount proportional to the average excess return of the affected retirement accounts with essentially no downside other than messaging relative to the strategy that 's being proposed   of course in reality it 's likely that retirement savings rates would decline as a result of the change so that would partially offset the overall reduction in tax revenue however the downsides of reduced retirement savings rates arguably far outweigh that benefit that 's why tax advantaged retirement accounts exist in the first place

an alternative to a savings account is a money market account   not a bank money market account which pays effectively the same silly rate as a savings account but an actual money market investment account   you can even write checks against some money market investment accounts i have several accounts worth about 13,000 each   originally my emergency fund was in a cd ladder   i started experimenting with two different money market investment accounts recently   here 's my latest results august returns on various accounts worth about $ 13k   discover bank cd   $   discover bank cd   $   discover bank cd   $   discover savings   $   credit union money market savings account   $   fidelity money market account   $   vanguard money market account   $ the actual account values are approximate   the fidelity money market account holds the least value and the credit union account by far the most the result of the experiment is that as the cds mature i 'll be moving out of discover bank into the vanguard money market account you can put your money into more traditional equities mutual fund   the danger with them is the stock market may drop big the day before you want to make your withdrawl and then you do n't have the down payment for your house anymore   but a well chosen mutual fund will yield better there are 3 ways a mutual fund increase in value here 's how three of my mutual funds did in the past month   adjusted as if the accounts had started off to be worth about $ 13,000 those must vary wildly month to month by the way if you look up the ticker symbols is a vanguard fund of funds it invests not 100 in the stock market but 80 in the stock market and 20 in bonds   is a 60/40 split   interesting that grew less than but that assumes my spreadsheet is correct   most of my mutual funds pay dividends and capital gains once or twice a year   i do n't think any pay in august

i do n't know any clever way to do what you 're describing   and in a sense you can see why there might not be one   a mortgage is n't just a magical way to reduce your housing expenses it 's a tradeoff in which you agree to a long term commitment in exchange for fixed costs or at least costs with a structure over that long term   if you 're unwilling to accept the obligation of paying for and maintaining the property over a long period you ca n't really expect to reap the benefits of lowered costs   part of the reason people say buying is better is because people often do live in the same place for a long time in which case if they rent they might miss out on savings they could have had if they bought instead   if you 're not going to live in the same place for a long time buying may not actually be better for you

i would say that the three most important skills are note that some costs are hidden so for example a mutual fund investing in other countries than where you live in may mean the investment target country charges a certain percentage of dividends going to the mutual fund the mutual fund company does n't usually want to tell you this there may be clever financial instruments derivatives that can be used to avoid this but they are not without their problems if you diversify into equities at low cost you will have a very wealthy future i would recommend you to compare two options and pick from these options the cheaper one if your time has a high value and you wish to take this value into account i would say it is almost always far better option to choose an index fund whatever you do do n't pay for active management it is a mathematical truth that before costs actively managed investments will yield the same return than indexed investments however the costs are higher in active management so you will have less total return do n't believe that good historical return would imply good future return however if for some reason you see an index fund that continuously loses to the index more than by the amount of stated costs beware

your decision about which of these investments to make is going to depend on how long you expect to leave the money in the account for example based on the figures you give us if you think you are going to want to withdraw the money in three months or less then you should chose the savings account   for ten months or more you should choose the fixed deposit as michael says flexible to withdraw at any time does not mean you wo n't pay penalties for withdrawing early that 's why you should n't choose the longer term deposits if you want to withdraw earlier that 's the simplest approach the trouble of course is that you do n't necessarily know how long you are going to leave the money in if you are saving for a house and you know you wo n't want to buy in the next year the 12 month deposit looks good but what if your car suddenly needs repairs you would have to withdraw that money early and pay the penalties and it turns out you would have been better of putting it in the savings account a good approach is

if it were my money i would n't put it in a 401(k for this purpose if you were working at a company that provided 401(k matching then it might be worth it to put the money in your employer 's 401(k because the employer chips in based on what you put in but you 're self employed so there 's no matching unless you match it yourself   correct so given that there 's no matching a 401(k arrangement would have more restrictions than a non tax advantaged account like a bank account or a taxable money market account   this would be taxable in the year you earn the money but then that 's it if you 're expecting to pull out the money pre retirement i would n't put it in in the first place

this answer applies only to corporation tax not income tax   different things income tax is much higher   12.5 is the low rate for corporation tax   the standard rate is 25   or if you 're apple 0    like many countries ireland will only consider you eligible for the low rate of corporation tax if you your irish company can demonstrably prove yourself resident in ireland   this is more than just address and you must be able to evidence that your staff work there your directors are both european economic area citizens and have their board meetings in ireland and most importantly that they run the company from ireland etc   if you 're a one man corporation unless you want to live in ireland it 's not going to work    referring to the irish government 's website   the term residence was not until recently defined in law the    general rule was that companies whose central management and    control was exercised in the state were treated as resident here    this rule or test emerged as a result of judicial decisions set down    in case law factors to be taken into account in establishing where    the company 's central management and control lie include for example    where the important questions of company policy are determined where    the majority of directors reside where the negotiation of major    contracts is undertaken and where the company 's head office is    located long story short   an irish incorporated company is not treated as irish resident for tax    purposes if it is a relevant company a relevant company is a    company that is ultimately controlled by persons resident in the    eu or in a country with which ireland has concluded a double taxation    treaty

gt;are these people making min wage dying en mass no then they are supported i do n't want to sound crude but there really is n't a profession on earth where you do n't have to rough it out for a few years life 's tough    beat the kid   it builds character   my parents did it to me   look how well i turned out   an over exaggeration but at a basic level it is the same idea as what you put above   a certain level of stress creates growth mentally and physically   too much stress actually counters growth   small periods of high stress are great for teaching coping   long periods perhaps to wear the person   but when we recklessly let them be applied rather than trying to guide it to something constructive we are being irresponsible   gt;the abundance of min wage jobs you speak of are either not as abundant as you think relative to the demand or the minimum wage is already too high relative to the demand    now this is a pure capitalism argument and fails to hold water for the same reasons capitalism is having issues today     the market is not solely determined by supply and demand   distance from resources ability to control resources everyone needs ability to control resources or market for your competition environmental disasters etc   all these control the market   new graduates have little to no power over the market so companies can easily control how much or little new graduates can make without fear of losing demand   there will always be new graduates who are gullible enough to take their jobs    and   capitalism favors those with more capital   this ties in with the first part   when you have the resource you can choose which source of any item you need   when you have few resources you may be stuck getting your needs fulfilled by whatever the nearest or most available market is   your time another resource is more free if you have capital and more tied up in other peoples businesses if you have less capital   if you have to work two full time jobs to feed yourself and your dependents your time resources is already invested and it is much more difficult to invest some of that resource in yourself to improve your position   you may be able to your financial resources to build a buffer so you can improve yourself   you may not be able to   i think that part is where we disagree   the rest i agree with you in more than just part   i 'm enjoying this exploration in ideology   thank you :d

you know those perks benefits that you do n't want to give up those are funded by the fees you are trying to eliminate by paying cash the credit card company makes money by interest merchant fees and other fees such a annual fees they give you perks to generate more transactions thus bringing in more merchant fees for a small business they need to balance the fee of the credit card transaction with the knowledge that it is convenient for many customers some small businesses will set a minimum card transaction level they do this because the small transaction on a credit card will be more expensive because the credit card company will charge 2 or 50 cents whichever is larger    yes a business does figure the cost of the cards into their prices but they can get ahead a little bit if some customers voluntarily forgo using the credit card

imagine that your normal mode of using credit gets you a score of x. as time goes by your score trends upward if the positive items length of credit outweigh your negative items but there are no big increases or decrease in your score then you make a one time change to how you use credit if this is a event that helps your score there will be a increase in your score if it is bad thing your score will drop but if you go back to your standard method of operating your score will drift back to the previous range getting a car loan for a few months to get a bump in your credit score will not sustain your score at the new level indefinitely overtime the impact will lessen and the score will return your your normal range spending money on the loan just to buy a temporary higher credit score is throwing away money

i like precious metals and real estate for the op 's stated timeframe and the effects qe is having on precious metals physical silver is not a recommended short term play if you believe that silver prices will fall as qe is reduced you may want to consider an etf that shorts silver   as for real estate there are a number of ways to generate profit within your time frame these include purchase a rental property if you can find something in the $ 120,000 range you can take a 20 mortgage then refinance in 3 7 years and pull out the equity   if you truly do not need the cash to purchase your dream home look for a rental property that pays all the bills plus a little bit for you and arrange a mortgage of 80 let your money earn money when you are ready you can either keep the property as is and let it generate income for you or sell and put more than $ 100,000 into your dream home visit your local mortgage broker and ask if he does third party or private lending ask about the process and if you feel comfortable with him let him know you 'd like to be a lender he will then find deals and present them to you you decide if you want to participate or not private lenders are sometimes used for bridge financing and the loan can be short 6 months 5 years and the rates can be significantly higher than regular bank mortgages the caveat is that as a second position mortgage if the borrower goes bankrupt you 're not likely to get your principal back

businesses are free to decide what payment methods they accept for their goods and services businesses sometimes advertise what credit cards they accept by posting some stickers at their door when your credit card is n't among them and you do n't have enough cash with you ask about your card before you order if a business does n't accept your credit card your best recourse is to take your business elsewhere when you already ate there and got into an awkward situation because you assumed that they would accept your card you might also want to write an online review of the place and warn others to bring cash for their visit but please be fair in the review when the food and service are decent a restaurant does n't deserve a one star rating just because they do n't take credit cards note that businesses have good reasons to not accept credit cards it often means additional cost for them in form of but there is also a more shady reason taking payment in cash means that there is no electronic trail of the transaction that makes it far easier for an establishment to their income they might under report it to evade taxes or over report it to launder money both are illegal of course

they are similar in the sense that they are transferring money from the company to shareholders but that 's about it there is different tax treatment yes but that 's because they are fundamentally different dividends transfer money equally to all shareholders but that also reduces the value of each share by the same amount since it 's cash out the door which drops the value of the company shareholders are taxed on dividends at the capital gains tax rate a buyback returns the cash to shareholders who decide to sell   other shareholders get a secondary benefit of now owning a slightly larger portion of the company since there are fewer shares outstanding   shareholders only pay tax if they sell shares for a gain it that means when company buyback their stock the stock price will definitely go up not necessarily it depends on the price that the company buys back the shares for and what the opportunity cost of that cash is meaning what else could the company have done with the cash that would have been better buybacks often happen in mature companies with undervalued stock prices and fewer opportunities for further investment   if a company has an intrinsic value of $ 10 a share but its stock is trading at $ 8 a share then it can instantly get a 25 return by buying back stock   i use the term return loosely since the company does not actually profit from the buyback but from the shareholder 's perspective the company is worth more per share

this was an interesting little article thanks for sharing it   however i 'm a bit by part of the analysis     the authors give some fairly substantial hints that the value they are providing is not the standard deviation but most of the respondents miss these hints   the answers for the annualized rate also suggest that many of the respondents knew how to compute this given the standard deviation   the authors then go on to say that basically all of the respondents gave the correct mathematical definition of the standard deviation   then they go on to say that   gt whatever reason there was for their error it did not result from ignorance of the concept   but this strikes me as both disingenuous and incorrect   on the contrary the most likely explanation would seem to be that most of them were not aware of the concept of mean absolute deviation probably because they had either never learned it or never had occasion to apply it   i agree that people even highly trained people tend to be very bad at probability just look up the hall problem for a primer on that   but i strongly disagree with the notion that this paper provides any evidence of this tendency as there seems to be a much stronger case for ignorance   this alternative is further supported by the authors assertion that   gt with respondents revealed that they rarely had an immediate understanding of the error when it was pointed out to them   again suggesting ignorance as the most not least likely culprit   i also found it odd that they asked the respondents specifically about the standard deviation definition but not about the mean absolute deviation despite the fact that the latter is almost certainly more obscure   to that last bit i just went through the textbooks i have on hand and this concept is not mentioned in either of the undergraduate statistics probability textbooks i own nor in the one undergraduate finance textbook i have   i 'm in machine learning and not finance but it is mentioned in just one of the four graduate level texts i have on applied statistics and probability once on one page in a textbook on bayesian statistics   and the wikipedia page is terrible   in short while this is an interesting little experiment and write up i think the analysis and conclusions are inappropriate and not supported by the evidence the authors provide   that does n't mean that their conclusions are incorrect just that i disagree with the notion that this paper them   this response ended up being way long

agriculture is down to single digits as part of the gdp what does that have to do with a gold standard and monetary policy   i was being sarcastic    gt;but as soon as the usa left the gold exchange standard total factor productivity began to dramatically stagnate   correlation does n't equal causation remember that this is also the same time that european japanese and soviet economies were picking back up after ww2 global production picked up and there was more international competition    gt;because our massive debt is doing so well for us in the beginning it looks nice because there is very little pain and is practically but as we see current events playing out in the us and to a greater extent europe which is nt as tightly economically as the us fiat currency has huge problems   the eu can not print money in the same way the usa can if anything the euro is a cautionary tale about currency 's with too stringent printing limitations along with tying together a set of countries at vastly different levels of economic development    the usa is not anywhere near the point of no return and seeing as we can finance our debt at ridiculously low rates compared to the rest of the world it would be much simpler to do that than try and restructure the entire monetary system of the usa   over what the last 40 years we are at about 80 90 years now    hardly enough time to call practical fact when the gold standard existed for hundreds and thousands of years   the gold standard has not been in use for hundreds of thousands of years nor was it the only currency previous to fiat   gt;i am not sure why you think that the usa is in such a great position the american dream is if you 're just starting out in life just ask any number of recent college grads who are increasingly living with parents not getting married and ca n't find jobs   i do n't think asking my local college grad is a good way of determining the usa 's macro economic situation you 're absolutely right that there is a major major disparity of wealth problem but the gold standard is n't the reason for that unemployment insurance and welfare are also comically small portions of the budget if you wanna talk about cutting spending defense and medicare are where it 's at and you do n't even have to hurt old people or soldiers to fix them

the exchange rate between two currencies is simply the price that the most recent market participants were able to agree on when trading ie if the is 1.36 it 's because the last trade that happened where someone bought 1 usd cost 1.36 cad there is no one person organization which decides the rate between two currencies the rate moves you see is just the reality of money changing hands as people in various situations trade currencies for various reasons just like with stocks or any other market product foreign exchange rates can fluctuate wildly based on many things it is very difficult to forecast where rates will go because the biggest changes in rates can often be unpredictable news events for example when brexit happened the value of the gbp plummeted relative to other currencies because the market traders had less faith in the uk economy and therefore were n't willing to pay as much to buy gbp see more here there is a very high level of risk in the foreign exchange market for your sake do n't get involved in any trading that you do not well understand first

firstly i 'm going to do what you said and analyze your question taking your entire family 's finances into account that means giving you an answer that maximizes your family 's total wealth rather then just your own if instead of that your question really was should i let my parents buy me a house and live rent free then obviously you should do that assuming your parents can afford it and you are n't taking advantage people who need to be saving for retirement and not wasting it on a 25 y o who should be able to support him herself this is really an easy question assuming you are willing to listen to math goto the new york times rent vs buy calculator and plug in the numbers firstly if you do what you say you want to do buy the house all cash and live there for 4 years it would be the equivalent of paying month in rent once you factor in transaction costs taxes opportunity costs etc take a look at the calculator it 's very detailed this is why you should never buy houses all cash unless its a negotiating tactic in a hot market and even then you should refi after mortgage rates are super low right now all that money sitting in the house is appreciating at maybe the rate of inflation assuming the house value is n't going down which it can very easily do if you do n't maintain it another cost you need to factor in instead you could be invested in the stock market getting 8 the lost opportunity cost there is huge i 'm not even considering your suggestion that you hang onto the house after you move out in 4 years that 's a terrible idea investment properties should be at a maximum value of 10x the yearly rent i would n't pay more then 72 k for a house apartment that rents for only 600 month and even then i would look for a better deal which you can find if you time things right do n't believe me just do the numbers renting your 200 k house for 600 month is 7200 year figure you 'll need to spend 1 year i 'm being optimistic here on vacancy and i 'm not even considering your time dealing with tenants plus another 1 or so on property tax that 's 4 k year so your total profit is 3200 which is a return of only 1.6 on your 200k. you can get 1 in an ally savings account for comparison really you are much better off investing in a diversified portfolio you only need 6 months living expenses in cash so unless your family is wealthy in which case you should be asking your financial planner what to do and not stack exchange i have no idea why your parents have 200 k sitting around in a savings account earning 0 open a vanguard account for them and put that money in vti and your family will be much better off 5 years from now then if you buy that money pit err house if risk is a concern diversify more i have some money invested with a robo advisor they do charge a small fee but it 's set it and forget it with auto diversification and tax loss harvesting   bottom line is get that money invested in something having it sitting in a bank account earning 0 is probably the second worst thing you could do with next to buying this house

options reflect expectations about the underlying asset and options are commonly priced using the black scholes model   and are probability functions s is the spot current price of the asset k is the strike price r is the risk free rate and t t represents time to maturity   without getting into the mathematics it to say that higher volatility or expectation of volatility increases the perceived riskiness of the asset so call options are priced lower   and put options are priced higher think about it intuitively if the stock is more likely to go downwards then there 's an increased chance that the call option expires worthless so call options must be priced lower to accommodate the relative change in expected value of the option   puts are priced similarly but they move inversely with respect to call option prices due to put call parity so if call option prices are falling then put option prices are rising note however that call prices falling does not cause put prices to rise the inverse relationship exists because of changes in the underlying factors and how pricing works so the option action signifies that the market believes the stock is headed lower in the given time frame that does not mean it will go lower and option traders assume risk whenever they take a particular position bottom line got ta do your own homework best of luck

separation of powers under the united states constitution   separation of powers is a political doctrine originating in the writings of charles de baron de in the spirit of the laws in which he argued for a constitutional government with three separate branches each of which would have defined abilities to check the powers of the others this philosophy heavily influenced the writing of the united states constitution according to which the legislative executive and judicial branches of the united states government are kept distinct in order to prevent abuse of power this united states form of separation of powers is associated with a system of checks and balances   during the age of enlightenment philosophers such as advocated the principle in their writings whereas others such as thomas strongly opposed it     ^ ^pm](https://www.reddit.com message compose?to = kittens_from_space ^| ^exclude ^me](https://reddit.com message compose?to = wikitextbot&amp;message = excludeme&amp;subject = excludeme ^| ^exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com r economy about banned ^| ^faq ^/ ^information](https://np.reddit.com r wikitextbot wiki index ^| ^source](https://github.com kittenswolf wikitextbot    ^ ^downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.24

your question boils down to saving for a house or saving for retirement why not do both if you invest in a roth 401k or roth ira you can withdraw any contributions that are at least 5 years old without penalty assuming you 're willing to put off purchasing a little longer than your original 2 3 years if you qualify as a first time home buyer i.e. you have n't owned a home in at least 2 years you can withdraw investment earnings as well if your distribution is earmarked towards the down payment and is no more than $ 10000 although you wo n't be penalized for using investment earnings for a down payment you will still have to pay taxes on them so this may be more appealing to someone that has enough contributions to avoid dipping into the investment earnings the only other downside is that contributions to a roth investment are not tax deductible like traditional ira and 401k contributions are instead they grow tax free and distributions are tax free when you reach retirement age

this is a poor example really it 's not necessary to measure inequality from the position of a janitor it 's more illustrative to measure it from the educated middle class who have also fallen sharply in household wealth relative to the 1 this trend is more surprising and disturbing as it runs counter to the great 20th century trend of a rising middle class   if you want to understand inequality just look at the rate of investment and the relative rate of return achieved by the 1   not only is the wealth of the 1 increasing it is increasing at a faster rate    needless to say that difference compounds over time   until we have an extended period of the wealthy losing money at a faster rate than the less wealthy inequality will rise and also needless to say that scenario is forever and always unacceptable to the 1   it 's easy to talk about solutions to inequality right up until someone asks how are we going to make the wealthy less wealthy in a relative sense   at which point you realize there are no serious efforts being made against inequality

the best cheapest and safe way is to wire transfer that money from their bank account to yours ask your bank about information regarding inbound international wire transfer and provide those details to your dad about how much amounts can he do so if the amount is more than $ 10 k you need to provide enough information about where the money is coming from sources and other legal details whatever way you chose never do transfers in small chunks which is called structuring to avoid the legal hassle as that might result in more issues and every bank has checks in place to find out this way of structuring i would suggest wire transfer all the money through proper channel through the banks it 's better to pay some fees follow the law and live peacefully than to go through some improper channels to avoid paltry fees and get into serious issues

yes you should incorporate if you plan on seriously investing in real estate this not only limits liability in terms of paying back the debt but also in case your tenants sue you   pass through entities typically an llc but it depends on the state if they have good or bad llc laws pennsylvania is a state where you would not want to incorporate as an llc other options include s corps and   loans are taken out by corporations against the property typically mortgage loans are non recourse if you set up a company for each property this further insulates you against the bank capturing other properties within the pool however recourse can still end up getting you on the hook personally for the loans these typically include voluntary bankruptcy you would very rarely have to file for bankruptcy anyway for your real estate investments at worst it will end in foreclosure but banks typically would prefer deed in lieu just because it is faster and easier for them too you just turn over the keys and walk away it will have very little impact on your personal finances or record everyone in real estate walks away from properties and leaves them with the bank it 's a fact of doing business and your lender should have been comfortable owning your property at the basis they lent money to you if they were n't they were just stupid   yes every real estate investment requires equity in the property typically it 's a 20 equity check but if the lender the property to a lower value than what you purchased it for you may have to line up more expensive financing

in this scenario the date of income is the date on which the contract has been signed even if you received the actual money settlement later regardless of the ny special law for residency termination that is the standard rule for recognition of income during a cash not installments sale the fact that you got the actual money later does n't matter which is similar to selling stocks on a public exchange when you sell stocks through your broker on a public exchange you still recognize the income on the day of the sale not on the day of the settlement this is called the constructive receipt doctrine the irs publication 538 has this to say about the constructive receipt constructive receipt    income is constructively received when an    amount is credited to your account or made available to you without    restriction you need not have possession of it if you authorize    someone to be your agent and receive income for you you are    considered to have received it when your agent receives it income is    not constructively received if your control of its receipt is subject    to substantial restrictions or limitations once you signed the contract the money has essentially been credited to your account with the counter party and unless they 're bankrupt or otherwise insolvent you have no restrictions over it and also more specifically for your case you can not hold checks or postpone taking possession of similar    property from one tax year to another to postpone paying tax on the    income you must report the income in the year the property is    received or made available to you without restriction timing wire transfer is akin to holding and not depositing a check from this perspective so unless there was a restriction that was lifted after you moved out of new york i doubt you can claim that you could n't have received it before moving out i.e. you have in fact constructively received it

i see a couple of reasons why you could consider choosing a mutual fund over an etf in some cases index mutual funds can be a cheaper alternative to etfs in the uk where i am based fidelity is offering a management fee of 0.07 on its ftse all shares tracker last time i checked no etf was beating that there are quite a few cost you have to foot when dealing etfs in some cases when dealing for relatively small amounts e.g. a monthly investment plan you can get a better deal if your broker has negotiated discounts for you with a fund provider my broker asks £ 12.5 when dealing in shares £ 1.5 for the regular investment plan whereas he asks £ 0 when dealing in funds and i get a 100 discount on the initial charge of the fund as a conclusion i would suggest you look at the all in costs over total investment period you are considering for the exact amount you are planning to invest despite all the hype etfs are not always the cheapest alternative

not to mention that what they were doing was the right way to do it for many decades it was simply seen as the norm that you would have a job take part of your savings and put that into a 401k because it was the only way to really provide for a safe future   so that 's what we did oops   the other big difference between gen x and the surrounding generations in regards to retirement is social security the baby boomers will have social security for most of the rest of their lives it 's funded and it wo n't be a problem millenials have mostly come of age knowing that 's a joke gen x on the other hand grew up and worked at least part of their lives under the assumption that social security while having problems would at least provide some help however with the way the economy and government is going it 's very possible that wo n't be a guarantee without major adjustments decreased payout increased retirement age etc so they 're going to be taking it there as well   that 's not even to get started on the mortgage situation for a lot of us x'ers we bought homes near or at the top of the bubble again because everyone was telling our generation that we were foolish for renting why with the tax incentives in place and the way housing prices have been rising the last 20 years you 're just throwing your money away by renting so again the baby boomers enjoyed 20 30 years of rising home prices giving them a chance to build up a lot of equity and refinance at lower and lower rates the millenials again were shielded simply by not being at the point in their lives where it would be a problem once again it 's gen x that was just trying to do what they had observed as working their entire life   i think generation x will rise out of everything that has happened much wiser most of us have been through enough at this point that i think we 're beginning to become very of the way things are and that will have heavy ramifications as the reigns of power fall from the boomers to the x'ers   may you live in interesting times

at a minimum i would save 20 30k because you need to have both a safety net and some money for home repairs   very few people move into a house and then do zero repairs painting usually at a minimum and there 's almost always something that comes up pretty soon after   even if you 're buying a condo you 'll want to be sure you can fix anything that needs fixing within that first year or two beyond that you have to decide based on your risk tolerance and your other details like your income   taking a smaller mortgage means a guaranteed 3 to 4 return right now   that 's not quite what you 'll probably get on the market over the long term but how did your investments do last year   my 401(k was down slightly   in order to do better than that 3 4 you 're going to have to invest in stocks or etfs or similar meaning you could have swings potentially year over year which if that 's your only extra 50k might be more than you can tolerate if you 're very risk tolerant and mostly looking to make money over the long term then it may be worth it to you   but if a larger mortgage makes it harder to pay the monthly payments a meaningfully smaller buffer or if your job is such that you might end up having to sell those investments at a loss to cover your mortgage for a few months because you did n't make laid then you may want the smaller mortgage to make that less of a risk though still setting aside the safety net in something minimally risky

just their website not a single name of anybody involved their application process is n't https usage while transferring private information   and considering they contacted you rather than you contacting them i will be very wary about how they got my details and they are located in indonesia and a simple google takes me to a boiler scam thread so all in all you have been scammed try asking for your money back but may not be that helpful next time before giving your money to somebody do some due diligence these type of scams are n't new and are very common

it will have some positives and some negatives the hardest hit will be the insurance agencies as well as banks manufacturing will also take a short term hit when insurance payments come out then there will be a boom in construction consumer goods industrial goods etc companies will upgrade their equipment whereas before they might have let it run for another 10 20 years or longer after all if you are going to buy something you are n't going to get it used you 'll get something more modern of course japan already was one of the most modern countries in the world so they likely wo n't see as many gains as other countries but this would hold more true in a less technologically advanced society long term 10 20 years down the line when everything is rebuilt it might have a slight positive increase in productivity but this will be somewhat offset because japan already is such a technological powerhouse and on the cutting edge in many technologies but i agree it 's quite foolish to say that it 'll improve the economy of japan some clarification should be done to clear that one up

i 've had an echo well now three of them for more than two years   it starts out as a novelty   then you find the things that are useful which is mostly just kitchen timers quick math amp;amp conversion questions music amp;amp radio amp;amp podcasts and questions to settle an argument   sometimes i ask about the weather something in the news etc   and then occasionally i 'll order something or add something to a shopping list   the only home automation device i control with the echo is the thermostat alexa make it cooler   the latest development is our acquisition of the echo show which just adds a touch screen   that has added the ability to    a. shop visually which i still do n't do often   b. entertain distract my for a few minutes in the kitchen alexa play daniel tiger and   b. video chat with my mom for whom i also bought one again for keeping the kid occupied while we 're cooking   so all in all i do n't think i 'm really using it the way amazon wants i.e. voice purchases and buying more alexa connected devices because i have this hub but i 'm still happy with it and use it every day   and as you might gather i am neither single nor old nor affluent   so that 's my story

brokerages are supposed to keep your money separate from theirs so even if they fail as a company your money and investments are still there and can be transferred to another brokerage it does n't matter if it 's an ira or taxable account   of course as is the case with mf global if illegally take their client 's money i.e. steal it may be a different story in such cases sipc covers up to $ 500 k of which $ 250 k can be cash as joetaxpayer said   you may be interested in the following news item from the sec it 's about some proposed changes but to frame the proposal they lay out the way it is now the most relevant quote    the customer protection rule rule 3    this sec rule requires a    broker dealer to segregate customer securities and cash from the    firm ’s proprietary business activities if the broker dealer fails    these customer assets should be readily available to be returned to    customers

well to get money you need to leverage your assets   so your options basically are   asset cash   well i figure if you had you would n't have asked how to get more of it but its always worth mentioning   do n't forget about cash that can be in tricky places to tap like 401ks iras investment accounts etc   there is usually some way to get at the cash but it may not be worth it and you could end up sacrificing long term financial stability if you do   asset job skills and initiative   get a job and and earn the cash    $ 2k is not a ton and if you live frugally you should be able to save it   there are tons of websites dedicated to living frugally and earning extra cash on the side    my personal favorite is r    asset good credit borrow the money from a traditional bank   signature loans go up to $ 35k at most banks just ask what it would take to qualify   you could also get a credit card for that amount and use it to start up the business     asset bad credit   if you 've got bad credit you can still take out a loan from a place like prosper or lending club or sofi these places are handy if you have good credit too   your rates will be much higher but they will still lend to you   asset property   if you own stuff you can sell it and get cash   clean out your attic or ask relatives if you can have the stuff in theirs and sell it   if you own fancy stuff you can borrow against it home car boat etc   asset your charm and winning smile   if you have a good solid business plan written down and professional looking ask around and see if you can find an investor   it could be friends or family but it could also be someone who is looking to invest   be professional and be sure to draw up the appropriate business docs if you do a partnership or take a private loan   asset your government   if you live in the us there are federal programs that offer small business loans   check out for more info   you will need a business plan and will have to meet the criteria of the loan or grant   not sure if your ecommerce business will meet the criteria as the intent of these types of programs are to spur the economy by allowing small business owners to hire workers   but its worth checking out

math the half match is 3 or $ 3900 after 5 years $   if you stay you are vested and have $ 20 k i hope it 's actually far more extra for you it 's like 2 month 's salary bonus after 5 years   if you leave early the good news is that even if the expenses within the plan were n't great you have the money you put in along with what vested so far you move that to an ira and choose your own thrifty funds or etfs   for me as duff said there 's no one answer so to be clear this is my feeling or preference not gospel 6 is far too little to save as a percent of my income so if the 401(k fees ran say .8 or higher i 'd put in the 6 to get the potential match and then save on the side   our answers might change slightly depending on the exact fees you 're exposed to

and if you subtract that 30 the 19 social security and 11 fed holdings which are entirely bogus and moot   then that 32 out of the remaining 70 is pretty darned near half and regardless of it being just shy of a majority it is still the largest block   even then since the dollar itself is backed by nothing it is n't technically a problem the us can pay it off at any time the only inherent cost being the debasement of the currency   where the problem with that comes in is that there are a lot of us assets located on foreign soil all of the joint operation manufacturing plants in china for instance and foreign governments can hold them hostage so to speak or if they so choose to literally confiscate nationalize them and yet legally compensate their us based paper owners by paying them off with the debased dollars and/or us bonds same thing really basically just paying us with checks drawn on our own collective account

you have 3 assumptions about the use of credit cards for all your purchases 1 may be a moot point at current interest rates that will not make much of a difference if somebody links their card to a checking account that does n't pay any interest there will be no additional interest earned if the rate on their account is < 1 they may make a couple of dollars a month 2 make sure that the card delivers on the benefits you expect do n't select a card with an annual fee cash is better than miles for most people also make sure the best earnings are n't from only shopping at one gas station or one store you might not make as much as you expect especially if the gas station is generally the most expensive in the area sometimes the maximum cash back is only for a limited time or only after you have charged thousands of dollars that year 3 it can have a positive impact on your credit rating i have also found that the use of the credit card does minimize the chances of accidentally overdrawing the linked account there is only one big scheduled withdraw a month instead of dozens of ones there is some evidence that by the drop in balance from the purchase people spend more they say i am getting x% back but then are shocked when they see the monthly bill

most companies get taken over eventually more to the point any company with a public float over 50 percent that 's large and viable enough to fall on people 's radar screens will get taken over if its stock price is too low relative to its long term prospects   it is the possibility of a takeover as much as anything else that the stock prices of many companies particularly those that do n't pay dividends in essence the takeover price is just one large liquidating dividend

for anyone who 'd like to know a little more   basically i 'm curious about newer styles of portfolio optimization we all know and love the classic markowitz mean variance optimization model gather your assets optimize weights based on minimizing variance and maximizing return plot your capital allocation line find your sharpe ratio portfolio   in case anyone does n't know what i 'm talking about check this out it is a very common technique still used quite widely terms e   however the markowitz model makes a couple of huge assumptions one of them being that asset returns roughly follow a normal distribution since this is not always the case new models for risk management and optimization have emerged starting with value at risk and more recently conditional value at risk terms c   you can also draw an efficient frontier for portfolios using fairly complicated linear programming techniques as first outlined in this very influential fortunately these days the techniques are widely available in python and matlab packages    for further discussion what are your thoughts on the markowitz model do you have a preferred portfolio optimization method

companies do both quite often   they have opposite effects on the share price but not on the total value to the shareholders   doing both causes value to shareholders to rise ie any un bought back shares now own a larger percentage of the company and are worth more and drops the per share price so it is easier to buy a share of the stock   to some that 's irrelevant but some might want a share of an otherwise expensive stock without paying $ 700 for it as a specific example of this apple appl split its stock in 2014 and also continued a significant buyback program apple announces $ repurchase program oct 2014 apple stock splits in june 2014 this led to their stock in total being worth more but costing substantially less per share

if you pay off a debt through a collections agency it will damage your credit   here 's an alternative approach   settling a $ 10 k loan for $ 2 k shows the lender is keen to settle    instead of paying the collections agency negotiate with the lender and agree to pay 2 k to settle provided that they agree to this could be a win win for both   the lender gets to keep full 2 k without having to pay the collection agency a fat commission and your credit is n't damaged not saying this will always work but worth a try    pro tip get everything in writing before you pay anything
