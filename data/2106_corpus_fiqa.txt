there 's often a legal basis to answer this question for instance austria guessing from your profile currently uses a 4 statutory interest rate you 'll need to dig up not just the actual but also the historical rates note that you 'll want the non commercial interest rate some countries differentiate between loans to businesses and loans to individuals

what you are positioning as a loan was not a loan at all your father bought something to be delivered in the future your aunt does not want to deliver it so she should buy it back at whatever the current market value is what is the price that your dad believes her share of the inheritance is currently worth is that based on actual appraisals and some sort of objective audit if so your aunt does n't have much of a case if not then she could seek an audit to bolster her bargaining position how much did your aunt benefit from having a place to live for the last 15 years was that benefit greater than some larger amount of money at an unknown future date that 's probably why she sold her inheritance 15 years ago now that the inheritance looks like it is going to be available soon she wants to trade back after having enjoyed the use of your father 's money that might be okay but simply paying back the original sum with inflation but without interest does n't seem fair to your father she may not be able to afford to give any more than what she is offering in which case she might want to consider offering the original sum now and some portion of her inheritance as interest on that original sum i 'm not taking sides in this one if it were one of my siblings i 'd be inclined to give the benefit of the doubt and take a smaller amount back if i felt that the lesson was learned and if i felt that he she would make wise use of my gift to him her   i have no idea what your father 's current economic situation is nor am i aware of any other baggage that might influence his feelings about his sister it 's as likely as not that money is n't really what is bothering him in which case the amount she repays may have little to do with bridging the divide between them you might need to ask different questions in the interpersonal skills stack if you want to help your father feel better

with no written agreement in place the right rate is whatever both parties can agree to i could argue that i could have invested the money in s&p 500 index funds and made about 9 annually over the last 15 years and the 15,000 would have been over 40,000   the fair rate would be whatever rate of return could have been expected from whatever your father would have done with the money otherwise keep it in a bank account pay off debt invest in the market start a business whatever   your father has the benefit of hindsight to know what would have been a good use of the funds over 15 years using the rate of inflation results in effectively a zero percent loan in real interest terms meaning no profit was made just accounting for the time value of money both parties need to either decide on an amount or equivalent rate or decide if squeezing the other for a few thousand euros is worth the strife

gt;there was a good quote in the article about how google apple and amazon combined employ fewer than 1/3 the people that gm did in 1980   yeah that was from the blogs steve   first that is only a total of their direct employees numbers from wikipedia on each company   amazon = apple = facebook = 3,000 google =   so that is not including indirect employees including any and all subcontractors to wit   amazon sells lots of stuff but lets just think of the books alone there are lots of authors publishers printing industry people etc who are not direct employees of amazon nor even indirect contract   employees but whom amazon 's business model has helped to increase total sales of their products and then of course there are all of the amazon affiliates   apple sells stuff but basically no longer manufactures anything at all so comparing it to gm would only be valid if one looked only at gm 's engineering and sales personnel and ignored it 's manufacturing people or if gm had likewise all of its manufacturing to say toyota just about everything that apple sells is made by subcontract overseas manufacturers like foxconn which employed over 900,000 people in china in 2010 and of course that is not including the component manufacturers   and of course this is also ignoring the entire software industry that has built up around apple 's products mac and developers   facebook amp google likewise there are a lot of indirect non employees who nonetheless are in many senses laboring for these companies and be compensated by them whether app developers affiliates etc   i find it very notable that entirely ignored firms like microsoft + direct employees and dozens amp even hundreds of others software companies like adobe systems 9,000 + etc not to mention countless thousands of consulting companies   at it 's absolute peak employment in 1970 gm had a little under 400,000 employees   if you add in microsoft adobe and a handful of cad software companies then high tech employs at least that number add in the domestic sub contract employees the consultants affiliates and on and they employ far more people even domestically than not only gm but gm + ford + chrysler combined   add in the worldwide employment and there is no comparison at   and even then all of it is beside the point   yes you can not eat software or an ipod but likewise you can not eat a car   what is chiefly critical is whether a nation can feed itself and the us production of has never been higher nor on a long term comparison basis have food or energy costs ever been lower even with all of the disastrous effects of monetary inflation   the us 's current problem is is domestic employment and that is mainly a result of various trade monetary and taxation policies it certainly is n't the direct fault of private industry and definitely not the fault of technology   i mean good god how many times does the luddite meme need to be proven false

i 'm not sure that you 're considering all the options    so you may not subtract $ x from b but you do compare npv(b to $ y.    also remember that we 're not trying to figure out the return on b.   we 're trying to figure out what to do next   in terms of planning the sunk cost is irrelevant   but in terms of calculating return a was a turkey   and to calculate the return we would include $ x in our costs for b.   and for the second option we 'd subtract $ x from $ y may be negative    sunk costs are irrelevant to planning but they are very relevant to retrospective analysis   please do n't confuse the two   when looking back part of the cost for b will be that $ x.   but in the middle after paying $ x and before starting b the $ x is gone   you only have the building and have to make your decision based on the options you have at that moment    you will sometimes hear $ y called the opportunity cost of b.   you could sell out for $ y or you could do b.   you should only do b if it is worth more than $ y.    the sunk cost fallacy would be comparing b to $ x.   assuming $ y is less than $ x this would make you not do b when it is your best path forward from that moment   i.e. $ y < npv(b < $ x means that you should do the project   you will lose money apparently that 's a foregone conclusion but you will lose less money than if you just sold out    you should also do b if $ y < $ x < npv(b or $ x < $ y < npv(b   in general you should do b any time $ y < npv(b   the only time you should not do b is if npv(b < $ y.   if they are exactly equal then it does n't matter financially whether you do b or not

there could be a number of reasons the price hit your number $ but by the time your order hit the market the price had gone up perhaps the stock went up between when you placed the stop loss and when the order was executed a trailing stop loss will ratchet up very simply the trailing stop maintains a stop loss order at a precise percentage below the market price or above in the case of a short position the stop loss order is adjusted continually based on fluctuations in the market price always maintaining the same percentage below or above the market price

according to the book of hull american and european calls on non dividend paying stocks should have the same value american puts however should be equals to or more valuable than european puts the reason for this is the time value of money in a put you get the option to sell a stock at a given strike price if you exercise this option at t=0 you receive the strike price at t=0 and can invest it at the risk free rate lets imagine the rf rate is 10 and the strike price is this means at you would get if on the other hand you exercise the option early at you would simply receive the strike price 10 $ basically the strike price which is your payoff for a put option does n't earn interest another way to look at this is that an option is composed of two elements the insurance element and the time value of the option the insurance element is what you pay in order to have the option to buy a stock at a certain price for put options it is equals to the s 0 where k = strike price and stock price   the time value of the option can be thought of as a risk premium it 's difference between the value of the option and the insurance element if the benefits of exercising a put option early earning the risk free rate on the proceeds outweighs the time value of the put option it should be exercised early yet another way to look at this is by looking at the upper bounds of put options for a european put today 's value of the option can never be worth more than the present value of the strike price discounted at the risk free rate if this rule is n't respected there would be an arbitrage opportunity by simply investing at the risk free rate for an american put since it can be exercised at any time the maximum value it can take today is simply equals to the strike price therefore since the pv of the strike price is smaller than the strike price the american put can have a bigger value bear in mind this is for a non dividend paying stock as previously mentioned if a stock pays a dividend it might also be optimal to exercise just before these are paid

are you in the us because if so there are tax discrepancies gains from sale of stocks held for less than one year are subject to ordinary income tax so probably around 30 if you hold those stocks for a year or more gains will be taxed as capital gains tax 15   for forex taxes on your earnings will be split 60/40 60 will be traded at the lower 15 rate while the remaining 40 will be taxed at a higher rate approximately 30   so purely short term there is a tax advantage to in forex however these are both incredibly risky things to do with your money i never would recommend anyone invest short term looking to make quick cash in fact the tax code discourages people from short term investments

what you choose to invest in depends largely on your own goals and time horizon   you state that your time horizon is a few decades most studies have shown that the equity market as a whole has outperformed most other asset types except perhaps property in some cases over the long term   the reason that time horizon is important is that equities are quite volatile who knows whether your value will halve in the next year but we hope that over the longer term things come out in the wash and tomorrow 's market crash will recover etc   however you must realize that if your goals change and you suddenly need your money after 2 years it might be worth less in two years than you expect

not to state the obvious but whenever an investment is being made the nuts and bolts is your return on investment   analyzing the rate of return on an investment is the primary factor in any decision   ideally once the actual mechanics of investment and side benefits are factored out the goal is to be able to analyze the pure financial return usually the biggest problem faced in analyzing various investments is comparing the present value of an investment to a series of payments that may be made or received in the future   when considering the purchase of a large equity for example you might be looking at what series of payments are required to purchase the asset   you can also reverse this and ask what amount of money is equivalent to this series of payments ultimately the present value of an annuity is the way to make these comparisons equal    fundamentally the present value of an annuity is an amount of money that should in theory be equivalent to a series of payments   there is for example technically no difference between $ today and $ 100 a month for a year at an interest rate of 1 per month   grant you most people would be happier with the money now but that is what interest does it compensates you for waiting on your money    you can fire up a spreadsheet and calculate the present value as long as you have the monthly payment interest rate and number of periods   alternatively you can calculate any one of those missing four variables and the key is usually to understand what that rate would be in order to compare the investments finally the taxable implication is really just an adjustment to the rate of return imagine the following three scenarios obviously the rates are fictional the goal is to show they are the same scenarios 1 2 are really just two sides of the same coin   using the future value formula in excel = 12 -100 you get $   in scenario 1 you would have $ in your bank account   in scenario 2 your bank would have $ from you and you would have $ 100 less debt per month   they are equivalent transactions    scenario 3 is really just a variation on scenario 2 localized to the united states   because the interest is tax deductible however the rate of 6 is n't really accurate   assuming you had a 25 tax bracket you 'd actually be getting back one quarter of your interest   put another way 7.5 mortgage interest costs you as much as 6 credit card debt this is how you compare apples and just turn everything into an annuity or a lump sum using present value calculations    finally quick rule of thumb if you owe taxes in both canada and the us your canadian taxes are probably higher than your american ones   as such any tax incentives will be higher   if you only can only use canadian tax incentives then look to those incentives other things being equal

when you buy a put on a stock you buy the right to sell the stock at fixed price f that his usually different from the market price m. you paid a price p for the put   your potential profit going forward is represented by the difference you get to collect between your fixed price f and that market price m plus the price you paid for the put or this assumes that p is fixed but the smaller m gets the larger the term and therefore the higher your potential profit from owning the put so when m tanks the put goes higher   the $ put is already in the money if it were settled today the value would be $ or $ 19 this minus the cost of the put itself represents your profit the $ 365 put is out of the money the stock has to fall $ 11 more before the put is exercised but if the stock went down 8 points today that is less than the $ 19 difference at the start of the day because there is time between now and october there is a chance for the stock to go down further thereby going into the money the current value of the put is represented by this chance obviously the chances of the stock going down $ 11 more from today is greater than the chance of it going down $ 19 more on the other hand the closer it gets to the expiration date the less an out of the money put is worth it 's a race between the stock 's fall and the time to expiration

you are entirely correct that it is an assumption so i will not argue the point any further other than to say that i do n't think it 's a very large stretch of the imagination to say that a more robust bitcoin economy and a larger user base would smooth it out the volatility it seems pretty reasonable to me that the instability in prices ca n't be accounted for from the technology that runs bitcoin and yet it is obvious that the current bitcoin economy is borderline abysmal it 's the things bitcoin allows you to do outside of financial institutions that give it a over typical government backed fiat currencies when we utilize this advantage real people will use the technology and a genuine economy could flourish    as a caveat to this i 'm not 100 convinced that bitcoins are the answer to me bitcoins are one particular brand of free as in speech decentralized crypto currencies when i speak of bitcoins i 'm promoting the idea it represents more than this particular implementation although i do believe the exact software you can download and run at this moment have the potential for tremendously more use than they 're currently being used for

from a mathematical expected value standpoint there is no difference between gambling e.g. buying a lottery ticket and investing e.g. buying a share of stock   the former probably has negative expected value while the latter probably has positive expected value but that is not a distinction to include in a definition else every company that gives a bad quarterly earnings report suddenly changes categories however investment professionals have a vested interest in claiming there is a difference that justifies them charging fees to steer you into the right investment   consequently hair splitting ideas like the motive behind a purchase are introduced   the classification of an item to be purchased should not depend on the mental state of its purchaser depending on the situation it may be right to engage in negative ev behavior   for example if you have $ 1000 and need $ 2000 by next week or else you ca n't have an operation and you will die and you ca n't find anyone to give you a loan   your optimal strategy is to gamble your $ 1000 at the best odds you can get with a possible outcome of $ 2000   so even if you only have a 1/3 chance of winning and getting that operation it 's still the right bet if you ca n't find a better one

i wrote a brilliant guest post at do n't mess with taxes titled roth iras and your retirement income note this article now reflects 2012 rates just updated simply put it 's an ongoing question of whether your taxes will be higher now than at any point in the future if you are in the 25 bracket now it would take quite of bit of money for your withdrawals to put you in that bracket at retirement in the case of the ira you have the opportunity to convert in any year between now and retirement if your rate that year drops for whatever reason   the simplest case is if you are now in the 25 bracket i say go pre tax and track year by year what your withdrawal would be if you retired today   at 15 but with a good chance for promotion to the 25 bracket start with roth flavor and then as you hit 25 use a combination this approach would smooth your marginal rate to stay at 15   to give you a start to this puzzle in 2012 a couple has a $ standard deduction along with 2 exemptions of $ 3800 each this means the first $ in an ira comes out tax free at retirement if you believe in a 4 withdrawal rate you need a retirement account containing $ 500 k pretax to generate this much money this tick up with inflation 2 years ago it was $ and $ k respectively this is why those who scream taxes will go up may be correct but do you really believe the standard deduction and exemptions will go away   edit and as time passes and i learn more new info comes to my attention the above thoughts not there 's an issue of taxation of social security benefits this creates a the phantom tax rate zone which i recently wrote about a single person with not really too high an income gets into the 46 bracket not a typo to be exact

look i agree with you in theory    in practice it is quite different    the fact that there is way more educated people than is even remotely necessary the extreme vast majority of jobs out there do not even require actual ability to get a diploma let alone a degree    think about your daily life with whom do you actually deal with that requires much of an education few people are going to pay more to their retail sales or car because they have an advanced degree     everybody having a college degree drives the value down for everybody which is exactly what is happening     things need to be turned on their head i propose that colleges need to receive their income as a percentage of the first 10 15 years of income from their students   it will cut down on bogus degrees concentrate on valuable students even those with questionable academics like steve jobs and larry and concentrate on degrees with high future value    however when you get 2500 applications for a lower end job i would immediately take it down to those with a degree because it 's easy and nobody will second guess you

in united states vs. wiki the supreme court established the precedent of interpreting sec rule using the theory the theory establishes that   gt confidential information for securities trading purposes in breach of a duty owed to the source of that information gives rise to a duty to disclose or abstain    you 're correct that from a legal perspective the rules are anything but clear outside of company insiders however your own admission is consistent with what anyone in the securities industry knows is true if you trade on material non public information you risk being charged   i think most would conclude that it 's unethical irrespective of the letter of the law it damages the integrity and functioning of markets furthermore if the law was clarified i think it 's highly unlikely it would state trading on material non public information is permissible for anyone who is not a company insider instead i would expect it to be consistent with trading on material non public information is illegal if in doubt abstain and this is exactly what the government officials should be doing

as mentioned in the comments the problem stems with converting your u.s. dollars to indian rupees so as to be able to purchase an indian fixed deposit at the time of writing this 1 u.s. dollar = 64 indian rupees consider the following economic factors both of the above factors are not definitive but are worth considering you might be what if i never intend to convert my rupees back to dollars if it is the case that money converted to rupees would stay that way that then eliminates the risk of foreign exchange losses mentioned above however you must still keep in mind that part of the reason interest rates on fixed deposits is as high in india is because inflation is high a 9 return must be looked at after adjusting for inflation inflation is somewhere between at the time of writing which then reduces your real return to about 4 pre tax

building out infrastructure is time consuming and labor intensive you also have no guarantee that because you put fiber to every house in a neighborhood that every person will sign up for your service building out infrastructure requires permits from the municipality and underground wiring on new poles on existing poles etc it requires tying into existing networks more infrastructure permitting and commercial contracts   if you want to offer telephone services that requires more network and permitting and has additional requirements as phone service has legacy legal requirements if you want to offer tv services you need more infrastructure and commercial contracts with the tv channels   in many municipalities existing providers ie comcast twc have exclusive contracts with the city that say no one else can come in and build a network   tldr legal contracts commercial contracts and the expense of building out the actual infrastructure make it pretty much impossible to create your own isp unless you have regular money like google does

first in most cases when you inherit stocks the cost basis is stepped up to the date of the death of the person you inherited them from so the capital gain loss is likely reset to zero the rules vary a bit for joint accounts but retirement accounts 401k roth are considered individual accounts by the irs the rules on this have changed a lot in recent history so it may depend on when he died update as joetaxpayer pointed out and i confirmed via this site the gains are not stepped up for retirement accounts so this is a moot point anyway   further evidence that retirement accounts can be complicated and seeking professional guidance is a good idea is no step up in cost basis    upon the death of the ira owner most    other assets owned by an individual    receive a step up in cost basis upon    the death of the person eliminating    all capital gains on those assets up    to that point in time second   even if you can deduct an investment capital loss you can only deduct it to offset capital gains on another investments also you can only do this up to $ 3k per year though you can roll over excess capital losses into future years bottom line i really doubt you are going to be able to claim a deduction however due to the complexity of the situation and the amount of money involved i strongly suggest you talk to a qualified tax adviser and not rely solely on information you gather through this site

repurchase agreements are a way of financing a security position you have a collateralized loan where you give your security in exchange for cash let 's say you have a 10 year treasury note paying 3.5 while the repurchase rate is 0.5 you loan the security to someone with a promise to repurchase it from them some time in the future you   collect the 3.5 coupon and you pay the 0.5 interest clearly it makes no sense for someone to collect interest on money and also collect coupon payments and for the counter party it makes no sense to be not getting coupon payments and also to be paying interest this how one website explains the process during the transaction any coupon payments that come due belong to    the legal owner the borrower however when this happens a cash    amount equal to the coupon is paid to the original owner this is    called manufactured payment in order to avoid the tax payment on    the coupon some institutions will repo the security to a tax exempt    entity and receive the manufactured payment and avoid the tax coupon    washing i find this description to be the clearest during the life of the transaction the market risk and the credit risk    of the collateral remain with the seller because he has agreed to    repurchase the asset for an agreed sum of money at maturity provided    the trade is correctly documented if the collateral has a coupon    payment during the life of the repo the buyer is obliged to pay this    to the seller

you can certainly borrow from your parents and they can take out a loan under their own names if you can persuade them to do so that really is the best solution i can think of for a loan to a minor assuming that your parents think the trip is important enough to justify the cost and commitment of taking out a loan at all if they do n't they would n't co sign for a loan either other than that i think the simple answer is no you are probably going to have to find some other way to raise the money or delay the trip yes theoretically there are things that can be done with them guaranteeing a loan on your behalf but at your age i do n't know whether you would be considered legally competent to sign that agreement in most jurisdictions and realistically it winds up being no less risky for your parents than the approach i suggested since they 're still on the hook if you ca n't repay in time

in some states it is your responsibility to pay the sales tax on a transaction even if the party your purchase from does n't collect it this is common with online purchases across state lines for example here in massachusetts if i buy something from new hampshire where there is no sales tax i am required to pay ma sales tax on the purchase when i file my income taxes buying a service that did not include taxes just shifts the burden of paperwork from the other party to me even if you would end up saving money by paying in cash as other here have pointed out you are sacrificing a degree of protection if something goes wrong with the transaction he could take your money and walk away without doing the work or do a sloppy job or even damage your vehicle without a receipt it is your word against his that the transaction ever even took place should you be worried that he is offering a discount for an under the table transaction probably not as long as you do n't take him up on it

since there are no details rightfully so you need to know how it will make money period snap chat sounded like a weird idea but it got super popular and is valued very high but guess what it does n't know how to make money which is why the value has been so volatile and going down you need to know how your idea will very specifically make money details about your target audience how many people does it include how you will attract them why they would want your product or service over someone else 's how you will give it to them how much they would pay how often would it be needed and you need to know how much money it will cost you to make that money so figure out the costs you need to know the exact resources that you will need how much they will cost how long it will take to even begin execution and how long you expect it will be until you are cash flow positive there 's a lot more but hopefully that 's a starting point for you since you seem to not any real research done

if the ira is costing you $ 100 a year you should almost certainly transfer it to a cheaper provider regardless of whether you 're going to withdraw anything   you can transfer the ira to another provider that does n't charge you the fees   or you can convert it to roth and combine it with your existing roth   either way you will keep all the money and save $ 100 per year in the future if you want to take money out of your retirement accounts you should take it out of your roth ira because you can withdraw contributions i.e. up to the amount you contributed from the roth without tax or penalty whether you should withdraw anything from your retirement accounts is a different question   if you 're already maxing out your roth ira and you have sufficient retirement savings you could just instead plow that $ 5500 into your student loans   if you can afford it of course it 'd be better to just pay the $ 7500 from your income and still contribute to the retirement accounts   there 's no reason to withdraw from retirement accounts to pay loans when you could just divert current income for that purpose instead

the thing that gets so many people is that multilevel marketing is n't inherently a scam it has all of the potential that they try to sell you on it just so happens that every friend you have does n't have an infinite supply of friend networks completely unrelated to anyone you know so once you get three or four people in the same area in on an mlm or if you try to join not realizing that there are already people in on it and especially if you get in on mlm without knowing anything about he product aside from the mlm opportunities for your potential marks or without knowing anything about sales in general then people start getting screwed   mlm is cancer

depending on your strategy it could be though there is also something to be said for what kind of order are you placing market limit or otherwise something else to consider is whether or not there is some major news that could cause the stock etf to gap at the open   for example if a company announces strong earnings then it is possible for the stock to open higher than it did the previous day and so a market order may not to take into account that the stock may jump a bit compared to the previous close   limit orders can be useful to put a cap on how much you 'll pay for a stock though the key would be to factor this into your strategy of when do you buy

gt;then we will have to agree to disagree   the important thing is that we did n't give any solid advice to the original question   gt;the social discount rate is n't about borrowing it is about funding projects that would return a higher rate to simply say the discount rate is the same as the borrowing rate which is dirt cheap right now is n't wise because different projects offer better social value think of it as your opportunity cost   i agree with you that there may be better projects but i am implying that as long as those other projects irr are above the borrowing rate they also should be basically keep on borrowing and going down the order until the borrowing rate meets the irr of projects not started what every that equilibrium is should be the discount rate   and while someone may say that borrowing takes away from private investment and they are right it is in the best interest of the country to ignore that the market for government securities is global the state could be taking more from foreign private investment than domestic   however this does ignore the manipulation on the rate that goes on from forced lending from citizens social security by law has no choice but to invest in government securities i do n't know i think i 'm just rambling now

the big risk for a bank in country x is that they would be unfamiliar with all the lending rules and regulations in country y. what forms and disclosures are required and all the national and local steps that would be required a mistake could leave them exposed or in violation of some obscure law plus they would n't have the resources in country y to verify the existence and the actual ownership of the property the fear would be that it was a scam this would likely cause them to have to charge a higher interest rate and higher fees not to mention that the currency ratio will change over the decades    the risks would be large

this is because short term debt needs to be rolled over to finance the long term project and so when interest rates rise they will be refinanced at a higher interest rate this means that it will end up costing more than if the company had taken out a long term loan at the lower rate a long term project implies that the beneficial incoming cashflows will be long term but with short term financing the debt will come payable sooner which is why it needs rolling over any beneficial cashflows are not   enough to cover the debt

most directly and most likely it can hurt your credit score if you miss payments since it 's being reported regardless of whether or not it benefits you this is a risk for you but a benefit for landlords since it gives renters more incentive to actually make on time payments secondarily there 's a small risk that credit ladder or one of their partners makes a mistake and you have to spend some time correcting it they do seem to have reputable partners so it 's likely that mistakes can be corrected at the cost of through customer support finally it 's important to look at where they get their money   credit ladder charges directly for premium memberships it appears that those are basically a sort of group discount thing none of the benefits seem super awesome but the cost is low enough that i think it could be worth it for some people so that 's one way to make money risk here = this service does n't make enough money and they might phase out the free tier now source of money 2 your information according to this source within the privacy policy the company states that they may use the personal information collected about you to provide third parties with statistical information about our users but this information will not be used to identify any individual user it ’s not clear if this is the intended monetization of the company it is a consideration to the user that this information may be sold risk here = they might get hacked or they might sell your non identifying information there 's no details as to whether or not they are actually doing this but they have the right to do so if they got even 10 of the renters in uk using their service then this data would be quite valuable

an option gives you an option   that is you are n't buying any security you are simply buying an option to buy a security   the sole value of what you buy is the option to buy something an american option offers more flexibility i.e. it offers you more options on buying the stock   since you have more options the cost of the option is higher of course a good example makes sense why this is the case   consider the vix   options on the vix are european style   sometimes the vix spikes like crazy tripling in value in days   it usually comes back down pretty quick though within a couple of weeks   so far out options on the vix are n't worth just a whole lot more because the vix will probably   be back to normal   however if the person could have them right when it got to the top they would have made a fortune many times what their option was worth   since they are style though they would have to wait till their option was redeemable right when the vix would be about back to normal   in this case an american style option would be far more valuable especially for something that is difficult to predict like the vix

i have heard that it is better for your credit score to pay them down over time will it make much of a difference i have never heard that however the financial institutions who are charging you an amount of interest which was at one time in the not so distant past classified and punishable in state criminal codes really enjoy you thinking that way you are clearly capable of doing the math yourself while i do n't know the exact numbers i am totally confident that you will find in about 5 or 10 minutes if that long that eliminating debt of any kind in your life will pay an immediate return that beats the great majority of other investments in terms of risk reward after the immediate financial return there is a and even greater long term benefit basic principle highest rates first perhaps this decision could be considered slightly less important than deciding not to smoke during your youth but i would put it as a close second you are already in a position where you can see the damage that your prior decisions about financial debt have produced run the clock back to the time in your life when you were debt free now pay off that debt with the big check and start from zero now turn on your psychic powers and predict the same amount of time in the future with the same amount of money do n't even try to adjust for inflation just use flat dollars without losing the money which you have given to the financial institutions during this previous part of your life do you now see why the financial institutions want you to think about slowly paying them off instead of waking up tomorrow without owing them anything

granted this is an article on argentina 's debt but something that is not mentioned here is how vulture funds work it is my understanding that vulture funds purchase debt which is considered weak or on the verge of default at discounted prices with the sole intention of holding out on the debt and blocking any settlements until they can get significantly higher payment on their bonds than their original investment plus interest on the amount plus profits essentially then vulture funds sole purpose is to profit off financially distressed debtors so the court is ruling that all the shareholders who agree to the payout must wait until those shareholders that do not agree to the payout are those shareholders who bought their debt cheap from debt holders that   wanted to sell and get out while the getting out was good so much for the concept of risk or investing into the project that speculators and financiers out whenever they want to describe the benefits their activities bring to the economy

the problem would not only be that of kyle but also that of american express when kyle pays by credit card american express pays the bills out of their pockets on his behalf and then forwards the bill to kyle the issuer of a credit card takes the risk that the holder of the card wo n't pay the credit card bill in practice there are safeguards in place which prevent a company like ae to pay such huge sums in one day through an automated process credit card companies have sophisticated algorithms to determine unusual spending patterns and block any transactions which appear unusual also after a few billions their bank will likely block them and prevent them from paying any more bills but let 's play along and pretend these safeguards would n't exist that means after kyle 's spending spree american express will be trillions in debt with their main being a 10 year old boy who wo n't ever be able to pay kyle will have to declare personal bankruptcy there are various variants of in the us but they basically all boil down to him paying everything he can pay not much considering that he is 10 and then defaulting on his debt afterwards he is debt free that means the debt is now that of american express american express will not be able to pay that debt with their bank(s either so they will have to declare bankruptcy and default on their debt too this domino effect passes the burden on to the banks which can not carry a trillion level debt either a bank going bankrupt is a serious issue because it means they can not pay back any of the money in the saving accounts hold by companies or private people with them so the problem would return to those people kyle wanted to help in the first place also the collapse of one bank will often result in the collapse of further banks resulting in a collapse spiral destroying the whole world wide finance system nothing would be gained

first of all i did n't say anything about bitcoin nothing i said was even related to bitcoin but rather the inherent value of the market beyond a cryptocurrency   this market is at the beginning stages right now so of course you are going to have schemes and scammers why would n't you the established financial market as it stands today has been around for a while and still has schemes and scammers wherever there is money specifically amounts of money you will have people trying to game the system or pull the wool over other people 's eyes sometimes in life the sheep get slaughtered so i am not really sure why certain people losing their ass in crypto could be considered different from people losing their ass in other financial instruments you ever been to /r wallstreetbets   your basic view is more than likely developed from what you are reading in main stream outlets which is why i encouraged you to go beyond what you are reading in the easily accessible and often way behind and misinformed news sources and go straight to the updated and credible sources usually from the developers themselves   icos alone have proven themselves to be a new and revolutionary capital raising instrument it makes sense that traditional and conservative finance communities would be opposed to it because it their ecosystem and gives not only very new companies but non accredited investors an opportunity to participate when major vcs are able to look at icos which are in direct competition to their industry and purpose and say to themselves wow what an innovative way to raise capital that 's a big deal   regarding anonymity the purpose of most cryptocurrencies and protocols is n't focused on that it is usually a side effect of the decentralization of the ecosystem in general bitcoin is n't even a top coin for anonymity which is again why i suggested you research the industry   several projects are being launched and have been launched that will help revolutionize certain areas of the web ranging from predictive markets with projects like and to the network which taps into idle computer time for users that need additional computing power even something like which is essentially a social platform similar to reddit which utilizes its own token system so content creators within the ecosystem can receive monetary payment for their time and contribution to the site and the community from other users imagine instead of an upvote you received money   to reiterate we are at the beginning stages of seeing what is to come in the space many of these projects will fail and many new ones will launch as blockchain technology continues to grow not only individually but in tandem with the iot industry there are scenarios where machines are interacting bartering and negotiating with each other without human interaction or intervention to agree on payments for products and services and then conducting said payments

having all of the numbers you posted is a start it 's what you need to perform the calculation   the final word however comes from the company itself who are required to issue a determination on how the spin off is valued say a company is split into two instead of some number of shares of each new company imagine for this example it 's one for one i.e. one share of company a becomes a share each in company b and company c. this tell us nothing about relative valuation right was b worth 1/2 of the original company a or some other fraction say it is exactly a 50/50 split company a releases a statement that b and c each should have 1/2 the cost basis of your original a shares now b and c may very well trade ahead of the stock splitting as when issued shares at no point in time will b and c necessarily trade at exactly the same price and the day that b and c are officially trading with no more a shares they may have already in price that is there 's nothing you can pull from the trading data to identify that the basis should have been assigned as 50 to each new share this is my very long winded was of explaining that the company must issue a notice through your broker and on their investor section of their web site to spell out the way you should assign your basis to each new stock

it 's only a loss if you believe the purpose of indexes is to represent the basket of underlying companies with the highest returns   but that 's simply not true   an index is just a rules based way to track measure a thing   that thing could be the largest us companies all the companies in a specific sector all of the companies in the world a commodity or basket of commodities pretty much anything   somebody just has to write down the explanation of what an index tracks then create etfs to track the index   by being a passive investor you are still making active investing decisions to some degree in that you need to decide which indexes to passively invest in   if people are not going to attempt to understand the companies they invest in because they 're almost certainly better off indexing which is fine then the responsibility must fall on someone to make decisions about what are the best rules for the indexes   for most of the history of capital markets good corporate governance has been enforced by shareholders   if management did something bad shareholders could vote to replace the board of directors and in general they had tools to hold management accountable   only in recent years founders of companies like google facebook snap etc have attempted to this relationship public shareholders give a company money and in return the company must answer to the shareholders and essentially take money for nothing   so far it 's still a pretty short experiment this has worked as long as the share price is going up but what happens when it does n't   what happens when these companies screw up and stop performing well and there 's nothing shareholders can do about it   investors who intentionally own individual shares will have little to no leverage to demand change and passive investors would be stuck with some of their money in these companies with terrible governance and the precedent would only make dual class and non voting shares more attractive for future ipos making the problem more prevalent   if you think it is in your best interest to own the entire s&amp;p 500 plus snap then just do that   for every dollar you invest into spdr or something similar allocate something like $ 0.01 into snap   it 's that simple   but do n't make this out to be a story about how s&amp;p is anti free markets or doing a disservice to investors   that 's ridiculous   if most americans are just going to blindly put their retirement savings into index funds without bothering to understand them again which is fine then somebody needs to make sure the companies in said indexes are good companies   historically a company with zero corporate governance and entrenched management = /= a good company   s&amp;p realized this and decided to set a good precedent for us equity markets rather than a very bad precedent   you wanna buy shares with no voting rights   go for it   but that should be your decision not a default inclusion in major indexes

you can look at the company separately from the ownership the company needs money that it does n't have therefore it needs to borrow money from somewhere or go bankrupt   and if they ca n't get money from their bank then they can of course ask people related to the company like the two shareholders for a loan it 's a loan like every other loan that needs to be repaid how big the loan is does n't depend on the ownership but on how much money each one is willing and capable of giving the loan does n't give them any rights in the company except the right to get their money back with interest in the future   alternatively such a company might have 200 shares and might have given 75 to one owner and 25 to the other owner keeping 100 shares back in that case the shareholders can decide to sell some of these 100 shares i might buy 10 shares for $ 1,000 each so the company has now $ 10,000 cash and i have some ownership of the company about and the 75 and 25 shares have gone down because now they own 75 out of 110 or 25 out of 110 shares i wo n't get the $ 10,000 back ever it 's not a loan but the purchase of part of the company

when margin is calculated as the equity percentage of an account the point at which a broker will forcibly liquidate is typically called maintenance margin in the us this is 25 for equities to calculate the price at which this will occur the initial and maintenance margin must be known   the formula for a long with margin is and for a short where is the maintenance margin price is the initial margin price is the initial margin rate and is the maintenance margin rate   at an initial margin of 50 and a maintenance margin of 25 a long equity may fall by 1/3 before forced liquidation a short one may rise by 50 this calculation can become very complex with different asset classes with differing maintenance margins because the margin debt is applied to all securities collectively

many web sites and articles warn against buying former rental cars    because people renting these cars often them rental cars are typically driven by people over 25 these are typically people with some financial means air travel credit card additionally rental cars are subject to frequent inspection and likely to be on tighter maintenance schedules than many owners would keep so while some people may drive a rental harder than they would their own car it 's not typical and not likely to result in some hidden damage that makes a rental less desirable all else being equal on the used car market does the fact that they sell the car mean during this time suggest that they know the car 's cost of further maintenance or other costs will be higher or is there another reason they sell at this time which has a calculated advantage to them but which is less than idea statistically for me the purchaser rental companies buy at incredible volumes as such some manufacturers have programs where they will buy back used cars from the rental company at a set price and/or time other incentives are guaranteed depreciation wherein the manufacturer will make up the difference if the used vehicle does n't sell for a set percentage of it 's purchase price after a set amount of time outside of these incentive programs rental companies also get substantial volume discounts and they typically are buying base models which hold value better than their higher trim counterparts according to kbb market analyst so the conventional wisdom about depreciation does n't really apply the timing of their sales is primarily based on their purchasing arrangements and their desire to keep an up to date fleet not on projected maintenance repair costs the best you can do with any used car purchase is to test drive get a pre purchase inspection and review whatever history is available

as an expansion on the correct answer consider a really boring economy   nothing changes   wages and prices stay constant for years at a time   every month the consumer price index stays at 0    then something catastrophic happens say on july 31 2000 a cheap local source for a vital resource runs out and it must be obtained from a higher cost source   floods cut internal road networks resulting in higher transportation costs   whatever   the new situation is permanent as a result the next month august 2000 prices go up 5   that is 5 higher than the previous month july 2000 and 5 higher than a year previously august 1999 there is a lot of and politicians each promise that they and only they can inflation to the ground but when the figures for september 2000 come out inflation stays the same   prices are the same as in august 2000 and 5 higher than in september 1999 this goes on for months   nothing changes prices stay the same and the inflation rate year over year stays at 5 finally the figures for august 2001 come out   wonder of wonders   prices are the same as in august 2000 and inflation drops to zero    and the politicians all take the credit short version inflation year over year changes either because of what in now included in the month just past or what is now excluded from a year ago

intrinsic value is a myth   there is no such thing   subjective human demand is the only thing that gives anything value   this subjectivity is different person to person and can change very quickly historically there are two main uses for gold jewelry and money   how can you tell when a particular type of money is undervalued   it disappears from circulation since people prefer to use money that is overvalued   this phenomenon is paraphrased in 's law bad money drives out good money the coinage act of established the us dollar as grains of silver or grains of gold   this established a government ratio of 15 ounces of silver to 1 ounce of gold   in the late 18th century there was a large production of silver from mexico and the market ratio of silver to gold increased to to 1 by   the government ratio however was still 15 to 1   this was enough incentive for people to exchange their silver coins for gold coins at the government ratio melt the gold and sell the gold bullion overseas at the market value   thus gold coins disappeared from circulation as people either hoarded the gold or sent it abroad   people used the overvalued silver coins i.e. the bad money domestically and gold coins disappeared from the market in an attempt to correct the problem of disappearing gold coins the coinage act of was enacted   it kept the us dollar at grains of silver but changed the definition to grains of gold which established a government ratio of 16 to 1   this was close to the market ratio of gold to silver at the time so both gold and silver coins appeared in circulation again   the gold rush of produced a lot of gold and the market ratio of silver to gold became to 1   now gold was overvalued so people began exchanging their gold coins for silver coins at the government ratio melt the silver and sell the silver bullion overseas at the market value   people used the overvalued gold coins i.e. the bad money domestically and silver coins disappeared from the market when you see gold circulating everywhere you will know it is overvalued compared to other types of money   paper money always drives gold out of circulation since the market ratio of paper to gold severely under values gold source here

first off your commitment to paying down debt and apparent strong relationship with your brother is admirable however i think you are your situation and potentially your relationship by attempting to combine debts in this way you could consider a simple example where you have interest bearing at 5 and your brother has interest bearing debt at 10 if you both pay down his higher interest debt first and then both pay down your debt after then clearly you will have paid less interest combined but by waiting to pay off your debt until later you have accrued more interest yourself so who has saved money by doing this your brother you will have paid let 's say without getting into balances $ 50 extra interest to save your brother $ 70 in interest so why would you want to give your brother $ 50 total interest savings between both of you in this simplified example are $ 20 so in theory your brother could pay you $ 60 after the fact effectively meaning you end up $ 10 ahead and your brother ends up $ 10 ahead here you end up in a position where you could still say in theory we both came out ahead but what if your brother loses his job while you 're both paying off your debt and he ca n't help any more does he accrue some type of calculated interest until he pays you back what if he 's off work for 2 years and still owes you 30k what if he just never makes his payments to you on time at what point do you resent your brother for failing to uphold his end of the deal money and friends do n't mix money and family mixes even worse in rare circumstances where you absolutely must mix family and money get everything in writing get it signed make it legal outline all details of the transaction including interest rates and examples of how the balances calculate in 5 years when things go following the letter of the law is what will keep you from becoming enemies but with family often people have an expectation that while we agreed i would pay x he 's my brother so he should take pity on me and allow me to pay only y if i need to finally to your question about how to calculate amounts to pay it will be very complicated you will need to track minimum balance payments interest rates and even potentially the lost income which one of you gives up to pay down the other 's debt you could do these things in a simplified way close to what i 've set out above but then ultimately one of you will lose out if you pay down your debts first how can you calculate the lost living potential for your brother who might want to buy a house but ca n't save for a down payment for an extra year what if he has to move and without sufficient down payment he needs to pay extra mortgage insurance on his loan from the bank will you compensate him for that my recommendation if you have n't caught it yet is do not do this your potential savings are not going to be worth the potential of breaking your relationship with your brother   instead look at joining your minds not your money set goals for yourselves individually and hold each other accountable make this an open conversation between yourselves as it can be difficult to talk about finances with other people your support will help the other person and hopefully help keep you on track as well to provide numerical context for potential savings which you appear to still want consider the numbers you 've provided you have 40k debt at 10 your brother has 20k of debt at 5 let 's assume you each can pay up to 20k against the principal of your loans each year finally assume for simplicity that you also have enough to pay off interest as it gets charged so no compounding and you pay in even instalments each year mathematically that means your interest each year is equal to your interest rate your average annual balance if you each go alone then you will accrue 10 on an average balance of = 30k per year which equals 3,000 in interest in year 1 then = 10k .10 = 1,000 interest in year 2 total interest for you = 4,000 your brother will accrue = 10k .05 = 500 in interest in total total interest for both of you combined would be 4,500 if you pool your debt snowball then you will clear your debt first so the interest on your debt would be = 20k .1 = 2,000 your brother 's debt would fully accrue 5 of interest on the full balance in year 1 so interest in year 1 would be 20k .05 = 1,000 in year 2 your brother 's debt would be cleared half way through the year interest charged would be = 10k .05 50 = 250 you would then owe your brother 10k which you would pay him over the remainder of year 2 his total interest paid to the bank would be 1,000 + 250 = 1,250 total interest for both of you combined would be   in a simplified payment example using your numbers maximum interest savings would be about $ 1,250 combined how you allocate those savings would be pretty subjective assuming a 50:50 split this yields $ in savings to each of you if you are n't able to each save 20k per year then savings would be greater for snowballing because otherwise it will take you even longer to pay off your high interest debt this is similar to your brother loaning you 20k today that you can use to pay off your debts after which you pay him back so he can pay off his because you will owe him 20k for 2 years but an average of at any one time because he slowly advances it to you today and you slowly pay him back until the end of year 2 at $ 650 in benefit passed to your brother this is roughly equivalent to him loaning you money at 6.5 interest

being underwater a little is not all that scary but those who talk of being underwater are typically underwater by quite a lot   the amount of money they owe is large compared to their yearly income consider a metaphor   i put you in a hole   its only 1 foot deep   you 're not too concerned   if you want to leave you can step out of it   now we look at a deeper hole 3 feet   now you 're still not too concerned   you ca n't just walk out but if you need to get out you can wiggle your way up   6 feet   now you start getting nervous   climbing out is getting trickier and trickier   you may not be able to move in response to a changing around you because you 're stuck in a hole now make the hole 10 feet   now you ca n't reach the edges   now you 're in trouble   you have lost all mobility   you ca n't get out under your own power   now if something bad happens such as losing your job or a sudden health issue you ca n't move around to solve the problem this is the issue that arise from underwater mortgages   say you lose your job because the job market in your area dried up think detroit in the big auto manufacturer crash   you need to move   you are legally to a lender for your existing underwater house by more than you can sell it for   you need to pay for the privilege to sell it   you still owe payments on it so if you just buy a new house or rent in the new state you 're paying for twice as much property   you ca n't just shuffle the from your old house to your new house because the new lender has no interest in giving a loan for more than the value of the new home the only options you have to play with is renting the old house which many underwater families did or bankrupcy   if the area you were in is depressed you may not be able to rent the house for enough to cover your mortgage   this is the fear of being underwater   you have a piece of paper which claims some lender can take money from you that you may or may not have and that the us government will allow them to take your assets if need be to settle the score if you 're underwater by a few thousand it 's typically not a big deal   if you 're underwater by 80 or 90 thousand dollars which some people were that 's a lot of money to be for without the assets to recover them if you subscribe to the realtor story that the market will recover all you have to do is scrape by holding on until the market rises again   however those who are underwater recognize that the reason much of this occurred is that we entered a bubble because realtors kept saying the market could only go up   fool me once

many states have a simple method for assessing income tax on nonresidents   if you have $ x income in state a where you claim nonresident status and   $ y income overall then you owe state a a fraction x y of the income   tax that would have been due on $ y income had you been a resident of state a.   in other words compute the state income tax on $ y as per state a rules and send us x y of that amount   if you are a resident of state b then state b   will tax you on $ y but give you some credit for taxes paid to state a. thus you might be required to file a state a income tax return regardless of how small $ x is   as a practical matter many commercial real estate   investments are set up as limited partnerships in which most of the annual taxable income is a small amount of portfolio income usually interest income that you report on schedule b of form 1040 and the annual   bottom line is lots of passive losses which the limited partners report but do not get to deduct on the federal return   as a result state a is unlikely to come after you for the tax on say $ 100 of interest income each year because it will cost them more to go after you than they will   recover from you but when the real estate is sold there will hopefully be a big capital gain most of which   will be sheltered from federal tax since the passive losses finally get   to be deducted   at this point state a is not only owed a lot of money it knows nothing of your passive losses etc but after it processes the income tax return that you filed for that year it will likely demand that you file income tax returns for previous years as well

if you 're simply a futures speculator then yes it does seem like gambling if you 're a farmer producing a few thousand bushels of wheat futures can be a mechanism for you to hedge against certain kinds of market risk same if you 're running a heating oil company etc i just read somewhere that the bad spring weather in south dakota has prevented farmers from getting corn planted nothing is in the ground yet this is objective data from which you might infer that this year 's corn harvest could be late and/or smaller than normal so maybe if you 're a buyer for general mills you use corn futures to control your costs in this case you 'd have some idea based on experience what to expect for the price of corn what your production line requires for input how much you can charge for finished product etc these all factor in to the price you 'd be willing to pay for corn futures

you absolutely positively can land in jail in the united states of america for an unpaid non governmental debt in 2011 robin sanders was driving home when she saw the blue and red lights flashing behind her she knew she had not fixed her and believed that was why she was being pulled over she thought she might get a ticket instead sanders who lives in illinois was arrested and taken to jail as she was booked and processed she learned that she had been jailed because she owed debt $ to be precise related to an unpaid medical bill to her a collection agency had filed a lawsuit against her and having never received the notice instructing her to appear she had missed her date in court so a private company is able to the power of the state to arrest a person for a non criminal act being in debt

not perhaps practically useful but i found it conceptually useful to learn the basics of mathematical finance a way of describing financial markets via probability theory and stochastic processes it 's a little like trying to understand horse racing by studying horses rolling without friction in a vacuum but it does give you some ways of thinking that may be more appealing to someone with a math background for instance there 's the idea that shorting a stock is effectively owning negative shares option pricing is a common motivation there 's a brief introduction at the advanced undergraduate level in 's essentials of stochastic processes at the graduate level i liked williams introduction to the mathematics of finance

you can greatly reduce the risk if you can line up a buyer prior to purchasing the car   that kind of thing is common in business one example is drop shipping   also there are sales companies that specialize in these kinds of things bringing manufacturers of goods together with customers   the sales companies never take delivery of the product just a commission on the sales    from this the manufacturers are served as they have gained a customer for their goods   the buying company is served as they can make a better end product   the two parties may have not been brought together had it not been for the sales company so on some level both are happy to pay for the service can you find market inequalities and profit from them   sure   i missed a great opportunity recently   i purchased a name brand shirt from a discount store for $ 20   those shirts typically sell on ebay for $ 80   i should have cleaned out that store 's inventory and i bet someone else did as by the time i went back they were gone    that kind of thing was almost risk less because if the shirts did not sell i could simply return them for the full purchase price   that and i can afford to buy a few hundred dollars worth of shirts can you afford to float 45 k cdn   what if it takes a year to sell the car   what if the economy goes sour and you are left holding the bag   why are not car dealers doing exactly what you propose here in the us this type of thing is called horse trading and is very common   i 've both lost and made money on these kind of deals   i would never put a significant amount of my net worth at risk

if you have an s corp with several shareholders you probably also have a tax adviser who suggested using s corp to begin with   you 're probably best off asking that adviser about this issue if you decided to use s corp for multiple shareholders without a professional guiding you you should probably start looking for such a professional or you may get yourself into trouble that said and reminding you that 1 free advice on the internet is worth exactly what you paid for it and 2 i 'm not a tax professional or tax adviser you should talk to a ea cpa licensed in your state here 's this generally s corps are disregarded entities for tax purposes and their income flows to their shareholders individual tax returns through k-1 forms distributed by the s corp yearly the shareholders do n't have to actually withdraw the profits but if not withdrawing they 're added to their cost bases in the shares i 'm guessing your corp does n't distribute the net income but keeps it on the corporate account only distributing enough to cover the shareholders taxes on their respective income portion in this case the amount not distributed is added to their basis the amount distributed has already been taxed through k-1 if the corporation distributes more than the shareholder 's portion of net income then there can be several different choices depending on the circumstances the extra distribution will be treated as salary to the shareholder and a deduction to the corporation i.e. increasing the net income for the rest of the shareholders the extra distribution will be treated as return of investment reducing that shareholder 's basis in the shares but not affecting the other shareholders if the basis is 0 then it is treated as income to the shareholder and taxed at ordinary rates the extra distribution will be treated as buy back reducing that shareholder 's ownership stake in the company and reallocating the bought back portion among the rest of the shareholders in this case it is treated as a sale of stock and the gain is calculated as with any other stock sale including short term vs. long term taxation there 's also sec that can come in handy here the extra distribution will be treated as dividend this is very rare for s corp but can happen if it was a c corp before in that case it will be taxed as dividends note that options 2 3 and 4 subject the shareholder to the while option 1 subjects the shareholder to fica self employment tax and subjects the company to payroll taxes there might be other options your licensed tax adviser will go with you through all the facts and circumstances and will suggest the best way to proceed

this depends on if you 're talking secured credit card or prepaid debit card there is no separate category for secured credit cards in the list however it is possible some of them are classified as debit cards despite not being debit cards   you may want to check with the issuer to verify this and you can check the or the first 6 digits of the card number in the list i link to above to verify   however prepaid debit cards are debit cards and are less likely to be accepted for travel rental car hotel etc types of charges where a hold similar to a deposit is charged to the account this is one of the major differences between a prepaid card such as the kind you top up at the grocer and a secured credit card where you deposit some money but separately pay back the amount you charge on the card as a regular card secured cards are classified as credit cards while prepaid cards are debit cards as mhoran notes it 's possible your credit limit could be too low to allow a hotel airline or rental agency to allow a transaction but otherwise it should be fine

you mentioned that the that reports this sale is for 2014 which means that you got the proceeds in 2014 what i suspect happened was that the employer reported this on the next available paycheck thus reporting it in the 2015 period if this ends up being a significant difference for you i 'd argue the employer needs to correct both since you 've actually received the money in 2014 however if the difference for you is not substantial i 'd leave it as is and remember that the employer will not know of your espp sales until at least several days later when the report from the broker arrives if you sell on 12/31 you make it very difficult for the employer to account correctly since the report from the broker arrives in the next year

you 're not going to like this answer   you might be able to get out of the car you probably wo n't be able to get out of the loan   option 1 sell the car privately you 'll get more in a private sale and get a private loan for the difference between the sale price and what you owe   option 2 if you go to a dealership that advertises that they will take any trade no matter how much you owe they will roll your balance less your trade in value into your new loan so for example let 's say you buy a car for and borrow $ 20,000 the dealership gives you $ 6,000 for your trade because that 's what they do that leaves $ 9,000 on your loan and you will end up borrowing $ to buy a $ 20,000 car dealerships can be surprisingly accommodating but a lot of car buyers do n't understand the terms of what they 're getting into i actually knew someone a few years ago who left a dealership with a new car and could n't tell you anything about the deal beyond her monthly payment   option 3 hang on to the car and throw every extra penny at it to get the balance down on the loan until you can get it to the point where you can sell it trade it in or refi it without putting out a big one time cash payment

the car deal makes money 3 ways if you pay in one lump payment if the payment is greater than what they paid for the car plus their expenses they make a profit they loan you the money you make payments over months or years if the total amount you pay is greater than what they paid for the car plus their expenses plus their finance expenses they make money of course the money takes years to come in or they sell your loan to another business to get the money faster but in a smaller amount you trade in a car and they sell it at a profit of course that new transaction could be a lump sum or a loan on the used car they or course make money if you bring the car back for maintenance or you buy lots of expensive dealer options some dealers wave two deals in front of you get a 0 interest loan these tend to be shorter 12 months vs or even 72 months the shorter length makes it harder for many to afford if you ca n't swing the 12 large payments they offer you at x% loan for y years that keeps the payments in your budget pay cash and get a rebate if you take the rebate you ca n't get the 0 loan if you take the 0 loan you ca n't get the rebate the price you negotiate minus the rebate is enough to make a profit the key is not letting them know which offer you are interested in do n't even mention a trade in until the price of the new car has been finalized otherwise they will adjust the price rebate interest rate length of loan   and trade in value to maximize their profit the suggestion of running the numbers through a spreadsheet is a good one if you get a loan for 2 from your bank credit union for 3 years and the rebate from the dealer it will cost less in total than the 0 loan from the dealer the key is to get the loan approved by the bank credit union before meeting with the dealer the money from the bank looks like cash to the dealer

both a trust and an estate are separate legal entities just like any individual income earned by the trust or estate property e.g. rents collected from real estate is income earned by the trust or the estate who is liable for taxes on income earned by a trust depends on who receives or retains benefits from the trust who is liable for taxes on income received by an estate depends on how the income is classified i.e. income earned by the decedent income earned by the estate income in respect of the decedent or income distributed to beneficiaries generally trusts and estates are taxed like individuals general tax principles that apply to individuals therefore also apply to trusts and estates a trust or estate may earn income and may deduct certain expenses each is allowed a small exemption $ 300 for a simple trust $ 100 for a complex trust $ 600 for an estate however neither is allowed a standard deduction the tax brackets for income taxable to a trust or estate are much more compressed and can result in higher taxes than for individuals in short the trust should have been paying taxes on its gains all along when the money transfers to you it will be taxed as ordinary income

while it is a true loss as you 've determined is not a cash cost per se a cash cost would be a decrease in cash holdings   inflation does not take your cash balance it devalues it so it is an accrued loss central banks are extremely lazy in determining inflation so the highest resolution available at a public level is monthly   in the united states there is a small project that tries to calculate daily inflation rates and seems to do a decent job but unless if you are a customer of a particular financial institution you will suffer a lag   the small project refuses to make the data public in real time or even allow outside analysis in the uk the office for national statistics is responsible for consumer inflation statistics   the methodology is not readily available but considering the name it is most likely an inferior index instead of the optimal fisher index as it is in the us to calculate the accrued cost due to inflation simply multiply the amount of money held by the price index value at the beginning of the time held and divide by the price index value at the end of the time held for example to determine the amount of value lost since march 2014 multiply the money held by the price index value for march 2014 and divide by june 2014

from your question i believe that you are looking for what these mean in accounting terms and not the difference between a debit and a credit card i 'll deal with purchase and sale first as this is easier they are the same thing seen from different points of view if i sell something to you then i have made a sale and you have made a purchase every sale is a purchase and every purchase is a sale debits and credits are accounting terms and refer to double column accounting the most common accounting system used the way a set of accounts works is accounts are set up under the following broad the first 3 appear on the balance sheet so called because the accounts balance assets = liabilities + equity this is always a point in time snapshot of the accounts 1 june 2015 that last 3 appear on the profit and loss sheet profit or loss = income cost of goods sold expenses this is always an interval measure 1 july 2014 to 30 june 2015 changes in these accounts flow through to the equity part of the balance sheet when you enter a transaction the debits always equal the credits they are simply applied to different accounts debits increase assets cost of goods sold and expenses and decrease liabilities equity and income credits do the reverse for your examples 1 a customer buy something from me what is the debit and credit i will assume they pay $ 1,000 and the thing cost you $ 500 your cash asset goes up by $ 1,000 debit your inventory asset goes down by $ 500 credit your sales revenue income goes up by $ 500 credit this gives you a profit of $ 500 2 a customer buy something of worth 1000 but gives me 500 what is      debit and credit your cash asset goes up by $ 500 debit your debtors asset goes up by $ 500 your inventory asset goes down by $ 500 credit your sales revenue income goes up by $ 500 credit this also gives you a profit of $ 500 3 if i buy a product from supplier worth 1000 and pay equally what is credit and debit i assume you mean pay cash your cash asset goes down by $ 1000 credit your inventory asset goes up by $ 1000 debit there is no profit or loss here you have swapped one asset cash for another inventory 4 if i buy a product from supplier worth 1000 and do n't pay what is credit and debit your creditors liability goes up by $ 1000 credit your inventory asset goes up by $ 1000 debit there is no profit or loss here you have gained an asset inventory but incurred a liability creditors the reason for confusion is that most people only see debits and credits in one place their bank statement your bank statement is a journal of one of the banks liability accounts its their liability because they owe the money to you even loan accounts adopt this convention credits happen when you give money to the bank they credit   your account increase a liability and debit their cash balance increase an asset debits are when they give money to you they debit your account decrease a liability and credit their cash balance decrease an asset if at the end of the period you have a credit balance then they owe money to you a debit balance means you owe money to them if you were keeping a book of accounts then your record of the transactions would be a mirror image of the bank 's because you would be looking at it from your point of view

to add to mrchrister 's answer   canada also has a consumer price index cpi used to measure inflation that is distinct and separate from that maintained by the united states there are differences in inflation between the u.s. and canada because our currencies are different and there may be different items in the basket of goods that constitutes the index you can find current information on the canadian cpi at statistics canada here latest release from the consumer price index also the bank of canada our central bank maintains a free online inflation calculator   the boc 's inflation calculator is handy because you can enter a dollar amount for a past date and it will figure out what that would be in today 's dollars   for instance $ 100 in 1970 dollars had the same purchasing power under the cpi as $ in 2009 dollars and you 're right if you get a salary increase that is less than the rate of inflation then in theory you have lost purchasing power   so anybody really looking for a raise ought to make an effort to get more than the increase in cpi   of course some employers are counting on you not knowing that because any increase that 's less than cpi is effectively a salary decrease which could mean more profit for them if they are able to increase their prices revenues at inflation or better finally consider that salary wage increases also contribute to inflation   perhaps you 've heard of the wage price inflation spiral   if you have n't there 's more on that here and here

the only ways to increase your after tax income are to increase your tax deferred savings 401k increase your tax deductions or increase your pre tax income increasing tax deferred savings is great for the long term but will usually not result in a bigger paycheck though net pay including the savings will go up this is however probably your best bet for reducing current tax liability increasing deductions usually involves spending money on charity mortgage interest other taxes etc so while you may reduce your tax liability you probably wo n't end up with more money in your pocket also if you are single and are n't paying a mortgage it probably wo n't be easy to exceed the standard deduction which pretty much leaves you with asking for a raise getting a better paying job or taking on a second job to increase your top line income

gt;i'm curious to know if you or any of your relatives have ever been declared as being mentally ill or having a psychological disorder    there are but only a handful some valid mental illnesses but by and large the is filled with little more than social scams   and as far as anecdotes i have known quite a few people who have been diagnosed with a wide variety of so called disorders most of them are quite happy to accept the label as it can then be used as a justification for their behavior and/or for claiming benefits and no one ever said that psychology was n't a useful fraud a lot of people believe and think it to be quite useful just as a lot of other people think is   gt;if most of psychology is all bs then that just makes everyone else stupid for spending all of their money to get treated and really if we are that stupid stupid enough to believe such a huge lie i would then agree with the 25 of americans suffer from mental illness statement because you have to be pretty stupid to be told such a huge lie and not figure it out    and whoever claimed that the majority of the human population were anything but easily duped idiots   i certainly never have   thing if it is so easy to tell that psychology is a scam then why is there in general cross from physics biology history language medicine etc acceptance of psychology as a science    chiefly because the majority of people in those other sciences even the hard sciences are rather dumb and easily duped themselves most are who have only rote knowledge of their own fields and just as with religions psychology offers a mixture of theoretical bases that they accept or reject on an ad hoc anecdotal basis mostly without even any superficial investigation much less anything more thorough and in the cases where someone has investigated the claims theories the are often very easily debunked cf john work   add in that many drugs amp substances which pre existed psychology amp are in fact effective in changing thoughts and behaviors duh that 's like saying water is wet and which have become the main tool and then via a pragmatic used to create a causal theoretical basis the whole brain chemical imbalance even though there is no objective evidence to validate the theory beyond the affect of the drugs which can not be independent evidence since that would be like saying the reason water is wet is because of it 's properties

agree with the previous posts the question is poorly worded     clark howard does say you really need to be getting 90 back in the mortgage payment   remember that what ever your paying in principle a month is adding to your net worth and every month that gets you a little more money than the last payment    also this is a good hedge on inflation and at some point within a few years you will be at break even

according to the new york attorney general 's tenants rights guide landlords regardless of the number of units in the building    must treat the deposits as trust funds belonging to their tenants and they may not co mingle deposits with their own money landlords of buildings with six or more apartments must    put all security deposits in new york bank accounts earning    interest at the prevailing rate each tenant must be informed    in writing of the bank ’s name and address and the amount of    the deposit so you have to keep it separate you ca n't spend it and if you own more than six units you have to put it in a bank account   the guide goes on to explain that the interest should be paid to the tenant

this scheme does n't work because the combination of corporation tax even the lower tax plus the personal income tax does n't give you a tax advantage not on any realistic income i 've ever worked it out on anyway   prior to the 2014 tax year on lower incomes you could scrape a bit of an advantage but the 2013 budget changed the calculation for the tax credit on non eligible dividends so there should n't be an advantage anymore moreover if you were to do it this way by paying corporation tax instead of cpp you are n't eligible for cpp if you sit with a calculator for long enough you may figure out a way of saving $ 200 or something small but it 's a lot of paperwork for little if any benefit and you would n't get cpp i understand the money multiplier effect described above but the tax system is designed in a way that it makes more sense to take it as salary and put it in a tax deferred saving account i.e. an rrsp so there 's no limit on the multiplier effect like i said sit with a calculator if you 're earning a really large amount and are still under the small business limit it may make more sense to use a but that is the case regardless of using it as a tax shelter because if you 're earning a lot you 're probably running a business of some size the main benefit i think is that if you use a you can carry forward your losses but you have to be aware of the definition of an allowable business investment loss

the difference is that yahoo is showing the unadjusted price that the security traded for on that date while google is adjusting for price splits this means that google is showing how much you would have had to pay to get what is now one share since 1979 jnj has split once and 2-for-1 four times = 48 if you bought 1 share at that time you would now have 48 shares today yahoo is showing a price of $ 66 for what was then 1 share $ = which google rounds to you can see this if you get the prices from may 14 21 1981 the stock split and the price dropped from 108 to yahoo 's adjusted close column has not been accurate since they re wrote the finance website it now just represents the closing price the other relevant field on yahoo is the adj close this adjusts for splits but also adjusts for dividends hence why this does n't match either the google or yahoo numbers

i think you are approaching this question the wrong way the interest rate is not the most important consideration you also need to consider the other characteristics of the investment money in a bank account is very liquid you can do anything you want with it equity in a house is very illiquid it is hard and expensive to access let 's say you have $ 25,000 to either go towards a bigger downpayment or to invest what happens if you lose your job if you have $ 25,000 in the bank you have a lot of flexibility you can pay a mortgage for a number of months or you could use it to relocate if you put the money in the house you can not access it at all without a job you ca n't refi or get a home equity loan your only recourse would be to sell the house which might not be possible if there are systemic issues such as the ones in the real estate crash even if you can refi or get a home equity loan you will have to pay fees my advice is to put the money somewhere else if your term is long say 10 years or so i would put the money in an index fund

there are basically two ways to get value out of an appreciating asset such as a home a sell it and take the profit in the case of a home you presumably still have to live somewhere so unless you buy a cheaper home to replace it this does n't get you anywhere if you can get another house that is just as nice and in just as nice a location whatever you consider nice to be than this sounds like a winning option if it means moving to a less desirable home then you are getting the cash but losing the nice home you 'll have to decide if it 's worth it b use it as collateral for a loan in this case that means a second mortgage home equity loan or a home equity line of credit but this can be dangerous house prices are very volatile these days if the value of the house falls you could be stuck with debts greater than your assets in my humble opinion you should be very careful about doing this borrowing against your house to send the kids to college or pay for your spouse 's life saving operation may be reasonable borrowing against your house to go on a fancy vacation is almost surely a bad idea the vacation will be over within a couple of weeks but you could be paying off the debt for decades

you did n't put what country you 're in so i 'll work off the basis you 're in the united states i think you 're going to have a very hard time accomplishing what you 're talking about after such an extraordinary amount of time   one has to assume that there would still be records that could be retrieved in order for anyone to determine the amount you 'd have to pay and after 40 years the paper records would be long gone   it 's possible there might be somewhere but i would n't have a clue how easy or possible it would be for it to be retrieved    i assume you 're wanting to repay this as a way to boost social security or other government benefits in your retirement but it 's really hard to say whether repaying the money would make much if any difference    this is really something you 'll have to contact the irs about but unless they are trying to collect funds from you that they say you owe then it 's highly unlikely they have any record of what you 're asking about and they probably do n't even have a mechanism for accepting and crediting such monies   the real issue here is the amount of time that has passed because there would be little compelling reason for the government to keep detailed records they perhaps maintain summaries but little else for extended periods   we all have the impression the government knows all and never forgets but that simply is n't the case

it 's not possible to determine whether you can expect a refund or whether you are claiming the right number of exemptions from the information given    if your wife were not working and you did not do independent contracting then the answer would be much simpler   however in this case we must also factor in how much your contracting brings in since you must pay income tax on that as well as medicare and probably social security whether you are filing jointly or separately and your wife 's income from her business    there are also other factors such as whether you 'll be claiming certain child care expenses and certain tax credits which may phase out depending on your income    if you can accurately estimate your total household income for the year and separate that into income from wages contracting and your wife 's business as well as your expenses for things like state and local income and property taxes then you can make a very reasonable estimate about your total tax burden including the self employment taxes on your non wage income and then determine whether you are having enough tax withheld from your paycheck   some people may find that they should have additional tax withheld to compensate for these expenses see irs w-4 line 6

this is a extremely complicated subject but i assume you want a very simple answer otherwise i 'm not qualified to answer the value of most currencies is closely tied to the economy of the county so if china were to print a huge amount of yuan then since the value of their economy has not really changed the international currency markets would devalue the yuan to compensate this is rather like if have shares in say apple and they were to issue an extra billion shares then the value of your shares would fall by half rather than for apple to be suddenly be worth twice as much print too many notes and your currency basically becomes almost worthless which is what happened to the dollar i like the idea of china skipping loads of actual yuan or dollars notes to america but in practice the borrowing is just a paper exercise rather like an iou as to whether america owes yuan or dollars the answer is whatever has been agreed assuming the currencies are fairly stable then since each country has more control over their own currency it is natural for them to prefer their own currency however if america believes the value of the dollar will increase they may prefer to pay back in yuan costing them less dollars and if china believes the value of the dollar will decrease they may agree to that

the question you are asking concerns the exercise of a short option position   the other replies do not appear to address this situation suppose that apple is trading at $ 96 and you sell a put option with a strike price of $ 95 for some future delivery date say august 2016   the option contract is for 100 shares and you sell the contract for a premium of $ 3.20 when you sell the option your account will be credited with the premium and debited with the broker commission   the premium you receive will be $ 320 = 100 x $ 3.20   the commission you pay will depend on you broker now suppose that the price of apple drops to $ 90 and your option is exercised either on expiry or prior to expiry   then you would be obliged to take delivery of 100 apple shares at the contracted option strike price of $ 95 costing you $ 9,500 plus broker commission   if you immediately sell the apple shares you have purchased under your contract obligations then assuming you sell the shares at the current market price of $ 90 you would realise a loss of $ 500 = plus commission   since you received a premium of $ 320 when you sold the put option your net loss would be $ = $ 180 plus any commissions paid to your broker now let 's look at the case of selling a call option   again assume that the price of apple is $ 96 and you sell a call option for 100 shares with a strike price of $ 97 for a premium of $   the premium you receive would be $ 360 = 100 x $   you would also be debited for commission by your broker now suppose that the price of apple shares rises to $ 101 and your option is exercised   then you would be obliged to deliver 100 apple shares to the party exercising the option at the contracted strike price of $ 97   if you did not own the shares to effect delivery then you would need to purchase those shares in the market at the current market price of $ 101 and then sell them to the party exercising the option at the strike price of $ 97   this would realise an immediate loss of $ 400 = 100 x $ plus any   commission payable   if you did own the shares then you would simply deliver them and possibly pay some commission or a delivery fee to your broker   since you received $ 360 when you sold the option your net loss would be $ 40 = $ plus any commission and fees payable to the broker it is important to understand that in addition to these accounting items short option positions carry with them a margin requirement   you will need to maintain a margin deposit to show good faith so long as the short option position is open   if the option you have sold moves against you then you will be called upon to put up extra margin to cover any potential losses

that makes sense though since i live in a small town with few tech jobs available and glassdoor is a good deciding factor when the very little that is available offer little return compared to bigger cities i am not comfortable moving to the big city just yet since i have n't established myself in the field and competing in a big industrialized city does n't assure that i will find a job easy lemon from where i am just yet therefore it 's good to stick around and find something to build experience i am just hoping to do it before the tech market and these jobs either become scarce or are n't very profitable anymore since public schools and community efforts offer coding classes and seminars in several cities and communities in hopes of retraining people when this specialized skill becomes that common it might become as valuable as fast food cashiers since everyone wants to learn i do n't want to compete in a market in that state it 's all very scary but there are several people on the internet convincing people to not go to college i live in a town that takes this advice and i know there are several hundred more like it so i have that going for me    anyway glassdoor does effect smaller businesses that have no benefits and just a non standardized work cultures basically it 's a bit of a toss up on how you will be treated in a small company since unlike google do n't list their terms and conditions plus their policies on their website if they have one and if they bother i know big corporations might not need to worry about glassdoor reviews unless they work in chapters rather than having a huge hq in one place that hires thousands i would imagine a small business has more to be afraid of when it comes to glass door brand wise

many partnership agreements include a shotgun clause one person sets a price the other can either buy at that price or sell at it it 's rather brutal you can make offers that you know are less than the company is worth if you 're sure the other person will have to take that money from you say if you know they ca n't run the company without you   he has asked for $ x to be bought out and failing that he would like to keep owning his half and send his wife who may very well be competent but who among other things has a very ill husband to deal with to take his place if he can occasionally contribute to the overall vision and she can do the day to day then keeping things as they are may be the smart move but if that 's not possible it does n't mean you have to buy him out for twice what you think it 's worth   in the absence of a partnership agreement it 's going to be hard to know what to do but one approach might be to pretend there is a shotgun clause ask him if he thinks half the company is worth $ x if he 's willing to buy you out for that price and have his wife run it without you he is likely to out that it is n't worth that and she ca n't do that   and at that point you 'll actually be negotiating

when you create a liability account with an opening balance this creates a transaction to the account equity opening balance   you really want this transaction to be an expense i would delete the test account and the transactions you have made so far and start again   make a liability account call it liabilities overdue cable bill or something similar instead of the test with an opening balance of 0 and create a transaction dated which debits liabilities overdue cable bill showing up in the right hand column as a charge and credits expenses cable in the left hand column as an expense   to check that the sign is right liabilities overdue cable bill should now have a positive balance because money is owed   this indicates that you spent money you did n't have on cable and now you owe the cable company when you pay off the debt make a transaction that debits right column assets cash in wallet   and credits liabilities overdue cable bill left column   now you should have a reduced balance in assets cash in wallet and a zero balance in liabilities overdue cable bill and the entry in expenses cable is still there to indicate where the money went this assumes you paid the bill in cash from your wallet if you paid it by check or bank transfer or something else you probably want to substitute assets cash in wallet with assets checking account or whatever is appropriate

see if the bank has other credit cards they offer many banks have multiple ones some cards have great benefits others do not some cards have high rates some do not some cards are secured some do not   if they have a card that you like ask them to switch you to the card you want they should be able to do so very easily your card number will change but they will treat it is a replacement so that your credit score will not take a hit during the switch it may be possible to get them to waive the annual fee but most wo n't because each card type they offer are separate products so they only allow you to pick one of their options if they do n't have a card to your liking apply for a card from anther bank that has the benefits and annual fees zero that you are looking for it may be that the new card will start with a lower limit but it will increase over time especially as you shift more of your business to the new card when you cancel the old card before the next year rolls around you will take a small short hit to your credit score but that is ok

ok fair enough but you did say a large part of their barrier to entry is government in relation to general industry in defense of your earlier statement that monopolies can rarely exist without one or two things government support or limited geographic area   my contention is that regulation can present a barrier to entry but this is not nearly as large a barrier as size and barriers due to size is the primary reason for monopolies or oligopolies in recent times   if you do n't want to use the aircraft industry as an example let 's use amazon itself amazon is cleaning everyone 's clocks whatever you try and sell if it is available on amazon a smaller player will not be able to compete with them except on the edges their market share continues to increase they own 43 of all us online retail   why does n't someone just start up and compete with them why are n't there 10 12 different competitors to amazon   now clearly amazon got a head start they were among the first to shift into the non specialized internet retail market pets.com only sold pet food whereas amazon now sells everything there is no arguing that they do things very well and have advanced the area of online sales   but they are now without competition and will not have significant competition unless they badly and even then they may not have competition see ebay which now sucks but still has no real competition   when i look at changing sectors in my general geographic area i see massive up sizing coupled with a lack of new entries into the sector i 'll give a few examples   auto dealers i had a relative who owned a dealership in the 70s just one he did ok from it now most of the dealerships are owned by people who own somewhere between 5 and 15 different dealerships    gas stations i had a relative who owned a gas station again just one there were lots of these guys around now most of the gas stations are owned by 2 or 3 conglomerates who own many dozens of stations   banks yes regulation is in play here but there used to be dozens of different banks in my region now there are maybe 2 regional banks and 3 national banks gone are the days when there was one bank that had 2 3 branches even credit unions are consolidating   hardware stores we are down to home depot lowe 's and a regional chain that has 20 30 stores no independent guys   grocery stores my region has exactly two full service grocery store chains plus maybe 2 discount chains when i was a kid there were 10 different regional chains in the area    not the best example but video stores there used to be 10 12 different mom and pop stores which consolidated into two blockbuster hollywood video which got crushed by netflix smart tvs have allowed for there to be more players in the on demand world but the level of skill needed to enter this area can not be more different between the initial mom and pop video store and the world of online content delivery   the list goes on and on consolidation is the name of the game and when a market the average person can no longer enter it as it further the above average person can no longer enter it and when it gets to a certain point no one can enter it that has harmed the economy because people have stopped playing the game because they know they ca n't win they ca n't compete with the big boys   now i do n't know what to do about this but my observation is that this has accelerated in the past 30 years i think that technology has accelerated it but i also think that tax code and lack of anti trust enforcement has also accelerated it i would put my bet on tax code as the 1 culprit tax code has made it attractive for people to try and earn tens of millions of dollars per year there is truth to the conservative claim that if the tax rates are too high people will not work as hard that 's not necessarily a bad thing though markets are driven by demand and at any point in time they have a finite demand a total size if there is $ 15 million worth of demand for hardware in a region that demand can either be satisfied by one massive global corporation or by 15 $ 100k small businesses or by 30 $ 50k small businesses    there can be an advantage to one massive global corporation cheaper prices higher quality but there can also be a downside which is eventually higher prices less innovation and even lower quality plus the downside of the elimination of opportunity for the 30 people who would serve that demand if the massive corporation did not exist opportunities which turned over every so often due to businesses closing due to retirement or even incompetence    i do not think that tax code innovation though because people innovate for passion not for money steve jobs and steve wozniak founded apple when the top tax rate was 70 they did it because they wanted to make computers not because they wanted to make money i think that a high tax rate would stifle the relentless pursuit of more dollars by using existing dollars to consolidate sectors

the question that i walk away with is what is the cost of the downside protection disclaimer i do n't sell anything i am not a fan of insurance as an investment with rare exceptions i 'll stop there all else is a tangent there 's an appeal to looking at the distribution of stock returns it looks a bit like a bell curve with a median at 10 or so and a standard deviation of 15 or so this implies that there are some number of years on average that the market will be down and others about 2/3 up now you wish to purchase a way of avoiding that negative return and need to ask yourself what it 's worth to do so   the insurance company tells you a 2 off the top i.e. no dividends and b we will clip the high end over 9.5   i then am compelled to look at the numbers knowing that your product ca n't be bought and sold every year it 's appropriate to look at rolling returns the annual returns i see and the return you 'd have in any period i start with 1900 2012 i see an average 9.8 with std of 5.3 remember the 10 year rolling will do a good job pushing the std down the return the insurance would give you is an average 5.4 with std of .01 you 've bought your way out of all risk but at what cost   from 1900 2012 my dollar grows to $ yours to $ for much of the time treasuries were higher than your return much higher   it 's interesting to see how often the market is over 10 for the year clip too many of those and you really lose out   from 1900 2012 i count 31 negative years ouch but 64 years over 9.5 the 31 averaged the 64   the illusion of market gains is how this product is sold long term they lag safe treasuries

your initial plan of minimizing your interest rate and taking advantage of the 401(k match makes sense except i would put the 401(k money in a very low risk investment such as a money market fund while the stock market seems to be in a bear market   how to decide when the stock market is in a bear market is a separate question you earn a 100 return immediately on money that receives the company match provided that you stay at the company long enough for the company match to vest   this immediate 100 return far exceeds the 3.25 return by paying down debt as long as it makes sense to keep your retirement funds in low risk low return investments it makes more sense to use your remaining free cash flow to pay down debts than to save extra money in retirement funds after setting aside the 6 of your income that is eligible for the company match you should be able to rapidly pay down your debts   this will make it far easier for you to qualify for a mortgage later on   also if you can pay off your debt in a couple years you will minimize your risk from the proposed variable rate   first there will be fewer chances for the rate to go up   second even if the rate does go up you will not owe the money very long

this is a stress period much like the 1930s and 1970s at a time like this it is smart to be debt free and to have money saved for the likely emergencies there are growth periods like those of the 1980s and 1990s probably returning in the and at such times it makes sense to play it a little looser and borrow money for investments but the first order of business in answering this question is to look around you and figure out what is going on in the world stress or growth

cosigning is explicitly a promise that you will make the payments if the primary signer can not do n't do it unless you are able to handle the cost and trust the other party will make you whole when they can which means do n't do it for anyone you would not lend your money to since it comes out to about the same level of risk having agreed you 're sorta stuck with your ex friend 's problem i recommend talking to a lawyer about the safest way get out of this it is n't clear you can even sue the ex friend at this point

for simplicity let 's start by just considering cash back in general cash back from credit cards for personal use is not taxable but for business use it is taxable sort of i 'll explain later the reason is most personal purchases are made with after tax dollars you typically are n't deducting the cost of what you purchased from your personal income so if you purchase something that costs $ 100 and you receive $ 2 back from the cc company effectively you have paid $ 98 for that item but that would n't affect your tax bill however since businesses typically deduct most expenses that same $ 100 deduction would have only been a $ 98 deduction for business tax purposes so in this case the $ 2 should be accounted for note you should not consider that $ 2 as income though that would artificially inflate your revenue it should be treated as a negative expense similar to how you would handle returning an item you purchased and receiving a cc refund now for your specific questions part 1 as a small business owner i wish to attend an annual seminar to improve my business i have enough credit card reward points to cover the airfare hotel and rental car will those expenses still be deductible at the value displayed on the receipt effectively no these expenses are not deductible if you deduct them they will be completely counter acted by the refund you receive for the payments part 2 does it matter if those points are accrued on my personal credit card rather than a business credit card this is where it gets hairy suppose your company policy is that employees make purchases with their own personal credit cards and submit receipts for reimbursement in this case the employer can simply reimburse and would not know or care if the employee is racking up rewards points cashback the trick is as the employee you must always purchase business related items normally so you have receipts to show and if you receive cashback on the side there seems to be a do n't ask do n't tell rule that the irs is ok with it works the same way with heavy business travelers and airline the free vacations those users get as perks are not treated as taxable income however i would not go out of my way to abuse this loophole typically things like travel airfare hotel car rental meals are expected but i would n't go purchase 100 company laptops on your personal card and ask the company to reimburse you the company should purchase those 100 laptops on a company card and effectively reduce the sale price by the cashback received or more realistically negotiate a better discount with your account rep and just cut them a check part 3 would there be any difference between credit card points and brand loyalty points if the rental car were paid for with points earned directly on the rental car company 's loyalty system not a cc would that yield a different result there is no difference perhaps the simplest way to think about this is you can only deduct an expense that you actually incur in other words the expense should show up on a bank or cc statement this is why when you volunteer and work 10 hours for a charity you ca n't call that a donation of any amount of money because there is no actual payment made that would show up on a bank statement instead you could have billed the charity for your 10 hours of work and then turned around and donated that same amount back to them but it ends up being a wash

to expand on @joetaxpayer 's answer the devil is actually in the fine print all   the credit card checks that i have ever received in the mail explicitly says that the checks can not be used to pay off   or pay down the balance on any other credit card issued by the same bank whether the card is branded with the bank logo or is branded with a department store or airline logo etc the checks can be used to pay utilities or even taxes without paying the service fee that is charged for using a credit card for such payments the payee is paid the face amount of the check in contrast to charges on a credit card from a merchant who gets to collect only about of the amount on the   charge slip generally speaking balance transfer offers are a bad deal regardless    of whether you pay only the minimum amount due each month or whether    you pay each month 's statement balance in full by the due date or    anything in between the rest of this answer is an explanation in support of the above assertion feel free to tl;dr it if you like if you make only the minimum payment due each month and some parts of the balance that you are carrying has different interest rates applicable than other parts then your payment can be applied to any part of the balance at the bank 's discretion it need hardly be said that the bank invariably chooses to apply it to pay off the lowest rate portion by law card act of 2009 anything above the minimum payment due must be applied to pay off the highest rate part and then the next highest rate part etc but minimum payment or less is at the bank 's discretion as an illustration suppose that you are not using your credit cards any more and are paying down the balances due by making the minimum payment due each month suppose also that you have a balance of $ 1000 carrying 12 apr on card a and pay off the entire balance of $ 500 on card b transferring the amount at 0 apr to card a for which you are billed a 2 fee your next minimum payment   will be likely be $ 35 computed as $ 10 interest on $ 1000 + $ 10 transfer fee + $ 15 1 of balance of $ 1500 if you make only the minimum payment due that payment will go towards paying off the $ 500 and so for next month your balance will be $ 1500 of which $ will be charged 1 interest and $ will be charged 0 interest   in the months   that follow the balance on which you owe 1 interest per month will grow and the 0 balance will shrink   you have to pay more than the minimum amount due to reduce the amount that you owe in this example in the absence of the balance transfer the minimum payment would have been $ 20 = $ 10 interest on $ 1000 at 1 per month + $ 10 1 of balance and would have left you with $ 990 due for next month   to be at the same point with the balance transfer offer you would need to pay $ 30 more than the minimum payment of $ 35 due this extra $ 30 will pay off the interest and transfer fee $ 20 and the rest will be applied to the $ 1000 balance to reduce it to $ 990 there would be no balance transfer fee in future months and so the extra that you need to pay will be a little bit smaller etc if you avoid paying interest charges on credit cards by never taking any cash advances and by paying off the monthly balance   consisting only of purchases made within the past month in full by the due date then the only way to avoid paying interest on the purchases made during the month of the balance transfer offer is to pay off that month 's statement in full including the balance just transferred over and the balance transfer fee by the due date   so depending on when in the billing cycle the transfer occurs you are getting a loan of the balance transfer amount for 25 to 55 days and being charged 2 or 3 for the privilege if you are getting offers of 2 balance transfer fees instead of 3 you are probably among those who pay their balances in full each month and the bank is trying to tempt you into doing a balance transfer by offering a lower fee it is unlikely that they will make a no transfer fee offer they would prefer laughing all the way to themselves by collecting a 2 transfer fee from you and possibly interest too if you fail to read the fine print than having you decline such offers at 3 as being too expensive can you make a balance transfer offer work in your favor sure   do n't make any purchases on the card in the month of the balance transfer or during the entire time that the 0 apr is being offered in the month of the transfer pay the minimum balance due plus the balance transfer fee in succeeding months pay the minimum balance due typically 1 of the balance owed each month all of it will go to reducing the 0 apr balance because that is the only amount owing just before the 0 apr expires anywhere from 6 to 24 months pay off the remaining balance in full   but remember that you are losing the use of this card for this whole period of time put it away in a locked trunk in the attic because using the card to make a purchase will mean paying interest on charges from the day they post something that might be totally alien to you

my opinion including the value of depreciating property one owns in a net worth calculation is silly but could be interesting you do n't expect your tv or laptop to gain value   instead you expect them to decrease in value every year until you replace them   anything you expect to hold or increase in value art a house etc is a different story if you 'd like to really get anal about this you can track your net worth like a business would track its balance sheet   i 'm not going to go into detail but the general idea is that when you purchase an item you debit the cost from cash and add the value paid to assets so your net worth does n't change when you make a purchase    you then depreciate the value of the item under assets according to a depreciation schedule   if you plan on replacing your laptop every three years you might subtract 33 of the value every year    this could be an interesting exercise i.e. even if you make money your net worth may decrease because of all the depreciating junk you own but my hunch is that it would n't be worth the effort it requires

costco requires an annual paid membership before you can enter and the the minimum price of any purchase is greater than at other stores because you are getting large bulk of that item   starbucks charges several dollars for a cup of coffee not an essential item   in both cases their clientele are the middle classes not the less well off members of society   consequently it makes business sense for them to pay staff such that are they are substantially similar to the customers   but walmart does serve the less well off   and their management is n't stupid if they believed a doubling of wages would result in greater sales and profitability they would do it in an heartbeat   but it wo n't   and i 'll bet walmart 's customers and employees are as similar to each other as costco 's customers and employees are to each other     walmart 's effects on prices is well   every cent they save customers is a cent those customers can put towards other things or prolong how long a particular amount of money will last   there are numerous claims about them lowering the effects wal mart   so changing nothing else increasing employee wages would decrease customer savings   we could make the cost of living for employees be less by reducing the costs of housing rather than every time house prices go up   and if you believe everyone should have healthcare then ensure everyone has it   if you believe it should be provided via employers along with a bizarre insurance industry a rather peculiar then just make that mandatory in the law   and finally for all the who believe it can be done better go ahead and do so   it is always easier to advocate how and what others should do if walmart are getting it so wrong then show everyone the right way

one wonders where the author thinks the monies for the generous boomer pension payouts will come from   and of course they utterly ignore the fact that things like 401k 's and ira 's require that a person begin at a progressive rate after one hits age 70 1/2   yes post retirement fund sales minus the taxes on the proceeds of course which taxes are not to be ignored these people could turn the entire remainder of those monies back around and then re invest them back into the stock market as non tax deferred retail stock purchasers but that is pretty unlikely to happen   in addition the boomers as a generation have become accustomed to a far higher lifestyle newer cars larger amp fancier homes more vacations etc than the previous and so just as with many other things where boomers broke the mold relying the the data from those generations as an economic model of how much wealth retirees tend to cash in and how they spend versus what they sit on and hoard for their heirs may be rather foolish somewhat akin to building an economic model on 20 years of data that americans do n't default on their mortgages yeah that turned out to not be very wise   and then finally i wonder if this author really the meaning of the phrase at the margin after all everyone in a neighborhood does n't have to default on their mortgage to drive house prices down in fact all it takes is a lack of buyers and prices can not be sustained   so the problem with the boomer en masse retirement is not just the possibility that they will all sell everything at the same time but rather that the demographic bulge will at a certain tipping point change from buyer hoarders to sellers and that inevitably will have a major affect on the float and thus the prices of stocks and just as inevitably at some stage of that change herd behavior even panicked herd behavior will take over   it really does n't take much to drive a stock down nor even an entire stock market if the authors wisdom were true would we ever have had any stock market crashes in the first place

what are you talking about the rules are regulations are setup as needed if you give a concrete e.g. maybe if you give a concrete example of where the govt is in the way i can understand rules and regulations are not examples of govt in the way in itself it would be if say you need to do something but you need to petition the govt first for something and there 's tons of bureaucracy or or something else govt just set the rules such as stop at red light etc   govt is not in the way here    the rest of your comments are on same line so this one bullet is enough again you 're just accusing generally with no specifics and i 'm not naive this is real and my opinion govt sets new rules as needed as a response to something not because people in the govt who change every few years feel so you 're talking about changing people in govt all adhering to the same laws because it makes sense to keep it and if not it gets repealed govt is not one same set of people always present from your birth to death govt keeps changing govt does care about fairness and hft 's existing is proof that govt lets free market and private business start things as it pleases till such time as it stops being fair for all    govt is not really an inhibitor to free market govt actually has no to free market because it allows a fair and balanced free market unlike what you 're referring to which is a free market with no rules like the wild wild west we had that free market before and over time people went from unregulated markets to more regulated markets because it is for our own good govt is just people who agreed with it joined the govt and made it so and others agreed if we do n't agree in future it can be changed    there is a term as regulated free market unregulated free market will lead to salesmen and generally a backwards movement to the wild west again   i do n't think you really want to talk you just want to spew your ignorant libertarian viewpoints because you 've heard them somewhere without thinking much about it you just blindly believe the govt is always wrong with no logic or justification just like religious people    just think on a few points and you will see that you are wrong sometimes is the govt perfect heck no is it always right nope but it is some times and it does do the right things many times it does the wrong things at times as well    but i do n't believe like you do at all because i think for myself and reason if you reason on a few points you 'll see the other viewpoint and stop reading or ron paul because they 're not right about govt being always wrong either    i wo n't bother replying to you anymore because you 're just a troll or arrogant smug guy who thinks he knows it all because your friends all think like you and blindly agree with you so you 've never been taken to reason or logic like others have to you on this board look at the other replies to your posts almost all contradict you just think why are they all wrong or perhaps you are

will the bank be taxed on the $ x received through selling the    collateral why do you care they will of course although their basis will be different it is of no concern for you what is your concern is that the write off of the loan is taxed as ordinary income as opposed to capital gains when you sell the stocks for you so when the bank the stocks they will also report to the irs that they gave you the amount of money that you owed them which they will give you and then put it on the account of the loan so you get taxed on that amount as income in addition you will be taxed on the gains on the stocks as giving them to the bank is considered a sale so you may actually find yourself in a situation where you 'd be paying taxes twice once capital gains and once as ordinary income on the same money i would strongly advise against this if it is a real situation and not a hypothetical question get a professional tax advice i 'm not a professional talk to a cpa ea licensed in your state

20 is almost certainly too high i agree with 2 as a very rough rule it will vary significantly depending on the industry i generally calculate an average of the previous 2 3 years working capital and deduct that from cash working capital is current assets less current liabilities current assets is comprised of cash prepaid expenses and significantly accounts receivable this means that ca is likely to be much higher than just cash which leaves more excess cash after liabilities are deducted which reduces ev which makes the ev ebitda ratio look even more pricey as noted but a balance sheet is just a snapshot of the final day of the quarter as such and because of seasonal effects it 's critical to smooth this by averaging several periods after calculating this for a few companies compare to revenue is it close to 2

not true the language used in the navy amp army clauses are different there is a duty to maintain the navy and support the armies there is no such mandate in the postal clause nor can the act of establishing be read as implying maintenance because the constitution specifically includes those things for the army and navy suggesting it was not implied    you can establish something and then privatize it government chartered companies were common at the time so it 's not like the idea did n't occur to them    strictly speaking i do n't see any reason that congress could n't also privatize the army and navy assuming that maintain and support do n't imply direct congressional control but that 's a harder argument compared to this much easier distinction in the case of the post office

if a company is valued correctly then paying dividends should lower the share price and buying back shares should leave the share price unchanged   if the share price is $ 100 and the company pays a $ 10 dividend then either its cash goes down by $ 10 per share it is has to borrow money for the same amount or some mixture either way the value of the company has gone down by $ 10 per share   if the share price is $ 100 and the company buys back 10 percent of its shares then it also has to find the money just as for the dividend and the value of the company goes down by 10 percent however the number of shares also goes down by 10 percent so the amount of value per share is the same and the share price should stay unchanged   now there are psychological effects many people like getting paid dividends so they will want to own shares of a company paying dividends so the share price goes up similar with a share buyback the fact that someone buys huge amounts of shares drives the price up both effects are purely psychological   a buyback has another effect if the shares are not valued correctly if the company is worth $ 100 per share but for some reason the is down to $ 50 then after the buyback the value per share has even gone up basically the company buys from stupid investors which increases the value for clever investors holding on to their shares if the were $ 200 then buying back shares would be a stupid move for the company

so how often do investors really lose money the short answer is every day let 's first examine your assumptions if the price of the share gets lower the investor can just wait until    it gets higher what are the chances that it wo n't forever or for    years there are many stocks whose price goes down and then down further and then to zero the most apparent example is of course enron the stock went from about $ 90 per share to zero in about 18 months for it to have been sold at $ 90 obviously someone had to buy it almost no matter where they sold it they lost money if they did n't sell it when the stock was worthless they lost money there are more modern examples of companies that are declining in a rapidly changing market for example sears holdings is getting beat down by amazon and many other on line retailers i suspect that if you buy it today and wait for it to go higher you will be disappointed the more common way to lose money is to either not have a plan or not stick to the plan disciplined investors typically plan to buy quality stocks at a fair price and hold them long enough for increasing sales and profits to bring the stock price up if later he hears a bit of bad news about his stock and decides to sell out of panic or fear and become a trader instead of keeping to the plan to remain a disciplined investor he is likely to lose money he will lose because no one can predict accurately that a stock is going down and will never recover nor can he predict accurately when a stock is going up and will never falter the chance of bankruptcy especially for huge companies like apple is    really low as i see it but i may be wrong thousands of people lost billions of dollars thinking that about enron too i too believe apple is a fine stock with excellent prospects but technology changes and markets change twenty or thirty years from now it may be a different case

risk is the problem as others have pointed out your fixed mortgage interest rate is for a set period of time only let 's say your 3 might be good for five years because that 's typical of fixed rate in canada so what happens in five years if your investment has dropped 50 due to a prolonged bear market and interest rates have since moved up from 3 to 8 your investment would be underwater and you would n't have enough to pay off the loan and exit the failed strategy rather you might just be stuck with renewing the mortage at a rate that makes the strategy far less attractive being more likely to lose money in the long run than to earn any leverage or borrowing to invest amplifies your risk considerably if you invest your own money in the market you might lose what you started with but if you borrow to invest you might lose much more than you started with there 's also one very specific issue with the example investment you 've proposed you would be borrowing canadian dollars but investing in an index fund of u.s based companies that trade in u.s. dollars even if the index has positive returns in u.s. dollar terms you might end up losing money if the canadian dollar strengthens vs. the u.s. dollar it has happened before multiple times so while this strategy has worked wonderfully in the past it has also failed in the past unless you have a crystal ball you need to be aware of the various risks and weigh them vs. the potential rewards there is no free lunch

although i do n't think you need to factor in risk tolerance to get the probabilities i agree with joetaxpayer that you will need to factor in risk tolerance in order to make a practical decision about what to do   in fact i think that to make a practical decision you will need more than the specific probability you ask for you in the question rather you would like to see the complete probability distribution of possible outcomes in other words it 's not enough to know that there is a 51 chance that investing will outperform paying down debt   you actually need to know much it outperforms when it does outperform and how much it underperforms when it underperforms   as joetaxpayer 's comment suggests you might not choose to make an investment that had a 99 chance of outperforming debt payment by 1 and a 1 chance of underperforming by 99 i think it possible to address these questions by doing simulations   this can be done even with a spreadsheet but more flexibly with simple programming   essentially you can create some kind of probabilistic model of the various factors e.g. chance that your investment will go up or down and see what actually happens how often you lose a lot of money lose a little money gain a little money or gain a lot of money   then based on that you can consult your inner spirit animal to decide whether the probability distribution of possible gains outweighs that of possible losses

other than the exchange risk one more thing to consider is interest rate risk and the returns you are generating from your money if it is lying around in a current account with no interest then it is rational to keep it where you intend to or aus now if your money is working for you earning interest or has been invested in the market then it seems reasonable that you should put it where it earns the maximum for you but that comes with a rider the exchange risk you may have to bear if you are converting between the currencies do the returns earned by your money cancel out the fx rates moving up and down and still leave you with a positive return compared with what you would earn if your money was where you stayed consider the below scenarios do evaluate all your options before you transfer your money

first of all congratulations on saving some money so many people these days do not even get that far as far as investments what is best for you depends heavily on your here is a quick summary of types of assets that are likely available to you and my thoughts on why they may or may not be a good fit for your situation cash equivalents cash equivalents are highly liquid meaning you can get cash for them on fairly short notice in particular money markets and certificates of deposit cds are also considered very safe when issued by a bank as they are often insured against loss by the government up to a certain amount this varies quite a lot by country within europe see the wikipedia article here for additional detail please note that in the case of a cd you are usually unable to get access to your money for the length of the investment period which is usually a short period of time such as 3 months 6 months or 1 year this is a good choice if you may need your money back on short notice and your main goal is to preserve your principal however the returns tend to be very low and often do not keep pace with inflation meaning that over several years you may lose real purchasing power even if you do n't lose nominal value in your account special note on cash equivalents if the money you want to invest is also your emergency fund or you do not have an emergency fund i would highly recommend cash equivalents they will provide the highest level of liquidity along with a short time horizon so that you can get your money as needed in the case of unforeseen expenses such as if your car breaks down debt debt investments include government and corporate bonds they are still considered relatively safe as the issuer would need to default usually this means they are in bankruptcy in order for you not to be paid back for example german bonds have been considered safer than greek bonds recently based on the underlying strength of the government unlike cash equivalents these are not guaranteed against loss which means that if the issuer defaults you could lose up to 100 of your investment bonds have several new features you will need to consider one is interest rate risk one reason bonds perform better than cash equivalents is that you are taking on the risk that if interest rates rise the fixed payments the bond promises will be worth less and the face value of your bond will fall while most bonds are still very liquid this means that if you need to sell the bond before it matures you could lose money as mentioned earlier some bonds are riskier than others given that you are looking for a low risk investment you would want to select a bond that is considered grade rather than a riskier junk bond debt investments are a good choice if you can afford to do without this money for a few years and you want to balance safety with somewhat better returns than cash equivalents again though i would not recommend investing in debt until you have also built up a separate emergency fund if you do choose to invest in bonds i recommend that you diversify your risks by investing in a bond fund rather than in just one company 's or government 's debt this will reduce the likelihood that you will experience a catastrophic loss ownership ownership assets includes stocks and other assets such as real estate and precious metals such as gold while these investments can have high returns in your situation i would strongly recommend that you not invest in these types of investments for the following reasons for these reasons debt is considered a safer investment than equity for any particular company government or the market as a whole ownership assets are a good choice for people who have a high risk tolerance long time horizon low liquidity needs and will not be bothered by larger potential changes in the value of the investment at any given time special note on gold i would consider gold a very risky investment and not a good fit for you at the moment based on what you 've shared in your question gold is considered safe in the sense that people believe that if the economy goes into recession depression or collapses entirely gold will continue to be valuable in a post apocalyptic world where paper money became worthless it is still a good bet that gold will always be considered valuable within human society as a store of value that being said the price of gold fluctuates almost entirely based on how bad people think things are going to get think about the difference between gold and a company like coca cola would you like to own 100 of coca cola of course because you know there is a very good chance that people will continue to spend money all over the world on their products on the other hand gold itself produces no products no sales no profits and no cash flow as such if you buy gold you are really making a speculative bet that gold will be in higher demand tomorrow than it is today you are buying an asset the gold rather than part of a company 's equity or debt that is designed to throw off payments to its investors in the form of bond payments or dividends so if people decide next year that things are improving it is possible that gold could lose value given that gold prices are at historically high levels gold could be a good choice for someone who has a large well diversified investment portfolio and who is looking for a hedge to protect against inflation and other risks that they have taken on via their other investments i hope that is helpful best of luck in your choices let us know what you decide

so people deposit money with you you agree to pay them fixed back and then you invest money for your own profit sounds like a bank to me   or a dividend paying mutual fund or a number of other similar ideas   sure you 're welcome to start something like that up it 's unlikely you 'd get money from people unless you had already proved yourself competent as an investor though   after all if it 's possible to get a safe comfortable 5 why would anyone give you money at 2 or 3 instead of just getting that 5 for themselves   or more likely finding a competitor who gives 4.9 as in most things the market will find inefficiencies like this and squash them like bugs    that said there are some opportunities that take advantage of other kinds of situations   the most common i 'd say is owning a home   you take out a mortgage for 80 of the value of the home instead of buying it outright and you instead invest the 80 in the market   you likely will beat your mortgage rate given the current rates   that 's effectively doing the same thing with an expense you 'd have anyway you always have to live somewhere since it 's a secured loan you get better rates than the market will give as it 's quite safe and you can use tax laws in your favor mortgage interest deduction in particular and the capital gains break on primary residences

when banks would return the actual physical cheque at least you had some printing writing from the other bank on it as some type of not easily proof now many most banks do n't return the actual cheques anyway just an image of it sometimes a low quality photocopy like image too   you 'd have to check with a lawyer or court in your area but i suspect any photocopy or image as well as a written or carbon copy duplicate would not be good enough proof for a law court since they could all be easily re written or so i do n't think there 's a real upside anyway only an official bank statement saying that the name people written actually cashed the cheque might be good evidence i 'm having doubts that the bank 's own low quality image would even qualify unless it 's verified as coming directly from the bank somehow i 'd agree with nate + 1 that a big downside could be identity theft either online or alongside phone loss theft

i can say from personal experience that as an employee i would prefer a system like this for determining pay scale i had a situation happen to me that was similar to the driver analogy in the article i had been at a software company for a little while and they were always hiring with a chronic shortage of talent finally they hired some new guys but still had open positions one of the new guys who came on was making a full $ 15k more in salary than me for doing the exact same and no he was n't a lead sr or anything like that no matter how i tried to not let this get to me it was hard not to let it affect my morale and i finally ended up leaving the company    so yeah i 'm sure guys like would say it 's my fault for not negotiating a better salary but since that 's impossible due to the bureaucracy in most jobs the fact is that the best way to negotiate a better salary is usually to just look elsewhere

material information means that any information that can reasonable affect the share price of the company upward or downward as looked by the investors the idea is to provide a level playing field to all investors hence it forces people having material information not to trade when they have this information that is not yet disclosed yes it happens all the time and laws are quite stringent there is monitoring of share activity by regulators hence most of the times the companies come out with their own guidelines and top senior management is prohibited from trading in their own company ’s shares for pretty much round the year except few windows the company decides is safe now it may not be possible to monitor every small material info but any large spike of stocks after certain announcements is investigated by regulators to verify any undue gains for ex a person who never trades suddenly buys large qty of shares and it goes up and he sells again etc

the home owner will knock 20 off the price of the house if the house is worth $ k then 20 is just a discount your landlord is offering   so your actual purchase price is $ 237 k and therefore a bank would have to lend you $ since the house is worth more than the loan you have equity   20 to be more accurate   another way to say is the bank only wants to loan you 80 of the value of the item securing the loan if you default on day one they can sell the house to somebody else for $ k and get a 20 return on their loan so this 20 you are worried about is n't actually money that anybody gives anybody else it is just a concept

different bonds and securitized mortgages are bonds that have similar average lives tend to have similar yields or at least trade at predictable yield spreads from one another so why does a 30 year mortgage not trade in lock step with 30-year treasuries first a little introduction mortgages are pooled together into bundles and securitized by the federal agencies fannie mae freddie mac and ginnie mae investors make assumptions about the prepayments expected for the mortgages in those pools as explained below those assumptions show that mortgages tend to have an average life similar to 10-year treasury notes   100 a so called average rate of prepayment means that the prepayment increases linearly from 0 to 6 over the first 30 months of the mortgage after the first 30 months mortgages are assumed to prepay at 6 per year this assumption comes from the fact that people are relatively unlikely to prepay their mortgage in the first 2 1/2 years of the mortgage 's life see the graph below   the faster the repayments the shorter the average life of the mortgage with 150 a mortgage has an average life of nine years on average your investment will be returned within 9 years some of it will be returned earlier and some of it later this return of interest and principal is shown in the graph below   the typical investor in a mortgage receives 100 of this investment back within approximately 10 years therefore mortgages trade in step with 10 year treasury notes average life is defined here the length of time the principal of a debt issue is expected to be    outstanding average life is an average period before a debt is repaid    through amortization or sinking fund payments to calculate the    average life multiply the date of each payment expressed as a    fraction of years or months by the percentage of total principal that    has been paid by that date summing the results and dividing by the    total issue size

so let me get this straight   the ceo of sears did a deal with another company he runs his hedge fund   so he gives sears a $ line of credit with a 9.75 interest rate   so the only winner here is eddie   either he saves sears with the line of credit zero chance of that happening or worst case sears fails and he still makes his 9.75 on the $   somehow i have a feeling this debt is going to be the first to be paid by sears each month   this is basically a $ gift from a bleeding sears to eddie

in the uk at least dealers definitely want you to take finance they get benefits from the bank which are not for doing this these benefits translate directly to increased commission and internal rewards for the individual salesman it 's conceivable that the salesman will be less inclined to put himself out for you in any way by your deal as much as you 'd like if he 's not going to get incentives out of it indeed since he 's taking a hit on his commission from you paying in cash it 's in his best interests to perhaps be with you during price negotiation so will the salesman be frustrated with you if you choose to pay in cash yes absolutely though this may manifest in different ways in some cases the dealer will offer to pay off the finance for you allowing you to pay directly in cash while the dealer still gets the bank referral reward so that everyone wins this is a behind the scenes secret in the industry which is not made public for obvious reasons it 's arguably on fraud if the salesman likes you and trusts you then you may be able to get such an arrangement if this does not seem likely to occur i would not go out of my way to disclose that i am planning to pay with cash that being said you 'll usually be asked very early on whether you are seeking to pay cash or credit the salesman wants to know for the reasons outlined above and there is little use lying about it when you 're shortly going to have to come clean anyway

i do n't know any clever way to do what you 're describing   and in a sense you can see why there might not be one   a mortgage is n't just a magical way to reduce your housing expenses it 's a tradeoff in which you agree to a long term commitment in exchange for fixed costs or at least costs with a structure over that long term   if you 're unwilling to accept the obligation of paying for and maintaining the property over a long period you ca n't really expect to reap the benefits of lowered costs   part of the reason people say buying is better is because people often do live in the same place for a long time in which case if they rent they might miss out on savings they could have had if they bought instead   if you 're not going to live in the same place for a long time buying may not actually be better for you

unfortunately the tax system in the u.s. is probably more complicated than it looks to you right now first you need to understand that there will be taxes withheld from your paycheck but the amount that they withhold is simply a guess   you might pay too much or too little tax during the year   after the year is over you 'll send in a tax return form that calculates the correct tax amount   if you have paid too little over the year you 'll have to send in the rest but if you 've paid too much you 'll get a refund   there are complicated formulas on how much tax the employer withholds from your paycheck but in general if you do n't have extra income elsewhere that you need to pay tax on you 'll probably be close to breaking even at tax time when you get your paycheck the first thing that will be taken off is fica also called social security medicare or the payroll tax   this is a fixed 7.65 that is taken off the gross salary   it is not refundable and is not affected by any allowances or deductions and does not come in to play at all on your tax return form there are optional employee benefits that you might need to pay a portion of if you are going to take advantage of them such as health insurance or retirement savings   some of these deductions are paid with before tax money and some are paid with after tax money the employer will calculate how much money they are supposed to withhold for federal and state taxes yes california has an income tax and the rest is yours at tax time the employer will give you a form w-2 which shows you the amount of your gross income after all the before tax deductions are taken out which is what you use to calculate your tax   the form also shows you how much tax you have paid during the year form 1040 is the tax return that you use to calculate your correct tax for the year   you start with the gross income amount from the w-2 and the first thing you do is add in any income that you did n't get a w-2 for such as interest or investment income and subtract any deductions that you might have that are not taxable but were not paid through your paycheck such as moving expenses student loan interest tuition etc   the result is called your adjusted gross income next you take off the deductions not covered in the above section property tax home mortgage interest charitable giving etc   you can either take the standard deduction $ 6,300 if you are single or if you have more deductions in this category than that you can itemize your deductions and declare the correct amount after that you subtract more for exemptions   you can claim yourself as an exemption unless you are considered a dependent of someone else and they are claiming you as a dependent   if you claim yourself you take off another $ 4,000 from your income what you are left with is your taxable income for the year   this is the amount you would use to calculate your tax based on the bracket table you found california has an income tax and just like the federal tax some state taxes will be deducted from your paycheck and you 'll need to fill out a state tax return form after the year is over to calculate the correct state tax and either request a refund or pay the remainder of the tax   i do n't have any experience with the california income tax but there are details on the rates on this page from the state of california

for some people it should be a top priority   for others there are higher priorities   what it should be for you depends on a number of things including your overall financial situation both your current finances and how stable you expect them to be over time your level of financial education the costs of your mortgage the alternative investments available to you your investing goals and your tolerance for risk your 1 priority should be to ensure that your basic needs including making the required monthly payment on your mortgage are met both now and in the near future which includes paying off high interest i.e. credit card debt and building up an emergency fund in a savings or money market account or some other low risk and liquid account   if you have n't done those things do not pass go do not collect $ 200 and do not consider making advance payments on your mortgage   mason wheeler 's statements that the bank ca n't take your house if you 've paid it off are correct but it 's going to be a long time till you get there and they can take it if you 're to paying it off early and then something bad happens to you and you start missing payments   if you 're not underwater you should be able to get some of your money back by selling possibly at a loss before it gets to the point of foreclosure but you 'll still have to move which can be costly and   so make sure you 've got what you need to handle your basic needs even if you hit a rough patch and make sure you 're not financing the paying off of your house by taking a loan from visa at 27 annually once you 've gotten through all of those more important things you finally get to decide what else to invest your extra money in   different investments will provide different rewards both financial and emotional and mason wheeler has clearly demonstrated that he gets a strong emotional payoff from not having a mortgage which may or may not be how you feel about it   on the financial side of any potential investment you 'll want to consider things like the expected rate of return the risk it carries both on its own and whether it balances out or the overall risk profile of all your investments in total its expected costs including its and your tax rate and any preferred tax treatment and any other potential factors such as an employer match on 401(k contributions which are basically free money to you   then you weigh the pros and cons financial and emotional of each option against your imperfect forecast of what the future holds take your best guess and then keep adjusting as you go through life and things change but i want to come back to one of the factors i mentioned in the first paragraph   which options you should even be considering is in part influenced by the degree to which you understand your finances and the wide variety of options available to you as well as all the of how different things can make them more or less advantageous than one another   the fact that you 're posting this question here indicates that you 're still early in the process of learning those things and although it 's great that you 're educating yourself on them and keep doing it it means that you 're probably not ready to worry about some of the things other posters have talked about such as cost of capital and roi   so keep reading blog posts and articles online there 's no shortage of them and keep developing your understanding of the options available to you and their pros and cons and wait to tackle the full suite of investment options till you fully understand them however there 's still the question of what to do between now and then   paying the mortgage down is n't an unreasonable thing for you to do for now since it 's a guaranteed rate of return that also provides some degree of emotional payoff   but i 'd say the higher priority should be getting money into a tax advantaged retirement account a because the tax advantaged growth of those accounts makes their long term return far greater than whatever you 're paying on your mortgage and they provide more benefit tax advantaged growth the earlier you invest in them so doing that now instead of paying off the house quicker is probably going to be better for you financially even if it does n't provide the emotional payoff   if your employer will match your contributions into that account then it 's a no brainer but it 's probably still a better idea than the mortgage unless the emotional payoff is very very important to you or unless you 're nearing retirement age so the tax free growth period is small   if you 're not sure what to invest in just choose something that 's broad market and low cost total market index funds are a great choice and you can diversify into other things as you gain more savvy as an investor what matters more is that you start investing in something now not exactly what it is disclaimer i 'm not a personal advisor and this does not constitute investing advice   understand your choices and make your own decisions

no you do n't rounding errors happen and if there 's no change in the actual tax there 's no reason to amend if all the income was properly reported and the tax was properly calculated no one cares if it was rounded up or down on one of the lines note for the next time though not sure about new york but federal taxes are generally rounded to the nearest dollar on each line of the form so do n't calculate cents just round to the nearest dollar and be consistent on all of your tax forms technically it is perfectly legal to report cents as well and people used to when the forms were still filled by hand with pen but all the automatic tax filing software rounds so just do that

depending on the the requirements of the annuity you might be able to pull back to part time for   a semester thus reducing the bill for that semester during that semester either get a job that will allow you to save money or get an internship related to your major some of these programs alternate between work semesters and schools semesters   many colleges have an installment plan where the payments are due every month they usually spread them out over a 10 month period most only charge a nominal fee to set up the plan this would reduce the amount of money needed to bridge the gap to only a portion of the tuition payments for the spring semester you could also live off campus to save money there is no guarantee it will be cheaper but because the costs are n't fixed and due at the start of the semester you might be able to stretch your budget

one thing i would like to clear up here is that black scholes is just a model that makes some assumptions about the dynamics of the underlying + a few other things and with some rather complicated math out pops the black scholes formula black scholes gives you the real price under the assumptions of the model your definition of what a real price entails will depend on what assumptions you make with that being said black scholes is popular for pricing european options because of the simplicity and speed of using an analytic formula as opposed to having a more complex model that can only be evaluated using a numerical method as dumbcoder mentioned should note that for many other types of derivative contracts e.g. american or style exercise the black scholes analytic formula is not appropriate the other important thing to note here is that the market does not necessarily need to agree with the assumptions made in the black scholes model and they most certainly do not to use it if you look at implied for a set of options which have the same expiration but differing strike prices you may find that the implied for each contract differ and this information is telling you to what degree the traders in the market for those contracts disagree with the distribution assumption made by black scholes implied vol is generally the thing to look at when determining cheapness of an option contract with all that being said what i 'm assuming you are interested in is either called a delta gamma approximation or more generally greek based profit and loss attribution in case you wanted to google some more about it here is an example that is relevant to your question let 's say we had the following european call contract popping this in to bs formula gives you a premium of $ delta of and gamma of let 's say you bought it and the price of the stock immediately moves to 55 and nothing else changes re evaluating with the bs formula gives whereas using a delta gamma approximation gives the actual math does n't work out exactly and that is due to the fact that there are higher order greeks than gamma but as you can see here clearly they do not have much of an impact considering a 10 move in the underlying is almost entirely explained by delta and gamma

keep in mind that by fully paying off one of your loans you will reduce your minimum repayments this will make you feel richer than you actually are this will make you buy stuff that it seems like you can afford probably putting some of it on credit as you ca n't actually afford this this will leave you in a years time with the same amount of debt you have now or more but with a slightly bigger tv assuming your home loan has no penalties for paying off extra then put all 11k into there to keep your monthly repayments as high as possible

credit risk and insurance risk are highly correlated for a single legal party   trouble with one could indicate trouble with another any increase in credit risk such as new borrowing will be perceived to be an increased likelihood of insurance risk manifested as a fraudulent or subconsciously induced claim   any claim of insurance will be perceived to be an increased likelihood of default manifested as a default voluntary or not to a creditor insurer only the law applies therefore private arrangements between the borrower insured and third parties do not factor because the creditor insurer has no hope of recourse against such third parties in most places around the world regardless of whether there is a price ceiling on compensation for damages to assets limiting an insurers costs if a risk is realized then it can be presumed through sequential sampling as well as other reliable statistical techniques that future risk has risen   the aforementioned risk dominoes subsequently fall generally speaking the lower one 's financial variance the lower the financial costs   in other words uncertainty can be mostly quantified with variance and other mathematical moments as well   any uncertainty is a cost to a producer thus a cost to the consumer   a consumer who is perfectly predictable with good outcomes will pay much lower costs on average than not so one who keeps a tight financial ship not exposing oneself to financial risks and better yet not realizing financial risks will see less financial variance thus will enjoy lower costs to financing which includes insuring

i agree with the comments so far access does n't equal ownership there are also different levels of access e.g. your financial advisor can have access to your retirement account via power of attorney but only ability to add or change things not withdraw another consideration is when a creditor tries to garnish wages bank accounts it needs to find the accounts first this could be done by running a credit report via ssn my guess is an account with access only rights wo n't show up on such a report i suppose the court could subpoena bank information but i 'm not an attorney so please check with a professional

the other two folks here are right with the math and such so i 'll just throw some intuition out there for you   the basis for this valuation model is really just tacking the gordon growth model which is really just a form of valuing a perpetuity onto a couple of finite discounted cash flows so that ending part is the gordon growth model at the future point discounted back to the present   the gordon growth model uses a next period dividend for the very simple reason that it 's the next one you 'd get if you bought the stock   is that explanation clear enough or were some of these points not adequately explained in your class i 'll help a bit more if i can

people seem to think that yelp serves businesses or the public   it does n't   it serves yelpers   yelpers want reviews from other yelpers and that 's it   if you do n't review things frequently on yelp they do n't care about your opinion   sorry   nothing personal but this website is only interested in reviews from people who use the site frequently   you might be the most person in the world and you might post a great review of a business but this is n't your blog   you 're not entitled to have the world see your review here   they only want the opinion of regular yelpers   if you want to be a part of the yelp community keep making reviews and they 'll un filter your reviews   there are people who say that businesses that pay yelp get more reviews but it 's not true   the article even states that she was paying $ 350/month before these reviews got filtered out   the article also says a court case against yelp was thrown out because there was no evidence showing bias   people who claim this are just butt hurt and want to justify their bias by claiming that yelp is greedy and unscrupulous   the fact of the matter is this yelp has a powerful community   business owners see yelp as possibly affecting their business   they want to have control over that but they ca n't   in fact yelp goes out of their way to prevent that   many business owners simply are n't mentally capable of grasping how some things work and when things do n't go their way they get angry and make accusations   this particular woman who is currently taking 3 hours of social media classes per week wtf thinks there maybe needs to be some rules on the net that are n’t there now   no offense lady but you probably should n't be writing internet laws until you 're done with your internet for dummies classes   you might think that this is not a good model for a review website   if so do n't use it   it 's not a government institution and you 're not obligated to use it   go find another review site   better yet if you think yelp is so horrible go make your own review website that allows anyone to review things   i 'm sure it will be great and everyone will love it   whatever you choose stop trying to ruin yelp   the people who use it like the way the it is and do n't want some butt hurt non users fucking it up

i have about $ 1 k in savings and have been told that you should get into investment and saving for retirement early i make around $ 200 per week which about $ 150 goes into savings that 's $ 10k per year   the general rule of thumb is that you should have six months income as an emergency fund   so your savings should be around $ 5k   build that first    some argue that the standard should be six months of living expenses rather than income   personally i think that this example is exactly why it is income rather than living expenses   six months of living expenses in this case would only be $ 1250 which wo n't pay for much   and note that living expenses can only be calculated after the fact   if your estimate of $ 50 a week is overly optimistic you might not notice for months until some large living expense pops up    another problem with using living expenses as the measure is that if you hold down your living expenses to maximize your savings this helps both measures   then you hit your savings target and your living expenses increase   so you need more savings   by contrast if your income increases but your living expenses do not you still need more savings but you can also save more money   does n't really change the basic analysis though   either way you have an emergency savings target that you should hit before starting your retirement savings    if you save $ 150 per week then you should have around $ 4k in savings at the beginning of next year   that 's still low for an emergency fund by the income standard   so you probably should n't invest next year   with a living expenses standard you could have $ in savings by april 15th deadline for an ira contribution that appears in the previous tax year   that 's $ 5000 more than the $ 1250 emergency fund so you could afford an ira probably a roth that year    if you save $ 7500 next year and start with $ 4k in savings under the income standard for emergency savings that would leave you with $ 11,500   take $ 5500 of that and invest in an ira probably a roth   after that you could make a $ 100 deposit per week for the next year   or just wait until the end    if you invested in an ira the previous year because you decided use the living expenses standard you would only have $ 6500 at the end of the year   if you wait until you have $ you could max out your ira contribution   at that point your excess income for each year would be larger than the maximum ira contribution so you could max it out until your circumstances change    if you do n't actually save $ 3k this year and $ 7500 next year do n't sweat it   a college education is enough of an investment at your age   do that first then emergency savings then retirement    that will flip around once you get a better paying long term job   then you should include retirement savings as an expected cost   so you 'd pay the minimum required for your education loans and other required living expenses then dedicate an amount for retirement savings then build your emergency savings then pay off your education loans above the minimum payment   this is where it can pay to use the more aggressive living expenses standard as that allows you to pay off your education loans faster    i would invest retirement savings in a nice diversified index fund or two since maintaining the correct stock bond mix of stocks is less risky than investing in just bonds much less just stocks   investing in individual stocks is something you should do with excess money that you can afford to lose   secure your retirement first   then stock investments are gravy if they pan out   if they do n't you 're still all right   but if they do you can make bigger decisions e.g. buying a house    realize that buying individual stocks is about more than just buying an app   you have to both check the fundamentals which the app can help you do and find other reasons to buy a stock   if you rely on an app then you 're essentially joining everyone else using that app   you 'll make the same profit as everyone else which wo n't be much because you all share the profit opportunities with the app 's system   if you want to use someone else 's system stick with mutual funds   the app system is actually more dangerous in the long term    early in the app 's life cycle its system can produce positive returns because a small number of people are sharing the benefits of that system   as more people adopt it though the total possible returns stay the same   at some point users the app   all the possible returns are realized   then users are competing with each other for returns   the per user returns will shrink as usage grows    if you have your own system then you are competing with fewer people for the returns from it   share the fundamental analysis but pick your stocks based on other criteria   fundamental analysis will tell you if a stock is overvalued   the other criteria will tell you which undervalued stock to buy

# 109292
i agree that you should consider a shares based dividend income sipp however unless you 've done self executed trading before enough to understand and be comfortable with it and know what you 're getting into i would strongly suggest that as you are now near retirement you have to appreciate that as well as the usual risks associated with markets and their constituent stocks and shares going down as well as up there is an additional risk that you will achieve sub optimal performance because you are new to the game i took up self executed trading in 2008 oh yes what a great time to learn and whilst i might have chosen a better time to get into it and despite being quite successful over all i have to say it 's the hardest thing i 've ever done the biggest reason it 'll be hard is emotionally because this pension pot is all the money you 've got to live off until you die right so even though you may choose safe quality stocks when the world economy goes wrong it goes wrong and your pension pot will still plummet somewhat at least unless you beat the market something you should not expect to do if you have n't done it before taking the rather abysmal as a benchmark all quality stocks right lol from last highs to this months lows and projecting that performance forwards to the end of march assuming you get reasonable dividends and draw out £ 1000 per month your pot could be worth £ k after one year where as with normal stable long term market performance i.e. no horrible devaluation of the market it could be worth £ k going forwards from those 2 hypothetical positions assuming total market stability for the rest of your life and the same reasonable dividend payouts this one year of devaluation at the start of your pensions life is enough to reduce the time your pension pot can afford to pay out £ 1000 per month from 36 years to 24 years even if every year after that devaluation is an extra 1 higher return it could still only improve to 30 years normally of course any stocks and shares investment is a long term investment and long term the income should be good but pensions usually diversify into less and less risky investments as they get close to maturity holding a certain amount of cash and bonds as well so in my view a sipp with stocks and shares should be at most just a part of your strategy and if you ca n't watch your pension pot payout term shrink from 26 years to 24 years hold your nerve then maybe a sipp with stocks and shares should be a smaller part when you 're dependent on your sipp for income a market crash could cause you to make bad decisions and lose even more income all that said now even with all the new taxes and loss of tax deductible costs etc i think your property idea might not be a bad one it 's just diversification at the end of the day and that 's rarely a bad thing i really don't think you should consider it to be a magic bullet though it 's not impossible to get a 10 yield from a property but usually you wo n't i assume you 've never done buy to let before so i would encourage you to set up a spread sheet and model it carefully if you are realistic then you should find that you have to find really really exceptional properties to get that sort of return and you wo n't find them all the time when you do your spread sheet make sure you take into account all the one off buying costs build a ledger effectively so that you can plot all your costs income and on going balance and then see what payouts your model can afford over a reasonable number of years say 10 take the sum of those payouts and compare them against the sum you put in to find the whole thing you must include budget for periodic minor and less frequent larger renovations your tenants won't respect your property like you would i promise you land lord insurance do n't omit it unless you maintain capability to access a decent reserve at least 10 20 k say i mean it it 's happened to me it cost me 10 k once to fix up a place after the damage and negligence of a tenant and it definitely could have been worse but i do n't really recommend you insuring yourself like this and taking on the inherent risk budget for plumber and electrician call out or for appropriate schemes which include boiler maintenance etc basically more insurance also consider estate agent fees which will be either finders fees and/or 10 management fees if you do n't manage them yourself if you manage it yourself fine but consider the possibility that at some point someone might have to do that for you either temporarily or permanently budget for a couple of months of vacancy every couple of years is probably prudent do n't forget you have to pay utilities and council tax when its vacant for do n't forget ground rent you can get a better return on investment by taking out a mortgage because you make money out of the underlying roi and the mortgage apr this is usually the only way you can approach 10 yield but do n't forget to include the cost of mortgage fees valuation fees legal fees etc every 2 years or however long and repeat your model to make sure it is viable when interest rates go up a few percent

i 'm going to start with your title question how can home buying be considered a sound investment with all of that interest that needs to be paid if taken literally this is a loaded question because if you pay cash for a home you do n't pay any interest furthermore if your interest rate is 3 for 10 years you wo n't pay nearly as much interest as you will if your rate is 10 for 30 years so all of that interest is relative to your personal situation having said that of course i understand what you mean most people pay interest and interest is expensive so how do you calculate if it 's worth it that question has been asked and answered but for your particular situation you really have two separate questions i believe you should answer these questions independently if you move far away it 's probably the case that you can save a lot of money by either renting or buying in that location so you should first consider if it 's worth it to move and then if it is decide if it 's worth it to rent or buy if you decide not to move far away then decide if maybe you can save money by renting somewhere near your current home since it sounds like if you move you may have to become a landlord living close by to your tenant may also make it easier to deal with problems when they arise

credit scores are not such a big deal in canada as they are in the us and even some european countries   one reason for this the social insurance number sin number is n't used for so many purposes like the social security number ssn in the us   the sin number is n't even required to get credit but with some exceptions it is needed to open an interest bearing savings account so that the interest income can be reported   you can refuse to provide the sin number to most private companies canada also has one of the highest per capita immigration rates of any large country so new are expected and services are geared up for them   most of the banks offer special deals for new canadians   you should get a credit card even if just a secured credit card through them with one of these offers to start a credit file anyway but there 's no need to actually use it much   auto paying a utility bill through the card and paying it off in full each month is one way to keep it active   no need to ever pay any interest most major apartment rental firms will expect a good proportion of their renters to be new to canada so should have procedures in place to deal with it such as a higher deposit   you should not give them your sin for a credit check even when you 're more established same for utilities they can just charge a higher deposit if they ca n't credit check you   for private landlords everything is negotiable but see the laws link at the end of this answer you will later need a credit rating for a mortgage on a house if not paying cash so it 's worth getting that one token credit card   useful for car rental also here 's a fairly complete summary of the laws on renting in canada which includes the maximum deposits that can be asked for and notice periods

of course credit cards are viewed as credit if you 're using money on a credit card you are not directly paying for your transactions on goods services immediately this is the act of borrowing credit to pay for them debit cards on the other hand work where the funds are taken from an account immediately or subject to a small delay but usually no more than 24 hours depending on various factors you should never miss credit card payments as that will affect your credit rating if you have unpaid money on your card this is debt plain and simple but to answer your question succinctly yes credit cards are a form of credit as the name suggests when you apply for a mortgage any unpaid credit debt is considered and would adversely affect you if you have such debts the level to which it affects you depends on the amount of debt this is how it works in the uk but to my knowledge it is the same in the us and most other countries please clarify if you think this is incorrect

the answer depends on what is your portfolio 's objective    if you are operating a multi asset class portfolio i.e. your portfolio has both bonds and stocks and are targeting absolute returns then yes comparing a stock 's beta or correlation to a bond benchmark makes sense what you do with this stock 's bond beta information further depends on what kind of return profile you want your multi asset class portfolio to have if you want stocks that appreciate in price when bond prices decline then of course you want to buy negative bond beta stocks   if you are operating a purely relative equity portfolio i.e. you are to the stock market then comparing the bond beta is of little use to you   hope this helps

it 's monopoly money   everybody treats it like that   of course it does n't work     it would be vastly different if you had you budget plus     a freedom of choice for the supplier internal or external     b your group could spend any budget surplus on whatever they wanted well for the office     but that will never happen because company policy

it depends on your definition of inactive if you have credit cards open and do not use them at all for a period of time some lenders will not update your usage to the credit bureaus while some will close your account in which will definitely hurt your credit score but since you use your card once in a while and pay them off you should be good lenders like to see some activity rather than no activity if there are great offers out there by credit card companies then why not take advantage of them the only downside may be the annual fees if there is any but with your credit score it implies you are financially responsible so there should be no compelling financial reason to not open more cards in fact the number of credit accounts you have open can play a role on your score essentially the more the better according to credit karma 0 5 credit accounts is very poor 6 10 is poor 11 20 is good 21 + is excellent

generally the answer is as follows   if there is a legal obligation to pay cash flow including the possibility of court determined restructuring then it is debt   if the asset owner is not guaranteed any cash flow   but instead owns the residual cash flow from the operations of the business i.e. the cash flow left over then it is equity

the idea is it concurrently drives prices down due to labour costs society will have to be generally less and those in production will probably require different taxation to keep capital and labour fairly even but yes it 's going to happen one way or another

who 's to say it was n't priced into the markets at least to some degree without any information on the behaviour of holders pre expiry no one can know if they 've been shorting the stock in advance of selling on expiry day and with the float being such a small proportion of the total issuance there 's always the risk of sudden fluctuations picking up big momentum which could easily explain the 7 drop on expiry day add into all this uncertainty the usual risks of shorting e.g. limited upside unlimited downside and the observed phenomena are n't by any means killer blows of the efficient market hypothesis that 's not to say that such evidence does n't necessarily exist just that this is n't it

these good rates all tend to be on up to $ x where x is some number that could require multiple accounts they often also come with other strings like set up automatic deposits withdrawals and use debit card at least 15 times per month the two you mention have these flaws whether or not it 's worth it depends on if you are happy to meet those requirements and how big your emergency fund is   personally i 'd rather get rewards on a credit card than use a debit card and i do n't want to open a bunch of accounts so i have a boring savings account with a pretty low interest rate for my emergency fund it 's liquid earns some interest and i do n't have to think about it

for me it 's a pretty fine line   i really hate when i go to a store and i have salespeople breathing down my neck the instant my foot touches the floor   however if i 've been in a store for more than 5 10 minutes especially if i 've been hovering in one spot or over one time for the majority of that time one would think that a salesperson would think hey maybe that dude wants to buy something and i should help him out   i guess what irritates me most is the lack of common sense and courtesy displayed in these situations although i can certainly understand that oftentimes it is merely someone following corporate policy in order to make enough money to get by or even keep their jobs
