you can only claim an input tax credit if tax was actually collected by the seller irrespective of whether it should have been or not you need to contact the seller to request an invoice that shows the gst hst if any as well as the seller 's gst hst number which is required to be printed on invoices if the seller is not including gst hst in the prices indicated on kickstarter i would like to know how they get away with that

i have read in many personal finance books that stocks are a great investment for the long term because on average they go up 5 7 every year this has been true for the last 100 years for the s&p500 index but is there reason to believe this trend will continue indefinitely into the future it has also been wrong for 20 + year time periods during those last 100 years it 's an average and you can live your whole career at a loss there are many things to support the retention of the average over the next 100 years i think the is out of scope of your actual investment philosophy but basically there are many ways to lower your cost basis by reinvesting dividends selling options or contributing to your position at any price from a portion of your income and by inflation and by the growth of the world economy with a low enough cost basis then a smaller percentage gain in the index gives you a magnified profit

well there are a few comments that need to be made here i suppose though at work now so this will be short    first there is the difference between banking which indeed mostly looks at capital adequacy ratios and uses var as one of the methods to get to the risk weighted assets then there is the buy side which is more interested in how much would i stand to lose in portfolio x if markets head south and how does that relate to what a have promised my client in the first situation it is the bank itself taking on the risk in the second the risk lies entirely with the client an asset manager could lose 100 on your regular old equity mandate and it would n't hit him except for loss in fees whereas a significant trading loss for a bank can put it out of business    my personal view is that all of these metrics are merely useful instruments and for a large part they all tell me the same thing a higher duration on a fixed income mandate will give a higher var a higher shortfall more negative results on rates stress scenarios etcetera they only really become useful when imposing limits on them or using them to steer based on whatever the prevailing risk appetite is at a certain point in time or when looking at trends or relative risk of portfolio a vs b   do n't get me wrong i too can debate for hours about var parameters confidence intervals look back periods return frequency decay factors parametric or historical monte carlo simulation etcetera but i think in practise that is really of limited use if you take any ex ante risk measure and you thoroughly understand it make an informed choice about risk appetite and steer on it you basically have done your job as a risk manager   sorry i know i am not answering your questions in a structured way but am on my phone so it 's hard to keep overview pm me if you want to discuss things in detail

that 's a dumb thesis for klarman if it 's what he 's doing   what history shows is that new investors are very interested in the total debt payments you are on the hook for    the higher your debt payments the less room there is for new payments      you clear off all debts people are more excited to lend because it 's the previous lenders that got the pain   it 's gambling   i really have no idea what klarman is doing we just know what happened with the situation    if klarman is not demanding 100 face value of the bonds but something not too much more than what he bought them for then who cares    there 's a reasonable function of debt where the debt holder who does n't want to deal with a long term repayment plan sells the debt to be out of the stress and the guy taking it on knows he will get an amount more that is a function of being willing to wait things out    it should n't be a amount more though   otherwise the original investor is an idiot for not waiting

you may also want to consider short term low risk investments rolling certificate of deposits can be good for this they do n't grow like an index fund but there 's 0 risk and they will grow faster than your bank for my bank as an example today 's rates on my money market is 0.10 apy while the lowest cd 90 days is 0.20 apy with a 5 year going up to 0.90 apy it 's not substantial by any stretch but its secure and the money would just be sitting in my bank otherwise for more information look at what is cd laddering and what are its pros and cons

your best approach is to assess rent levels in your local area for offices of a similar size you need to take into account all the amenities parking etc just as if your home office was provided by a third party get your $ ft and work out the monthly amount with this figure you need to then work out what of it you can charge if the space is used exclusively for the business charge 100 if it 's used about half the time charge 50 etc i would strongly advise you to do two things 1 make sure your accountant and your attorney help you get this squared away 2 document everything about how you arrived at the cost nothing fancy but dates realtors addresses $ foot a simple table will do by doing these two things if the irs should come around to chat you should be covered

what you 're asking about is called a distribution when it comes to an llc   it 's basically you paying yourself some or all of the proceeds of the business depending on how you 're set up   you can pay yourself distributions on a regular schedule say monthly or you can do it at the end of the year whatever you do in this regard what you take out as distributions is reported on your personal income tax as taxable income   llcs in the u.s. use pass through taxation unless you intentionally elect to have the llc treated as a corporation for tax purposes which some people do so whatever the principals receive in distribution is personally taxable keep in mind that you 'll have to pay all of the taxes normally covered by an employer such as self employment tax usually about 15 social security tax and so on   this is in addition to income tax so remember that i hope this helps good luck

if one wants to have a bound on the loss percentages that are acceptable this is would be a way to enforce that for example suppose someone wants to have a 5 stop loss but does n't want this to be worse than 10 as if the stock goes down more than 10 then the sell should n't happen thus if the stock opened in a gap down 15 one day this triggers the stop loss and would exit at too low of a price as the gap was quite high as i wonder how familiar are you with how much a stock 's price could change that makes the prices not be as continuous as one would think at least this would be my thinking on a volatile stock where one may want to try to limit losses if the stock does fall within a specific range

it depends on whether you want a career as a fund analyst or if you want to be an trader a fund manager will have many constraints that a private investor does n’t have as they are managing other people ’s money   if they do invest their own money as well they usually would invest it differently from how they invest the fund 's money many would just get someone else to invest their money for them just as a surgeon would get another surgeon to operate on a family member my suggestion to you is to find a job you like doing and build up your savings whilst you are building up your savings read some books you said you do n’t know much about the financial markets then learn about them get yourself a working knowledge about both fundamental and technical analysis work out which method of analysis if not both suits you best and you would like to know more about as you read you will get a better idea if you prefer to be a long term investor or a short term trader or somewhere in between or a combination of various methods now you will start to get an idea of what type of books and areas of analysis you would like to concentrate on once you have a better idea of what you would like to do and have gained some knowledge then you can develop your investment trading plan and start paper trading once you are happy with you plan and your paper trading you can start trading with a small account balance not more than $ 10,000 and preferably under $ 5,000 no matter how well you did with paper trading you will always do worse with real money at first due to your emotions being in it now so always start off small if you want to become good at something it takes time and a lot of hard work you ca n’t go from knowing nothing to making a million dollars per year without putting in the hard yards first

if the answer were no you still found the black swan type exception that proves the answer to be yes right my experience is this again just my experience my bank when by balance goes below $ 10 i have the account trigger an email i wrote a check i forgot to register and subtract so the email was sent and the account balance in fact showed negative i transferred to cover the check and the next day there was a history that did n't go negative the evening deposit was credited prior to check clearing   i set up my bills on line i set a transfer in advance for the same dollar amount as a bill that was due e.g. $ 1000 transfer for a $ 1000 bill i woke up to an email and the account showed the bill was paid prior to the transfer so one line showed going and the next line + $ 100 after transfer even though it 's the same online process again the next day the history re ordered to look like i was never negative but even on a day i know i 'm having payments issued i can never just ignore that email   the first time this happened i asked the bank and they said if the negative went until the next day i 'd get an overdraft short balance notice   this is a situation to ask your bank how they handle this

normally when thinking about whether it 's worth it to start a small business the biggest factor is your time there 's a big difference between spending 10 hours to make a profit of $ 50 vs spending 1 hour to make a profit of $ 50 your scenario is quite different though in that you suggest your wife is considering teaching for free instead of accepting payment in this case the time factor almost goes away since if you accept payment there is very little extra time involved for depositing checks tracking income and filling out some extra forms come tax time from a financial point of view there is no reason to turn down the money if people are willing to pay it there may be other reasons to prefer doing it for free but taxes social security payments and the small extra effort to run the business would n't normally be among those reasons i do n't know what your reasons for possibly preferring to do it for free are but an alternative option to consider is to donate all of her income to charity

one important issue that has yet to be covered is the cost to you in terms of paperwork lost time and phone calls that you have to make to claim the insurance   such insurance claims often are very low priority on their customer service queues for obvious reasons since they have already made the sale therefore you might have to spend up to a few hours of your time calling or writing emails to claim the warranty which may often not be much   therefore many people end up not claiming the warranty during the hassle much like non scam mail in rebates more often than not you would either forget to or decide it is not worth your time to claim the warranty before buying such policies other than the obvious cost benefit calculations you should also take this additional factor into account    therefore many people end up not claiming the warranty during the hassle much like non scam mail in rebates more often than not you would either forget to or decide it is not worth your time to claim the warranty before buying such policies other than the obvious cost benefit calculations you should also take this additional factor into account

this answer will expand a bit on the theory a company as an entity represents a pile of value some of that is business value the revenue stream from their products and some of that is assets real estate manufacturing equipment a patent portfolio etc one of those assets is cash if you own a share in the company you own a share of all those assets including the cash in a theoretical sense it does n't really matter whether the company holds the cash instead of you if the company adds an extra $ 1 billion to its assets then people who buy and sell the company will think hey there 's an extra $ 1 billion of cash in that company i should be willing to pay $ 1 billion shares outstanding more per share to own it than i would otherwise granted you may ultimately want to turn your ownership into cash but you can do that by selling your shares to someone else from a practical standpoint though the company does n't benefit from holding that cash for a long time cash does n't do much except sit in bank accounts and earn small amounts of interest and if you wanted pathetic amounts of interests from your cash you would n't be owning shares in a company you 'd have it in a bank account yourself really the company should do something with their cash usually that means investing it in their own business to grow and expand that business or to enhance profitability sometimes they may also purchase other companies if they think they can turn a profit from the purchase sometimes there are n't a lot of good options for what to do with that money in that case the company should say i ca n't effectively use this money in a way which will grow my business you should go and invest it yourself in whatever sort of business you think makes sense that 's when they pay a dividend you 'll see that a lot of the really big global companies are the ones paying dividends places like coca cola or exxon mobil or what have you they just ca n't put all their cash to good use even after their growth plans many people who get dividends will invest them in the stock market again possibly purchasing shares of the same company from someone else or possibly purchasing shares of another company it does n't usually make a lot of sense for the company to invest in the stock market themselves though investment expertise is n't really something most companies are known for and because a company has multiple owners they may have differing investment needs and risk tolerance for instance if i had a bunch of money from the stock market i 'd put it in some sort of growth stock because i 'm twenty something with a lot of savings and years to go before retirement if i were close to retirement though i would want it in a more stable stock or even in bonds if i were retired i might even spend it directly so the company should let all its owners choose unless they have a good business reason not to sometimes companies will do share buy backs instead of dividends which pays money to people selling the company stock the remaining owners benefit by reducing the number of shares outstanding so they own more of what 's left they should only do this if they think the stock is at a fair price or below a fair price for the company otherwise the remaining owners are essentially giving away cash this actually happens often on the other hand if the company 's stock is depressed but it subsequently does better than the rest of the market then it is a very good investment the one nice thing about share buy backs in general is that they do n't have any immediate tax implications for the company 's owners they simply own a stock which is now more valuable and can sell it and pay taxes on that sale whenever they choose

you have to be the owner of record before the ex dividend date which is not the same day as the date the dividend is paid this also implies that if you sell on or after the ex dividend date you 'll still get the dividend even if you no longer own the stock   keep in mind also that the quoted price of the stock and on any open orders that are not specifically marked as do not reduce on its ex dividend date is dropped by the amount of the dividend first thing in the morning before trading starts if you happen to be the first order of the day before market forces cause the price to move you 'll end up with zero gain since the dividend is built into the price and you got the same value out of it the dividend in cash and the remaining value in stock as pointed out in the comments thanks you 'll still get a market price for your trade but the price reduction will have had some impact on the first trade of the day source nyse rule also remember that the dividend yield is expressed in annualized terms so a 3 yield can only be fully realized by receiving all of the dividend payments made by the company for the year you can of course forget about individual companies and just look for dividends to create your own effective yield over time but see the final point finally if you keep buying and selling just to play games with the dividends you 're going to pay far more in transaction fees than you will earn in dividends and depending on your individual circumstances you may end up paying more in capital gains taxes

i would say generally the answer is no    there might be some short term relief to people in certain situations but generally speaking you sign a contract to borrow money and you are responsible to pay   this is why home loans offer better terms then auto loans and auto loans better than credit cards or things like furniture   the better terms offer less risk to the lender because there are assets that can be repossessed   homes retain values better than autos autos better than furniture and credit cards are not secured at all people are not as helpless as your question suggests   sure a person might lose their high paying job but could they still make a mortgage payment if they worked really hard at it   this might mean taking several part time jobs   now if a person buys a home that has a very large mortgage payment this might not be possible   however wise people do n't buy every bit of house they can afford    people should also be wise about the kinds of mortgages they use to buy a home   many people lost their homes due to missing a payment on their interest only loan   penalty rates and fees jacked up their payment that was way beyond their means   if they had a fixed rate loan the chance to catch up would have not been impossible perhaps an injury might prevent a person from working   this is why long term disability insurance is a must for most people   you can buy quite a bit of coverage for not very much money typical us households have quite a bit of debt   car payments phone payments and either a mortgage or rent and of course credit cards   if income is drastically reduced making all of those payments becomes next to impossible   which one gets paid first   just this last week i attempted to help a client in just this situation   they foolishly chose to pay the credit card first and were going to pay the house payment last if there was anything left over   there was n't and they are risking eviction renters      people finding themselves in crisis generally do a poor job of paying the most important things first   basic food first housing and utilities second etc   let the credit card slip if need be no matter how often one is threatened by creditors   they do this to maintain their credit score how foolish i feel like you have a sense of associated with debt   it is there and real despite many people noticing it   there is also the fact that compounding interest is working against you and with your labor you are enriching the bank   this is a great reason to have the goal of living a debt free life   i can tell you it is quite

if you 're referring to times when they pay nothing or receive a refund at the end of the year it 's because they 're paying taxes throughout the year at the end of the year the accountants find that they paid exactly what they needed to or more so they do n't have to pay anything or get money back on their yearly forms   i do n't think there 's a us corporation paying almost zero tax in the us

it is generally best to avoid such situations any credits to your accounts need to be explained to tax authorities whenever they enquire   this can not be treated as income as you did not work in exchange for the amount it can be treated by tax authorities as gift gift upto certain amount is tax free beyond the amount its taxable gifts from close relatives has not amount limit and is tax free whenever the scrutiny happens if you can convince the tax authorities that the action was more for convenience it maybe fine

every bank and credit union in the us has a deposit agreement and disclosures document bank of america is no different our general policy is to make funds from your cash and check deposits    available to you no later   than the first business day after the day    of your deposit however in some cases we place a hold   on funds that    you deposit by check a hold results in a delay in the availability of    these funds that sounds great but for determining the availability of your deposits every day is a    business day except saturdays    and federal holidays    if    you make a deposit on a business day that we are open at one of our    financial centers before    p.m. local time or at one of our atms    before p.m. local time in the state where we   maintain your    account we consider that day to be the day of your deposit however    if you make   a deposit after such times or on a day when we are not    open or that is not a business day we   consider that the deposit was    made on the next business day we are open some locations have     different cutoff times so if you deposit a check on friday afternoon the funds are generally available on tuesday but not always in some cases we will not make all of the funds that you deposit by    check available to you by the   first business day after the day of    your deposit depending on the type of check that you deposit   funds    may not be available until the second business day after the day of    your deposit the first   $ 200 of your deposits however may be    available no later than the first business day after the day   of your    deposit   if we are not going to make all of the funds from your    deposit available by the first business   day after the day of your    deposit we generally notify you at the time you make your deposit we    also tell you when the funds will be available ok what happens when the funds are available in many cases we make funds from your deposited checks available to    you sooner than we   are able to collect the checks this means that    from time to time a deposited check may be   returned unpaid after we    made the funds available to you please keep in mind that even though     we make funds from a deposited check available to you and you withdraw    the funds you are   still responsible for problems with the deposit    if a check you deposited is returned to us unpaid   for any reason you    will have to repay us and we may charge your account for the amount of    the   check even if doing so your account fidelity has a similar document each check deposited is promptly credited to your account   however    the money may not be available until up to six business   days later    and we may decline to honor any debit that is applied   against the    money before the deposited check has cleared if a deposited check does not clear the deposit will be removed   from    your account and you are responsible for returning any   interest you    received on it i would think that the longer holding period for fidelity is due to the fact that they want to wait long enough to make sure that the number of times they have to undo investments due to the funds not clearing is nearly zero

as user quid states in his answer all you need to do is open an account with a stock broker in order to gain access to the world 's stock markets   if you are currently banking with one of the six big bank then they will offer services   you can shop around for the best commission rates   if you wish to manage your own investments then you will open a self directed account   you can shelter your investments from all taxation by opening a tfsa account with your stock broker   currently you can add $ 5,500 per year to your tfsa   unused allowances from previous years can still be used   thus if you have not yet made any tfsa contributions you can add upto $ to your tfsa and enjoy the benefits of tax free investing investing in what you are calling index funds means investing in etfs exchange traded funds once you have opened your account you can invest in any etfs traded on the stock markets accessible through your stock broker buying shares on foreign markets may carry higher commission rates but for the us markets commissions are generally the same as they are for canadian markets   however in the case of buying foreign shares you will carry the extra cost and risk of selling canadian dollars and buying foreign currency   there are also issues to do with foreign withholding taxes when you trade foreign shares directly    in the case of the us you will also need to register with the us tax authorities   foreign withholding taxes payable are generally treated as a tax credit with respect to canadian taxation so you will not be double taxed in today 's market for most investors there is generally no need to invest directly in foreign market indices since you can do so indirectly on the toronto stock market   the large canadian etf providers offer a wide range of us european asian and global etfs as well as canadian etfs   for example you can track all of the major us indices by trading in toronto in canadian dollars   the s&p500 the dow jones and the are offered in both currency hedged and unhedged forms   in addition there are etfs on the total us market us small caps us sectors such as banks and more exotic etfs such as those offering covered call strategies and put write strategies here is a link to the bmo etf website here is a link to the ishares canada etf website

this company was a reputable rating agency for many years see weiss research website ratings section for a very different perspective on martin weiss 's work than the websites with which he is now associated i checked both links provided and agree with the questioner in every way these appear to be highly questionable investment research websites i use such strong terms based on the fact that the website actually uses the pop up ploy   are you sure you want to leave this site clearly something changed between what weiss ratings was in the past per company history since 1971 and what martin weiss is doing now larry seems to have been associated exclusively with questionable websites and high pressure investment advice since 2007 from 1996 through the present he worked as either an employee or contractor of weiss research let 's answer each of your questions   on june 22 2006 the commission instituted settled administrative    proceedings against weiss research inc. martin weiss and lawrence    collectively respondents for violations of the investment    advisers act of 1940 in connection with their operation of an    unregistered investment adviser and the production and distribution of    materially false and misleading marketing materials full details about weiss ratings operations including its history from 1996 through 2001 when it operated in compliance with securities laws then from 2001 through 2005 which was when the sec filed charges for regulatory violations are available from the june 2006 u.s. sec court documents pdf finally this quantitative assessment safe with martin weiss december 2010 by advisory providers of objective research and reviews to aid investing decisions for its readers concluded the following in summary the performance of martin premium services in    aggregate over the past year is the study methodology was good but i recommend reading the article i posted the url to fully understand what caveats and assumptions were done to reach that conclusion

if you just had one expense once a year of $ 1200 you would put in $ 100 a month the average balance is going to be $ 600 in that case the 0 and $ 1200 months average to $ 600 as do the $ 100 and $ 1100 the $ 200 and $ 1000 and so on if you had one expense twice a year of $ 600 and put in $ 100 per month it will average to $ 300 you have a mix of months does 8 months seem reasonable as an average frequency if so there should be about a 4 month slush all the time now instead of one expense averaged over 12 months imagine 12 accounts each needing $ 100 a month if you started at zero you would put in $ 1200 the first month and immediately spend it one account would go from + 100 its share of what you put in to while the rest are all at + 100 overall your balance would be zero then the next month you would again deposit 1200 and spend 1200 bringing one account to one to and the rest to + 200 you average to zero actually on deposit because some of the accounts have negative balances and some have positive but are n't doing that you caught up the months you were   behind so it would be like putting in $ 1200 for the first account $ 1100 for the second $ 1000 for the third and so on a total of $ then you take out $ 1200 and go down to the next month you put in $ 1200 and take out $ 1200 but you will always have that $ amount in there all of the accounts will have positive balances averaging $ 550 in this example

yes you can do what you are contemplating doing and it works quite well just do n't get the university 's payroll office too by going in each june july august and september to adjust your payroll withholding do it at the end of the summer when perhaps most of your contract income for the year has already been received and you have a fairly good estimate for what your tax bill will be for the coming year do n't forget to include social security and medicare taxes both employee 's share as well as employer 's share on your contract income in estimating the tax due the nice thing about paying estimated taxes via payroll deduction is that all that tax money can be counted as having been paid in four equal and timely quarterly payments of estimated tax regardless of when the money was actually withheld from your university paycheck you could if you wanted to and had a fat salary from the university heh heh have all the tax due on your contract income withheld from just your last paycheck of the year but whether you increase the withholding in august or in december do remember to change it back after the last paycheck of the year has been received so that next year 's withholding starts out at a more pace

there many car loans at zero percent interest    finance the car at zero percent then take your money and invest it if you want to be super safe buy a cd the same length as the car loan 5 years you will get 2   if you still want safety and a better return take up a asset allocation strategy that moves your cash to risky assets when the market is performing well then to cash bonds or cds when the market under performs now you have your car with a zero percent loan and you are making the return on the money instead of the car company

the profit maximising level of employment now we consider how many people a business might decide to employ the profit maximising level of employment occurs when a firm hires workers up to the point where the marginal cost of employing an extra worker equals the marginal revenue product of labour i.e. =   this is shown in the labour demand diagram shown below     so the cost of each additional unit of labor is 8 = 8) as the wage is and q = in the short run find the right quantity produced by taking dp of your original inverse demand curve which will give you the marginal revenue of each product set it equal to 8 and solve for q.

4000 miles a year is not a few european average is about 9000 but nevertheless but when it comes to risk then 1 nothing stops you from changing circumstances and drive 10 times as much as in previous the insurance remains the same the only thing the insurance company can do is to charge you more next year taking the miles you 've made this year as a basis for calculations 2 drivers who drive very seldom are a huge risk because of their low experience i know a few people that drive more than 100 miles only a few times a year and on average once a year have accident during that drives it does n't mean that an average sunday driver have similar risk of accident as daily driver but it 's in no way similar   germany switzerland based the whole eu is likely to be the same

my entrepreneurship prof said that in most cases if you really believe in your product idea and it is differentiated from what exists already you can afford to have someone steal your idea and try to make a go of it because you should still be able to do a much better job of it than they can and their heart is nt in it the way yours is    i think ultimately it really depends on the product though you definitely do n't want to try going 2nd to market against someone with superior resources unless you can 100 beat their version of the product by a good margin either on price or quality and hopefully both and you can scale up quickly

those are some very broad questions and i do n't think i can answer them completely but i will add what i can barron 's finance and investment handbook is the best reference book i have found it provides a basic description definition for every type of investment available it covers stocks preferred stocks various forms of bonds as well as mortgage pools and other exotic instruments it has a comprehensive dictionary of finance terms as well i would definitely recommend getting it   the question about how people invest today is a huge one there are people who simply put a monthly amount into a mutual fund and simply do that until retirement on one side and professional day traders who move in and out of stocks or commodities on a daily basis on the other

i agree with mhoran_psprep 's answer but would like to add a few additional points to consider    turbotax and the professional it will send to represent you in case of a tax audit   have no more information about your tax return than what you entered into the program   now there are three or four different kinds of audits    the correspondence audit is the most common kind where irs sends a letter requesting copies of documents supporting a deduction or tax credit that you have claimed representation is hardly necessary in this case    the office audit is more serious where you have to make an appointment and go to the local irs office with paperwork that the examining agent needs to see physically and to answer questions etc   it would be better to be accompanied by a representative at these meetings but office audits are not as common as correspondence audits and because they are expensive for the irs usually occur when the irs is fairly sure of recovering a substantial sum of money   if you have been cutting corners and pushing the envelope in taking large enough deductions to make it worthwhile for the irs to go after you you probably should not have been using turbotax to file your income tax return   but should have been using an accountant or tax preparer who would be   representing you in case of an audit if the reason that you used turbotax   is that no accountant was willing to prepare a tax return with the deductions   that you wished to claim i doubt that having turbotax 's representative with you when you go to the irs office will help you all that much an example of a field audit is when the irs agent comes to your home to see if you actually have a space set aside to use exclusively as your home office as you claimed you did etc a taxpayer compliance measurement program audit is where the   irs randomly chooses returns for statistical checks that taxpayers are complying with the regulations the taxpayer has to prove every line of the return you claim to be filing as married filing jointly bring in your marriage certificate   submit birth certificates and social security cards of your dependent children and so on   yes having turbotax represent you for only $ will help but not if you are not married and can not provide the irs with a marriage certificate etc so pay the fee for peace of mind if you like and as insurance as littleadv suggests   but be sure you understand what you might be getting for the   money   most tax returns selected for audit are selected for what the irs believes are good reasons not at random   if what you said if my tax return is randomly selected for audit they will represent me   is interpreted literally turbotax will represent you only if your return is selected for examination under the program not if it is selected for audit because the irs believes that something is fishy about your return   and as always you get what you pay for

there are two different issues that you need to consider and the answers to these two questions are not always the same   the answer to the first is described in some detail in publication 17 available on the irs website in the absence of any details about your situation other than what is in your question e.g. is either salary from self employment wages that you or your spouse is paying you   are you or your spouse eligible to be claimed as a dependent by someone else are you an alien etc   which of the various apply to you can not be determined and so i will not state a specific number or confirm that what you assert in your question is correct   furthermore even if you are not required to file an income tax return you might want to choose to file a tax return anyway the most common reason for this is that if your employer withheld   income tax from your salary and sent it to the irs on your behalf but your tax liability for the year is zero then in the absence of a filed tax return the irs will not refund the tax withheld to you nor will your employer return the   withheld money to you saying oops we made a mistake last year   that money is gone an and non tax deductible gift   from you to the us government so while i am not required to file an income tax return and i refuse to do voluntarily what i am not   required to do   is a very stand to take it can have monetary consequences another reason to file a tax return even when one is not required to do so is to claim the earned income tax credit eitc if you qualify for it as publication 17 says in chapter 36 qualified persons must file a tax return even if you    a do not owe any tax    b did not earn enough money to file a return    or    c did not have income taxes withheld from your pay in order to claim the credit in short read publication 17 for yourself and decide whether you are required to file an income tax return and if you are not whether it is worth your while to file the tax return anyway note to readers preparing to down vote this answer is and says things that are far too well known to everybody and especially to you but please remember that they might not be quite so well known to the op

's the real scoop i would hire more people and buy more inventory and put more into capital investment if i paid less taxes   you would do so if there was money to be made doing so    it 's as simple as that    corporate taxes are on net income     if hiring one more person contributed further to your bottom line you 'd do so     that is the only thing that drives you    if the incremental cost of the hire is lower than the increased revenue    period   corporate taxes are on net income    meaning you 're still going to get more money you 're just going to get a little less of that incremental income growth than you thought     you 'll still hire

i 've given up on trying to understand how the allowances correspond to my number of dependents    what i do instead to achieve the same end goal of having the right amount of money withheld is using a paycheck calculator if i get paid 24 times a year twice a month and i figure i 'm going to owe about $ 6,000 of taxes then every paycheck needs to have $ 250 of federal tax withheld from it to make sure i am covered go to the paycheck calculator and play with the allowance numbers until you get $ 250 as the federal tax withheld and then submit a new w4 to your employer this is the only reliable way i 've found to figure this out on my own   because my calculations are done in dollars instead of exemptions etc and my taxes do not wildly fluctuate year to year this works well for me

first i 'd recommend that you separate short term assets from long term assets in your head   short term assets are earmarked for spending on something specific in the near future or are part of your emergency fund   these should be kept in cash or short bond funds    long term assets are assets that you can take some risks with and are n't going to spend in the next few years   under normal circumstances i 'd recommend 80 bonds or even 70/30 for someone your age assuming you 're saving mainly for retirement and thus have a correspondingly long time horizon   these portfolios historically are much less risky than 100 stock and only return slightly less    right now though i think that anyone who does n't absolutely need safety keep 100 of their long term assets in stocks   i 'm 26 and this is my asset allocation   bond yields are absolutely pathetic by historical standards   even ten year treasury yields are comparable to s&p 500 dividend yields and likely wo n't outperform inflation if held to maturity   the stock market is modestly undervalued when measured by difference between current p e ratio and the historical average and more severely undervalued when you account for the effects of reduced inflation transaction costs and capital gains taxes on fair valuation   therefore the potential reward for taking risk is much higher now than it usually is

and i 'm mad that everyone 's mad stop being mad d   but seriously chill out there are legitimate reasons to keep money in your checking account and it is not a moronic move a more moronic move would be to have no money available on hand in the event of an emergency like if your own a house and your boiler breaks or if you get in an accident and have to shell out money for medical bills or if you want to save up so you can pay your larger loans off in full so you do n't accrue interest on them e.g. college loans

i agree   finding success in life is hard   it will probably always be hard   there is no need for us to exacerbate the issue by not helping those we can help or by blaming them for their failures when we never taught them how to succeed either   gt;in order to acquire capital you need to do productive things which are productive to some degree to society as a whole   unless you inherit it   the problem is there are tons of non productive ways to build capital that require capital   stocks and futures monopolies law manipulation media manipulation etc   there are few methods to gain capital if you have low capital that are n't controlled by someone with large capital   and this is okay so long as those with low capital have sufficient avenues to increase their capital acquisition     it also does n't help that capital they do have is now worth less than it used to be   a minimum wage job used to be sufficient to pay for a year of college   now it is n't even sufficient to pay for housing   you ca n't just acquire more capital because existence itself costs capital   you need food water a place to stay warmth a way for people to reach you and a reliable method of transportation   you probably also need access to a computer and the internet   all of these repeatedly cost capital and you already entered with low capital   i do n't believe our capitalist system is a good reflection of s d anymore   i believe it represents control by those with the most     isps have local monopolies because people ca n't easily move and a startup isp is expensive   pharmaceuticals have a monopoly on new medicines that people need to survive   it 's kind of a health system   net neutrality is being attacked because isps want to be able to charge and control who can access what   like any company they want to thrive   we are letting our freedom be sold off one piece at a time because profit not people are the most important thing   at least that is where i see things heading

that makes sense though since i live in a small town with few tech jobs available and glassdoor is a good deciding factor when the very little that is available offer little return compared to bigger cities i am not comfortable moving to the big city just yet since i have n't established myself in the field and competing in a big industrialized city does n't assure that i will find a job easy lemon from where i am just yet therefore it 's good to stick around and find something to build experience i am just hoping to do it before the tech market and these jobs either become scarce or are n't very profitable anymore since public schools and community efforts offer coding classes and seminars in several cities and communities in hopes of retraining people when this specialized skill becomes that common it might become as valuable as fast food cashiers since everyone wants to learn i do n't want to compete in a market in that state it 's all very scary but there are several people on the internet convincing people to not go to college i live in a town that takes this advice and i know there are several hundred more like it so i have that going for me    anyway glassdoor does effect smaller businesses that have no benefits and just a non standardized work cultures basically it 's a bit of a toss up on how you will be treated in a small company since unlike google do n't list their terms and conditions plus their policies on their website if they have one and if they bother i know big corporations might not need to worry about glassdoor reviews unless they work in chapters rather than having a huge hq in one place that hires thousands i would imagine a small business has more to be afraid of when it comes to glass door brand wise

you 're losing money and a lot of it consider this the inflation is 2 4 a year officially depending on your spending pattern your own rate might be quite higher you earn about 1/2 i.e. you 're losing 3 a year guaranteed you can do much better without any additional risk 0.1 on savings account why not 0.9 on line savings account ally american express e*trade etc give much higher rates than what you have current ally rates are 0.9 on a regular savings account 9 times more than what you have with no additional risk its a fdic insured deposit you can get a slightly higher rate with cds at the same bank for 12 months deposit ira why is it in cd 's its the longest term investment you have that 's where you can and should take risks to maximize your compounding returns not doing that is actually more risky to you because you 're guaranteeing compounding loss of the said 3 a year on average more volatile stock investments have shown to be not losing money over periods of decades even if they do lose money over shorter periods rental if you can buy a property that you would pay the same amount of money for as for a comparable rental you should definitely buy your debt will be secured by the property and since you 're paying the same amount or less you 're earning the equity there 's no risk here just benefits which again you chose to forgo in the worst case if you default and walk away from the property you lost exactly or less what you would have paid for a rental anyway 14 years old car may be cheaper than 4 years old to buy but consider the maintenance licensing and repairs will it not some up to more than the difference in my experience it is likely to bottom line you think you 're risk averse but you 're exactly the opposite of that

there is no generic formula as such but you can work it out using all known incomes and expenses and by making some educated you should know your buying costs which include the purchase price legal fees taxes in australia we have stamp duty which is a large state based tax when you purchase a property other things to consider include estimates for any repairs and/or renovations also you should look at the long term growth in your area and use this as an estimate of your potential growth over the period you wish to hold the property and estimate the agent fees if you were to sell and the depreciation on the building these things including the agent fees when selling and building depreciation will all be added or deducted to your cost base to determine the amount of capital gain when and if you sell the property you then need to multiply this gain by the capital gains tax rate to determine the capital gains tax you may have to pay from all the items above you will be able to estimate the net capital gain after all taxes you could expect to make on the property over the period you are looking to hold it for in regards to holding and renting the property things you will need to consider include the rent the long term growth of rent in your area and all the expenses including loan fees and interest insurance rates land tax and an estimate of the annual maintenance cost per year also you would need to consider any depreciation deductions you can claim other things you will need to consider is the change in these values as time goes by and provide an estimate for these in your calculations any increase in the value of land will increase the amount of rates and the land tax you pay and generally your insurance and maintenance costs will increase with time however your interest and mortgage repayments will reduce over time will your rent increases cover your increases in the expenses from all the items above you should be able to work out an estimate of your net rental gain or loss for each year again do this for the number of years you are looking to hold the property for and then sum up the total to give a net profit or loss if there is a net loss from the income then you need to consider if the net capital gain will cover these losses and still give you a reasonable return over the period you will own the property below is a sample calculation showing most of the variables i have discussed

i 'm going to start with your title question how can home buying be considered a sound investment with all of that interest that needs to be paid if taken literally this is a loaded question because if you pay cash for a home you do n't pay any interest furthermore if your interest rate is 3 for 10 years you wo n't pay nearly as much interest as you will if your rate is 10 for 30 years so all of that interest is relative to your personal situation having said that of course i understand what you mean most people pay interest and interest is expensive so how do you calculate if it 's worth it that question has been asked and answered but for your particular situation you really have two separate questions i believe you should answer these questions independently if you move far away it 's probably the case that you can save a lot of money by either renting or buying in that location so you should first consider if it 's worth it to move and then if it is decide if it 's worth it to rent or buy if you decide not to move far away then decide if maybe you can save money by renting somewhere near your current home since it sounds like if you move you may have to become a landlord living close by to your tenant may also make it easier to deal with problems when they arise

of course but then paper also has utility so do seashells and    there is no obvious reason why even in a perfect world we would go looking for a malleable highly conductive corrosion resistant metal as something to peg the value of our banknotes to    the argument in favor of a gold standard is not whether gold is intrinsically more valuable than paper or seal skins or anything else it 's that gold is fairly inelastic in terms of supply so it limits the ability of central bankers to mess up the value of the currency through funny business    if you picked up a rock and started going around telling people that we should use it as money because it 's highly malleable and conductive and can be used in computer parts they would look at you like you 're a crazy person that 's not why gold is was should be a currency    gold was the perfect currency for thousands of years because it was easy to identify easy to handle hard to and rare those were important characteristics when strangers had to carry physical money to different places without any atms credit cards or paypal accounts they are somewhat less critical today but still   the one characteristic that might still argue in favor of a gold standard is rarity since the amount of gold in the world is somewhat fixed forcing the currency supply to be restricted to the gold supply semi prevents governments and central bankers from getting into too much or at least that 's the theory    i will leave it to others to argue over whether a return to the gold standard would be a good idea but the argument has nothing to with the intrinsic utility of gold i 'm sure we can all agree that gold is a fine metal with many good qualities

the setting of interest rates or repurchase rates varies from country to country as well as with the independence of the central bank there are a number of measurements and indices that central bankers can take into account this is a limited overview but should give an indication of just how complex tracking inflation is let alone attempting to control it   house prices are in the mix but which house or which price the choice of what to measure faces the difficulty of attempting to find a basket which really affects the majority regularly and not everyone is buying several new houses a year so the majority are ring from fluctuations in prices at the capital end but not from the interest rate end and this is only when the various agencies statistics central bank labour etc are independent   in countries like venezuela or argentina government has taken over release of such data and it is frequently at odds with individual experience links for the us and for australia

in addition to the possibility of buying gold etfs or tradable certificates there are also firms specializing in providing bank accounts of sorts which are denominated in units of weight of precious metal while these usually charge some fees they do meet your criteria of being able to buy and sell precious metals without needing to store them yourself also these fees are likely lower than similar storage arranged by yourself depending on the specifics they may also make buying small amounts practical buying small amounts of physical precious metals usually comes with a large mark up over the spot price sometimes to the tune of a 50 or so immediate loss if you buy and then immediately sell do note that as pointed out by john bensin buying gold gets you an amount of metal the local currency value of which will vary over time sometimes wildly so it is not the same thing as depositing the original amount of money in a bank account since 2006 the price of an ounce about grams of gold has gone from under $ 500 us to over $ 1800 us to under $ 1100 us few other investment classes are anywhere near this volatile if you are interested in this type of service you might want to check out not the same thing at all as bitcoin or i am not affiliated with either make sure to do your research thoroughly as these may or may not be covered by the same regulations as regular banks particularly if you choose a company based outside of or a storage location outside of your own country

indeed you are correct sir but my response would be does the customer regulator not also have a model and can a financial company exist without these two stakeholders explicit endorsement models always have assumptions the key is figuring out what they are and why they should or should n't be made i would argue that any investor sophisticated enough to be around with leveraged etfs cds index tranches or illiquid long dated interest rate swaps better have a damn good reason to buy em and if their model breaks is that the fault of the bank or the customer

i pretty much only use my checking what 's the downside checking accounts do n't pay as much interest as savings account oh but wait interest rates have been zero for nearly 10 years so there is very little benefit to keeping money in my savings account in fact i had two savings accounts and well fargo closed one of them because i had n't used it in years downsides of savings accounts you are limited to 5 transfers per month into or out of them no such limit with checking upsides of savings accounts well maybe you will be less likely to spend the money why do n't you just have your pay go into your checking and then just transfer extra money out of it rather than the reverse if you want to put money away so that you save it assuming you 're in the open a traditional ira max deposit of $ and it reduces your taxable income it 's not a bad idea to have a separate account that you do n't touch except for in an emergency but for me the direction of flow is from work to checking to savings

that depends where you put the top bracket but probably there is little way to jack income tax to anywhere near that without serious detrimental effect to the economy the real issue is not that the wealthiest earn too much but that they have too much there is a huge glut of massive savings at the top that is continually growing and taking money from the economy this savings drives the creation of public debt more than any other factor it is that which needs to be at least in the near term taxed aggressively

when a house is sold at a foreclosure auction the selling bank usually does not provide the guarantees that a normal house seller provides   furthermore the previous owner may have neglected the property and/or damaged the property   bank owned properties are often neglected and/or   banks are usually too short sighted to properly market the real estate they own and do a poor job of making it easy to buy the property thus foreclosure sales usually happen at a price that is significantly below the fair market value of sales between competent households   it is common for a house that is worth $ 125,000 even in a depressed market to sell for only $ 100,000 in a short sale or foreclosure it is possible that this property sold for an even larger discount   it is also possible that the tax assessor is inadvertently comparing a run down property with well maintained properties that have extra expensive features without fully adjusting for the properties conditions and features   in the latter scenario the property owner can ask the tax assessor to re consider the assessment   usually this request is called an appeal

will pull your credit report and perform a hard inquiry on your file this means the inquiry will be noted in your credit report and count against you slightly this is perfectly normal just do n't apply too many times too soon or it can begin to add up they will want proof of your income by asking for recent pay stubs with this information your income and your credit profile they will determine the maximum amount of credit they will lend you and at what interest rate the better your credit profile the more money they can lend and the lower the rate   you want financed the price of the car minus your down payment that is the amount you can apply for and in that case the only factors they will determine are 1 whether or not you will be approved and 2 at what interest rate you will be approved while interest rates generally follow the direction of the prime rate as dictated by the federal reserve there are market fluctuations and variances from one lending institution to the next further different institutions will have different criteria in terms of the amount of credit they deem you worthy of   know the price of the car now determine how much you want to put down and take the difference to a bank or credit union or work directly with the dealer dealers often give special deals if you finance through them a common scenario is 1 a person goes to the car dealer 2 test drives 3 negotiates the purchase price 4 the salesman works the numbers to determine your monthly payment through their own bank pay attention during that last process this is also where they can gain leverage in the deal and make money through the interest rate by offering longer loan terms to maximize their returns on your loan it 's not necessarily a bad thing it 's just how they have to make their money in the deal it 's good to know so you can form your own analysis of the deal and make sure they do n't completely bankrupt you   that you can comfortable afford your monthly payment the car dealers do n't really know how much you can afford they will try to determine to the best they can but only you really know do n't take more than you can afford be conservative about it for example think you can only afford $ 300 a month budget it even lower and make yourself only afford $ 225 a month

as with most things accounting tax related it depends in general though yes as an example if the client were to buy equipment on credit before fiscal year end in lets say december but did not pay until the next year started in january then under cash basis they would not have the purchase accounted for until they made payment that means they could not claim any deductions from the purchase under accrual the purchase would have been put on the books in december when the equipment was installed and they would have been able to claim any deductions

i will add one point missing from the answers by cqm and when you take a loan and invest the proceeds the interest that you pay on the loan is deductible on schedule a line 14 of your federal income tax return under the category of investment interest expense   if the   interest expense is larger than all your investment earnings not just those from the loan proceeds then you can deduct at most the amount of the earnings and carry over the excess investment interest paid this year for deduction   against investment earnings in future years also if some of the earnings are long term capital gains and you choose to deduct the corresponding investment interest expense then those capital gains are taxed as ordinary income instead of at the favored ltcg rate you also have the option of choosing to deduct only that amount of interest that offsets dividend and short term capital gain income that is taxed at ordinary rates pay tax at the ltcg rate on the capital gains and carry over rest of the interest for deduction in future years in previous years when the tax laws called for   reduction in the schedule a deductions for high income earners this investment interest expense was exempt from the reduction whether future tax laws will allow this exemption depends on congress so this should be taken into account when dealing with the taxes issue in deciding whether to take a loan to invest in the stock market

today the rates are arrived simply on the basis of demand and supply historically rates were pegged to gold when all currencies were printed depending on the gold reserves so if one country printed 100 units of currency of a of gold and other country 10 units of currency for 1 gm of gold the rate would be 1:10 however in the with shortages of gold and other reasons usd became the default standard so the rate started being pegged to the usd reserves the countries started maintaining however later in the early us backing out the rate purely started getting pegged to market demand and supply so for most currencies there was a default rate to begin with and today its changed incase of usd eur the initial rate was determined by the weighted average of the currencies that it sought to replace after that its been market supply and demand since most of the trade in international market is us denominated largest being oil each country has created a huge reserves of usd so technically if china were to bank half its usd denominated treasury bills the usd would come crashing down but then china itself would be at disadvantage as its value of usd its holding would become less and it can not buy the same items hence all countries keep hording usd and this means us if they print more money the value will not come down because it that happens all countries holding usd would loose their value of reserve in essence a country can print as much as currency it wants if its debts and trades are denominated in local currencies this is 100 true for us and hence it can get away by printing money this is also true to a large extent for japan as bulk of its debts are denominated in jpy

if you read joel greenblatt 's the little book that beats the market he says owning two stocks eliminates 46 of the non market risk of owning just one stock     this risk is reduced by 72 with 4 stocks by 81 with 8 stocks by 93 with 16 stocks by 96 with 32 stocks and by 99 with 500 stocks   conclusion after purchasing 6 8 stocks benefits of adding stocks to decrease risk are small    overall market risk wo n't be eliminated merely by adding more stocks   and that 's just specific stocks so you 're very right that allocating a 1 share to a specific type of fund is not going to offset your other funds by much you are correct that you can emulate the lifecycle fund by simply buying all the underlying funds but there are two caveats generally these funds are supposed to be cheaper than buying the separate funds individually check over your math and make sure everything is in order call the fund manager and tell him about your findings and see what they have to say if you are going to emulate the lifecycle fund be sure to stay on top of rebalancing one advantage of buying the actual fund is that the portfolio distributions are managed for you so if you 're going to buy separate etfs make sure you 're rebalancing as for whether you need all those funds my answer is a definite no consider mark cuban 's blog post wall street 's new lie to main street asset allocation although there are some highly questionable points in the article one portion is clear   let me translate this all for you i want you to invest in cash and the rest in 10 different funds about which you know absolutely nothing i want you to make this investment knowing that even if there were 128 hours in a day and you had a year long vacation you could not possibly begin to understand all of these products in fact i do n’t understand them either but because i know it sounds good and everyone is making the same kind of recommendations we all can pretend we are smart and going to make a lot of money until we do n’t standard theory says that you want to invest in low cost funds like those provided by vanguard and you want to have enough variety to protect against risk although i ca n't give a specific allocation recommendation because i do n't know your personal circumstances you should ideally have some in us equities us fixed income international equities commodities of varying sizes to have adequate diversification as defined by theory you can either do your own research to establish a distribution or speak to an investment advisor to get help on what your target allocation should be

defined benefit plans defined benefit plans are disappearing because of their high cost to the companies that provide them   when an employee retires the company must pay his pension for the rest of his life even longer if the pension includes a survivor option   thus the company 's financial burden grows as more employees retire    by law they must provide a fund that has sufficient resources to pay all present and future pensions   low interest rates such as we have now place a greater burden on the amount that must be in these funds    for these reasons most companies including large ones like ibm and lockheed martin have discontinued their pension plans and provide only defined contribution plans    defined contribution plans these require the company to only make contributions while the employee is working   once the employee retires the company 's responsibility ends   usually these plans employ a 401 k type savings plan for which the employee contributes and the companies matches some or all of that contribution   comparison although a fully company paid pension plan is the best it is now almost unavailable   the defined contribution plan if it includes company matching can be a viable alternative if the investments are chosen wisely and perform as expected   of course this is not guaranteed but is probably the best option that most working people have at this time

the big risk for a bank in country x is that they would be unfamiliar with all the lending rules and regulations in country y. what forms and disclosures are required and all the national and local steps that would be required a mistake could leave them exposed or in violation of some obscure law plus they would n't have the resources in country y to verify the existence and the actual ownership of the property the fear would be that it was a scam this would likely cause them to have to charge a higher interest rate and higher fees not to mention that the currency ratio will change over the decades    the risks would be large

profit has nothing to do with the level of interest rates is this correct in theory yes the difference that you 're getting at is called net interest margin as long as this stays constant so does the bank 's profit according to this article as long as the interest rate charged on loans does n't decline faster than the interest rate received on deposit accounts banks can continue to operate normally or even reduce their bad loan exposure by offering lower lending rates to already proven borrowers so banks may be able to acquire the same net interest margin with lower risk however the article also mentions new research from a federal agency their findings show that net interest margins get worse during low rate environments defined as any time when a country 's three month sovereign bond yield is less than 1.25 so in theory banks should remain profitable when interest rates are low but this may not actually be the case

this may be a controversial opinion but i think this makes great business sense   they found that the cost of running two battery production lines 60 amp 75 exceeded the cost of providing the slightly more expensive battery for every s60 customer   they also gain the benefit of enriching the resale market and providing customer choice   i do n't think that most people here realize that software locking functionality is a very common practice across manufacturers and industries to reduce manufacturing costs and provide customer options   what is rare is the ability to unlock after purchase   for example my last vw was a golf and it shared the same with several other vw lines including more expensive offerings with more premium features   one of these premium features is a package that enables you to roll your windows up and down from your key by holding the unlock or lock button but my car did not come with that option in fact no golf at the time came with it   the package was not enabled but the software and hardware was there   you can grab yourself a usb cable and software and go enable it yourself and a number of other nice features   all of this said i think we are in the early days of dlc   remember when you could by a full game for $ 50 and play it for a year and then some dlc would come out and give you reason to play again for $ 5 or $ 10   then companies cough ea cough came along and started to make the dlc part of what you needed to have the full experience on day 1   yea that is bad   i am in support of what tesla has done so far but the second they or possibly another manufacturer looking to capitalize on the idea of dlc starts removing standard bits to make them post facto we may be getting into a bad place

in addition to the answer from cqm let me answer your am i missing anything question then i 'll talk about how your approach of simplifying this is making it both harder and easier for you last i 'll show what my model for this would look like but if you are n't capable of stacking this up yourself then you really should n't be borrowing 10,000 to try to make money on the margin am i missing anything yes you 're forgetting 1 taxes specifically income tax and 2 sales fees   on the first you have not considered anything in your financial model for taxes you should include at least 25 of your expected returns going to taxes because anything that you buy and then sell within 12 months is taxed as income not capital gains on the second you will incur sales commissions and/or transaction fees depending on the brokerage you are using for your plan these tend to vary widely but i would expect to spend at least $ 25 per sale so if i were building out this model i would think that your break even would have to at least cover monthly interest + monthly principal payment income tax when sold commissions and broker 's fees every time you sell holdings on over simplifying you have the right idea with thinking about both interest and principal in trying to sketch this out but as i mentioned above you 're making this both harder and easier for yourself you are making it harder because you are doing the math wrong the actual payment for this loan assuming it is a normal loan can be found most easily with the pmt function in excel = nper pv fv = 24 0 that returns a monthly payment   of principal + interest of   so you actually are over calculating the payment by $ with your ballpark approach however you did n't actually have all the factors in the model to begin with so that does n't matter much   you are making it artificially easier because you have not thought about the impact of repaying principal what i mean is this in your question you indicate   i 'm guessing the necessary profit is just the total interest on this loan = = $ 720 usd so i 'll break even on this loan if and only if i make $ 720 from stocks over 24 months so the rate of return is + 720 = this sounds all you need is a total return across two years but assuming this is a normal loan and not an interest only loan you have to get rid of your capital a little bit at a time to pay back the loan in essence you will pay back 1/3 of your principal the first year and then you have to keep making the same fixed interest + principal payments out of a smaller base of capital   so for the first few months you can cover the interest easily but by the end you have to be making phenomenal returns to cover it   here is how i would build a model for it i actually did and your breakeven is about per month at that outstanding annual return you would be earning a whopping $ 4 at least as far as the variables are concerned you need to be considering your current capital balance because month 1 you may have $ 10,000 but month 2 you have just after paying back some principal   your rate of return if you do this in excel you can play with it some but you should save the time and just invest somewhere else your actual return that month rate of return existing capital balance   loan payment = for the parameters you gave earlier   income tax = actual return .25 with this kind of loan you 're not actually making enough to preserve the 10,000 capital and you 're selling everything you 've gained each month   commission = $ 25 per month assuming that covers your trade fees and broker commissions i guarantee you that this is not the deal breaker in the model so do n't get excited if you think i 'm over estimating this and you realize that scottrade or somewhere will let you have trades at $ each    monthly ending balance = = next month 's starting capital balance   stack it all up in excel for 24 months and see for yourself if you like the key thing you left out is that you 're repaying each month out of capital that you 'd like to use to invest with this makes you need much higher returns   even if your initial description was n't clear and this is an interest only loan you 're still looking at a rate of about 7.6 annually that you need to hit in order to just break even on the costs of holding the loan and transferring your gains into cash

if you have doubts about the long term prospects at your employer or jobs in your area you may want to keep the option of moving to find a new job open while you save up for a larger down payment on a house   while there are insurance products out there that claim to cover your mortgage they often have loopholes which make them difficult to collect on insurance companies are in business to make money and premiums are high when it 's likely that people will try to collect splitting those premiums into your mortgage and your own self insured unemployment fund i.e. an emergency fund in a money market bank account will usually be a better deal as always make sure you have term life insurance for a family and long term disability insurance just in case something really bad happens in the near term buying a home is a better financial decision when you know you 'll be in an area for at least 5 years saving until you have 20 down on place that you can afford to pay off in 15 years even if you take a 30 year loan will be a lot cheaper and less stressful

issuing selling equity vs debt is often done during very different periods of a company 's life cycle and for very different reasons   if i were to generalize equity is most typically involved in the beginning and end of a business debt in the middle     in the beginning your company has no cash flow no track record so the only people willing to invest are angels venture capitalists true believers friends amp family   people who are willing to take risk either because they like you or they believe there is a chance of high risk high reward   in the middle of the life cycle when the company has a demonstrated track record it is easier to issue debt because you have stable cash flows which banks find attractive   banks are low risk low return investors   towards the end of a company 's life cycle the owners may decide they have successfully grown a business and want to retire or start a new business or maybe they just want to lock in the earnings they 've achieved which are sitting in the company   in this case they may sell the company entirely to a rival firm or a private equity group    i feel like op 's original question is a bit off because i do n't find too many situations where a company is seriously considering both equity and debt alternatives   usually it is a variety of equity offerings or a variety of debt offerings and you 're trying to figure out which one is better of the company

if you keep the monthly payment the same and the interest is lower then you will be by definition overpaying the new loan therefore it will be paid off sooner based on some quick calculations it will be paid off approximately 5 years sooner one advantage to the new loan is that you will have flexibility you can drop the payment to the lower level for a few months because of a big financial problem and not be in default

it 's my understand that leasing is never the better overall deal with the possible exception of a person who would otherwise buy a brand new car every 2 or 3 years and does not drive a lot of miles note in the case of a company car canadian taxes let you deduct the entire lease payment which clearly has some principal in it if you lease while if you buy you can only deduct the interest and must depreciate the car according to their schedule this can make leasing more attractive to those buying a car through a corporation i do n't know if this applies in the us the numbers you ran through in class presumably involved calculating the interest paid over the term of the loan can you not just redo the calculation using actual interest and lease numbers from a randomly chosen current car ad i suspect if you do you will discover leasing is still not the right choice

the wording of this question is very confusing because primary signer would in ordinary parlance mean the person borrowing the money and the co signer not would mean the one who is guaranteeing the repayment of the loan if the borrower does not pay the co signer is liable for making the payments whose name is on the title of the car who borrowed the money to buy the car is the loan in your name and your son co signed the loan to induce the bank to loan you money to purchase the car or is it the other way around that your son borrowed the money and you co signed the loan in order to induce the bank to loan your son the money if the car title and the loan are in your name are you defaulting on the loan and so your son is making the loan payments that should have come from you or is it that your son borrowed the money to buy the car his name is on the title he is making the payments and you are no longer interested in backing him up in case he defaults and the bank comes after you for the money

i agree with you most of what you 're saying but there is still the fundamental conflict at the bottom of all of this   you are saying that the public accounting firms should do these things when they are in fact just businesses which are by definition amoral   the public in public accounting is misleading here for the firms are privately held owned organizations   of course there are going to be benefits for acting in accordance to these standards but if they can reasonably get away with it then why would n't they   edit   your comment in regards to the inefficiency of government audits is an excellent point though

the roth traditional decision is complex but can be broken down into a set of simple rules   ideally you want to choose to tax your money at the lowest possible rate this specifically refers to your marginal rate the rate you last $ 100 was taxed or next $ 100 of income with be taxed that in itself is another issue answered with questions here discussing marginal rates   my suggestion has been that if you are in the 15 bracket use roth and continue to do so until you hit 25 at that point begin to shift to the traditional pre tax 401(k or ira my article the 15 solution goes into detail on this although it references the 2013 tax rates i need to re edit if you are already in the 25 bracket i 'd suggest just going pre tax given the ability to convert it 's not as if there are 2 points in time deposit and withdrawal but you can decide every year if your situation changes it 's not uncommon to get married have a baby buy a house and find you just dropped back down to 15 marginal rate when you were solidly 25 prior   let me explain why you should go 100 pretax if already at 25   a single person hits the top of the 15 bracket in 2017 at $ taxable add the standard deduction and exemption and you are at $ the tax on this is $ less than 10 average despite the next $ 100 being taxed at 25 it would take over $ 1 m to have an account large enough to withdraw $ 40k yr   if you blow through that number you hit 25 i agree but why pay 25 now for sure to avoid maybe hitting 25 later you have decades of opportunities for conversion and even more when the funds are transferred to iras if you have a job change and the conversion discussion has multiple layers when the ira is involved say you are too successful you are hitting $ 2 m before age 55 if you retire you can withdraw from the 401(k penalty free but you have 15 years before you 'd start to take ss benefits 15 years to use conversions even if pushing into 25 to reduce the impact of ss taxation   my advice is not a set and forget solution it 's an annual evaluation of the plan for the coming year   further notes on my choice of 15 solution this is the 2017 tax table for singles   i note that median individual income is k which puts that median single at ~20 k taxable this is where the analysis begins this earner might have upward mobility to reach the 25 bracket and begin to save pre tax the goal would be to have a mix of pre post tax money so that over the course of their life the 25 bracket was avoided perhaps completely   in general my writing tend towards the second highest quintile the 60 80 slice of the population the numbers might appear arbitrary but in the end the discussion has to start someplace the concept i described here is best implemented by the single or couple who is still at 15 but soon pushing higher than the line this enables them to start by saving in the roth and slowly shifting towards pre tax the final mix at retirement depends on that timing as well as their opportunities for conversions along the way   part of my focus on that line is that the differential is greatest in bracket shifts between 15 and 25 much of the benefit in the whole discussion is in that shift depositing at 25 yet withdrawing at 15 the 28 couple might wish to avoid the 33 bracket at retirement but that level of income impacts far fewer people and fewer still that are either reading these boards or my other writing

here 's a simple example for a put from both sides assume xyz stock trades at $ 200 right now   let 's say john writes a $ 190 out of the money put on xyz stock and sells this put to for the premium which is say $ 5 assume the strike date or date of settlement is 6 months from now   thus is long one put option and john is short one put option the writer of the option is short the option on settlement date let 's assume two different scenarios 1 if the price of the stock decreases by $ 50 then the put that bought is in the money 's profit can be calculated as being strike price 190 current stock price 150 premium paid 5 = $ 35 so not including any transaction fees that is a $ 35 dollar return on a $ 5 investment 2 if the price of the stock increases by $ 50 then the put that bought is worthless and her loss was 100 or her entire $ 5 premium   for john he made $ 5 in 6 months in reality you need collateral and good credit to be able to write sizable option positions

it 's impossibly difficult to time the market generally speaking you should buy low and sell high picking 25 as an arbitrary ceiling on your gains seems incorrect to me because sometimes you 'll want to hold a stock for longer or sell it sooner and those decisions should be based on your research or if you need the money not an arbitrary number to answer your questions if the reasons you still bought a stock in the first place are still valid then you should hold and/or buy more if something has changed and you ca n't find a reason to buy more then consider selling keep in mind you 'll pay capital gains taxes on anything you sell that is not in a tax deferred e.g. retirement account no it does not make sense to do a wash sale where you sell and buy the same stock capital gains taxes are one reason i 'm not sure why you would ever want to do this what reasons were you considering you can always sell just some of the shares see above and link regarding wash sales buying more of a stock you already own is called dollar cost averaging it 's an effective method when the reasons are right dca minimizes variance due to buying or selling a large amount of shares at an arbitrary single day price and instead spreads the cost or sale basis out over time all that said there 's nothing wrong with locking in a gain by selling all or some shares of a winner buy low sell high

the company released its 2nd quarter revenue of $ a couple days ago however the stock did not move up in any way why if the company is making money should n't the stock go up during the time between earnings announcements analysts occasionally publish their assessment of a company including their estimate of the company 's value and future earnings and as part of an earnings report companies often include guidance their prediction for the upcoming quarter this will frequently be a conservative estimate so they 're more likely to achieve it investors make their purchase and sale decisions based on this information when the earnings report comes out investors compare these actual returns to analysts predictions and the company 's guidance if their results are in line with these predictions the stock price is unlikely to move much as those results are already incorporated into the stock price if the company is doing better than predicted it 's usually a good sign and the price often rises conversely if it 's doing worse the price will likely fall but it 's not as simple as this as others have explained for long term investors stock prices are based on expectations of future activity if the results of that quarter include some one time actions that are unlikely to repeat investors will often discount that portion

i say before investing your real capital into the stock market play around on the virtual stock exchange game it let 's you invest with virtual capital and you can gain experience with the stock market i would n't start investing in stock until i 'm sure i can cover losses though if you do intend to invest stocks so early in your career then you should learn how to read sec filings not necessary but helpful in understanding how investors think such as documents so you can predict profitability and growth of companies you invest in once you become a veteran of the stock market game you probably wo n't need to read the sec filings into too much detail especially if you have a diverse portfolio good luck the one takeaway from this message would probably be stop and play around on virtual stocks before yourself in the real thing

it is worth noting first that interest and short term dividends capital gains are all taxed at the same rate so all the investments below i mention even savings accounts will be taxed at the same rate   also even short term capital losses can often be harvested to reduce your tax rate in many countries while it is worth paying attention to the taxes when investing in the short term the more important factor is how much risk that you can take or want to take with the money   most equity portfolios like the s&p index give a much higher risk that there will be much less in the account when you need to buy   you generally have a higher expected return with equity but as you mention that return is very random over such a short period over such a short variable period many people will invest in short term bond index funds or just keep the fund in a high yielding savings account   with the savings account your money is guaranteed   short term bond funds will have generally higher yields but a small chance you may lose money in the short term some people can trade short term bond indices for free with their broker but if you ca n't be sure to include the trading costs when thinking about which investment to use as with how low yields are currently the fees may eat up any advantage you gain

it requires fairly large levels of capital but what about seed funding angel investments in startups this would be before venture capital gets involved so the amounts are relatively low tens of thousands vs. millions of usd but as valuations this early in the game are also low you can get a significant portion of equity in a startup that you feel is being run by good people and is in a promising market paul graham of y has a number of articles about this from both sides of the table that you can take a look at and see if this is for you it 's definitely very high risk but if you can pick successful startups before their valuation shoots up get some equity help them succeed and they eventually go public or get acquired you can stand to bring in some big returns note that this is n't a hands off investment you 'll need to build connections in the startup community and it is n't uncommon for angel investors to become involved in the day to day operations of the businesses in which they invest

you could buy options i do not know what your time horizon is but it makes all the difference due to theta burn there are weekly monthly quarterly yearly and even longer duration options called leaps you have decided how long of a time frame you also have to see what the implied volatility is for the underlying because if you think hypothetically that the price of the spy is 100 dollars currently today is hypothetically a thursday and you buy a weekly option expiring on friday the next day of strike and the call option is priced at cents and you buy it this means that the underlying has to move .5 dollars in one day to be considered in the money but at time 0 the option should only be worth its intrinsic value which is the underlying say the spy moved 55 cents up from 100 to minus the strike = 5 cents so if you payed 55 cents and one day later at expiration its worth 5 cents you lost almost 91 of your money rather with buying and holding you lose a lot less the leverage is on a 10x scale typically that is why timing is so important anyone can say x stock is going to go up in the future but if you know when you can make a killing if it is not already priced into the market another thing you can do is figure out how much msft contributes to the spx movement in terms of points what does a 1 move in msft spx if you can calculate that and you think you know where msft is going you can just trade the spy options synthetically as if it were microsoft you could also buy msft stock on margin as a retail investor but be careful like said look into an etf that has microsoft the nasdaq has a which microsoft is in called the triple q. the ticker is qqq qqq ™ formerly known as qqq or the 100 index tracking stock ® is an exchange traded fund based on the index ® best of luck and always understand what you are buying before you buy it

dividends are declared by the board of directors of a corporation on date a to stock holders of record on date b a later date these stockholders then receive the declared dividend on date c the so called payment date all of these dates are announced on the first declaration date if there is no announcement no dividend will be paid the stock typically goes down in price by approximately the amount of the dividend on the   date it goes ex   but then moves in price to reflect other developments including the possibility of another declaration payment three months hence dividends are important to some investors especially those who live on the income they are less important to investors who are out for capital gains and who may prefer that the company reinvest its money to seek such gains instead of paying dividends in actual fact dividends are one component of total or overall return the other component is capital gains and the sum of the two represents your return

value investing is an investment approach that relies on buying securities below their intrinsic values there are two main concepts one is the intrinsic value and the other is margin of safety   intrinsic value is the value of the underlying business if we are talking about stocks that can be calculated through carefully analyzing the business looking at all aspects of it if there is an intrinsic value exists for a company then there is a price tag we can put on its shares as well value investing is looking to buy shares well below its intrinsic value   it is important to know that there is no correct intrinsic value exists for a company and two people can come up with different figures if they were presented the same data calculating the intrinsic value for a business is the hardest part of value investing   margin of safety is the difference between the buying price of a stock and its intrinsic value value investors are insisting on buying stocks well below their intrinsic value where the margin of safety is or even more this concepts is protecting them from poor decisions and market downturns it is also providing a room for error when calculating the intrinsic value   the approach was introduced by benjamin graham and david dodd in a book called security analysis in 1934 other famous investor using this approach is warren buffet books to read   i would start to read the first two book first

the biotechnology sector as a whole is a popular buy recommendation among some analysts these days for a few reasons   some analysts feel that the high costs in r&d even without much profit are a positive sign for growth because it means a company is working towards finding the next blockbuster drug or the next class of such drugs there have n't been many new classes of blockbuster drugs since the development of 's and and many of the new drugs that have been developed have been tweaks to existing classes of drugs some analysts feel that it 's about time for a new class of blockbuster drugs to hit the market a new blockbuster drug means significant profits for the company that develops it a new class of blockbuster drugs means significant profits for the whole industry   since about 2009 the food and drug administration has been more lenient in its approval of new drugs this wave of new approvals has reduced r&d costs for companies because they do n't need to go back to the lab or earlier phases of clinical trials and continually tweak their drugs in order to gain approval this has also made some analysts optimistic genetic engineering is considered an up and coming field with potentially significant applications to the pharmaceutical industry advances in this field may increase profits for the industry but since biotech companies are often the ones producing the engineering equipment research etc such advances could be a major source of revenue for the entire biotech industry   in the us and in the developed world as a whole the elderly population is growing and since people consume more medicine as they grow older this could lead to higher profits for companies involved in the production of pharmaceuticals which includes biotech companies of course in the long run   in the us the passage of the patient protection and affordable care act expanded insurance coverage which gives more people the means to afford pharmaceuticals also in general people consume more healthcare services when they have insurance this is called moral hazard so some analysts expect that the expansion of insurance coverage will only lead to more profits for the pharmaceutical industry and biotechnology firms in general the global food crisis as the climate changes companies like monsanto which use various forms of genetic engineering to produce crop strains that can survive in increasingly hostile environments look more and more appealing to places that need crops designed to grow in such environments any methods that could increase yields look increasingly popular and biotechnology companies often market such methods as a side note i know monsanto is a contentious example and there are a lot of misconceptions about genetically modified food and the genetic engineering methods they do so i wo n't get into a debate about that   in general technology is a popular subject right now i 've read analyst reports from analysts that clearly do n't follow the biotech sector that base their forecasts for the biotech sector on the activities of companies like dell zynga hp linkedin facebook etc clearly it 's problematic when an analyst sees the word technology and automatically assumes that the biotech sector is responsive to the same factors as social media firms hardware manufacturers etc this is n't to say that the biotech sector is completely isolated from this but when i read a report that talks about facebook 's ipo being bad news for companies like gilead sciences without mentioning upcoming fda decisions about gilead 's products or any biotech specific factors i 'm not convinced the analyst has performed due diligence   i keep using the phrase some analysts because i want to stress that the opinions stated above are n't universal although they 're popular not everyone is so optimistic also i do n't want you to see these reasons and think that i 'm making a buy recommendation because i 'm not i 'm not making a recommendation one way or another   i 'm happy to clarify my answer too i follow the biotechnology sector extensively if you want to get a rough feel for the daily movements of the sector as a whole a good place to start is ibb the ishares nasdaq biotechnology index fund the four largest holdings are gilead sciences and which are all big players in the industry obviously these are a little different from the big name pharma companies like pfizer etc but they 're still considered pharma companies it 's also worthwhile to follow the fda press announcements by the time the news is published there it 's probably already leaked or known to people in the industry the biotech sectors are rife with accusations of insider trading so you might not find trading opportunities but it 's important to get familiar with the information the releases contain if you want to know more about the industry volatility trades are always popular trades around fda drug approvals

i think people are glossing over the type of experience you get working at a startup   having worked at a huge multi national corp and now working in a basement i would say this    multinational corp everything is a process   they have a documented process for damn near everything including taking a shit   if you do n't know how to do something you have internal support or somebody around you that knows how to do it   you do n't learn anything in this type of environment   you get hired for one specific job on the assembly line and you consistently perform a set of pretty specific job functions every day   the upside is full benefits job security and stability   startup absolute chaos   your responsible for sales design implementation production support and late night troubleshooting   you could be out of a job tomorrow if a single customer pulls out   but the upside is the wealth of experience you get on all aspects of business and you have to see a design from spec to production   as a young professional i much prefer the latter   if i lose my job so what   i 'll find another one   the experience i 've gotten from the startup in just under a year far exceeds the experience i got in three years at the corporation

here 's what you do without on the negative side just for balance a bill when i last had comprehensive insurance it cost something like 3 4 of the value of the car per annum   obviously ymmv enormously but i think that 's somewhere near the middle of the range and i 'm not especially risky   so compared to the total depreciation and running costs of the car it 's actually fairly substantial   over the say 10 years i might keep that car it adds up to a fair slice of what it will take to buy a replacement financial crisis costs i do n't know about you but my insurance went up something like 30 in recent years despite the value insured and the risk going down said by the insurer to be due to market turmoil   so at least hundreds of dollars is just kind of loss and i 'd rather not pay it with the insurer if you have insurance and a loss you have to persuade them to pay out perhaps document the original conditions or the fault perhaps argue about whether their payment is fair   i 've done this for small non automotive claims and it added up to more hassle than the incident itself   obviously all insurers will claim they 're friendly to deal with but until you actually have a big claim you never know moral hazard i know i 'm solely responsible for not having my car crashed or stolen   somehow that just feels better free riders i 've seen people fudge their insurance claims so that things that should n't have been covered were claimed to be   you might have too   buy insurance and you 're paying for them choice insurers are typically going to make the decision for you about whether a claim is or not and in my experience are reluctant or refuse to just give you the cash amount of the claim see also moral hazard   do it yourself and you can choose whether to live with it make a smaller or larger repair or replace the whole vehicle with a second hand one or a brand new one or indeed perhaps do without a vehicle a distraction hopefully by the time you 've been working for a while a vehicle is not a really large fraction of your net worth   if you lose 10 of your net worth it 's not really nice but well you could easily have lost that off the value of your house or your retirement portfolio in recent years   what you actually need to insure is genuinely serious risks that would seriously change your life if they were lost such as your ability to work   for about the same cost as insuring a $ x car you can insure against $ x income every year for the rest of your life and i think it 's far more important if i have a write off accident but walk away i 'll be perfectly happy and obviously liability insurance is important because being hit for $ millions of liabilities could also have a serious impact    coverage for mechanical failures if your car needs a new transmission insurance is n't going to help yet it may cost more than the typical minor collision   save the money yourself and you can manage those costs out of the same bucket flexibility if you save up to replace your car but some other crisis occurs you can choose to put the money towards that   if you have car insurance but you have a family medical thing it 's no help i think the bottom line is insure against costs you could n't cope with by yourself   there are people who need a car but can just barely afford it but if you 're fortunate enough not to be in that case you do n't really need comprehensive insurance

in general the other party will expect you to keep your promises if you promise to do something for a fixed amount of money you take on a risk and it is no longer their problem if you work slower than you planned in principle it could even be the case that you take on a project and fail after which the company may not have to pay at all so regardless of how things should be written in your books for example a theoretical pay above minimum wage but a loss for your private company an important thing to note is that if you are worried about ending up below minimum wage you are definitely asking a fee that is too low you should keep in mind that your fee should include a fair compensation for the expected work and a fair compensation for the risk that you have taken on

i am going to give advice that is slightly differently based on my own experiences first regarding the financing i have found that the dealers do in fact have access to the best interest rates but only after negotiating with a better financing offer from a bank when i bought my current car the dealer was offering somewhere around 3.3 which i knew was way above the current industry standard and i knew i had good credit   so like i did with my previous car and my wife 's car i went to local and national banks came back with deals around 2.5 or 2.6   when i told the dealer they were able to offer so it 's ok to go with the dealer 's financing just never take them at face value   whatever they offer you and no matter how much they insist it 's the best deal never believe it   they can do better with my first car i had little credit history similar to your situation and interest rates were much higher then like 6 8   the dealer offered me 10   i almost walked out the door laughing   i went to my own bank and they offered me 8 which was still high but better than 10   suddenly the dealer could do 7.5 with a 0.25 discount if i auto pay through my checking account down payment wise there is nothing wrong with a 35 down payment   when i purchased my current car i put 50 down   all else being equal the more cash down the better off you 'll be   the only issue is to weigh that down payment and interest rate against the cost of other debts you may have   if you have a 7 student loan and the car loan is only 3 you 're better off paying the minimum on the car and using your cash to pay down your student loan   unless your student loan balance is significantly more than the 8k you need to finance like a 20k or 30k loan also remember that a car is a depreciating asset   i pay off cars as fast as i can   they are terrible debt to have   a home can rise in value offsetting a mortgage   your education keeps you employed and employable and will certainly not make you dumber so that is a win   but a car   you pay $ 15k for a car that will be worth $ 14k the next day and $ 10k a year from now   it 's easy to get underwater with a car loan if the down payment is small interest rate high and the car loses value quickly to make sure i answer your questions do you guys think it 's a good idea to put that much down on the car if you can afford it and it will not interfere with repayment of much higher interest debts then yes   a car loan is a major liability so if you can minimize the debt you 'll be better off what interest rate is reasonable based on my credit score i am not a banker loan officer or dealer so i can not answer this with much credibility   but given today 's market 2.5 4 seems reasonable do you think i 'll get approved probably but only one way to find out

there are times when investing in an etf is more convenient than a mutual fund when you invest in a mutual fund you often have an account directly with the mutual fund company or you have an account with a mutual fund broker   mutual funds often have either a front end or back end load which essentially gives you a penalty for jumping in and out of funds etfs are traded exactly like stocks so there is inherently no load when buying or selling   if you have a brokerage account and you want to move funds from a stock to a mutual fund an etf might be more convenient with some accounts an etf allows you to invest in a fund that you would not be able to invest in otherwise   for example you might have a 401k account through your employer   you might want to invest in a vanguard mutual fund but vanguard funds are not available with your 401k   if you have access to a brokerage account inside your 401k you can invest in the vanguard fund through the associated etf another reason that you might choose an etf over a mutual fund is if you want to try to short the fund

set aside any perceived positive aspects of being owed a refund and weigh those with the negatives what are the reasons you should not have your money tied up with the irs you 'll see that uncle sam does not have a good track record as a financial institution many thousands of refunds every year are delayed for many months due to irs systems yet many people count on that refund which is not always guaranteed within the stated time frame you have no legal recourse you can not sue the federal government for the money you lent them when they decide not to pay you back for an extended period of time yet if you decide to delay paying them they have all the power and will use it to charge you fee 's that no corporate private institution would get away with owing some tax money is better than having a refund from a id theft fraud security aspect again there is zero financial incentive to lend free money to uncle sam he is not a bank the only time interest comes into play is when the refund is overdue even then it is not an incentive does n't come close to the penalty burden on you if you do n't pay your taxes on time i would ask the followup question what sane person would engage in business with such a financial institution

in usa if you take a personal loan you will probably get rates between 8 19 it is better that you take a loan in india as home loan rates are about is the lowest offered by sbi   this might not be part of the answer but it is safer to hold usd than indian rupees as india is inflating so much that the value of the rupee is always going 1970 when you could buy 1 dollar for 7 rupees there might be price fluctuations where the rupee gains against the dollar but in the long run i think the dollar has much more a personal opinion and since you are taking a home loan i am assuming it will be somewhere between 10 20 years so you would actually save a lot more on the depreciating rupee than you would pay interest yes if you can get a home loan in usa at around 4 it would definitely be worth considering but i doubt they will do that since they would not know the actual value of the property coming to answer your question getting a personal loan for 75k without keeping any security is highly unlikely what you can do since you have a good credit score is get a line of credit for 20 25k as a backup and use that money to pay your emi only when absolutely required that way you build your credit in the united states and have a backup for around 2 years in india in case you fail to pay up moreover line of credits charge you interest only on the amount you use cheers

you 'd need to talk with an attorney familiar with social security or an appropriately qualified ssa representative to be sure but all signs point to the idea that unfortunately social security does not work the way your father was told it would and if he does n't file to receive benefits the reality is actually much worse than throwing away free money however this is not due to a complete misunderstanding of the system social security does work the way he thinks in some instances just that the rules do n't apply to his exact situation first of all retroactive benefits come in a few forms file and suspend to get a lump only if you really need it before the age of 70 only in this method you apply for retirement but you tell the ssa to suspend delay your benefits you are entitled to full lump sum of the payments you deferred but at a cost of getting lower monthly benefits permanently and that also lowers spousal and dependent children 's benefits too if those could apply to your dad but note that at the age of 70 social security will stop deferring the payments and start paying you the full maximum retirement benefit monthly with no lump sum this is a kind of emergency insurance policy for those who want to try to defer retirement benefits but who want the opportunity to cash out and get the money they would have been getting just in case you can get up to 6 months of retroactive benefits such as if you wait past your exact retirement age to apply for benefits but no more we can not pay retroactive benefits for any month before you reached full retirement age or more than 6 months in the past as for after death benefits an estate can only get benefits that were already due to be paid which generally means a person died and did not get their benefits for that month so ssa can re issue a check to the estate following these rules but as a person can not be due a lump sum payment after age 70 for more than 6 months at most the estate will only be able to get at most 1 6 months of payments and 6 months is doubtful you 'll need to ask a lawyer if that much would even be possible if your father was below 70 and wanted to file and suspend the question of lump on death would be more complex and i do n't know that answer but once you are past 70 this does n't matter any more as you are n't due a lump anymore given the above we 've established pretty clearly that if you do n't claim your benefits within 6 months after age 70 any months of payment you would have gotten are just forfeited to the system but if you claim the benefits and stick them in the bank can they be taken well if a lawsuit is really a worry then yes these accumulated funds can required to pay a debt but this potential for loss can be protected against without forfeiting the benefits entirely this is not very common but if your father does n't need the money now he may be able to deposit some of the money into a special partially lawsuit protected format of the roth ira which has no age limits as detailed here if he never gets sued that 's ok it 's still his money if he passes away the value goes to his estate and does not disappear and he does n't forfeit any of his earned retirement benefits finally i would like to share one last thing with you and your father these benefits are n't free he has been paying a portion of his paycheck for decades into social security and now he is eligible for the maximum amount of benefits per month that he will qualify for and if he wants to keep working he loses no benefit and the amount could potentially even go up that 's up to him but not filing for benefits now will mean that all this money he 's been paying in for decades will just be lost they 'll basically just be a tax he 's paid out to other retirees his estate which means you kids wo n't get any of it either that 'd just be a waste for everyone involved if you have continued doubts or questions i would n't hesitate to consult a specialist lawyer or talk with the ssa directly to make sure this is all correct it 's his money and he has earned his benefits for many years i very much hope he gets to enjoy as much of them as he can

while it is a true loss as you 've determined is not a cash cost per se a cash cost would be a decrease in cash holdings   inflation does not take your cash balance it devalues it so it is an accrued loss central banks are extremely lazy in determining inflation so the highest resolution available at a public level is monthly   in the united states there is a small project that tries to calculate daily inflation rates and seems to do a decent job but unless if you are a customer of a particular financial institution you will suffer a lag   the small project refuses to make the data public in real time or even allow outside analysis in the uk the office for national statistics is responsible for consumer inflation statistics   the methodology is not readily available but considering the name it is most likely an inferior index instead of the optimal fisher index as it is in the us to calculate the accrued cost due to inflation simply multiply the amount of money held by the price index value at the beginning of the time held and divide by the price index value at the end of the time held for example to determine the amount of value lost since march 2014 multiply the money held by the price index value for march 2014 and divide by june 2014

suing is a legitimate option as well as screening your calls but here 's another idea which has personally worked and relates to the collections i did for awhile   talk with the collector   outstanding debt gets sold many times and each time a new collector gets their hands on an account they do their due diligence which means calling every single number multiple times   collectors a looking for consumers who actively evade collections calls for years my recommendation is to use logic and explain the situation   give your first name and describe when you received the phone number and then ask a simple question   when in the last 3 1/2 years have you or any collector had a successful hit from this number   they 'll respond never in 3 1/2 years   the collector notes the account for themselves and future collectors   debt collectors are about about making money not wasting time and they do review all notes pertaining to an account   will it work   maybe not but hopefully it will stop the calls with a short conversation   good luck

edited to incorporate the comments elsewhere of assuming apparently incorrectly that duration is time to maturity first note that the question does not mention the coupon rate the size of the regular payments that the bond holder will get each year   so let 's calculate that consider the cash flow described   you pay out 1015 at the start of year 1 to buy the bond   at the end of years 1 to 5 you receive a coupon payment of x.   also at the end of year 5 you receive the face value of the bond 1000   and you are told that the pay out equals the money received using a time value of money of 4.69 so if we use the date of maturity of the bond as our valuation date we have the equation maturity + future value of coupons = future value of bond purchase price 1000 + x 1 + = 1015 ^ 5 solving this for x we obtain   the coupon rate is   you will receive at the end of each of the five years    now we can take this fixed schedule of payments and apply the new yield rate to the same formula above   only now the unknown is the price paid for the bond y. 1000 + 1 + 1 = y ^ 5 solving this equation for y we obtain y =

depends on how the money is invested within the 401k but in general prices move both up and down with a long bias toward up   think of it this way with fund shares priced lower now you are getting shares cheaper than when you entered the plan so this dip is actually working in your favor as long as you are comfortable trusting that long term view and trusting the funds your 401k money is going into believe me it 's even when you 're nearer your target retirement date and a 10 dip may be six figures but it 's all theoretical until you actually start drawing the money back out and you have to learn to accept some volatility as part of the trade off   for getting returns better than bonds

are there banks where you can open a bank account without being a citizen of that country without having to visit the bank in person i 've done it the other way around opened a bank account in the uk so i have a way to store gbp   given that britain is still in the eu you can basically open an account anywhere   german online banks for instance allow you to anything online should there be cards issued you would need an address in the country   and for opening an account a passport is sufficient you can identify yourself in a video chat   now what 's the downside   french banks online services are in french german banks services are in german   if that does n't put you off i would name such banks in the comments if asked are there any online services for investing money that are n't tied to any particular country can you clarify that   you should at least be able to buy into any european or american stock through your broker   that should give you an ease of mind being fca regulated   however those are usually global depository receipts and denominated in gbp pence so you 'd be visually exposed to currency rates by which i mean that if the stock goes up 1 but the gbp goes up 1 in the same period then your gdr would show a 0 profit on that day also and more dividends are distributed in the foreign currency then exchanged by the issuer of the gdr on that day and booked into your account so if you want to be in full control of the cashflows you should get a trading account denominated in the currency and maybe situated in the country you 're planning to invest in if you 're really serious about it some brokers banks offer multi currency trading accounts again i will name them if asked where you can trade a wide range of instruments i.e. on the primary exchanges and you get to manage everything in one interface   those accounts typically include access to the foreign exchange markets so you can move cash between your accounts freely well for a surcharge   also typically each subaccount is issued its own iban

here 's an excerpt from the charles schwab website which i think will help evaluate your position the simple answer to your question is no the value of a gift of stock    for gift tax liability is not the donor 's cost basis but rather the    fair market value of the stock at the time the gift is given so let 's    say you purchased 100 shares of xyz stock at $ 50 a share your cost    basis is $ 5,000 now the stock is $ 80 a share and you give it as a    gift the value of your gift for gift tax purposes is $ 8,000 in 2015 you can give up to $ 14,000 to an unlimited number of    individuals each year without paying a gift tax or even reporting the    gifts if you give over that amount to any individual however you    must report the gift on your tax return but you do n't have to pay    taxes until you give away more than the current lifetime limit of    $ the amount above and beyond $ 14,000 per person per    year so in the example above there would be no gift tax liability    however if the stock happened to be $ 150 a share the value of the    gift would be $ 15,000 you 'd then have to report it and $ 1,000 would    be applied toward your $ lifetime exclusion you will need to pay a gift tax on the current value of the stock i 'm not familiar with the tax laws in india but if your brother was in the us he would n't pay taxes on that gift until he sells the stock the recipient does n’t have to worry about gift taxes it 's when the    recipient decides to sell the stock that the issue of valuation comes    up for income taxes and this is where things can get a bit more    complicated in general when valuing a gift of stock for capital gains tax    liability it 's the donor 's cost basis and holding period that rules    as an example let 's say you receive a gift of stock from your    grandfather he bought it for $ 10 a share and it 's worth $ 15 a share    on the day you receive it if you then sell the stock whether for a    gain or a loss your cost basis will be the same as your    grandfather ’s $ 10 per share sell it at $ 25 and you 'll pay tax at    the short- or long term rate depending on how long he owned the    stock on a gain of $ 15 a share sell it at $ 8 and your capital loss    will be $ 2 a share ultimately with a gift this large that also crosses international borders you really should hire a professional who is experienced with these types of transactions their fees commission will be completely offset by the savings in risk and paperwork

i do n't want to get involved in trading chasing immediate profit   that is the best part there is an answer in the other question where a guy only invested in small amounts and had a big sum by the time he retired there is good logic in the answer if you put in lump sum in a single stroke you will get at a single price but if you distribute it over a time you will get opportunities to buy at favorable prices because that is an inherent behavior of stocks they inherently go up and down do n't remain stable stock markets are for everybody rich or poor as long as you have money does n't matter in millions or hundreds to invest and you select stocks with proper research and with a long term view investment should always start in small amounts before you graduate to investing in bigger amounts gives you ample time to learn where do i go to do this   to a bank to the company most probably a brokerage firm any place to your liking check how much they charge for brokerage annual charges and what all services they provide compare them online on what services you require not what they provide ask friends and colleagues and get their opinions it is better to get firsthand knowledge about the products can the company i 'm investing to be abroad at the moment stay away from it unless you are sure about it because you are starting can try buying adrs like in us this is an option in uk but they come with inherent risk how much do you know about the country where the company does its business will i be subject to some fees i must care about after i buy a stock yes capital gains tax will be levied and stamp duties and all

first i believe that you ca n't just divide the losses over a number of years i know that would be ideal as it might let you use the losses to only offset 25 income a loss that gets you below zero taxable income would carry forward to the next year   that said i think it would be a great strategy to use the loss to offset a roth conversion in your case from the traditional 401(k to roth 401(k keep in mind as you 've seen from using the 2016 tax year turbotax you should be able to make a fairly good estimate for your 2017 return this could effectively use all of the loss to offset 25 income   i 'd look at the current projection and convert say 75 80 of the target amount immediately then in november when the 2017 software comes out convert the rest to get as close to your goal as you can

even after the real estate crash there are banks that lend money outside of the rules i 'll share   a fully qualified mortgage is typically run at debt to income ratios of 28/36 where 28 of your gross monthly income can apply to the mortgage property tax and insurance and the 36 is the total monthly debt including the mortgage etc plus car loan student loan etc it 's less about the total loan on the potential than about these ratios the bank may allow for 75 of monthly rent so until rentals are running at a profit they may seem a loss even while just breaking even   this is just an overview each bank may vary a bit

generally for tax questions you should talk to a tax adviser do n't consider anything i write here as a tax advice and the answer was not intended or written to be used and it can not be used by any taxpayer for the purpose of avoiding penalties that may be imposed on the taxpayer does irs like one payment method over other or they simply do n't care    as long as she can show the receipts they do n't care as long as she withholds the taxes 30 unless specific arrangements are made for otherwise she should withhold 30 of the payment and send it to the irs the recipient should claim refund if the actual tax liability is lower it 's only consulting work at the moment so most of the communication    is done over phone should they start engaging in written    communication to keep records of the work done yes if she wants it to be a business expense is it okay to pay in one go to save money transferring fees can she    pay in advance again she can do whatever she wants but if she wants to account for it on her tax returns she should do it the same way she would pay any other vendor in her business she can not use different accounting methods for different vendors basically she has not outsourced work in previous years and she    wants to avoid any red flags then she should start by calling on her tax adviser and not an anonymous internet forum

the bonus share also improves the liquidity however there is some difference in treatment lets say a company has 100 shares of $ 10 ea the total capital of the is 100 10 = 1000 assuming the company is doing well its share is now available in the market for $ 100 ea now lets say the company has made a profit of $ 1000 and this also gets factored into the price of $ 100 lets say the company decides to keep this $ 1000 kept as cash reserve and is not distributed as dividends    in a share split say 1:1 the book value of each share is now reduced to $ 5 the number of shares increase to 200 the share capital stays at 200 5 = 1000 the market value of shares come down to $ 50 ea    in a bonus share issue say 1:1 the funds $ 1000 are moved from cash reserve and transferred to share capital the book value of each share will remain same as $ 10 the number of shares increase to 200 the share capital increases to 200 10 = 2000 the market value of shares come down to $ 50 ea    so essentially from a liquidity point of view both give the same benefit as to why some companies issue bonus and not a split this is because of multiple reasons a split beyond a point can not be done ie $ 10 can be split to $ 1 ea but it does n't look good to make it $ 0.50 the other reason is there is adequate cash reserve and you want to convert this into share holders capital having a larger share holders capital improves some of the health ratios for the at times is used to play upon that one is getting something free

my answer is similar to ben miller 's but let me make some slightly different points there is one excellent reason to get a consolidation loan you can often get a lower interest rate if you are presently paying 19 on a credit card and you can roll that into a personal loan at you 'll be saving over 5 which can add up i would definitely not consolidate a loan at into a loan at then you 're just adding 1 to your interest rate what 's the benefit in this another good reasons for a consolidation loan is psychological a consolidation loan with fixed payments forces you to pay that amount every month you say you have trouble with credit cards it 's very easy to say to yourself oh just this month i 'm going to pay just the minimum so i can use my cash for this other very important thing that i need to buy and then next month you find something else that you just absolutely have to buy and again the next month and the next and your determination to seriously pay down your debt keeps getting pushed off if you have a fixed monthly payment you ca n't you 're committed also if you have many credit cards juggling payments on all of them can get complex and confusing it 's easy to lose track of how much you owe and to budget for payments at worst when there are many bills to pay you may forget one personally i now have 3 bank cards an airline card and 2 store cards and managing them is getting out of hand i have good reasons for having so many cards the airline card and the store cards give me special discounts but it 's confusing to keep track of as to adding $ 3,000 to the consolidation loan very very bad idea you are basically saying i have to start seriously paying down my debt tomorrow today i need a some extra cash so i 'm going to borrow just a little bit more but i 'm going to get started paying it off next month this is a trap and the sort of trap that leads people into spiraling debt start paying off debt now not at some vague time in the future that never seems to come

you are at the point that many millions of people are at and where i used to be you have no idea where your money is going you just spend spend spend until there 's nothing left and/or you borrow more to keep going   there are general rules of thumb on how much house and car you can afford but there is a great deal of personal variation housing and utility costs vary greatly from location to location city dwellers can use public transit instead of buying and maintaining a car how much other debt do you have that you need to pay off do you have expenses that are not common e.g. medical bills a more personal approach would be to figure out your own budget the first step is creating a written budget figure out how much you can spend in total i.e. your take home pay and the start allocating that money to expenses until you run out i started by looking backwards   look back at how much you spent on each category each month list them in order of priority e.g. food health housing utilities transportation entertainment everything else if the money runs out you either stop spending or reduce spending in another category e.g. can you cook a few extra meals at home instead of going out can you take lunch to work instead of a drive through the amount you have left over now indicates how much more house and car you can afford once you get to a point where you can budget comfortably then you can start looking at saving for retirement and other long term goals this worked for me and highlighted some areas where i overspent because i had good categorized records ironically because i used credit cards which i mostly stopped once i created a budget if you do n't have good records then you have to estimate   how much do you think you spend on food gas etc each month   then set aside that much and once it 's gone do n't spend anymore   now obviously you 're not going to stop eating but the idea is to plan ahead and realize i have only $ 20 left to spend on food this month maybe i should n't go to the movies it takes lots of practice and you wo n't get it right very often if you have enough left over you can set aside some as a cushion in case you do go over your budget but if you want true financial discipline you should start by reducing other categories first this is not easy by any means it will take of practice and trial and error to get to a point that you 're comfortable with the lifestyle that you can afford    so in the end there are only two variables in your equation income and outflow   do you want more house either spend less on other things or increase your income

the fee to withdraw cash from an atm using your credit card as opposed to your debit card is akin to the merchant fees paid by any business that accepts your credit card as payment these fees range from around 2.75 of the transaction to upwards of 5 and are charged to the merchant the fees are split among the various vendors that provide the infrastructure to conduct the credit card transaction resulting in the merchant receiving the money and the charge on your credit account these fees are used by each vendor to cover their costs and ultimately generate a profit note most vendors in the value chain do not receive any revenue from any interest you may pay on your outstanding balance therefore when you withdraw cash from an atm you are paying the merchant fees instead of whatever merchant you are purchasing goods services from with the cash withdrawn

gt;you could say the same about any public utility except the one largest one technically   there are literally thousands and thousands of processors which is not the case with utilities additionally processors do n't need to have any kind of office or presence anywhere near the business they 're serving which means being able to choose without geographical restrictions also paypal is not a utility this is not a relevant comparison   gt;are you saying they are unable both contractually and technically to affect the consumer side   they 'd have to revoke their partnerships with banks who issue cards which they are n't going to do because consumers using cards is how they make money banks could choose not to issue cards but they 're already free to do that there 's no right to a credit card   gt;but also by selectively quoting me you are deliberately side stepping what actually happened in the wikileaks case to focus on the consumer side   visa and mastercard prohibited payments to wikileaks on the basis of allegedly facilitating illegal activity how is that relevant to what paypal 's doing    gt;you must buy things in different corners of the internet than i do the customer experience to me is that there is the store or you can pay with paypal yes the store is actually a payment processor but this is a quick slippery slope to what you can just set up your own payment processor once they 've all blocked your legal business   what are you talking about you acknowledge that the store has its own processing but somehow that 's not enough because someday they might not have processing and have to go through paypal   processors already deny service to legal businesses notably anything considered high risk which includes travel services pharmaceuticals firearms adult entertainment telemarketing debt collection tobacco and more but also for businesses with poor credit high chargebacks business practices they do n't agree with lots of international transactions etc    it literally happens all the time and there are so many processors tens of thousands that there 's another processor willing to step in    tons of websites do n't even use paypal anymore and the ones that do often layer it on top of a different payment option paypal is trying hard to increase their presence in stores because of the competition in the internet space no one is unable to accept payments if they 're barred from paypal paypal actually cuts off accounts all the time because people use it for things against paypal 's tos    amazon payments shopify and stripe are the ones that most people know off the tops of their heads for online processing but there are literally thousands no one is somehow unable to conduct business if they ca n't use paypal    the only time that businesses ca n't really get processing is if they do something like rack up chargebacks and disappear or commit fraud against a processor in those cases the processor can put that business on the terminated merchant file or match list and other processors will see that there 's been a problem with that customer and not take them on even in those cases businesses can rectify the issue and get off the match list or they can look for processors that will serve them anyway and expect to pay a premium for it

the point of what you heard is likely that gold is thought by some to hold its value well when the money market would provide negative interest rates these negative interest rates are a sign of deflation where cash money is worth more in the future than it is today   normally under inflation cash money is worth less in the future than it is today under normal circumstances where inflation exists interest paid by the bank on money held there generally keeps up with inflation + a little bit extra now we are seeing many banks offering interest rates in the negatives which is an acknowledgement of the fact that money will be worth more in the future than it is today so in that sense holding physical gold fights deflation or negative interest rates in the same way that holding physical cash does because if you hold onto a $ 10k bundle of bills in 10 years you can walk into a bank and it will be worth $ 10k in future dollars which in a deflationary market would be more than it is worth today some view gold as being better at doing this than just holding cash but that discussion gets into an analysis of the value of paper money as a currency which is outside the scope of this answer   suffice to say i do not personally like the idea of buying gold as an investment but some do and partly for this reason

there are many reasons for buying new versus used vehicles price is not the only factor   this is an individual decision although interesting to examine from a macro perspective each vehicle purchase is made by an individual weighing many factors that vary in importance by that individual based upon their specific needs and values i have purchased both new and used cars and i have weighted each of these factors as part of each decision and the relative weightings have varied based upon my individual situation read freakonomics to gain a better understanding of the reasons why you can not find a good used car the summary is the imbalance of knowledge between the buyer and seller and the lack of trust although much of economics assumes perfect market information margin profit comes from uncertainty or an imbalance of knowledge   buying a used car requires a certain amount of faith in people and you can not always trust the trading partner to be honest price the price or more precisely the value proposition of the vehicle is a large concern for many of us larger than we might prefer that it be selection a buyer has the largest selection of vehicles when they shop for a new vehicle finding the color features and upgrades that you want on your vehicle can be much harder even impossible for the used buyer and once you have found the exact vehicle you want now you have to determine whether the vehicle has problems and can be purchased at your price preference a buyer may simply prefer to have a vehicle that looks new smells new is clean and does not have all the that even a gently used vehicle would exhibit this may include issues of pride image and status where the buyer may have strong emotional or psychological needs to through ownership of a particular vehicle with particular features reviews new vehicles have mountains of information available to buyers who can read about safety and reliability ratings learn about problems from the trade press and even price shop and compare between brands and models contrasted with the minimal information available to used vehicle shoppers unbalanced knowledge the seller of a used car has much greater knowledge of the vehicle and thus much greater power in the negotiation process buying a used car is going to cost you more money than the value of the car unless the seller has poor knowledge of the market and since many used cars are sold by dealers who have often taken advantage of the less knowledgeable sellers in their transaction you are unlikely to purchase the vehicle at a good price fear risk many people want transportation and buying a used car comes with risk and that risk includes both the direct cost of repairs and the inconvenience of both the repair and the loss of work that problems knowing that the car has not been abused that there are no hidden or problems waiting to leave you stranded is valuable placing a price on the risk of a used car is hard especially for those who only want a reliable vehicle to drive placing an estimate on the risk cost of a used car is one area where the seller has a distinct advantage warranties new vehicles come with substantial warranties and this is another aspect of the fear risk point above a new vehicle does not have unknown risk associated with the purchase and also comes with peace of mind through a manufacturer warranty you can purchase a used car warranty but they are expensive and often come with different problems finance terms a buyer can purchase a new vehicle with lower financing rate than a used vehicle and you get nothing of value from the additional finance charges so the difference between a new and used car also includes higher finance costs own versus rent you are assuming that people actually want to own their cars and i would suggest that people want to own their car until it begins to present problems repair and maintenance issues and then they want a new vehicle to replace it but renting or leasing a vehicle is an even more expensive and less flexible means to obtain transportation expense allocation a vehicle is an expense as the owner of a vehicle you are willing to pay for that expense to fill your need for transportation paying for the product as you use the product makes sense and financing is one way to align the payment with the consumption of the product and to pay for the expense of the vehicle as you enjoy the benefit of the vehicle capital allocation a buyer may need a vehicle either to commute to work school doctor or for work or business but either lack the capital or be unwilling to commit the capital to the vehicle purchase vehicle financing is one area banks have been willing to lend so buying a new vehicle may free capital to use to pay down other debts credit cards loans the buyer may not have savings but be able to obtain financing to solve that need remember people need transportation and they are willing to pay to fill their need but they also have varying needs for all of the above factors and each of those factors may offer value to different individuals

has good advice here i would like to add my notes if they give a 50 match that means you are getting a 50 return on immediately i do not know of a way to get a better guaranteed roi next when investing you need to determine what kind of investor you are i would suggest you make yourself more literate in investments as i suggest to anyone but there are basic things you want to look for if your primary worry is loss of your go for conservative investments this means that you are willing to accept a reduced expected roi in exchange for lower of loss of principal this does not mean you have a 100 safe investment as the last market issues have shown but in general you are better protected the fidelity investments should give you some information as to volatility or if they deem the investments conservative conservative investments are normally made up of trading bonds which have the lowest roi in general but are the most secure you can also invest in blue chip companies although stock is inherently riskier it is pointed out in comments that stocks always outperform bonds in the long term and this has been true over the last 100 years i am just suggesting ways you can protect yourself against market downturns when the market is doing very well bonds will not give you the return your friends are seeing i am just trying to give you a basic idea of what to look for when you pick your investments nothing can replace a solid investment adviser and taking the time to educate yourself

for some reason ca n't transfer it directly to his account overseas something to do with security codes authorized payees and expired cards do n't become someone 's financial intermediary find out exactly why he ca n't transfer the money himself and then if you want to help him solve that problem for him helping him fix his issue with his expired card or whatever the real problem is would be a good thing to do allowing him to involve you in the transaction would be a bad thing to do   possible problems which might be caused by becoming directly involved in the transaction -the relative is being scammed themselves and does n't realize it does n't realize the risks and either wants you to take the risk or simply thinks there is no risk but needs administrative help -the person contacting you is not the relative perhaps they are faking that person 's identity and are using your trust to defraud you -the person is committing some form of fraud money laundering or worse and is directly trying to defraud you in order to keep their hands clean -the transaction may be perfectly legal but is considered taxable in one or more countries by getting involved you might face tax filing obligations or even tax payment obligations -the transaction may be perfectly legal and legitimate but might accidentally get picked up as potential fraud by a financial monitoring system causing the funds to be held and your account to be flagged for further investigation creating headaches for you until it becomes resolved there are possibly other ways that this can go awry but these are the biggest possibilities i can think of the only possible good outcome here is that everything goes smoothly and it works exactly as well as if your relative 's administrative problems were solved first and the money went through his own account about why your account is needed and his is faulty is a big red flag if it is truly just an administrative issue on his end help him fix that issue instead

the only way to hedge a position is to take on a position with a higher multiplier as any counter position such as a 1:1 inverse etf will merely cancel out the etf it is meant to hedge yielding a negative return roughly in the amount of fees slippage for true risk aversion continually selling the shortest term available covered calls is the only free lunch   a suboptimal version the cboe index has outperformed its underlying with lower volatility the second best way is to continually hedge positions with long puts but this can become very tax complicated since the hedged positions need to be rebalanced continually and expensive depending on option liquidity the ideal assuming no taxes and infinite liquidity is to sell covered calls when implied volatility is high and buy puts when implied volatility is low

this is n't exactly an answer but i can not comment at the moment   i have bought a house in nz in the last year being my first there are a couple of things that you might need to watch out for with the first home subsidy the $ 5000 especially the one that says that you have to live in the house that you buy for a certain amount of time otherwise you have to pay it back   i also assume that you have been in the superannuation for at least 5 years you can only take $ 1000 for each year you have been in there up to $ 5000 you can take all of the funds except what the government has put in so if you have $ 4000 from your employer then you would probably have more in your contributions that you could use as well   you do n't have to have the 20 deposit to be able to buy a house i went through a broker and was able to get in with less not sure on the exact percentage the 20 does help to get the bank to put some extra funds in for legal fees etc my house was n't an investment property but i hope this helps

as the article states traditionally it 's a majority percentage of teens and immigrants makes sense my wife and i regularly volunteer with immigrants some documented and some not to assist in finding jobs and housing so that still holds true    but add to that the newer college grads who struggle to find any job    i do n't have a perfect solution i think most people pretend their agenda is the perfect solution so if the research shows and it does that mandated minimum wage raise eliminates jobs the solution lies elsewhere as far as livable wage goes that is partly determined by situation and partly by individual obviously the individual has to be responsible for their share frugality minimizing debt work ethic etc but what 's not in their control could be helped on a situation to situation basis what i mean is disadvantaged people needs to be defined before you can help them if disadvantage people means recently graduated students then minimize their biggest financial burden of school loan interest rates if it 's lower skilled workers like teens and some immigrants get rid of the minimum wage and allow them to work those lower paying jobs while gaining experience so on and so forth    as a business owner who makes around $ i can tell you i can't afford to hire help at $ to do simple tasks that would make me more productive that killed a job right there and it prevented me from freeing up my time to focus more on income generating work so i 'm poorer for it too as someone who volunteers with immigrants i ca n't tell you how happy the people i 've worked with would be to have more job opportunities

littleadv 's answer gives a concise summary of the system as it stands now but much more changed than just the portion of the mandatory contribution that was diverted to the private plan in broad terms the balances of your accounts and your future benefit wo n't change it 's only the source of these benefits that 's changing the bloomberg article describes the changes this way the state will take over the amount of bonds that pension funds held as of end of sept. 3 and turn them into pension liabilities in the state run social security system the state will assume control of percent of pension fund assets including bonds guaranteed by the government and other non stock assets after the change polish workers that held bonds in the private portion of their retirement portfolios will instead have more payments from the state run pension system the balances of your retirement portfolio and your future benefits should n't change but the reality may depend on how the state pension system is managed and any future changes the government implements the effect this change will have on future benefits is n't clear because the change may simply delay the problem of high levels of outstanding sovereign debt not solve it the government stated that because increasing numbers of workers invested their money in private pension funds less money went into the government 's fund which forced them to issue sovereign debt in order to cover the shortfall in their current pension liabilities   the government 's recent cancellation of government bonds in the hands of private pensions will decrease their overall outstanding debt but in exchange the government is increasing its future pension liabilities years down the road the government may find that they need to issue more sovereign debt to cover the increased pension liabilities they 're taking on today in other words they may find themselves back in the same situation years down the road and it 's difficult to predict what changes they might make at that time

many countries have employers report their employees salaries and withhold some money for income tax purposes it 's called pay as you earn withholding taxes or taxing at the source often the system is designed in such a way that most people actually pay too much and can get money back at the end of the year in that case the salary you receive can certainly be considered a net salary depending on the tax system individuals might need to file a separate tax returns to report any other income investments rents whatever or benefit from tax incentives but it can also be optional if you live in such a country and your situation is simple enough that there are no applicable deductibles you might simply choose to forgo it and let your employer take care of everything

the amount reliability and frequency of dividends paid by an etf other than a stock such as an index or mutual fund is a function of the agreement under which the etf was established by the managing or issuing company or companies and the basket of investments that a share in the fund represents   let 's say you invest in a djia based index fund for instance dow diamonds dia which is traded on several exchanges including nasdaq and amex one share of this fund is currently worth $ jan 22 2014 while the djia itself is $ as of the same time so one share of the etf represents approximately 1 of the index it tracks the etf tracks the index by buying and selling shares of the blue chips proportional to total invested value of the fund to maintain the same weighted percentages of the same stocks that make up the index mcdonald 's for instance has an applied weight that makes the share price of mcd stock roughly 5 of the total djia value and therefore roughly 5 of the price of 100 shares of dia now let 's say mcd issued a dividend to shareholders of say $ .20 per share by buying 100 shares of dia you own through the fund approximately five mcd shares and would theoretically be entitled to $ 1 in dividends however keep in mind that you do not own these shares directly as you would if you spent $ 16k buying the correct percentage of all the shares directly off the exchange you instead own shares in the dia fund basically giving you an interest in some investment bank that maintains a pool of blue chips to back the fund shares whether the fund pays dividends or not depends on the rules under which that fund was set up the investment bank may keep all the dividends itself to cover the expenses inherent in managing the fund paying fund management personnel and floor traders covering losses versus the listed price based on bid ask parity etc or it may pay some percentage of total dividends received from stock holdings however it will virtually never cut you a check in the amount of your proportional holding of an indexed investment as if you held those stocks directly in the case of the dia the fund pays dividends monthly at a yield of virtually identical to the actual weighted djia yield but lower than the per share mean yield of the dji 30 2.78 differences between index yields and etf yields can be reflected in the share price of the etf versus the actual index 100 shares of dia would cost $ versus the actual index price of a delta of $ or from the actual index price that difference can be attributed to many things but fundamentally it 's because owning the dia is not the exact same thing as owning the correct proportion of shares making up the djia however because of what index funds represent this difference is very small because investors expect to get the price for the etf that is inherent in the real time index

you can get no load annuities through some no load financial companies like vanguard so to start with i 'd see how what she is being offered compares with something that comes free of a sales load i 'd also question that fixed rate seems pretty impossible to me which makes me think there is some catch or gotcha that we are not seeing that either brings down that rate or makes it delusional they are kidding themselves or deceptive in some way   in any case it 's setting off my too good to be true alarm at full volume along with the shark attack alarm as well i would strongly suspect the advisor is advising the product that makes the most money for him not what is in your mother 's best interest   a fixed annuity is an insurance product not a security because the insurance company must credit the annuity holder ’s account with the specified interest rate for the contractually stipulated time period regardless of market fluctuations in actual interest rates it is the insurance company that bears the investment risk which it does by investing the annuity holder ’s purchase proceeds in fixed income instruments that the company hopes will provide sufficient return to fulfill its contractual representations to the holder   this is why there is no prospectus it 's not a security they are not required to provide one by sec because the risk is entirely with the company obviously as pointed out in the comments the company could easily go out of business especially of they sell a lot of these and ca n't find a way to get that kind of return on the invested money   now ask yourself if i was the insurance company would i be comfortable guaranteeing that level of return over that much time if i intend to make a profit from it pay sales and stay in business    in terms of will they stay in business i 'd have a hard look at their ratings and go compare where that is on the total range for am best they are lowest secure rating next thing down is in the vulnerable category and standard and poors 4 places down from their best rating next thing down is marginal followed by poor    you might also want to see if you can get any idea of historical ratings is this company 's ratings falling or rising    personally for the amount of money involved i 'd want a company with much higher ratings than these guys   then maybe someone could say no risk but with those ratings   an no i do n't think so btw i 'd check over what this um sorry that 's not fair to clowns is recommending she do with her own funds as well   for example is he recommending she take something that is already tax sheltered such as an ira and investing the stuff inside that in an annuity kind of pointless to double shelter the money or lock it up for a period of time when she may be required to make withdrawals make sure you do n't see something there that is actually against what is in her best interest and is only done to make him a comission

first the good news based on the time involved and the amount of potential profits you will not owe any tax on the sale of the house no matter which option you pick now the details when determining if there are any capital gains the irs cares about the difference between the sale price and the purchase price the amount of the loan the final balance of the loan or the lack of loan do n't factor into the calculation to complicate matters the government does factor into the equation any improvements you have made to the house like a new deck and the cost of buying and selling the house real estate agents if a single person has less than 250 k in capital gains and has used the house as their main residence for 2 of the the previous 5 years their tax is zero for a couple the tax free gain is $ 500k. for your situation since the sale price is less than $ 250 k the capital gains will also be less than $ 250k. you do have one potential area of concern if the house is worth significantly more than $ 150 k the government could claim that the difference between what you charged your parents and what you could have charged was a gift assuming that there are no other factors that you did n't include in the original question it would appear that you will not face any taxes regarding your two options neither will impact the taxes though draining your savings or investments could make it difficult to meet an emergency during the time between the sending of the $ 95 k to the mortgage company and the closing on the deal with your parents if the money came from retirement account it could have an even greater impact on your taxes and retirement situation

if you think of it in terms of trying to get an annual return on your investment over the long haul you can do a simple net present value analysis to decide your buy price   if you 're playing conservative with the investments and taking safety over returns you will still have some kind of expectation of that return will be   paying slightly more will drag down your returns perhaps less than what you want to get   if you really want to get your desired x% then stick to your guns and do n't go down the slippery slope of reaching   if 1 off is n't bad then 2 off is n't all that bad and maybe 3 is ok too for the right situation etc   got ta have rules and stick to them   you never know what opportunities will be around tomorrow   the possible drops in value should be built into your return expectations

it does n't make much difference in the end imagine you have $ 100 of revenue in your company you can either pay it to yourself as salary meaning that you do n't pay corporate tax on it or you can keep it in the company pay corporate tax on it then pay yourself a dividend of what is left while that dividend will be treated better than salary remember that the company already paid tax on it you paying less on what 's left does n't equate to paying less overall go ahead and run the numbers using your actual corporate tax rate and your personal income tax rate try doing your whole salary as dividends not dollar for dollar but as how much the company would have as profit to give you a dividend if it did n't spend and deduct salary money on you you are unlikely to see any difference at all the net final money in your pocket and the amount that went to the government will probably be the same if paying dividends keeps your earned income low you may find that you ca n't use rrsp or childcare deductions you are also not getting cpp credit that 's an argument for salary or at least a certain minimum amount of salary you have to deduct taxes at source on salary and send it along to the government which is an argument for dividends if you feel you could invest that money and use it well before the taxes get around to being due possibly you may discover an edge case where you move a few thousand from one marginal tax rate to another and clear a few hundred extra as a result i do n't discourage you from doing the math i just point out that the various percentages tax rates deductions etc have all been carefully chosen so that it pretty much works out the same or gives a small preference to salary we give excess money to ourselves as bonus rather than dividend having run the numbers a few times there 's no secret trick here

no there are additional factors involved note that the shares on issue of a company can change for various reasons such as conversion redemption of convertible securities vesting of restricted employee shares conversion of employee options employee stock purchase programs share placements buybacks mergers rights issues etc so it is always worthwhile checking sec announcements for the company if you want an exact figure   there may also be multiple classes of shares and preferred securities that have different levels of dividends present for they filed a 10q on 22 april 2015 and noted they had shares outstanding of their common stock   they also noted for the three months ended march 31 2014 that dividends were paid to both common stockholders and preferred stockholders and that there were series a preferred stock 3 million and series b preferred stock 10 million plus a statement in february 2015 our board of directors authorized a share repurchase program of up to $ million of our outstanding common stock shares repurchased under these programs are accounted for as treasury stock carried at cost and reflected as a reduction to equity therefore the exact amount of dividend paid out will not be known until the next quarterly report which will state the exact amount of dividend paid out to common and preferred shareholders for the quarter

that 's definitely a good point thanks for noting that leverage was definitely an issue   re the ratings agencies i just wanted to clarify that i was talking about something a bit different than the problem of ratings shopping i assume this is what you meant what you mentioned the ratings agencies    ratings shopping is essentially the tendency for a race to the bottom in ratings when banks pay for ratings that has always been an issue for the ratings agencies since the 1970s i think when they started having the rated entities pay for their ratings    what i was talking about is more unique to the structured products industry in the i.e. how the ratings agencies gave banks an opportunity for essentially risk less profit by merely mbss into cdos so banks would buy up mbss them into cdos sell shares of the cdos to investors and then hedge all of the residual risk away by writing a cds contract with a insurer like aig this has more to do with the relationship between ratings for different products and not the absolute level of the ratings for any given product   sorry if that sounds nit picky but i think it 's an extremely important detail that is generally lost upon as you pointed out economists who are pushing the ratings shopping theory i would guess this is because moral hazard is a story they are already familiar with

i doubt that there is an arrangement with any country that would allow you to transfer money out of a 401(k and roll it over to another country that is n't governed by us tax laws without taking a distribution   the us government wo n't let you pull out like that without taking its cut there may be but i 'd be surprised   check around in the appropriate venues if you 're making a distribution that incurs penalties then that 's what you 're doing   if you can do so without incurring penalties then great for you just deposit into the vehicle of your choice in your country

amortization is the process by which your loan balance decreases over time for both mortgages and credit card balances your interest charges are based on what you owe   the calculation of the balance is a little different but it still is based on what you owe you 're observing correctly that most of the first payments on a mortgage are interest   this stands to reason since an amortization schedule for a fixed rate mortgage is constructed on the assumption that you 're making your payments equally over the course of the mortgage   since you owe more at the beginning you accrue more interest and a larger fraction of your payment is interest   near the end you owe little and most of your payment therefore is principal

i can say that i got x dollars from an account like income benefits but where do i credit that money to expenses groceries yes does n't feel right since i never actually spent that money on food   you did did n't you you got food i 'm guessing there 's an established convention for this already   doubt it established conventions in accounting are for businesses and more specifically public companies so you can find a gaap or guidelines on how to book benefits hint salary expense but it is not something you may find useful in your own household accounting do what is most convenient for you since it is a double booking system you need to have an account on the other side expenses groceries does n't feel right add expenses groceries benefits or expenses benefits or whatever when you do your expense and cash flow reports you can exclude both the income and the expense benefits accounts if you track them separately so that they do n't affect your tracking of the real expenses

you 're certainly still responsible to pay what you owe the company given that 1 for whatever reason the recipient never received the checks and 2 the money was credited back to you albeit in a less than timely manner however if you take the time to explain the situation to the business and show them proof that you sent the payments i would guess they would probably be willing to work with you on removing any late fees you have been assessed or possibly setting up a payment plan also if you have been charged any overdraft or minimum balance fees by your bank while they held your money for the payments that was eventually credited back to your account you might be able to get them to refund those if you explain what has happened this is really a perfect example though of why balancing your checking account is as important today as it ever was

tough spot i 'm guessing the credit cards are a personal line of credit in their name and not the company 's the fact that the business can be liquidated separately from your parents means they did at least set up an llc or similar business entity using personal debt to save a company that could have just been dissolved at little cost to their personal credit and finances was indeed a very bad move the best possible end to this scenario for you and your parents would be if your parents could get the debt transferred to the llc before dissolving it at this point with the company in such a long standing negative situation i would doubt that any creditor would give the business a loan which was probably why your parents threw their own good money after bad with personal ccs they might in the right circumstances be able to convince a judge to effectively transfer the debt to the corporate entity before liquidating it that puts the debt where it should have been in the first place and the cc companies will have to get in line that means in turn that the card issuers will fight any such motion or decision tooth and nail as long as there 's any other option that gives them more hope of recovering their money your parents only for this to happen is if the ccs were used for the sole purpose of business expenses if they were living off the ccs as well as using them to pay business debts a judge best case would only relieve the debts directly related to keeping the business afloat and they 'd be on the hook for what they had been living on bankruptcy is definitely an option they will re affirm their commitment to paying the mortgage and any other debts they can and under a chapter 13 the judge will then negotiations over what total portion of each card 's balance is paid over what time and at what rate to a mediator chapter 13 bankruptcy is the less damaging form to your parent 's credit they are at least attempting to make good on the debt   a chapter 7 would wipe it away completely but your parents would have to prove that they can not pay the debt by any means and have no hope of ever paying the debt by any means if they have any retirement savings anything in their name for grandchildren 's college funds etc the judge and cc issuers will point to it like a bird dog apart from that their house is safe due to florida 's homestead laws but furniture appliances clothing jewelry cars and other vehicles pretty much anything of value that your parents can not defend as being necessary for life health or the performance of whatever jobs they end up taking to dig themselves out of this are all subject to seizure and auction they may end up just selling the house anyway because it 's too big for what they have left or will ever have again i do not under any circumstance recommend you putting your own finances at risk in this you may gift money to help or provide them a place to live while they get back on their feet but do not give till it hurts for this it sounds heartless but if you remove your safety net to save your parents then what happens if you need it your parents are n't going to be able to bail you out and as a contractor if you 're effectively doing business as contracting you do n't have the debt shield your parents had it looks like housing 's again due to the news that the fed 's going to start backing off you could need that money to weather a double dip in the housing sector over the next few months and you may need it soon

the pure numbers answer says you want the refund to be close to $ 0   you can even argue as some answers have that you want to try to maximize the payment without receiving any sanctions for underpaying during the year if you trace the money it 's easy to see why   let 's say you get a paycheck   tag some of the dollars for uncle sam   these are the dollars that eventually will be given to the irs   now consider the following scenarios from the raw numbers like this its clear that you lose utility by setting yourself up for a large refund check   the money was yours the entire time but you chose to give it to uncle sam instead however the raw numbers are only part of the puzzle   if you 're a cold numbers person they 're the part that matters   when the are playing their tax evasion games this is the only thing they are paying attention to   however real humans have a few psychological reasons they may choose to lose utility in terms of raw dollars in exchange for psychological assistance these attitudes exist and may be ideal for any one person   obviously the financially savvy answer of minimize your refund is the ideal answer from a dollars and cents perspective but its up to you to see whether that attitude is right when you account for all of the non measurable things like stress   in general i would lead anyone to minimize your refund but i would be if i did n't include the very real psychological reasons people choose to deviate from it

people treat an emergency fund as some kind of ace in the hole when it comes to financial difficulty but it is only one of many sources of money that you can utilize what is an emergency first you have to define what an emergency is   is it a lost job   is it an unplanned event pregnancy perhaps   is it a medical emergency   is it the death of you or your spouse also what does it mean to be unplanned   is being so unhappy with your job that you give a 2-week notice an emergency   is one month of planning an emergency   two only you can answer these questions for yourself but they significantly shape your financial strategy   planning is highly dependent on your cashflow and for some people it may take them a year to build enough savings to enable them to take 3 months off work   for others they may be able to change their spending to build up enough for 3 months in 1 month also you have to consider the length of the emergency   job loss is rarely permanent but it 's rarely short as well   the current average is weeks that 's 7 months money in an emergency there are six main places that people get money during a financial emergency a good emergency strategy takes all six of these into account   some emergencies may lean more on one source than the other   however some of these are correlated for example in 2008 three things happened   the stock market crashed unsecured debt dried up and people faced financial emergency lost jobs cut wages   if you were dependent on a stock portfolio and/or a line of credit you 'd be up a creek because the value of your investments suddenly decreased and you ca n't really tap your now significantly limited line of credit however if you had a one or more of cash savings unemployment income and unemployment insurance you would probably have been ok budgeting for an emergency when you say financial emergency most people think job loss   however the most common cause of bankruptcy in the us is medical debt   depending on your insurance situation this could be a serious risk or it may not be    people say you should have of your monthly income in savings because it 's an easy back of the envelope way to handle most financial emergency risk but it 's not necessarily the most prudent strategy for you to properly budget for an emergency you need to fully take into account what emergencies you are likely to face and what sources of financing you would have access to given the likely factors that led to that emergency generally having a savings account with some amount of liquid cash is an important part of a risk mitigation strategy   but it 's not a panacea for every kind of emergency
