if you want to subcontract some of your excess work to somebody else you better be in business Â   while some kinds of employees e.g. commissioned salespeople are permitted to deduct some expenses on their income tax generally only a real business can deduct wages for additional employees or the cost of services provided by subcontractors do you invoice your clients and charge hst gst   or do you tell your clients each pay period how many hours you worked and they compensate you through their payroll system like everybody else that walks through the door   if you 're not invoicing and charging hst gst assuming you exceed the threshold and if you have too much work you probably do then perhaps your clients are treating you as an employee by default and withholding taxes cpp and ei so they do n't get in trouble after all canada revenue agency is likely to consider any person providing a service to a company to be an employee unless there is sufficient evidence to the contrary and when there is n't enough evidence it 's the company paying for the services that would be on the hook for unpaid taxes cpp and ei carefully consider what form of business you are operating or were intending to operate   it 's essential for your business to be structured appropriately if you want to hire or subcontract   you ought to be either self employed as a sole proprietor or perhaps incorporated if it makes more sense to your situation   next act accordingly for instance it 's likely that your business should be taking care of the source deductions cpp and ei   in fact self employed individuals should n't even be paying into ei an independent contractor would n't qualify to make an ei claim if they lost a contract as an independent one does n't have a job one has a business and ei does n't cover the business itself only the employees that the business deals with at arm 's length   as a business owner you would be considered non arms length and exempt from ei growing your business in the way that you are suggesting is an important enough a step that you should seek professional advice in advance   find a good accountant that deals with self employed individuals small businesses and run all this by him   he should be able to guide you accordingly   find a lawyer too   a lawyer can guide you on how to properly subcontract others while protecting you and your business finally be mindful of what it is you agreed to in your contract with your client   do they expect all services to be performed by you personally   even if it was n't written down who exactly would be performing the services there may be an assumption it 's you   some negotiation may be in order if you want to use subcontractors

how can i calculate my currency risk exposure   you own securities that are priced in dollars so your currency risk is the amount all else being equal that your portfolio drops if the dollar depreciates relative to the euro between now and the time that you plan to cash out your investments not all stocks though have a high correlation relative to the dollar   many us companies e.g. apple do a lot of business in foreign countries and do not necessarily move in line with the dollar   calculate the correlation using excel or other statistical programs between the returns of your portfolio and the change in fx rate between the dollar and euro to see how well your portfolio correlated with that fx rate   that would tell you how much risk you need to mitigate how can i hedge against it   there are various currency etfs that will track the usd eur exchange rate so one option could be to buy some of those to offset your currency risk calculated above   note that etfs do have fees associated with them although they should be fairly small one i looked at had a 0.4 fee which is n't terrible but is n't nothing also note that there are etfs that employ currency risk mitigation internally including one on the nasdaq 100    note that this is not a recommendation for this etf just letting you know about alternative products that might meet your needs

some rich people want to make money without working so they give their money to a company like apollo global management and then apollo global management takes the money that they were given and decides how they will turn that money into more money which they can give back to the person who gave it to them that money they give back is called return or return on investment that 's how the person who gave the money makes money from return on investment the company 's only real purpose is to make money with the money you give them the company takes the money and sometimes they let other companies borrow that money either for a long period of time or short period of time they have different things called stocks bonds commodities and other things that they trade back and forth and they only hope that they will make money doing it it is sort of like they are going to work and playing the lottery every day except they do a lot of math to try and figure out how they can win the money from other companies as quick as possible instead of buying lotto tickets they are buying those things i mentioned stocks bonds commodities and other things by buying or selling these things they are betting that a company will either make or lose money it is basically like a game with you and other people and companies all as players you are betting that the other players in the game will either make or lose money based on what you see other players doing as a player you can win big or small and you can lose big or small there 's a thing called the sec to play the game you have to follow the rules that the sec makes or you will end up in jail they are like the police they are looking for people who do bad things when you are older you can make a lot of money if you work at a company like apollo but you can make more money than a lottery winner if you own a company yourself like apollo

almost any kind of tax will cause market distortions if market distortions discourage activities which would have produced wealth society will lose out not only on the money which was taken by the tax but also on the wealth which could have been but was n't produced if those setting tax policy seek to maximize the amount of revenue that is made available for each dollar that the tax costs society taxing money which is being used to produce more wealth will go against that goal   further most of the things that companies do with their money to produce wealth end up generating taxable income for someone   if a company deducts from its taxes the money it pays to an employee who then has to pay taxes on that money the government ends up collecting about the same taxes as it would collect if the company did n't hire the employee and thus did n't take the deduction the effects of taxes on markets should be one of the most important factors considered when setting tax policy if one tax would cost society $ 1.05 for every dollar raised and another would cost society $ 5.00 for every dollar raised a wise policy would favor the first over the second   unfortunately politics often dominates over economic rationality

unquestionably i think the priority should be funding retirement through roth k over hsa extra   obviously you need to fund your hsa for reasonable and expected medical expenses   also there is some floor to your more traditional retirement funding beyond that what does one do with excess dollars   given the lack of flexibility and fees it seems clear to do roth ira and 401k. beyond that what then   you may want to decide to take some money home and pay taxes on it   do you have a desire to own rental property or start purchase a business   upgrade your home etc if all those things are taken care of only then would i put money into an hsa ymmv but most people maxing a roth ira alone will have plenty of money for retirement given a reasonable rate of return

there are two significant drawbacks to this type of transfer they were the reasons why i kept my american 401(k as is and started funding my canadian rrsp from zero balance 1 taxes a large chunk of your 401(k will be lost to taxes there is probably no way to transfer the funds without making a withdrawal which will incur the us federal tax and the 10 early withdrawal penalty   when the money went into the 401(k you got a tax deduction in the us and the tax break is supposed be repaid later when you make a withdrawal that 's basically how tax deferral works   it 's unlikely that any country will let you take a deduction first and send the payback to a foreign country   the withdrawal amount may also be taxable in canada canadians generally pay taxes on their global income and that includes pensions and distributions from foreign retirement plans   foreign tax credit will apply of course to eliminate double taxation but it 's of little help if your marginal canadian tax rate is higher than your average us tax rate 2 expenses your rrsp will have to be invested in something and mutual fund management expenses are generally higher in canada than in the us   for example my employer sponsored rrsp has a standard poor 's stock index fund that charges 1.5 and that is considered low cost   it also offers a number of managed funds with expenses in excess of 2 that i simply ignore   you can probably invest your american in mutual funds more efficiently

i see you 've marked an answer as accepted but i must tell you that stopping your 401k contribution all together is a bad idea your company match is 100 rate of 50 depending on structure   i do n't care what market you look at or how bad a loan you take out you will not receive 100 rate of return or be charged 100 interest further taking out a loan against your 401k effectively does two things it is a loan that must be repaid according to the terms of your 401k   and in every 401k i 've ever encountered you can not make contributions to the 401k until the loan is repaid this in effect stops your contributions and will almost certainly save you very little on your interest rates on your current loans i have 4 potential solutions that may help achieve your goal without sacrificing your 401k match and transferring the debt from one lender to another but they are conditional is your company match 100 up to 4 of your salary or 50 of your contribution up to a limit you have not yet reached this is important   if it is 100 up to 4 stop committing the additional 4 and use that to pay down your debt and after ward set up that 4 as auto pay into an ira not into the 401k   an ira will make you more money because you have control over its management not your employer if it is 50 match contribute until the match is met because you can not get 50 rate of return anywhere then take your additional monies and get an ira   as far as your debt in this scenario simply suck it up and pay it as is   you will lose far more than you gain by stopping your contributions if you simply must reduce your expenses by 150 $ month try refinancing the mortgage and rolling the 6500 $ into it   if you get a big enough drop in the interest rate you could still end up paying less or if you can not make the gain there try snowballing the three payments   you do this by calling your student loan vendor and telling them you need to make much smaller payments like even zero depending on the type of loan   then take all of the money you are currently spending on the 3 loans and put into the car payment   when it 's gone roll the whole thing into the higher interest student loan then finally roll it all into the last student loan   you 'll pay it off faster and student loans have lots of laws and regulations regarding working with payers to keep them paying something without breaking them whatever you do do not stop your contributions   50 or 100 that money is guaranteed at a higher rate of return than you can get anywhere especially guaranteed

but what about the following scenario which is my paraphrasing of a nanex article i 'm hoping you can help clarify this for me   1 i observe a 1,000 lot advertised for sell on a lit exchange   2 i try to lift the 1,000 by placing a limit order   3 my order goes through some kind of order routing process first 3 orders get executed on a dark pool let 's say i got a 50 lot filled so available offer reduces to 950   4 my order hits a lit exchange i get a partial fill for 100 offer shrinks to 850 but the offered size shrinks instead to 500 or 0   5 now in order to execute my trade i will have to take a higher price than the original advertised liquidity   my question maybe you can answer this is why did my original order size of 1,000 appear in smaller blocks is this because the order routing algorithm breaks up the size   or is it that market makers only post offers in small block sizes e.g. 100 so even if the order book looked like   100 10   100 10   100 10   100 10   100 10   100 10   all the way to 1,000 total as soon as the first 100 shares were lifted the mm can immediately cancel the remainder of the advertised liquidity in practical terms making it impossible to execute large orders at an advertised price

with the standard i am not a lawyer disclaimer consider this question if you and your girlfriend split up sometime after purchasing the house but before getting married would you expect her to repay you for the closing costs and downpayment   that is if you write her a check for $ 5k and 6 months after she signs the papers for the house one of you decides to break up with the other would you expect her to write you a check for $ 5k in return    that is the difference between a gift and a loan disguised as a gift   if the answer is no you do n't expect it back then everything is fine and you 're in the clear it 's perfectly legal to give someone money   if the answer is yes you would want to be paid back then it 's not a gift and you run the risk of running afoul of the regulations    with respect to a previous answer about gifting money that is not taxed in the us one person can give another up to $ 14,000 without worrying about gift taxes and even in the event that you exceed that amount the excess would simply eat into the lifetime exemption of $   individual states may have different rules and exempt amounts that would apply to state taxes    please also consider the income issue for your rental agreement   your gf would be expected to declare that amount and pay income tax on it as a business   she might also declare part of that amount as expected income for purposes of securing the loan but that may run into its own issues you 're not a roommate and presumably the home is not a duplex or set up as apartments and presumably she would not offer a similar deal to someone other than you

although i posted this question more than a year ago i subsequently read information which may be of use as an answer specifically regarding stockbrokers in the uk several years ago in which the fscs stepped in to compensate investors as detailed in the following for reference in case the links above are at some point in future taken offline the fscs faq states q i had deposited money with so can i expect Â£ 85,000 compensation from fscs   a no was not a deposit taker so the money held does not qualify under regulatory rules as a deposit the money will be treated as an investment which carries maximum fscs compensation of Â£ 50,000 per person fscs has no discretion to pay any more q what happens if my losses are over the fscs maximum of Â£ 50,000 and i accept the fscs âs compensation   a if you choose to accept compensation from fscs you will be required to assign or legally transfer to fscs all of your rights to claim in the administration fscs will then claim in the administration standing in your shoes and will claim for the whole of your loss even if it was over Â£ 50,000 when fscs receives the dividends in your place it will then pay to you any amounts recovered to ensure that you do not suffer a disadvantage for having accepted fscs compensation first example 1 loss = Â£ 80,000 fscs compensation = Â£ 50,000 dividend of received by fscs = Â£ 40,000 fscs pays Â£ 30,000 to claimant so he is fully compensated total Â£ 80,000 and retains Â£ 10,000 recovery for itself example 2 loss = Â£ 100,000 fscs compensation = Â£ 50,000 dividend of received by fscs = Â£ 50,000 fscs pays Â£ 50,000 to claimant so he is fully compensated total Â£ 100,000 and retains nothing for itself fscs does not have to have make a full recovery of its Â£ 50,000 before it starts paying its dividend recovery on to claimants claimants are not compelled to claim from fscs or to accept the fscs offer of compensation if a person does not want to transfer his legal rights to claim in the administration to fscs in return for accepting the payment of compensation then s he can decline our compensation and continue his claim in the administration after s he has received the s he can then return to fscs to claim for any remaining shortfall therefore the answer provided by was correct but in circumstances where fraudulent activity would mean otherwise the fscs was willing to intervene on the behalf of investors

that 's your assumption but the details are there are different tiers of liability depending on the level of employees you have have 5,000 + you must pay this increased level of medical insurance or other liabilities    so if he has 7,000 employees and increased liabilities would happen at 5,000 + sounds like there 's a $ $ incentive to decrease to    that 's not emotion that 's just business   the irony would be if he sold to a chinese company that cuts employee benefits and wages and sends most of the profit home while employing tax shelters to yield as little as possible in taxes

at any given time there are buy orders and there are sell orders   typically there is a little bit of space between the lowest sell order and the highest buy order this is known as the bid ask spread   as an example say person a will sell for $ 10.10 but person b will only buy at $ 10.00   if you have a billion shares outstanding just the space between the bid and ask prices represents $ 100,000,000 of market cap now imagine that the ceo is in the news related to some embezzlement investigation   a number of buyers cancel their orders   now the highest buy order is $ 7   there is n't money involved that 's just the highest offer to buy at the time but that 's a drop from $ 10 to $ 7   that 's a change in market cap of $   some seller thinks the stock will continue to fall and some buyer thinks the stock has reached a fair enterprise value at $ 7 billion $ 7 per share   whether or not the seller lost money depends on where the seller bought the stock   maybe they bought when it was an ipo for $ 1   even at $ 7 they made $ 6 per share value is changing not money   though it would be fun there 's no money at the nyse

i typed out a long ish answer but i 'm just going to direct you to this archive papers instead which seems to summarize the available contracts quite well   the biggest problem i see is infrastructure and credit risk say you have somebody with land who wants to start up a farming operation as the financial institution how do you know this person can actually deliver the goods to a distributor how do you know they wo n't just default on their payments the lack of creditworthiness is a big problem in developing countries and many countries lack the proper legal institutions to enforce the contracts further complicating the problem   i think your idea is good but i think widespread retail financing operations in developing countries need a lot of boots on the ground as it were to ensure you know who you 're lending to other alternatives are to just require a huge amount of collateral but impoverished farmers by their definition probably wo n't be able to meet this requirement

congratulations on your raise is my employer allowed to impose their own limit on my contributions    that 's different from the irs limit no is it something they can limit at will or are they required to allow    me to contribute up to the irs limit the employer can not limit you you can contribute up to the irs limit your mistake is in thinking that the irs limit is 17 k for everyone that is not so you 're affected by the hce rules highly compensated employees these rules define certain employees as hce if their salary is significantly higher than that of the rest of the employees and limit the ability of the hce 's to deposit money into 401k based on the deposits made by the rest of the employees basically it means that while the overall maximum is indeed 17 k your personal and other hce 's in your company is lowered down because those who are not hce 's in the company do n't deposit to 401k enough you can read more details and technical explanation about the hce rules in this article and in this blog post

unless there is a compelling reason to do so like reducing interest charges imo you should n't do this the fact that the bank teller or a computer files a ctr does n't imply that you are doing something improper it is simply a regulation that banks are required to adhere to millions of are probably filled out over the course of the year it does n't add more time to your transaction nor does it impact your tax or other liability learning about this stuff can instill a sense of paranoia do n't fall victim to that these are measures in place to make it more difficult to dodge taxation and launder money

debit cards can be riskier than credit cards that 's why i personally avoid debit cards unless i have a very good reason to go that direction e.g. hsa accounts   to explain the risk consider what happens if someone steals the card or number and starts using it credit card you get a big bill which you dispute and eventually get dismissed    debit card your bank account balance drops   you do n't have access to cash and your checks start bouncing and you rack up bounced check charges with your bank and stores where you write checks eventually you convince the bank it was fraud and they refund the money to your account the big difference is that while it is going on you are out the money with a debit card and with a credit card the bank is out the money the above scenario happened to my brother and it was n't pretty he was having to borrow money to pay his rent and groceries while the bank sorted it out

we change it every so often to reduce fraud this is idiocy they receive regular payments they are asking the people who pay them to regularly change where their money is being sent this increases their exposure to fraud dramatically as each time the account is changed there is a risk it will be changed to an account they do not control this is a huge red flag confirm that this is authentic and if so insist that they sign an agreement accepting all liability for the risks this crazy policy causes otherwise you should refuse to go through the effort of confirming new accounts and risking typing or communication errors on a regular basis this is definitely a what were they thinking kind of thing if it 's not fake entirely this answer assumes that you were given a correct explanation that they change it regularly believing that will reduce fraud

if there was no question of improvements to the property the problem would be simple each person invests whatever amount calculate the percentage of each person 's investment out of the entire investment and that 's what share each one owns like a puts in $ 10,000 for the deposit and pays $ 5,000 toward the mortgage over the next however many years b puts in $ 5,000 toward the deposit but pays $ 7,000 of the mortgage c puts in $ 15,000 but pays only $ 1,000 of the mortgage payments so total investments a $ 15,000 b $ 12,000 c $ 16,000 total $ so a 's share of the house is = etc if you then sell it you pay off any outstanding debt and then everybody gets their share of what 's left but once you start making improvements there is no simple formula suppose you put down new flooring in the dining room you pay $ 500 for materials and put in 20 hours of labor presumably you have now added something more than $ 500 to your share but how much more how much are the hours worth what if someone damages the house puts a hole in the all or something and then fixes it does the time and effort they put into fixing it add to their investment or did that just cancel out the damage they did what if one person does a lot to keep the house in generally good condition in small snippets of time like cleaning furnace filters and polishing the floors while another does nothing and lets their share get run down and dirty it gets very complicated theoretically you could come up with a rate at which you value your work like say every hour spent maintaining the house is worth $ 10 or $ 20 or whatever but who 's going to keep track of it over the course of potentially many years and what if one person does a small number of big easily quantifiable jobs while another does many small hard to count jobs like if a the floor every week for 2 years is that worth more or less than b installing 3 ceiling fans a door and 2 windows you could go around and around on this sort of thing

additionally the original commenter i was responding to was making an argument that they do n't make money therefore they 're a failure which is n't a bad argument to make if you 're talking about   companies that make no revenue are generally considered to be failures so in that context he would be correct to say they 're a failure because they make no money and you would n't really need any other points to back up your argument   that being said plenty of businesses start ups especially burn through more money than they make the lack of profit does n't necessarily make them a failure provided they are still generating which tesla is and a lot of it   so if you 'd like to have a discussion about whether they 're making enough revenue or whether they 're poorly re investing the revenue they are making and how those factors might determine whether or not they should be considered a failure then i 'd be happy to participate   but if you 're only interested in making replies that try to to me because you 're too quick to jump to conclusions about what i 've written then have at it i guess whatever floats your boat

hopefully before you invested in this stock you evaluated the company   you looked at the financial information about the company and where the company was headed and evaluated whether the stock was undervalued or overvalued   hopefully you determined that the stock was undervalued at the time you bought it the thing to do now is to reevaluate the stock   do you think the stock is overvalued or undervalued right now   if you did n't own it would you buy it today   instead of looking at the past performance of the stock you want to try to determine which direction the stock will go from today   if you would n't buy it today at it 's current price then you should sell if you have no idea how to do this evaluation neither do i.   for me with the investing knowledge i have right now investing in an individual stock would be way too risky   if you do n't know how to evaluate a stock and determine if it is a good buy or not then you should stay away from individual stocks and instead invest in stock mutual funds which lower the risk by diversifying over lots of stocks

housing prices are set by different criteria it can become memoryless the same as the stock if the criteria used to set its price in the past is no longer valid for example take phoenix or las vegas in the past these were considered attractive investments because of the economical growth and the climate of the area while the climate has n't changed the economical growth stopped not only there but also in the places where people buying the houses lived which is all over the world really what happened to the housing market dropped sharply and stays flat for several years now at the bottom so it does n't really matter if the house was worth $ 300 k in phoenix 5 years ago you can only sell it now for k and that 's about it the prices have been flat low for several years and the house price was $ 50 k but does it mean its going to stay so no once economy gears up the prices will go up as well so its not exactly memory less but the stocks are not memory less as well there is correlation between the past and the future performance if the environment conditions are similar the performance is likely to be similar for stocks however there 's much more environment conditions than the housing market and its much harder to predict them but even with the housing people were burnt a lot on the misconception that the past performance correlates to the future it does n't necessarily

dividends telegraph that management has a longer term focus than just the end of quarter share price   there is a to at least maintain if not periodically increase the dividend payout year over year   management understands that cutting or dividends will cause dividend investors in market to dump shares driving down the stock price    dividends can have preferential tax treatment in some jurisdictions either for an individual compared to capital gains or compared to the corporation paying taxes themselves   for example reits real estate investment trusts are a type of corporation that in order to not pay corporate income tax are required to pay out 95 of income as dividends each year   these are not the only type mlp master limited partnerships and other partnership structures will always have high dividend rates by design dividends provide cash flow and trade market volatility for actual cash   not every investor needs cash flow but for certain investors it reduces the risks of a liquidity crisis such as in retirement   the alternative for an investor who seeks to use the sale of shares would be to maintain a sufficient cash reserve for typical market recessions

i was a millennial stuck in new york i was in law school when the crash happened i wanted to practice in smaller cities like or atl but immediately after the crash there were very few jobs while new york started doing deals again by about late 2009 so i had to go to ny    you end up getting stuck because of the barriers to move for me it was the bar but there are others like markets that recovered more slowly experience requirements set by employers the fact that there are simply more jobs in large urban markets most of my law school class started in sf ny chi and la now we 're on our 2nd firm or city in atl mia etc

my two cents i am a pension actuary and see the performance of funds on a daily basis is it normal to see down years yes absolutely it 's a function of the directional bias of how the portfolio is invested in the case of a 401(k that almost always mean a positive directional bias being long now in your case i see two issues the amount of drawdown over one year it is atypical to have a 14 loss in a little over a year given the market conditions this means that you nearly experienced the entire drawdown of the sp500 which your portfolio is highly correlated to and you have no protection from the downside the use of so called target date funds their very implication makes no sense essentially they try to generate a particular return over the elapsed time until retirement the issue is that the market is by all statistical accounts random with positive drift it can be expected to move up in the long term this positive drift is due to the fact that people should be paid to take on risk so if you need the money 20 years from now what 's the big deal well the issue is that no one and i repeat no one knows when the market will experience long down moves so you happily experience positive drift for 20 years and your money grows to a decent size then right before you retire the market 20%+ of your investments will you recoup these damages most likely yes but will that be in the timeframe you need the market does n't care if you need money or not so here is my advice if you are comfortable taking control of your money see if you can roll your money into an ira some 401(k plans will permit this or if you contribute less that the 401(k contribution limit you make want to just contribute to an ira be mindful of the annual limits in this case you can set up a self directed account here you will have the flexibility to diversify and take action as necessary and by diversify i do n't mean that buy lots of different stuff garbage i mean focus on uncorrelated assets you can get by on a handful of etfs spy tlt qqq ect these all have liquid options available once you build a base you can lower basis by writing covered calls against these positions this is allowed in almost all ira accounts in my opinion and i see this far too often your potential and drive to take control of your assets is far superior than the so called professionals or advisors they will 99 of the time stick you in a target date fund and hope that they make their basis points on your money and retire before you do not saying everyone is unethical but its hard to care about your money more than you will

equity does not represent production divisions in a company i.e. chocolate strawberry and vanilla does not make sense   in sole proprietorship equity represents 1 owner   in partnership equity has at least two sub accounts namely partner 1 and partner 2   in corporations equity may have common stockholders and preferred stockholders or even different class of shares for insiders and angel investors   as you can see equity represents who owns the company it is not what the company does or manufactures   first and foremost define the boundary of the firm are your books titled the books of the family of doe the books of mr mrs doe or the books of mr mrs doe sons   ask yourself who owns this family if you believe that a marriage is perpetual until further notice then it does not make any sense to constantly calculate which parent owns the family more in partnership firm profits are attributed to partner 's accounts using previously agreed ratio for example because partner 1 is more hard working and valuable to the firm   does your child own this family does he she have any rights to use the assets to earn income from the assets to transfer the assets to others or to enforce private property rights if they do n't have a part of these rights they are certainly not part of equity   so what happens to the expenses of children if you follow the partnership model there are two ways the first way is to attribute the loss to the parents family since you do not expect the children to repay it is an unrecoverable loss written off the second way is to create a account to aggregate all child expense then create a separate book called the books children 1 and classify the expense in that separate book   i advise using the family of doe as the firm 's boundary and having 1 equity account to simplify everything it is ultimately up to you to decide the boundaries

therefore i get the outcome i want    the human brain must think it ca n't stop   if you do n't believe me try     the mental process of putting stuff in those is called rationalization   this is a bored mind who wants something   if that mind is not particularly well disciplined those things will get pretty unrealistic    that is what has happened to your friend   landlords do not like drama   they do like money   generally a landlord will be happy to take your money any reasonable way that they can achieve   it sounds like either your landlord lost the ability to do credit cards or he got sick of paying the 3 overhead or some other overhead costs that may be higher because he does not have the right credit card merchant service   for instance paypal here charges flat but a traditional can cost up to $ 2000 a year in up fees and charges    as soon as the landlord calls the rent a debt he has to take cash   but in most places rental is at will and the landlord can evict for any reason or no reason at all except race color national origin family running a daycare center and a few other protected reasons   and there 's not a whole lot you can do about it   even for a lease he can trump up a reason   your friend would be wise to have a meeting of the minds with the landlord about how he 'd like to pay   business is done by mutual consent not non consensual legal tricks   i agree i would n't do ach either    one problem with ach or credit is the landlord can charge anything he pleases and that 's when they start in surcharges for things   once he 's pulled the money out you 're really at a disadvantage to argue since he already has the money and it 's really difficult to do a chargeback on part of a payment so you end up having to chargeback the entire rent check and now he can evict you

you become a teacher generally k-12 but i have heard from the doe    that teachers at state schools qualify as well this is not 100 correct teaching in certain disciplines and areas stem special education title 1 schools can qualify for student loan debt forgiveness depending on the type of debt for instance i believe the federal loan forgiveness program only covers debt remaining after 10 years of teaching in a qualified discipline   do verify this as it 's been several years since i looked into the matter the doe has a student loan forgiveness program but the scope of it is somewhat narrow   i would encourage anyone considering this approach to investigate it in detail before committing to a career in teaching some states have similar programs but they typically have limitations as well

i bought a house 6 months ago for $ 240,000 on an $ 80k salary am getting by just fine and am able to save money and i live on long island an extremely expensive area to live i would look at finding a few more interest rate quotes for instance wells fargo is offering 4.25 right now for fha first time home buyers loan which only require 3.5 down a lower interest rate will lower your monthly payment make the banks compete with one another this little bit of leg work will save you thousands upon thousands of dollars in the long run also try to negotiate to not paying a point down on the mortgage most of the time they are bull especially in this economy banks are desperate for new loans   however as others have said do not assume or count on rent coming in to be able to afford your mortgage unless you are married what if your friend moves out and you can not find another tenant   however i strongly recommend you talk to a financial adviser and your bank mortgage loan officer to work out the numbers you will be surprised what you can afford when you factor in your income tax and mortgage interest write offs

would make sense that the higher liquidation cost and transaction costs are driving the share price down    higher and transaction means higher investors would require higher return driving down the share price the other possibilities i can think of off the top of my head based on looking at the firm for five minutes   1 in transaction costs did you include tax disclaimer math below done on the back of the envelope in between meetings   so nav says they are at liquidating that entire portfolio means about 22 capital gains tax rate which means after tax value is about $ add in any fees you 'd incur from trying to sell this stuff and it 's not unreasonable to assume you 'll only get about $ 55 m once all is said and done which is pretty close to the actual market cap    if you have accounted for the above consider   2 bulk of their investments seem to be in private assets which implies that they have some discretion in how they mark the value of those investments and there is the chance that the market does n't have confidence in these guys what 's their performance been like in recent years especially with a private asset portfolio i 'd be weary    if i was to invest in them i 'd want a higher return for the opaque portfolio

there 's many concrete answers but there 's something circular about your question the only thing i can think of is that phone service providers ask for credit report when you want to start a new account but i am sure that could be worked around if you just put down a cash deposit in some cases so now the situation is flipped you are relying on your phone company 's credit   who is to say they do n't just walk away from their end of the deal now that you have paid in full    the amount of credit in this situation is you just have to eat the risk and rely on their credit because you have no credit it does n't matter how much money you have $ 10 or $ 10000 can be out of you equally well if you must always pay for future goods up front you also ca n't use that money month by month now even in low risk investments although they will do exactly that and keep the interest and i challenge your assumption that you will never default you are not a being you live on planet earth ever had to pay $ 125,000 for a treatment because you got a rare form of cancer well you wo n't be able to default on your phone plan and pay for your drug or food if you bankrupt yourself on the drug because your money is already gone i know you asked a simpler question but i ca n't write a good answer without pointing out that no default is a bad model it 's like doing math without a zero element by the way this is realistic it applies to renting in say new york city it 's better to be a tenant with credit who can withhold rent in issue of neglected maintenance or gross unfair treatment than a tenant who has already paid full rent and has left the landlord with little market incentive to do their part

the ruble was is and will be very unstable because of unstable political situation in russia and the economy strongly dependent of the export of raw resources what you can do i assume you want to minimize risk the best way to achieve that is to make your savings in some stable currency euro and swiss franc are currently very stable currencies so storing your surpluses in them is a very good option if you want to keep your money safe to prevent political risk you should keep your money in countries with stable political regime which are unlikely to nationalize the savings of the citizens in predictable future as for your existing savings in rubles it 's a hard deal i assume as the web developer you have a plenty of money which have lost a lot of value if you convert them to euro or francs you will the current value after the loss you 'll safe them ruble falling down but in case the ruble will return to previous value you 'll loose   keeping savings in currencies is however speculation like investing in gold etc so if you can mentally accept the loss and want to sleep good convert them you have also option to invest in properties for example buy an extra appartment it 's a good way to deal with financial surplus in europe in us however you should be aware in it 's connected with the political risk the real estates can be confiscated in any moment by the state and you ca n't run away with it the savings can also be confiscated but there 's a fair chance you 'll manage to rescue them if you act quickly

this may be more of a comment than an answer but it 's too long for a comment perhaps the stackexchange gods will forgive my that said even with the tax penalties it can be to your advantage to put money into a retirement account and withdraw it before retirement the trick is is the amount of the tax penalty more than the benefit of untaxed compound growth for example just to make up some numbers suppose you have $ 1000 of gross income to invest you are considering whether to invest in an ordinary non tax favored account or a classic ira either way you will get 10 returns your tax rate both when you put the money in and when you take it out is 15 there is a 10 tax penalty for early withdrawal with an ordinary account you will pay 15 tax off the top so you are only investing $ 850 then each year 15 of your returns are paid in taxes so your net return is 8.5 but when you withdraw the money there are no additional taxes with an ira you do not pay any taxes up front so you can invest the entire $ 1000 you collect 10 each year with no taxes when you withdraw you pay 15 plus the 10 penalty equals 25 so after 5 years the ordinary account would yield $ 850 x ^ 5 = $ the ira would yield $ 1000 x 1.1 ^ 5 x 0.75 = $ the tax penalty hurts you are better to use the ordinary account but if you could leave your money in for 25 years then the ordinary account would yield $ 850 x ^ 25 = $ the ira would yield $ 1000 x 1.1 ^ 25 x 0.75 = $ the ira even with the tax penalty is better of course my numbers are just made up what your tax bracket is what returns you get and how long you think you might leave the money in the investment all vary

as the premiums go up so do the individuals subsidies because they are limited in how much they have to pay john has to pay $ 450 if his total insurance costs $ 11k or $ 15 k. so in effect he will get more money to pay for his increased insurance costs    this increases the overall costs to the taxpayers by millions of dollars the money goes to the person to pay premiums instead of straight to insurance companies    the taxpayers would be much better off if the payments to insurance companies continue to prevent the raise in premiums if trump stops the payments we are all going to pay more except for those near the poverty level

fta yet this new study notes that subsidies are nât simply cash being handed to oil companies subsidies often come in the form of tax breaks which is just one of the many ways oil companies receive government handouts   tax breaks are not subsidies   the taxpayer pay absolutely nothing to the oil companies when a tax break is applied   the taxpayers are actually net recipients from the drilling activity   if the existence of a tax break is a requirement for oil drilling profitability then elimination of the tax break would eliminate drilling   the taxpayers are choosing between zero additional tax revenue without tax breaks or some tax revenue with tax breaks so drilling can proceed   the article âs point about export ports being subsidized by the taxpayer is a distraction   the vast majority of oil produced in the us is consumed in the us   all that oil is drilled transported refined transported again then sold to consumers in an end to end supply chain built on a vast sum of private capital

while people will say i 'm going to sue you for all your worth that 's not how it really works when someone brings a lawsuit they are supposed to show how much harm you actually caused them the court then awards them an amount equal to whatever the judge or jury are convinced was the actual harm so in the case of a car accident if someone can convince the court that you caused the accident and that he had $ 100,000 in medical bills lost wages from work and/or whatever other expenses than the court will order you to pay $ 100,000 a court can add on compensation for pain and suffering and it can add punitive damages if you were reckless and irresponsible but that does n't change the point here if you 're a billionaire and this is less than you spend on lunch in a week good for you you pay it and you 're done if your only assets are the clothes you 're wearing and your iphone and you do n't have enough insurance to cover it then you will be in debt for a long long time saying sorry i do n't have that much money will not help your liability is not limited to what you can afford to pay many people say that in real life courts will order big companies that are responsible for an accident to pay more than it would order an ordinary person to pay because they figure that they can afford it i do n't know whether that 's true but even if the court goes easy on you because you 're poor you can still be ordered to pay a substantial amount of money if the amount is totally beyond what you have if the court orders you to pay $ 1 million and you make $ 10,000 a year than the other person ca n't expect to ever get all their money but you 'll be paying for the rest of your life

generally speaking personal loans have higher rates than car loans   during fairly recent times the market for car loans has become very competitive   a local credit union offers loans as low as which is about half the prevailing mortgage rate   in comparison personal loans are typically in the 10 14 range    even if it made mathematical sense to do so i doubt any bank would give you a personal loan secured by a car rather than car loan   either the brain would not work that way or it would simply be against company policy these questions always interest me why the desire to maximize credit score   there is no correlation between credit score and wealth   there is no reward for anything beyond a sufficiently high score to obtain the lowest rates which is attained by simply paying one 's bills on time   one will always be limited by income when the amount able to borrow is calculated regardless of score    i can understand wanting to maximize different aspects of personal finance such as income or investment return percentage etc   by why credit score   this is further complicated by a evolving algorithm   attempts to game the score today may not work in the future

the question you are asking concerns the exercise of a short option position   the other replies do not appear to address this situation suppose that apple is trading at $ 96 and you sell a put option with a strike price of $ 95 for some future delivery date say august 2016   the option contract is for 100 shares and you sell the contract for a premium of $ 3.20 when you sell the option your account will be credited with the premium and debited with the broker commission   the premium you receive will be $ 320 = 100 x $ 3.20   the commission you pay will depend on you broker now suppose that the price of apple drops to $ 90 and your option is exercised either on expiry or prior to expiry   then you would be obliged to take delivery of 100 apple shares at the contracted option strike price of $ 95 costing you $ 9,500 plus broker commission   if you immediately sell the apple shares you have purchased under your contract obligations then assuming you sell the shares at the current market price of $ 90 you would realise a loss of $ 500 = plus commission   since you received a premium of $ 320 when you sold the put option your net loss would be $ = $ 180 plus any commissions paid to your broker now let 's look at the case of selling a call option   again assume that the price of apple is $ 96 and you sell a call option for 100 shares with a strike price of $ 97 for a premium of $   the premium you receive would be $ 360 = 100 x $   you would also be debited for commission by your broker now suppose that the price of apple shares rises to $ 101 and your option is exercised   then you would be obliged to deliver 100 apple shares to the party exercising the option at the contracted strike price of $ 97   if you did not own the shares to effect delivery then you would need to purchase those shares in the market at the current market price of $ 101 and then sell them to the party exercising the option at the strike price of $ 97   this would realise an immediate loss of $ 400 = 100 x $ plus any   commission payable   if you did own the shares then you would simply deliver them and possibly pay some commission or a delivery fee to your broker   since you received $ 360 when you sold the option your net loss would be $ 40 = $ plus any commission and fees payable to the broker it is important to understand that in addition to these accounting items short option positions carry with them a margin requirement   you will need to maintain a margin deposit to show good faith so long as the short option position is open   if the option you have sold moves against you then you will be called upon to put up extra margin to cover any potential losses

excellent question and it is a debate that is often raised   mathematically you are probably best off using option 1   any money that is above and beyond minimum payments earns a pretty high interest rate about in the form of saved interest payments the problem is you are likely to get discouraged   personal finance is a lot about behavior and after working at this for a year and still having 5 loans albeit a lower balance might take a bit of fight out of you paying off such a large balance in a reasonable time will take a lot of fight with the debt snowball you pay the minimum to the student loan save in an outside account and when it is large enough you execute option 2   so a year from now you might only have three loans instead of five   if you behaved exactly the same your balance would be higher after that year then using the previous method however often one does not behave the same   because the goals are shorter and more attainable it is easier to delay some gratification   the 8 dollars you are saving in your weekly gas budget because of low prices is meaningful when saving for a 4 k goal where it is meaningless when looking at it as a 74 k goal   with the 4 k goal you are more apt to put that money in your savings where the 74 k goal you might spend it on a latte for me the debt snowball worked really well with either option make sure that excess payments actually go to a reduction in principle not a prepayment of interest   given this you may be left with no option   for example if method 1 you only prepay interest you are forced to use option 2

yes you should invest and yes you should save for the house down payment these should be two separate pools of money and the goals and time frames for them are different with a 3 year time frame for the down payment on the house the risk you should accept should be essentially zero that means it is less of an investment and more plain vanilla savings account or maybe a higher interest account or a cd the worst thing to have happen would be to try and save for the house while the value of your investment keeps dropping   you have to decide how to allocate your income between retirement accounts and saving for the house while still meeting all your other obligations the exact balance depends on how much you need to save for retirement and things such as rules for the company match

the crazy thing about this is that $ 30 million in annual salary and compensation really is n't the end of the story for rich guys   i worked for a reit a few years back and the guy that founded that reit made a few million in salary a year   i thought the number seemed a bit low for his lifestyle   he had many properties in the us for his own personal use around 6 8 big homes   he also had a garage that was insane   he had over 25 very expensive cars   my co workers would say nick is out his garage when he drove one to work every day for a month without driving the same vehicle twice in one month   it turns out he owned 30 million shares of stock that paid him $ 1.00 per share per year   so while his annual compensation was only a few million per year his dividend income was many many times that   think about that next time you see a ceo 's annual income and you think that it really is n't as much as you expect

vanguard released an analysis paper in 2013 titled dollar cost averaging just means taking risk later   this paper explores the performance between a dollar cost averaging strategy and a lump sum strategy when you already possess the funds this paper is an excellent read but the conclusion from the executive summary is we conclude that if an investor expects such trends to continue is    satisfied with his or her target asset allocation and is comfortable with    the risk return characteristics of each strategy the prudent action is investing the lump sum immediately to gain exposure to the markets    as soon as possible the caveat to the conclusion is weighing your emotions   if you are primarily concerned with minimizing the possibility of a loss then you should use a dollar cost averaging strategy with the understanding that on a purely mathematical basis the dollar cost averaging strategy is likely to under perform a lump sum investment of the funds the paper explores a 10 year holding period with either the analysis includes various portfolio and is backtested against the united states united kingdom and australian markets based on this as far as i 'm concerned the rule of thumb is invest the lump sum if you 're going to invest at all

one more thing to consider is that $ 1 m today is not the same as $ 1 m 30 years from now because of inflation   consider that just 30 years ago 1980 the average house price in the us was only about $ 69 k and a new car cost around $ 7 k on average   when you retire it is n't much of a stretch to assume that you could be paying $ 1.5 m for a typical house $ 100 k for mid grade car by the time you retire in 30 years   of course over the rest of your working life your salary will likely increase due to inflation too so that will help in 1980 the average us income was around $ 19k year so even though that number seems huge it is because it is denominated in currency that has been devalued significantly

another possibility is that a lot of it is bought using borrowed money especially if much of your own money is in the stock market it may be beneficial to take out a loan to buy something compared to selling other assets to raise the same amount of cash even going by the likely relatively conservative Â£ 200k year before taxes you are looking at a very nice house going for perhaps around 3 5 years worth of pre tax income let 's say you have good contacts at the bank and can secure a loan for Â£ 500 k at 3.5 interest not at all unreasonable if you make half that before taxes in a single year and purchase something that can be used as collateral for the money borrowed with a bit of negotiating i would n't be surprised if one could push the interest rate even lower and stock in a publicly traded company can also trivially be used as collateral that 's less than Â£ 1500/month in interest before any applicable tax effects less than 10 of the before tax income and like @victor wrote i think it 's reasonable to say that especially if the company is publicly traded the ceo makes more than Â£ 200k year given an income of Â£ 200k year and assuming 30 taxes on that amount the marginal tax would likely be higher and this includes e.g. interest expense deductions the money left over after taxes and interest payments on a Â£ 500 k 3.5 debt is still about Â£ 10k month even with a pretty rapid amortization schedule and even if the actual tax rate is higher that leaves quite a bit of money to be away in savings and other investments

get everything in writing that includes ownership money in money out who is allowed to use the place how much they need to pay the other partners who pays for repairs whether to provide friends and family discounts who is allowed to sell what happens if someone dies how is the mortgage set up what to do if one of you becomes delinquent etc etc etc money and friends do n't mix and that 's mostly because people have different ideas in their head about what fair means anything you do n't have in writing if it comes up in a disagreement could cause a friendship ending fight even if you are able to agree on every term and condition under the sun there 's still a problem what if 5 years from now someone decides that a certain clause is n't fair imagine one of you needs to move into the condo because your primary residence was pulled out from under you they crash at the condo because they have no where else to go you try to demand payment but they lost their job the agreement might say you must pay the partnership if you use the condo personally at the standard monthly rate of days but what is the penalty clause is everything under penalty of eviction and forced sale of the condo and distribution of profits following through on such a penalty means the friendship would be over you would feel guilty about doing it and also about not doing it at the same time your other partner loses their job and ca n't make 1/3rd of the mortgage payments anymore they need the rent or the bank will foreclose on their house etc etc etc even things like maintenance are the 3 of you going to do it yourselves labour distributed how will anyone get a management fee what about a referral fee for a new renter once you 've thought of all possible circumstances and rules and drafted it in writing go talk to a lawyer and maybe an accountant there will be many things you wo n't have considered yet and paying a few grand today will save you money and friends in the future

many colleges have offices that can help students find off campus housing they will have information about rooms being let by families and about houses being shared by groups of students the biggest issue is that many of the best places were filled months ago with only a month to go before classes start time is tight you can also look for electronic listings organized through a campus newspaper   the advantage of going through university resources is that they will have more information regarding the types of students they are looking for a house full of undergrads is different than a family house that rents only to young professors

you should really be talking to a tax adviser ea cpa licensed in your state about taxes and to a lawyer about the liability protection you wo n't find answers from neither of theses here besides the liability protection how do these 2 options affect taxes there 's no liability protection difference between the two talk to a lawyer to verify since you 'll be cosigning them personally either way in the first case loan to the llc everything goes on the 1065 and you get the bottom line on k-1 which transfers to you own tax return in the second case the loan interest is your personal investment expense schedule a deduction while the loan proceeds you moved to the llc add to your basis i 'd suggest getting the loan directly in the llc name if you can however the lawyers seem to agree that this would void the mortgage    because of the due on sale clause in mortgage loans due on sale may or may not be but that 's a risk you 'd be taking yes llc is a separate legal entity as opposed to a living trust to which your second quote seems to be referring so it is definitely a possibility for a lender to call on the loan if you re title it

see my answer here what is the dividend tax rate for uk stock the only tax from us stocks you 'd need to worry about would be dividend withholding tax of 30   if you contact your isa provider they should be able to provide you with a w8-ben form so that you can have this rate reduced to 15   just because there 's a tax treaty does not mean you will automatically be charged 15 you must provide a w8-ben form and renew it when it expires that last 15 is unfortunately unavoidable   if you were paying any uk taxes you could claim that 15 as a discount against your uk dividend tax liability but as your us stock would be wrapped in an isa there 's no uk tax to pay which means no tax to reclaim from the tax treaty other than though you will pay absolutely no tax on us stocks held in an isa to either the us or uk government

many states have a simple method for assessing income tax on nonresidents   if you have $ x income in state a where you claim nonresident status and   $ y income overall then you owe state a a fraction x y of the income   tax that would have been due on $ y income had you been a resident of state a.   in other words compute the state income tax on $ y as per state a rules and send us x y of that amount   if you are a resident of state b then state b   will tax you on $ y but give you some credit for taxes paid to state a. thus you might be required to file a state a income tax return regardless of how small $ x is   as a practical matter many commercial real estate   investments are set up as limited partnerships in which most of the annual taxable income is a small amount of portfolio income usually interest income that you report on schedule b of form 1040 and the annual   bottom line is lots of passive losses which the limited partners report but do not get to deduct on the federal return   as a result state a is unlikely to come after you for the tax on say $ 100 of interest income each year because it will cost them more to go after you than they will   recover from you but when the real estate is sold there will hopefully be a big capital gain most of which   will be sheltered from federal tax since the passive losses finally get   to be deducted   at this point state a is not only owed a lot of money it knows nothing of your passive losses etc but after it processes the income tax return that you filed for that year it will likely demand that you file income tax returns for previous years as well

earnings per share is the company profit or loss divided by the number of outstanding shares the number should always be compared to the share price so for instance if the eps is $ 1 and the share price is $ 10 the eps is 10 of the share price this means that if the company keeps up this earning you should expect to make 10 yearly on your investment long term the stock price may fluctuate but if the company keeps on making money you will eventually do so too as investor if the eps is low it means that the market expects the earnings to rise in the future either because the company has a low profit margin that can be vastly improved or because the business is expected to grow especially the last case may be a risky investment as you will lose money if the company does n't grow fast enough even if it does make a healthy profit note that the listed eps like most key figures is based on the last financial statement recent developments could mean that better or worse is generally expected also note that the earnings of some companies will fluctuate wildly for instance companies that produce movies or video games will tend to have a huge income for a quarter or two following a new release but may be in the negative in some periods this is fine as long as they turn a profit long term but you will have to look at data for a longer period in order to determine this

i 'd like to know if there is any reliable research on the subject intuitively this must be true no is it first is it even possible to discover the correlation if one exists dave ramsey is a proponent of proven study that shows you will spend 10 more on a credit card than with cash of course he suggests that the study came from an otherwise reliable source dun bradstreet a fellow blogger at get rich slowly researched and found nobody i know has been able to track down this mythical dun and    bradstreet study even dun and bradstreet themselves have been unable    to locate it reader with the assistance of her trusty    contacted the company and received this response    after doing some research with it turns out that someone made up    the statement and also made up the part where actually said    that in other words the most cited study is a myth   in fact there are studies which do conclude that card users spend more i think that any study on anything not just this topic cigarette companies buy studies to show they do n't cause cancer big oil pays to disprove global warming etc needs to be viewed with a critical eye the studies i 've seen nearly all contain one of 2 major flaws my own observation when i reviewed our budget over the course of a year some of the largest charges include i list the above as these are items whose cost is pretty well fixed we are not in the habit of going for a drive gas is bought when we need it all other items i consider fixed in that the real choice is to pay with the card or check unlike the items some claim can be inflated these add to about 80 of the annual card use i do n't see it possible for card use to impact these items and therefore the 10 more warning is   to conclude i 'll concede that even the pay in full group might not adhere to the food budget and grab the $ 5 brownie near the checkout or over tip on a restaurant meal but those situations are not sufficient to assume that a responsible card user comes out behind over the year for having done so   a selection of the studies i am referencing

another good reason if you have to replace a card due to damage loss or identity theft it 's nice to have a backup you can use until the new card for your primary account arrives i know folks who use a secondary card for online purchases specifically so they can kill it if necessary without impacting their other uses online arguably being at more risk if there 's no yearly fee and if you 're already paying the bill in full every month a second card account is mostly harmless if you have trouble yourself with one card a second could be dangerous

this is assuming that you are now making some amount x per month which is more than the income you used to have as a student otherwise the question seems rather moot all figures should be net amounts after taxes first figure out what the difference in your cost of living is that is housing electricity utilities the basics that you need to have to have a place in which to live i 'm not considering food costs here unless they were subsidized while you were studying basically you want to figure out how much you now have to spend extra per month for basic sustenance then figure out how much more you are now making compared to when you were a student subtract the sustenance extra from this to get your net pay increase after that is when it gets trickier basically you want to set aside or invest as much of the pay increase as possible but you probably have other expenses now that you did n't before and which you can not really do that much about this be particular types of clothes commute fares car gas bus pass or something entirely different anyway decide on a savings goal as a percentage of your net pay increase compared to when you were a student this might be 5 10 or if you are really ambitious 50 or more whichever number you pick make sure it 's reasonable giving your living expenses and keep in mind that anything is better than nothing find a financial institution that offers a high interest savings account preferably one with free withdrawals and sign up for one each and every time you get paid figure out how much to save based on the percentage you determined if your regular case is that you get the same payment each time you can simply set up an automated bank transfer put that in the savings account and for the moment forget about that money try your best to live only on the remainder but if you realize that you set aside too much do n't be afraid to tap into the savings account adjust your future deposits accordingly and try to find a good balance at the end of each month deposit whatever remains in your regular account into your savings account and if that is a sizable amount of money consider raising your savings goal a little the ultimate goal should be that you do n't need to tap into your savings except for truly exceptional situations but still keep enough money outside of the savings account to cater to some of your wants yes bank interest rates these days are often pretty dismal and you will probably be lucky to find a savings account that especially after taxes will even keep up with inflation but to start with what you should be focusing on is not to make money in terms of real value appreciation but simply figuring out how much money you really need to sustain a working life for yourself and then walking that walk eventually this may take anywhere from a couple of months to a year or more you should have settled pretty well on an amount that you feel comfortable with setting aside each month and just letting be by that time you should have a decently sized nest egg already which will help you get over rough spots and can start thinking about other forms of investing some of what you are setting aside whenever you get a net pay raise of any kind gross pay raise lower taxes bonus whichever increase your savings goal by a portion of that raise maybe give yourself 60 of the raise and bank the remaining 40 that way you are hopefully always increasing the amount of money that you are setting aside while also reaping some benefits right away one major upside of this approach is that if you lose your job not only will you have that nest egg you will also be used to living on less so you will have more money in the bank and less monthly expenses which puts you in a significantly better position than if you had only one of those let alone neither

i 'm not op but i think a very basic example would be brand choice every day people choose to buy cheaper products over greener products cups still exist because people buy them companies get as big as walmart because people shop there   if people really have a shit they could simply make different choices in a capitalistic system that would then promote small local business and sustainable practices but people choose lower prices every single time without regard to the inequalities or environmental destruction their choices promote

i 'm not being clear enough i 'll try a different tack   what sits behind the concept of corporate personhood that gives it such flexibility to pick and choose what parts of natural personhood they want bar them from financial involvement in politics oh no that would violate their first amendment rights just like a natural person being ca n't have that   write off expenses before paying tax on remaining income oh yes we definitely must keep that nevermind that a natural person is n't treated like that   okay so there is a huge difference between corporate and natural personhood even with a history of corporate did companies become people the legal evolution what i 'm missing is a walk through of the arguments that established the collective rights of an of natural persons rises to the level where those rights must be secured the same as a natural person in layman terms what steps were used to reach that conclusion without going to law school and then through the actual historical decisions

this answer will assume you know more math than most an ideal case for the point of argument first consider the following admittedly incorrect assumptions 1   the prices of all assets in your investment universe are continuously differentiable functions of time 2   investor r for rebalance continuously buys and sells in order to maintain a constant proportion of each of several investments in his portfolio 3   investor p for passive starts with the same portfolio as r but neither buys nor sells then under the assumptions of no taxes or trading costs it is a mathematical theorem that investor p 's portfolio return fraction will be the weighted arithmetic mean of the return fractions of all the individual investments whereas investor r will obtain the weighted geometric mean of the return fractions of the individual investments it 's also a theorem that the weighted arithmetic mean is always greater than or equal to the weighted geometric mean so regardless of what happens in the market given the above assumptions the passive investor p does at least as well as the rebalancing investor r.   p will do even better if taxes and trading costs are factored in the real world   of course prices are n't continuously differentiable or even continuous nor can you continuously trade   indeed under such assumptions the optimal investing strategy would be to sample the prices sufficiently rapidly to capture the derivatives and then to move all your assets to the stock increasing at the highest relative rate   this crazy momentum trading would destabilize the market and cause the assumptions to break the point of this is not to argue for or against rebalancing but to point out that any argument for rebalancing which continues to hold under the above ideal assumptions is bogus   many such arguments do   if a stockbroker standing to profit from commission pushes rebalancing on you with an argument that still holds under the above assumptions then he is profiting off of bs

there are two things to consider taxes beneficial treatment for long term holding and for espp 's you can get lower taxes on higher earnings also depending on local laws some share schemes allow one to avoid some or all on the income tax for example in the uk Â£ 2000 in shares is treated differently to 2000 in cash vesting restricted stocks or options can only be sold exercised years after being granted as long as the employee keeps his part of the contract usually staying at the same place of works through the vesting period this means job retention for the employees that 's why they do n't really care if you exercise the same day or not they care that you actually keep working until the day when you can exercise arrives by then you 'll get more grants you 'll want to wait to vest and so on this would keep you at the same place of work for a long time because by quitting you 'd be forfeiting the grants

if you want your order to go through no matter what then you should be using market orders rather than limit orders with limit orders you may get the price you are after or better but you are not guaranteed to get your order transacted with a market order you are guaranteed to get you order transacted but may get a price inferior to what you were after most times this should only be a few cents but can get much larger in a fast moving or less liquid market you should incorporate this slippage into your trading plan maybe a better option for you if you are looking at + or 0.5 from the last price would be to use conditional triggers stop buy and sell orders with your market orders once the market moves in your direction your conditional order will be triggered and the stock will be bought at current market price

it depends where you are going to live and how you are going to pay for your new accommodation if you are moving within the uk and intend to buy another house you run into the problem that you will find it hard to get a second mortgage if you rent out the house in kent you will probably have to change the mortgage basis on it to a mortgage that allows for letting normal residential mortgages exclude that entirely which would allow you to take out a residential mortgage it depends how much equity you have in the house if most of the value of the house is mortgaged then you 'll 1 find it hard to re mortgage on a commercial mortgage 2 may find it hard to cover the costs by letting and 3 are very sensitive to house prices falling also bear in mind that for the past three months in a row house prices in the uk have mostly either stagnated or fallen so you can not guarantee any increase in value of the house in kent what i 'm saying is there is no crystal ball that will tell you what 's financially the best thing to do talk to estate agents find out how much the house would sell for how much it would rent for talk to your mortgage lender and find out if they will let you rent it out talk to other mortgage lenders and find out how much a commercial mortgage would cost do the sums find out if renting the house would cover the costs in which case you can gamble on the housing market continuing to rise do n't rely on house prices continuing to rise as they have done before certainly where i live due to the number of new houses being built and other economic issues house prices have fallen over the past few months and may well continue to fall as more and more new houses come on the market

nothing necessarily has to benefit right now what primarily drives demand for gold is its perceived use as a hedge against the inflation of fiat currency i.e. when inflation strikes the price of gold goes up rapidly thus for a given currency gold decreasing in price is almost always a signal that the currency is increasing in value however it may be that at some point in time people everywhere just decide that gold is no longer worth using as an inflation hedge and thus the price collapses simply because demand collapsed no corresponding benefit

this is an old post i feel requires some more love for completeness   though several responses have mentioned the inherent risks that currency speculation leverage and frequent trading of stocks or currencies bring about more information and possibly a combination of answers is necessary to fully answer this question my answer should probably not be the answer just some additional information to help aid your and others firstly as a retail investor do n't trade forex period major currency pairs arguably make up the most efficient market in the world and as a layman that puts you at a severe disadvantage you mentioned you were a student since you have something else to do other than trade currencies implicitly you can not spend all of your time researching monitoring and investigating the various infinite drivers of currency return since major financial institutions such as banks broker dealers hedge funds brokerages inter dealer brokers mutual funds etf companies etc do have highly intelligent people researching monitoring and investigating the various drivers of currency return at all times you 're unlikely to win against the opposing trader not impossible to win just improbable over time that probability will rob you clean secondly investing in individual businesses can be a worthwhile endeavor and especially as a young student one that could pay dividends pun intended for a very long time that being said what i mentioned above also holds true for many large capitalization equities there are thousands maybe millions of very intelligent people who do nothing other than research a few individual stocks and are often paid quite handsomely to do so as with forex you will often be at a severe informational disadvantage when trading so view any purchase of a stock as a very long term commitment at least five years and if you 're going to invest in a stock you must review the company 's financial history that means through 10-k q for several years i typically examine a minimum ten years of financial statements and reading the notes to the financial statements read the yearly quarterly is usually too volatile to be useful for long term investors management discussion and analysis but remember management pays themselves with your money i assure you management will always place a cherry on top even if that cherry does not exist if you are a shareholder any expense the company pays is partially an expense of yours never forget that no matter how small a position you have partial ownership of the business in which you 're invested thirdly i need to address the stark contrast and often but not always deep conflict between the concepts of investment and speculation according to seth klarman written on page 21 in his famous margin of safety both investments and speculations can be bought and sold both typically fluctuate in price and can thus appear to generate investment returns but there is one critical difference investments throw off cash flow for the benefit of the owners speculations do not the return to the owners of speculations depends exclusively on the of the resale market this seems simple and it is but do not underestimate the profound distinction mr. klarman makes here and ask yourself will forex pay you cash flows while you have a position on a simple test prior to purchasing a stock might help to differentiate between investment and speculation at what price are you willing to sell and why i typically require the answer to be at least 50 higher than the current salable price so that i have a margin of safety and that i will never sell unless there is a material operating change accounting fraud or more generally regime change within the industry in which my company operates furthermore i then research what types of operating changes will alter my opinion and how severe they need to be prior to a liquidation i then write this in a journal to keep myself honest this is the personal aspect to investing the kind of thing you learn only by doing yourself and it takes a lifetime to master you can try various methodologies there are tons of books but overall just be cautious money lost does not return on its own i 've just the surface of a 200,000 page investing book you need to read if you 'd like to do this professionally or as a if this seems like too much or you want to wait until you 've more time to research consider index investing strategies i wo n't delve into these here   and because i 'm an investment professional please do not interpret anything you 've read here as personal advice or as a solicitation to buy or sell any securities or types of securities whatsoever this has been provided for general informational purposes only contact a financial advisor to review your personal circumstances such as time horizon risk tolerance liquidity needs and asset allocation strategies again nothing written herein should be construed as individual advice

one is a choice the other is not while they are both liabilities on the balance sheet in the real world they are quite different    we do not feel as much ownership over our money that goes to interest payments as we do over our tax payments   taxes pay for our government and the services it provides   interest on the other hand is what we pay in order to have a bank loan us money   similar to paying for a good or service obtained from some other business we do not feel we have a say in what the bank does with that money   if we of a business practices we stop doing business with them assuming there are other choices   we can not practically avoid dealing with our government    we certainly feel that we should have a say in what is done with our tax money   i doubt there is anyone in the world that completely approves of their government 's spending   it is very easy to feel with regard to our tax payments   for example some people feel resentment because their taxes fund the welfare rolls all that said i believe there is little overlap between the two groups   it seems to me that you are referring to those with large amounts of high interest e.g. credit card debt   i doubt that a large percentage of them are the tax laws looking for deductions and loopholes   if they had that mindset they would also be working hard to get out of the hole they are in    in summary we choose to pay a financial adviser to take out a loan or to obtain a credit card   we do not choose to pay taxes   since taxes are supposed to pay for our government and things which should benefit everyone we want a say in what is done with it   this is also the case because it is forced on us   fine son i 'll lend you some money but i do n't want you buying cigarettes with it   since our say is limited and we likely will not approve of everything our government does we want to exert what control we do have reduce our payments as best we can

you may simply be asking why stocks gap up or gap down when the stock market opens this is because the price adjusts to news that occurred while the exchanges were closed overnight perhaps asian stocks crashed or perhaps a news story was released in the new york times about some major company there are thousands of factors that affect market sentiment and the big gaps that happen at the open of every trading day is the price of the stocks catching up to those factors

if it is achievable it is almost certainly better than just tying the whole economy to the price of a single commodity if it is not achievable then it is almost certainly better to let the markets adjust and correct however than to tie the whole economy to the whims and wishes of incompetent and politically motivated money printers   so what i 'm getting from all of this is basically how we view the possibility of a workable flat currency   i think the possibility of whether or not a flat currency will actually work depends on many things some more important than others the size and power influence of a country can greatly affect how a flat currency will work within that country   if the country is large and power hungry like ours then a flat currency will most likely not work in the long run it will promote greed and monopolization of wealth but what of gold that ca n't work either because a large country ca n't sustain itself off such an inefficient monetary system   so to me it seems like extremely large countries should be split into smaller countries that can actually use flat currencies or gold without all of the potential for corruption   this same sort of logic applies to our cousins if a tribe of gets too large the group will split to relieve social tension   this is a big part of why i support ideas like   do you think there is a way for monetary systems to work in very large countries

for the first four months of the year when you were an employee the health insurance premiums were paid for with pre tax money   when you receive your w-2 at the end of the year the amount in box 1 of the w-2 will be reduced by the amount you paid for health insurance   you ca n't deduct it on your tax return because it has already been deducted for you now that you are a 1099 independent contractor you are self employed and eligible for the self employed health insurance deduction   however as you noted the cobra premiums are likely not eligible for this deduction because the policy is in your old employer 's name   see this question for details but keep in mind that there are conflicting answers on that question

this will likely cause either a running out of funds in hsa 2 as    the aggregate $ 6500 limit is nearing b an over contribution    situation between hsa 1 and hsa 2 2014 hsa contributions are under the limit by $ 3000 2015 expenses currently sit at about $ 3000 the solution is to stop putting money into hsa 2 so that you do n't go over the aggregate limit for this tax year but then using the money in hsa 1 to pay the medical costs if the person making the contribution had the ability to put money into either hsa then they should have the ability to spend that money from either account i realize the goal of the april transaction was to be able to effectively put $ into the hsa system in 2015 with the transaction that missed the deadline by seconds that opportunity is lost but any medical costs that can be paid with money in hsa 1 should be paid for with money from that account you do n't have to keep funds in hsa 1 while worrying about hsa 2 running out of funds the beauty of an hsa is that you can continue to pay medical expenses out of an account for years after you no longer have a high deductible insurance plan it can even be used in retirement

as everyone else has said we 're producing gasoline not crude oil   but since you asked even if we did produce enough crude for our needs we would still import if someone else can produce it more cheaply or if our resources would be better spent elsewhere   the classic example from economics class is a dentist hiring someone to mow his lawn   sure the dentist is a healthy guy he could mow his own grass for free   but that would take him an hour and he could be using that hour to be a dentist instead   and an hour of dentistry is worth a lot more than an hour of mowing the lawn   this is called comparative advantage for trade it does n't matter how productive you are in absolute terms just that you can do one thing better than another

it 's probably important to understand what a credit score is    a credit score is your history of accruing debt and paying it back   it is supplemented by your age time at current residence time at previous residences time at your job etc a person with zero debt history can still have a decent score provided they are well established a little older and have a good job   the top scores are reserved for those that manage what creditors consider an appropriate amount of debt and are well established   in other words you 're good with money and likely have long term roots in the community   after all creditors do n't normally like being the first one you try out being young and having recently moved you are basically a flight risk   meaning someone who is more likely to just pick up and move when the debt becomes too much so you have a couple options   the first is to simply wait   keep going to work keep living where you are etc   as you establish yourself you become less of a risk    the second is to start incurring debt   personally i am not a fan of this one   some people do well by getting a small credit card using some portion of it each month and paying it off immediately   others do n't know how to control that very well and end up having a few months where they roll balances over etc which becomes a trap that costs them far more than before if i were in your position i 'd likely do one of two things   either buy the phone outright and sign up for a regular mobile plan or take the cheaper phone for a couple years

how would you respond to these cases limited card options if someone has a bad credit record the cards available may only be those with an annual fee   not everyone will have your credit record and thus access to the cards you have some annual fees may be waived in some cases thus someone may have a card with a fee that could be waived if enough transactions are done on the card   thus if someone gives enough business to the credit card company they will waive the fee on the point of the rewards if the card is from a specific retailer there could be a 10 discount for using that card and if the person purchases more than a couple thousand dollars worth from that store this is a savings of $ 200 from the retail prices compared to what would happen in other cases that more than offsets the annual fee   if someone likes to be a handyman and visits home depot often there may be programs to give rewards in this case credit cards can be useful for doing on line purchases flight reservations rental cars and a few other purchases that to with cash or debit can be difficult if not close to impossible some airline cards have a fee but presumably the perks provide a benefit that outweigh that fee over the year i 'm thinking of the citibank cards tied to american airlines first year free then an $ 85 fee

from my experience payments from banks and other financial entities such as loyalty programs generally are n't as large as payments that go the other direction from consumer to bank thus keeping a bank account open simply for some reward loyalty points may just be changing your behavior for the wrong reasons the more important scenario is whether or not you have any automated ach payments or whether your bank account is linked to other services perhaps the biggest tell that you 're in the clear is when those transactions start occurring from your credit union account   for example if you had a direct deposit to your bmo bank account make sure you see deposits start to appear in the credit union account if you 're making automatic withdraws to an online savings or brokerage account make sure those transfers are stopped and that you instead see them coming out of your new credit union account you should n't need to move the auto loan but you will need to make sure you can pay it from the new account   some financial advisors such as in this bankrate article titled lenders can tap bank account for mortgage even recommend keeping liabilities and assets at different locations if for whatever reason your financial situation turned bleak it would be more difficult for the bank to help itself to what 's in your checking account to avoid getting nickel and to death by payment processing fees i tend to pay insurance bills yearly or semi annually thus consider if there is anything that may be coming due in the next 6 months if so you might want to get your new account hooked up while you still have all the routing numbers and account numbers in your head it 's a pain to dig this stuff up while also rushing to not be late if all that is in order close the account

this is several questions wrapped together how can i see the company 's financial information how strong a claim does a stockholder or have to see the company 's financials what information do i need to know about the company financials before deciding to buy in i 'll start with the easier second question which is quasi implicit   stockholders typically have inspection rights   for example delaware general corporate law 220 gives stockholders the right to inspect and copy company financial information subject to certain restrictions check the laws and corporate code of your company 's state of incorporation to find the specific inspection right   if it is an llc or partnership then the operating agreement usually controls and there may be no inspection rights   if you have no corporate stock then of course you have no statutory inspection rights   my admittedly incomplete understanding is that generally have no inspection rights unless somehow contracted for   so if you vest as a corporate stockholder it 'll be your right to see the financials which may make even a small purchase valuable to you as a continuing employee with the right to see the financials   until then this is probably a courtesy and not their obligation the first question is not easy to answer except to say that it 's variable and highly personal for small companies   some people interpret it as or the implication being that the founders are either hiding something or that you need to examine really closely the mouth of their beautiful gift horse   other people may be much cooler about the question understanding that small companies are risky and you 're being   and in some smaller companies they may believe giving you the expenses could make office life awkward if you approach it professionally directly and briefly do not over explain yourself with the responsible accountant or hr person if any then i imagine it should not be a problem for them to give some information   conversely you may feel comfortable enough to review a high level summary sheet with a founder or to find some other way of reviewing the right information in any case i would keep the request vague simple and direct and see what information they show you   if your request is too specific then you risk pushing them to show information a which they refuse to do but a vague request would've prompted them to show you information b.   a too specific request might get you information x when a vague request could have garnered xyz   vague requests are also less aggressive and may raise fewer objections the third question is difficult to say   my personal understanding is some perspective of how venture capitalists look at the investment opportunity you did n't say how new this startup is or what series stage they are on so i 'll try to stay vague the actual financials are less relevant for startups than they are for other investments because the situation will definitely change   most venture capital firms like to look at the burn rate or amount of cash spent usually at a monthly rate   a high burn rate relative to of cash suggests the company is growing rapidly but may have a risk of i.e. failing before exit   burn rate can change drastically during the early life of the startup   of course burn rate needs the context of revenues and reserves and latest valuation is helpful as a benchmark but you may be able to calculate that from the restricted share offer made to you   high burn rate might not be bad if the company is booming along towards a successful exit you might also want to look at some sort of business plan or info sheet rather than financials alone   you want to gauge the size of the market most startups like to claim or markets so even a few percentage points of market share will hit revenue into the   you 'll also have to have a sense for the business plan and model and whether it 's a good investment or a ridiculous rehash it 's twitter for dogs meets for russian orthodox singles   in other words appraise it like an investor or vc and figure out whether it 's a prospect for decent return   typical things like competition customer acquisition costs manufacturing costs are relevant depending on the type of business activity of course i would n't ignore psychology note that economists and finance people do n't generally condone the following sort of emotional thinking   if you do n't invest in the company and it goes big you 'll kick yourself   if it goes really big other people will either assume you are rich or feel sad for you if you say you did n't get rich   if you invest but lose money it may not be so painful as not investing and losing out the opportunity   so if you consider the emotional aspect of personal finance it may be wise to invest at least a little and hedge against syndrome   that 's more like emotional advice than hard financial advice so much of the answer really depends on your particular circumstances   obviously you have other considerations like whether you can afford the investment which will be on you to decide   and of course the 83(b election is almost always recommended in these situations which seems to be what you are saying to convert ordinary income into capital gain   you may also need cash to pay any up front taxes on the 83(b equity depending on your circumstances

sure that if you are a contractor your rate must be considerably higher than as employee to make up for the benefits you give up as well as the fica taxes and your expense of maintaining an llc in california it costs at least $ plus legal advice accounting and various other fees etc on the other hand oftentimes the benefits as an employee are n't actually worth all that much when you are in high income brackets do pay attention to health insurance that may be a valuable benefit or it may have such high deductibles that you would be better off getting your own or paying the penalty for going uninsured instead of a 401(k you can set up an ira update or various other options and you can also replace all the other benefits if you decide that being an employee is the way to go stop here if you decide that being a contractor is a better deal for you then it is indeed a good idea to set up an llc you actually have three fundamental options work as an individual the legal term is sole proprietorship form a single member llc disregarded for income tax purposes or various other forms of incorporation of these i would argue that the single member llc combines the best of both worlds taxation is almost the same as for sole proprietorship the paperwork is minimal a lot less than any other form of incorporation but it provides many of the main benefits of incorporating there are several advantages first as others have already pointed out the irs and department of labor scrutinize contractor relationships carefully because of companies that abused this status on a massive scale uber and now defunct for instance but also fedex and other old economy companies one of the 20 criteria they use is whether you are incorporated or not basically it adds to your legal credibility as a contractor another benefit is legal protection if your client or somebody else sues you they can usually only sue the legal entity they are doing business with which is the llc your personal assets are safe from judgments that 's why donald trump is still a billionaire despite his famous four bankruptcies which i believe were corporate not personal update for clarification some people argue that you are still liable for your personal actions you should consult with a lawyer about the details but most business liabilities do n't arise from such acts another commenter suggested an policy a very good idea but not a substitute for an llc an llc does require some minimal paperwork you need to set up a separate bank account and you will need a professional accounting system not an excel spreadsheet but if you are a single member llc the paperwork is really not a huge deal you do n't need to file a separate federal tax return your income will be treated as if it was personal income the technical term is that the llc is disregarded for irs tax purposes california still does require a separate tax return but that 's only two pages or so and unless you make a large amount the tax is always $ 800 that small amount of paperwork is probably why your recruiter recommended the llc rather than other forms of incorporation so if you want to be a contractor then it sounds like your recruiter gave you good advice if you want to be an employee do n't do it a couple more points not directly related to the question but hopefully generally helpful if you are a contractor whether as sole proprietor or through an llc in most cities you need a business license not only that but you may even need a separate business license in every city you do business for instance in the city where your client is located even if you do n't live there business licenses can range from not needed to a few dollars to a few hundred dollars in some cities the business license fee may also depend on your income and finally one interesting drawback of a disregarded llc vs. sole proprietorship as a contractor has to do with the w-9 form and your social security number generally when you work for somebody and receive more than $ they need to ask you for your social security number using form w-9 that is always a bit of a concern because of identity theft the irs also recognizes a second number the ein employer identification number this is basically like an ssn for corporations you can also apply for one if you are a sole proprietor this is a huge benefit because you can use the ein in place of your ssn on the w-9 instant identity theft protection however if you have a disregarded llc the irs says that you must use your ssn you can not use your ein update the source for that information is the w-9 instructions it specifically only excludes llcs

one potentially useful option to avoid the crippling tuition fees in the states is to instead get your degree abroad numerous european countries have very low tuition fees even for international students tuition can be as low as a 1000 eur and housing is generally also very affordable there is of course the language barrier but many universities are oriented towards receiving international students providing relocation assistance and offering courses in english as a bonus most europeans speak excellent english and are generally quite happy to practice it so you should n't have any problems off campus either going to the uk is an option but likely considerably more expensive than colleges in mainland europe this article while written for a nigerian audience lists some of the most attractive options for the international student the quality of the education is also generally very high for these colleges as an example belgium one of the cheapest options in the list has two universities ranked in the top 100 and many other german french dutch or universities figure in that list

my recommendation is simple   rent the fact that you have to ask the question is a clear sign that you have no business buying a home that 's not to say that it 's a bad question to ask though far more important then rather it 's wise for you to buy a home is the more important question of are you emotionally ready for the responsibility and of a home   at best you are tying your self to the same number of rooms same location and same set of circumstances for the next 5 7 years in that time it will be very unlikely that you will be able to sell the house for a profit get your minor equity back or even get a second loan for any reason   you mentioned getting married soon that means the possibility of more children divorce and who knows what else   you are in an emotionally and financially time in your life now is not the right time to buy anything large instead rent and focus on improving your credit rating in 5 years time you will have a much better credit rating get much better rates and fees and have a much better handle on where you want to be with your home family situation   buying a house is not something you do on a weekend for most people it 's the culmination of years of work searching researching and preparation   often times people that buy before they are ready will end up in foreclosure and generally have a crappy next 15 years as they try to work themselves out of the issue

i speak as a person without kids but i 'll give this a shot anyway using my memory of the perspective i had when i was a kid   my advice is if the kids are young enough to not care much do n't be afraid of the thrift store   my parents got a bunch of clothes from the thrift store as i was growing up around elementary school age and i did n't care at all   when i got to be older middle school age shopping at target and k mart did n't seem bad either   by the time the kids are old enough to really care beyond they are probably old enough to get their own part time jobs and get their own clothing i however am probably naive as i still care little for such things and judging from popular culture most care about them a great deal

there seems to be a gap in the internal logic of this story   gt some enterprising person maybe the merchant who runs the trading post comes up with the idea to just issue one note for all the farms in town he calls a meeting with all the farmers and proposes to have the town priest keep a book of certificates and so on and the farmers will get notes just like everyone else in exchange for the crops they contribute to the pool and the merchant will keep a cut of the crops with which to hire some accountants and farm to estimate the total crop yields across town and so on   gap   gt everyone agrees or at least enough farmers agree to kind of force the other ones to get on board if they want to participate meaningfully in the town economy and we now have something like a central bank issuing something like fiat currency that is currency whose value is decided by some central authority as opposed to the kind of straight up exchange certificates that can be traded for an actual apple from the issuer for example   we went from a system where the underlying product apples could actually be obtained to a system in which the underlying product apparently can not be obtained leaving only derivative if that markets of people swapping notes for other products and services   do you mean to say the enterprising person simply ended the ability to get apples and switched cold turkey to a new system in which the underlying product either does not exist or is not redeemable

not sure what you mean by missing credit card debt can be paid back in full when you get the bill or you can take a loan and pay in installments if you do the latter and pay back at least the minimum required amount on time you are not missing your payment technically you are taking a small but expensive loan and if you pay that loan back according to the terms and conditions that apply to your credit card this is reported to the credit bureau and improves your credit if you are really missing your payment paying late more than a few days less than minimum or nothing at all this wo n't help to improve your credit a first time offender wo n't always be reported to the credit bureau but if he is it wo n't be a positive report

this is not a normal occurrence and you have every right to be annoyed but the technical way it usually happens goes like this what can happen is when the merchant incorrectly completes the transaction without referencing the pre authorization transaction the bank effectively does n't know this is the same transaction so they process it the same way they process any other purchase and it has no effect on the pre authorization and related held pending transaction as far as the bank knows you purchased a second set of blinds in the store for $ 200 and are still waiting on the first order to come in they have no idea the store screwed up the reason this is possible is the purpose of the pre in the first place is that it is a contractual agreement between the bank credit card and the merchant that the funds are available will be available except under rare special circumstances and thus they can go ahead and process the order this lets the merchant be secure in the knowledge that they can collect their payment but you are n't paying interest or monthly payments on something you have n't even gotten yet this system works reasonably well for everyone right up until someone screws up and fails to properly release a hold makes a second transaction instead of properly referencing the first one or the bank screws up their system and fails to correctly match referenced pre authorization codes to purchases the problem is that this should not be a normal occurrence and the people you are speaking with to try to sort out the issue often do not have the authority or knowledge necessary to properly fix the issue or its such a hassle for them that they hope you just go away and time fixes the issue on its own the only sure fire solution to this is make sure you have so much extra credit line that this does n't effect you and you can safely let it time out on its own or stop doing business with this combination of merchant payment that creates the problem back when my credit limits were being pushed i would never pay at gas pumps because their hold polices were so weird and unpredictable and i would only pre pay inside or with cash to avoid the holds

the best way to use your new credit card to establish credit history is to use it for small medium purchases and pay it off in full each month there is no reward for using it more than once a month if you are getting some sort of rewards for using the credit card to pay your health insurance air miles points etc then you could go ahead and use it your credit score will take a temporary hit for high utilization you can actually avoid this by making a partial payment before the end of the billing cycle so that your utilization is never reported as near 100

the biggest risk you have when a country defaults on its currency is a major devaluation of the currency since the euro is a fiat currency like almost all developed nations its promise comes from the expectation that its union and system will endure the euro is a basket of countries and as such could probably handle bailing out countries or possibly letting some default on their sovereign debt without killing the euro itself a similar reality happens in the united states with some level of with state and municipal debt being considered riskier than federal debt it is n't uncommon for cities to default the biggest reason the euro will probably lose a lot of value initially is if any nation defaults there is n't a track record as to how the eu member body will respond will some countries attempt to break out of the eu if the member countries then the euro collapses rendering any and all euro notes useless it is that political stability that the value of the euro if you are seriously concerned about the risk of a falling euro and its long term stability then you 'd do best buying a hedge currency or a basket of hedge currencies to diversify risk many will recommend you buy gold or other precious metals but i think the idea is silly at best it is not only hard to buy precious metals at a fair value it is even harder to sell them at a fair value whatever currency you hold needs to be able to be used in transactions with ease does n't do you any good having $ 20 k in gold coins and no one willing to buy them as the seller at the store will usually want currency and not gold coins if you want to go the easy route you can follow the same line of reasoning central banks do buy usd and hold it it is probably the world 's safest currency to hold over a long period of time current us policy is inflationary so that wo n't help you gain value but that depends on how the eu responds to a sovereign debt crisis if one matures

to quote a comedian   you do n't have to be a helicopter pilot or engineer to know there is a problem when the engine is on fire   there is no need to appeal to authority   we can very often get so caught up in the myriad details of our subject matter that we fail to step back and see the situation from another point of view   we then become entrenched in our ideology and overly defensive when others bring criticisms   you have become overly entrenched in your republican ideology   your economic theories have left you lacking an understanding of value beyond what can be translated into financial gain   actors spend their lives learning to replicate life   they gain a better understanding of suffering and joy the intangibles in the economic field   thus that is where their criticisms often come from   you can expect each person to bring criticisms and insights from their field   my field contains logic critical thinking and taking things a literally and as possible because computers only do exactly what you tell them   so you will see that my criticisms are often about improper logic or false conclusions based on or interactions that do n't really exist   how did i myself   because i enjoyed comedy   that does n't make sense at all   as for going full retard a quote from a comedy i might add your argument is flying off the handle based off assumptions that have little relation to reality   where was my ass during   working offsite at a client 's far from voting machines   before then i was to media just as most people were at that time   i do n't see what you obviously in trump   i see him as a hypocritical bully that talks big but still represents money   he has lost more money than most people have earned in their lifetime of hard work yet he is touted as a great businessman   he attacks those who criticize him   hillary is a two faced back stabbing snake who will say anything to get the audience in her favor and is n't above lying to get her way   unfortunately she is than trump   if i had voted i would have voted for trump just because his methods are much more obvious   that does n't mean his methods are better   just because you have become so entrenched in trump 's support structure that you fail to see his failings does n't mean they do n't exist   just because liberals become so entrenched in hating trump that they fail to see his good side does n't mean it does n't exist either   but you are n't looking at both sides of the road   you are n't even trying to   instead you are telling me how my methods are bad because they are n't the same as yours my opinions are bad because they do n't agree with yours and i am going full retard because you disagree   you are yet again not verifying a damned thing and are appealing to authority the whole way   you are n't thinking for yourself   you are being led like a sheep by your preferred media   every time i have pointed out this shortcoming you have moved passed it without addressing it   but verification is the key to solid decision making   how can i possibly accept your view when you refuse to verify your information before you not only agree with it but argue it to others   that 's the action of an extremist or true believer not someone trying to make sure they know the truth   where is your logic and critical thinking   bring it back into the game   stop arguing with your ego and look for your own inconsistencies before you try to drag issues you see with me into the light   i have pointed out time and again how my methods are self consistent and i 've even admitted when i did n't have enough information   you have never self analyzed in the course of this discussion   by reasoning i feel you may rarely if ever self analyze   clean up your logic before you try to clean up mine please

normally i 'd say that because of the magic of compound interest balances of high rate cards shoot up rapidly so pay off the high rate cards one by one until they 're all zero in this case though 23 20 19 are close enough that i 'd pay off the card with the highest balance then 2nd highest then 3rd and leave the card for last note that sooner than you think other card companies will send you low rate balance transfer   take one asap and pay it down as much as possible so that when the low introductory rate is over the balance on your now high rate card is low bottom line balances on high interest rate card accumulate incredibly quickly so kill them first one at a time

nobel laureate economist paul krugman wrote a piece many ago about economic expansion and money supply   as an illustration of how money supply affects the economy he used the example of a baby sitting co op   while simplistic it provides an easy to grasp notion of how printing money and restricting it e.g. by pegging the currency to gold reserves can affect the economy here is an excerpt from his webpage with the decline of the traditional extended family in which relatives were available to take care of children at need many parents in the united states have sought alternative arrangements a popular scheme is the baby sitting coop in which a group of parents agree to help each other out on a reciprocal basis with each parent serving both as baby sitter and baby any such coop requires rules that ensure that all members do their fair share one natural answer at least to people accustomed to a market economy is to use some kind of token or marker system parents earn tokens by babysitting then in turn hand over these tokens when their own children are minded by others for example a recently formed coop in western massachusetts uses sticks each representing one hour of babysitting when a new parent enters the coop he or she receives an initial allocation of ten sticks   this system is self regulating in the sense that it automatically ensures that over any length of time a parent will put in more or less the same amount of time that he or she receives it turns out however that establishing such a token system is not enough to make a coop work properly it is also necessary to get the number of tokens per member more or less right to see why suppose that there were very few tokens in circulation parents will want on average to hold some reserve of tokens enough to deal with the possibility that they may want to go out a few times before they have a chance to babysit themselves and earn more tokens any individual parent can of course try to accumulate more tokens by babysitting more and going out less but what happens if almost everyone is trying to accumulate tokens as they will be if there are very few in circulation one parent 's decision to go out is another 's opportunity to babysit so if everyone in the coop is trying to add to his or her reserve of tokens there will be very few opportunities to babysit this in turn will make people even more reluctant to go out and use up their precious token reserves and the level of activity in the coop may decline to a low level   the solution to this problem is of course simply to issue more sticks but not too many because an excess of sticks can pose an equally severe problem suppose that almost everyone in the coop has more sticks than they need then they will be eager to go out but reluctant to babysit it will therefore become hard to find and since opportunities to use sticks will become rare people will become even less willing to spend time and effort earning them too many tokens in circulation then can be just as destructive as too few paul krugman 1997 accessed webpage 2010

credit scores are not such a big deal in canada as they are in the us and even some european countries   one reason for this the social insurance number sin number is n't used for so many purposes like the social security number ssn in the us   the sin number is n't even required to get credit but with some exceptions it is needed to open an interest bearing savings account so that the interest income can be reported   you can refuse to provide the sin number to most private companies canada also has one of the highest per capita immigration rates of any large country so new are expected and services are geared up for them   most of the banks offer special deals for new canadians   you should get a credit card even if just a secured credit card through them with one of these offers to start a credit file anyway but there 's no need to actually use it much   auto paying a utility bill through the card and paying it off in full each month is one way to keep it active   no need to ever pay any interest most major apartment rental firms will expect a good proportion of their renters to be new to canada so should have procedures in place to deal with it such as a higher deposit   you should not give them your sin for a credit check even when you 're more established same for utilities they can just charge a higher deposit if they ca n't credit check you   for private landlords everything is negotiable but see the laws link at the end of this answer you will later need a credit rating for a mortgage on a house if not paying cash so it 's worth getting that one token credit card   useful for car rental also here 's a fairly complete summary of the laws on renting in canada which includes the maximum deposits that can be asked for and notice periods

a derivative in finance is simply any asset whose value is based on the value of another asset or based on the value of a group of assets a derivative contract is a type of contract usually a standardized contract with specific payout instruction based on the price changes of a different asset the basic idea is that it becomes easier to make a claim to an asset or property and profit from this claim without needing to physically transfer it or even the title to said asset and use much less capital to do so reduce risk they become problematic when multiple people may have claims to the real asset or when the value of the derivatives changes very quickly or are hard to calculate there are also liquidity problems the further you get from the real asset this is not a problem for all kinds of derivatives contracts and you must recognize that derivatives are used colloquially in a way that has nothing to do with reality to cause fear in people investors that are not financially savvy many derivatives also have dubious or no economic purposes such that regulators do n't allow them to be traded since they ca n't see how it is different from gambling this is seen in financial markets that are less liberalized or cultures with backgrounds typically the trick is to convince regulators that the derivative or financial product helps with reducing risk and hedging and it will get approved i 've mentioned some terminology but this depends specifically on what kind of derivatives contract you become interested in swaps credit default swaps futures options options on futures leveraged exchange traded funds inverse leveraged exchange traded funds warrants and more all have their own terminology how to trade them in a simulation it all depends on which financial product you really become interested in

sprint has a great brand but needs cash to roll out their lte network faster   wimax was an unfortunate requirement of their spectrum allocation wherein if they did not use it they lost it so wimax should really never have existed for sprint but they had to do it   so i think based on what softbank has done in other markets this is a good thing it looks like at the very least it 'll put another $ 3 billion directly into the us lte roll which means a faster than previously announced rollout which in terms of markets was pretty good despite the overall lacking of availability   i hope new sprint pulls it together and gives verizon amp at&amp;t a run for their money they were nt going to last too long otherwise

you 're right to keep the oldest one   that 's an asset to your credit rating since you 're already responsible with your credit a dip in your credit rating does n't really matter unless you 're looking for another loan like a mortgage i personally like the cash back rewards because they 're the most flexible so you have a good thing going with that card do those reward cards give you perks on all of your purchases   if they do then look carefully to see if you can do noticeably better with another card   if not it may not really be worth it regarding cancelling one of the cards i would n't and here 's why   your cards can get compromised and sometimes more than one gets compromised at the same time   i was glad that i had three cards because two of them got hit the same day   hence having three cards hit on the same day is possible and you 'll be glad that you have the fourth

the price earnings ratio is calculated as the market value per share divided by the earnings per share over the past 12 months in your example you state that the company earned $ 0.35 over the past quarter that is insufficient to calculate the price earnings ratio and probably why the pe is just given as 20 so if you have the formula correctly the calculation given the numbers in your example would be 0.35 4 20 = $ as to i 'm not sure your pe is correct according to yahoo the pe for is at the time of writing not using the formula above this would lead to 2.3 4 = $ that stock has a 52-week high of $ so $ is not unrealistic i 'm more than a little dubious of the validity of that formula however and urge you not to base your investing decisions on it

this is the infographic from the fidelity it what 's wrong with the financial industry and the sad state of that we are in    to be clear fidelity treats the 401(k correctly although the assumption that the withdrawals are all at a marginal 28 is a poor one the roth side they assume the $ 5000 goes in at a zero tax rate this is nonsense as ca n't deposit $ 5000 she has to pay tax first no she 'd deposit $ 3600 and would have the identical $ at withdrawal time   and this is pure nonsense   let âs look at the numbers another way tom takes the $ 1,400 he saved    in taxes from his $ 5,000 pretax contributions and invests that money    in a taxable brokerage account that could boost his total at age 75    to $ the $ 1400 saved is in his 401(k already there 's no extra $ 1400 $ 5000 went in pretax   let me go one more step and explain what i think joe meant in his comment below tax table first    at retirement say a couple has exactly $ of income with the $ 20 k in standard deduction and exemptions they are right at the top of the 25 bracket   and have a federal tax bill of $ overall an effective rate of 17   of course this is a blend from and i maintain that if some money could have gone in post tax while in the brackets that would be great but in the end if it all off at 25 and comes out at an effective 17 that 's not too bad   the article is incorrect misleading and any of us that have any respect for numbers and the fact that the article claim that 87 found this helpful just makes me sad   i 've said it elsewhere and will repeat there are not just two points in time the ability to convert traditional 401(k to roth 401(k and if in iras not just convert but also recharacterize opens up other possibilities it 's worth a bit of attention and ongoing paperwork to minimize your lifetime tax bill time makes no difference there is no crossover point as with other financial decisions for this illustration the results are identical regardless of time   by the way in today 's dollars it would take $ 4 m pretax to produce an annual withdrawal of $ this number is about top 2 3 the need not worry about saving their way to a higher tax bracket

the 5 to 6.5 loan rates are a bit high you 'll probably want to pay those off first and make it one of your priorities as soon as you have a 6-month savings fund this should probably take precedence over savings for retirement unless you 're giving up a 401(k match pay extra on the highest interest loan until it 's all paid off then switch to the next one down and accelerate the payoff as much as you can if you 're looking at a loan at 6 and a payoff date in 8 years or so 2020 am extra dollar paid now will save you not a bad return in general and an excellent return for something that 's zero risk the other loans at 2 3 are different an extra dollar paid now on a 2 loan will save you $ 0.17 over 8 years that 's a pretty mediocre return if you have a good stable job and good job prospects and a decent family support network and few commitments like children and mortgages and a low cost of living generally the things that help you have a high tolerance for risk then you should consider investing your money in the stock market instead of paying off these loans any earlier than you need to broad index funds and the like not individual stocks

you are smart to read books to better inform yourself of the investment process   i recommend reading some of the passive investment classics before focusing on active investment books if you still feel like you can generate after tax after expenses alpha returns in excess of the market returns take a shot at some active investing   if you actively invest i recommend the core satellite approach invest most of your money in a well diversified basket of stocks via index funds and actively manage a small portion of your account   carefully track the expenses and returns of the active portion of your account and see if you are one of the lucky few that can generate excess returns to truly understand a text like the intelligent investor you need to understand finance and accounting   for example the price to earnings ratio is the equity value of an enterprise total shares outstanding times price per share divided by the earnings of the business   at a high level earnings are just revenue less cogs less operating expenses less taxes and interest   earnings depend on a company 's revenue recognition inventory accounting methods fifo lifo purchase price allocations from acquisitions etc   if you do n't have a business degree business background i do n't think books are going to provide you with the requisite knowledge unless you have the discipline to read textbooks   i learned these concepts by completing the chartered financial analyst program

choosing between an emergency fund and investing aside there is no reason to use a systematic investment plan when you have a lump sum ready to invest here are the three possible futures and the effects on each strategy obviously if you are investing in the market you expect it to go up over time so using an sip will work against you in that case   if the market does go down you 'd be better off but historically the market has gone up more than it 's gone down so there 's no practical reason to keep money in your pockets   you can always rebalance change investments do whatever after you 've invested so at worst you may have some transaction fees but that should n't be a huge issue

there has been an abundance of articles in recent years which make it fairly clear that many participants in the social security especially those who have started contributing recently and going forward from will experience negative rates of return in other words they will put in more than they will get out some examples of such articles time magazine but it is now official social security is a lousy investment for the    average worker people retiring today will be among the first    generation of workers to pay more in social security taxes than they    receive in benefits over the course of their lives according to a new    analysis by the associated press that ap piece referenced by time people retiring today are part of the first generation of workers who    have paid more in social security taxes during their careers than they    will receive in benefits after they retire it 's a historic shift that    will only get worse for future retirees according to an analysis by    the associated press a piece which appeared in includes a helpful graphic summary   10 myths about social security myth 4 social security is a good deal for today âs if    there were no reduction in benefits or increase in taxes an    impossibility given social security âs looming financing    shortfalls social security is an extremely bad investment for most    young workers in fact according to a study by the nonpartisan tax    foundation most young workers will actually receive a negative return    on their social security they will get less in benefits than    they paid in taxes some studies indicate that a year old    two earner couple with average income will lose as much as $    that actual loss does not even consider the opportunity cost what    workers might have earned if they had been able to invest their taxes    in real assets that yield a positive return in fact a study by    financial analyst william demonstrates that if a 25-year old    worker were able to privately invest the money he or she currently    pays in social security taxes the worker would receive retirement    benefits three to six times higher than under social security has that answered your question

changing my answer based on clarification in comments it appears that some of the securities you mentioned including are traded on what is colloquially known as the grey market grey sheets and also known as the gray market is another category of otc stocks that is completely separate from pink sheets and the   from investopedia the grey market is an over the counter market where dealers may execute orders for preferred customers as well as provide support for a new issue before it is actually issued this activity allows underwriters and the issuer to determine demand and price the securities accordingly before the ipo   some additional information on this type of stocks source unlike other financial markets no recent bid or ask quotes are available because no market makers share data or quote such stocks there is no quoting system available to record and settle trades all grey sheet trading is moderated by a broker and done between individuals at a price they agree on the only documentation that can be publicly found regarding the trades is when the last trade took place no sec registration and little sec regulation regulation of grey sheet stocks takes place mainly on a state level unlike pink sheets these stocks have no sec registration to possess a stock symbol or to possess shares or trade shares of that stock such penny stocks similar to pink sheets are not required to file sec securities and exchange commission financial and business reports these stocks may not be solicited or advertised to the public unless a certain number of shares are qualified to be traded publicly under 504 of regulation d. extremely illiquid gray sheet trading is infrequent and for good reason difficult to trade not advertised difficult to follow the price the least regulation possible hard to find any information on the stock very small market cap little history and most such stocks do not yet offer public shares the lack of information bids history financial reports alone causes most investors to be very skeptical of gray sheets and avoid them altogether   gray sheets are commonly associated with initial public offering ipo stocks or start up companies or spin off companies even though not all are ipo 's start ups or spin offs grey sheets is also home to delisted stocks from other markets some stocks on this financial market were once traded on the nasdaq or the pink sheets but ran into serious misfortune usually financial and thus failed to meet the minimum requirements of the registered sec filings and/or stock exchange regulations for a financial market such stocks were delisted or removed and may begin trading on the grey sheets   so to answer your question i think the cause of the wild swings is that    great question btw

cash price is $ 22,500 financed it 's the same thing 0 interest but you pay a $ 1500 fee = 6.6 basically the apr for your loan is 1.1 per year but you are paying it all upfront opportunity cost if you take the $ 22,500 you plan to pay for the car and invested it could you earn more than the $ 1500 interest on the car loan according to google as of today you can get 1 year cd 1.25 so yes it 's likely that interest rates will be going up in medium term so you can potentially earn even more   insurance cost if you finance you 'll have to get comprehensive insurance which could be costly however if you are planning to get it anyway it 's a brand new car after all that 's a wash which brings me to my main point why do you have $ 90k in a savings account even if you are planning to buy a house you should have that money invested in liquid assets earning you interest   conclusion take the cheap money while it 's available you never know when interest rates will go up again

so couple of things firstly every international etf includes risk disclosure language in the prospectus covering both market disruption events as well as geopolitical risk so the sponsor would be pretty well insulated from direct liability for anything if the russian market were truly shut down there are true up mechanisms in place but in the scenario you 're describing the market is still open it 's just only a few participants can trade in it   first thing to do is shut down that is allow no new money to come into the fund this at least prevents your problem from getting bigger    second you 're going to switch all redemptions to in kind only itself ca n't trade in the underlying so they 're kind of here an etf sponsor ca n't really refuse your redemption request can delay but only for a short time but they can control the form in which they respond to it     what theoretically should happen here is an ap not subject to sanctions will step in and handle redemptions   issue is they 'll probably charge for this so you should expect the fund to start trading at a discount to nav you as an investor sell to them cheaply they submit a redemption request then sell the stocks locally someone else has pointed that market makers will start stat the fund using correlated substitute instruments which totally will help keep things in line but my guess is that you 'd still see the name trading away from nav regardless driver of this will be the amount of money desperate to get out if investors are content to wait the sanctions out who knows

ok so by doubling down you mean when i said that ms as well as 3/4 of the country do n't consider sexual orientation a protected class ok then apparently i am not the only one who has their mind made up    you entire argument is based on it being a protected class it is but only in a few states ms is not one of them i agree that they should not think like that and their business should hurt because they are but that does not mean another business can do the same thing because you agree with them   it is ok to have a difference of opinion but you seem to think that a company providing a service based on their bias is ok for some and not for others how can you not see the similar aspects of the two    i agree with you that ms is wrong in this case and i also agree that the nazi are wrong we are on the same side but i do n't think that paypal should get a free pass when it aligns with my thinking they are not offering service based on an ideal the businesses in ms were as well so i think they are both wrong and should be blasted in public either you can show biased when dealing with customers or you ca n't it is that simple    you are agreeing with a company choosing to do business with whom they want to but then you are doubling down on having another business doing the same thing because you think that sexual orientation is a protected class everywhere   if it was we would not be having this discussion but here we are you are trying to have it both ways i do n't know how else to explain it

put options are contracts to sell you pay me a fee for the right to put the stock or other underlying security in my hands if you want to that happens on a specific date the strike date and a specified price the strike price you can decide not to exercise that right but i must follow through and let you sell it to me if you want to put options can be used by the purchaser to cap losses for example you purchase a put option for ge from me on october 19th you can make me let you sell your ge stock to me for $ a share if the price for ge has fallen to $ that would be a good idea if its now at $ 15.00 a share you will probably keep the ge or sell it at the current market price call options are contracts to buy the same idea only in the other direction you pay me a fee for the right to call the stock away from me calls also have a strike date and strike price like a put you can choose not to exercises it you can choose to buy the stock from me on the strike date for the strike price but i have to let you buy it from me if you want to   for example you purchase a call option for ge 16.00 option from me on october 19th you can buy my ge stock from me for $ 16.00 a share if the current price is $ you should make me let you buy if from me for $ 16.00 if its less than $ 16.00 you could by it at the current market price for less commonly options are for a block of 100 shares of the underlying security note this is a general description options can be very complicated the fee you pay for the option and the transaction fees associated with the shares affects whether or not exercising is financially beneficial options can be very risky you can loose all your money as there is no innate value in the option only how it relates to the underlying security before your brokerage will let you trade there are disclosures you must read and affirm that you understand the risk

short term the game is supply demand and how the various participants react to it at various prices on longer term prices start to better reflect the fundamentals within something like week to some month or two if there has not been any unique value affecting news then interest options market swing traders and such play bigger part with intraday the effects of available liquidity become very pronounced the market makers have algos that try to guess what type of client they have and they prefer to give high price to large buyer and low price to small buyer as intraday trader has spreads and commissions big part of their expenses and leverage magnifies those instead of being able to take advantage of the lower prices they prefer to stop out after small move against them in practise this means that when they buy low that low will soon be the midpoint of the day and high etc if they are still holding on buy and sell are similar to long call or long put options position and options are like insurance they cost you also the longer the position is held the more likely it is to end up with someone with ability to test your margin if you 're highly leveraged and constantly making your wins from the same source   risk management is also issue the leveraged pros trade through a company not sure if they 're able to open another such company and still open accounts after the inevitable

well i answered a very similar question credit card payment date where i showed that for a normal cycle the average charge is n't due for 40 days the range is 35 55 so if you want to feel good about the float just charge everything the day after the cycle closes and nothing else the rest of the month why is this so interesting it 's no trick and no secret   by the way this is n't likely to be of any use when you 're buying gas groceries or normal purchases but i suppose if you have a large purchase say a big tv $ 3000 this will buy you extra time to pay it would be of me to not clearly state that anyone who needs to take advantage of this trick is the same person who probably should n't use credit cards at all those who use cards are best served by charging what they can afford to pay at that moment and not base today 's charges on what paychecks will come in by the due date of the credit card bill

from hmrc note that the rule is when a person becomes entitled to payment of earnings this is not necessarily the same as the date on which an employee acquires a right to be paid for example an employee 's terms of service may provide for the employee to receive a bonus for the year to 31 december 2004 payable on 30 june 2005 if the employee is still in the service of the employer on 31 december 2004 if the condition is satisfied the employee becomes entitled to a payment on 31 december 2004 but is only entitled to payment of it on 30 june 2005 so paye applies to it on 30 june 2005 and it is for the date that matters is the date the employee is entitled to be paid the bonus   but why are you worried about paying tax that is your employer 's responsibility and they will do it for you ask you firm 's finance department also for further clarification hmrc are not an organization to mess with they will tie up your life in knots

it may not be an ideal option but you could use an hsa as a tax sheltered investment vehicle    the contribution limit is only $ for an individual and $ for a family in 2015 plus $ 1 k if you 're 55 + so you 're only making up a small portion of the 401(k limit   also you and a family member to get the higher contribution limit have to be covered by a qualifying high deductible health insurance plan hdhp to be eligible to make hsa contributions   as such it may not be the best option if you regularly incur significant medical expenses   and in many cases the investment fees in an hsa are higher than you would find in a 401(k or ira the investment choices can be limited so it is important to research the options before selecting a provider all that being said the contributions and growth are both tax deferred tax free if you use it for healthcare then at age 65 or medicare eligibility you can withdraw the funds without penalty and pay only income tax even if they are not used toward healthcare expenses

the total limit book is a composite of all the orders on all of the exchanges while it 's uncommon for a limit order posted beyond the nbbo to fill outside of the nbbo it does occur for example the best ask may be on exchange x but for some reason the smart order routing algorithm may select exchange y if it judges the net trade to be less costly etc and hfts will immediately arbitrage the order between two exchanges or the best order on exchange x disappears causing the order to fill above the nbbo the system is n't perfect because there are multiple exchanges but that eventuality is extremely rare with equities since nearly every exchange will have orders posted at the nbbo because exchange equity fee and rebate schedules are extremely competitive nearly identical   it is however more common with options since less exchanges as a percentage of the total will have orders posted at the nbbo because of very wide exchange rebate and fee schedules how a single exchange handles a new order that crosses an existing limit order is already addressed here how do exchanges match limit orders

without providing direct investment advice i can tell you that bond most assuredly are not recession proof   all investments have risk and each recession will impact asset classes slightly differently before getting started bonds are loans   you are loaning money   do n't ever think of them as anything but that bonds loans have two chief risks default risk and inflation risk    default risk is the most obvious risk this is when the person to whom you are loaning does not pay back   in a recession this can easily happen if the debtor is a company and the company goes bankrupt in the environment inflation risk is a more subtle risk and occurs when the fixed interest rate on your loan yields less than the inflation rate   this causes the real value of your investment to depreciate over time    the second risk is most pronounced when the bonds that you own are government bonds and the recession causes the government to be unable to pay back its debts   in these circumstances the government may print more money to pay back its creditors generating inflation

the optimal down payment is 0 if your interest rate is also 0 as the interest rate increases so does the likelihood of the better option being to pay for the car outright note that this is probably a binary choice in other words depending on the rate you will pay you should either put 0 down or 100 down the interesting question is what formula should you use to determine which way to go obviously if you can invest at a higher return than the rate you pay on the car you would still want to put 0 down the same goes for inflation and you can add these two numbers together for example if you estimate 2 inflation plus 1 guaranteed investment then as long as the rate on your car is less than 3 you would want to minimize the amount you put down the key here is you must actually invest it other possible reasons to minimize the down payment would be if you have other loans with higher then obviously use that money to pay down those loans before the car loan all that being said some dealers will give you cash back if you pay for the car outright if you have this option do the math and see where it lands most likely taking the cash back is going to be more attractive so you do n't even have to hedge inflation at all tip make sure to negotiate the price of the car before you tell them how you are going to pay for it and during this process you can hint that you 'll pay cash for it

the reason i do n't want to get into here it is because internet debates over these things turn into an absolute shit show instantly    in a nutshell the sane parts of argument comes down to very difficult to prove assumptions about how perfectly fiat currency can will be implemented   the sane case for gold is that it is very difficult to get into the kind of money printing that places like zimbabwe and argentina have got into when your currency is based on something with a finite and slow growing supply it 's hard to print more gold    the sane case for fiat currency is that it is ridiculous to the entire economy by tying it to one arbitrary commodity with a fluctuating value and supply that does not correlate well with overall economic output    a perfectly implemented fiat currency printed and by a perfectly perfectly competent and perfectly benevolent central bank let 's call it god money is the ideal that 's pretty much axiomatic and even sane gold bugs would tend to allow the above so far as it goes including all stipulations    in fact someone inclined to believe in divine intervention might make a case that gold is precisely that a hard to forge easy to detect easy to handle metal placed on earth by god in quantities just right to serve as currency   the problem is that a really bad fiat currency is absolutely terrible leads to nightmare scenarios people starving on one side of a fence while tons of crops are being burned on the other side because of price discrepancies stuff like that again even sane keynesians will allow as much    the problem is that the crazies and single issue come out of the woodwork when you start getting into this stuff and tend to dominate the conversation if conversation is a fair word to use in a sense the sane spectrum of debate boils down to an almost ideological divide    whether you believe that a sort of permanent central bank currency issuer is possible plausible   because if it is achievable it is almost certainly better than just tying the whole economy to the price of a single commodity if it is not achievable then it is almost certainly better to let the markets adjust and correct however than to tie the whole economy to the whims and wishes of incompetent and politically motivated money printers i hope that makes sense and that it is a fair representation of the conundrum   the problem with making an argument is that you 've got a of technical and sometimes fairly complicated nitty gritty plus a certain amount of starting assumption worldview ideological stuff all together and almost all of it is very hard impossible to prove via scientific testing    both the technical and historical stuff have strong conflicting indicators and it 's obviously not possible to say set up two identical societies and let them run for a thousand years controlling for everything but monetary policy and see what happens    macro economics is a very imperfect science it has certainly given the world some very useful and valuable insights and axioms but the testing methods are extremely indirect and heavily subject to interpretation you really have only the historical record to draw on and it is almost impossible to find examples that control for whatever variable is in question    macro ideally tries really hard to be science but you 're always kind of picking from bad examples when testing a hypothesis trying to line up vaguely similar historical periods to isolate for some common factor it 's kind of like or theoretical physics except with much smaller and data sets ten thousand years from now it will be much easier to look at the historical data and isolate for particular variables over multiple hundred year spans across a variety of cultural political and socio economic backgrounds    for now the peanut gallery is full of questions that the experts can not answer and the record is full of exceptions to every rule and a lot of it frankly boils down to worldview and ideology with a healthy of i 'm smarter than you to finish the sauce    since i personally prefer technical questions to politics i will leave it to others to formulate and debate those things

why would his prediction be the guy predicted the housing bubble because he saw middle managers in every place of business being replaced by software they were unable to find a new similar paying job and thus lost their houses now he sees 500,000 full time job loses and 800,000 part time job gains in one financial quarter he sees 200,000 jobs created last month in july with 140,000 of those jobs being low wage service jobs the guy is not a he is a realist you investors who see the economy with rose colored glasses are riding high on maximized profits as a result of low wage earning skeleton operation crews you 'll be in for a rude to find fewer customers able to buy the products and services being offered

i 'm going to go with ridiculous notion   the vast majority of businesses are legitimate run by honest people trying to earn a living for themselves and their employees   these days almost all of them accept credit cards   crooked businesses are a very small minority when a bad business over charges you you dispute the charge and you get your money back   but that 's not all that happens   the bad merchant pays penalties for this and if it happens more than a couple of times the merchant loses their merchant account with their bank which means that they lose their ability to accept credit card payments anymore   a crooked business is not able to rob people via credit card for very long at all a would certainly not be able to include every legitimate business   and a blacklist would never be able to be kept up to date as bad businesses come and go continuously as soon as a business was added to the blacklist they would lose their merchant account and would no longer need to be on the list what you are describing is very rare   my brother once had a bad experience with a tech support company where they were repeatedly charging him for a service they never performed   but a credit card chargeback took care of it   if that company made a habit of that i 'm sure that they got in trouble with their bank instead the most common credit card fraud happens when crooks use your credit card at perfectly legitimate businesses   but your blacklist would n't help you with that at all

so i was working at my dad 's store yesterday so he can take a day off and i do n't have that much experience i occasionally fill in whenever he needs to take a day off for something so yesterday i thought it was my lucky day cause i had two groups of people come in and buy nearly 500 $ worth of items each but with credit cards now once again i do n't have that much experience with this type of work i just sold them the stuff but the procedure was the same as with any other group of people buying multiple items show them multiple stuff bargain and eventually they buy the stuff i entered the price on the machine they put in the card they put in the pin they signed the receipt and it was the end of that turns out both groups used stolen cards so i get a call from my brother today saying both cards were stolen and we might not get the money for the stuff but i pretty much followed the procedure i was told to its just i do n't know why we would n't get the money back

first the stock does represent a share of ownership and if you have a different interpretation i 'd like to see proof of that secondly when the ipo or secondary offering happened that put those shares into the market int he first place the company did receive proceeds from selling those shares while others may profit afterward it is worth noting that more than a few companies will have secondary offerings convertible debt incentive stock options and restricted stock that may be used down the road that are all dependent upon the current trading share price in terms of how useful these can be used to fund operations pay executives and so forth third if someone buys up enough shares of the company then they gain control of the company which while you are n't mentioning this case it is something to note as some individuals buy stock so that they can take over the company which happens usually this has more of an overall plan but the idea here is that getting that control of the company 's voting shares are an important piece to things here

i think if you are only trading stocks with average volume greater than 1 m you should not have any trouble entering a 10,000 size trade if you are you can try a couple of things change your order from a market order to a limit order however this may potentially reduce the number of shares that are actually traded on that day and you may miss out on some or all of your order limit your trading to more liquid stocks say average daily volumes above 10 m or apart from that you might have to just put up with some extra slippage and incorporate it into your trading plan that is you can reduce your r multiple to allow some slippage

since your youtube income is considered self employment income and because you probably already made more than $ 400 in net income after deducting expenses from the $ 4000 you 've received so far you will have to pay self employment tax and file a return   this is according to the irs 's publication 17 2016 your federal income tax so assumes the same rules for 2016 will remain in effect for 2017 you are self employed if you carry on a trade or business as a sole proprietor are an independent contractor are a member of a partnership or are in business for yourself in any other way self employment can include work in addition to your regular full time business activities such as certain part time work you do at home or in addition to your regular job you must file a return if your gross income is at least as much as the filing requirement amount for your filing status and age shown in table 1 1 also you must file form 1040 and schedule se form 1040 self employment tax if your net earnings from self employment excluding church employee income were $ 400 or more or you had church employee income of $ or more see table 1 3 use schedule se form 1040 to figure your self employment tax self employment tax is comparable to the social security and medicare tax withheld from an employee 's wages for more information about this tax see pub 334 tax guide for small business i 'd also note that your predicted income is getting close to the level where you would need to pay estimated taxes which for self employed people work like the withholding taxes employers remove their employees paychecks and pay to the government if you end up owing more than $ 1000 when you file your return you could be assessed penalties for not paying the estimated taxes there is a grace period if you had to pay no taxes in the previous year 2016 in this case that could let you escape those penalties

why should n't i bring it up freight is one thing but if there 's an interest in increased commuter rail or other passenger rail areas where businesses would use freight rail if it was extended to them or anything like the system then it 's far more likely that the government will have to be shelling out the money instead of private organizations it takes huge capital investments and years to extend something like commuter rail and businesses probably do n't want to wait potentially decades to real the rewards of a risky venture so it will be left to public investment to extend systems into some areas that may become of activity after rail reaches them it 's not all about the freight lines
