as cryptocurrencies are rather new compared to most assets there has n't been a lot of specific guidance for a lot of situation but in 2014 the irs announced that it published guidance in notice 2014 21 i 'm not aware of further guidance that has been published beyond that though it would n't surprise me if treatments changed over time in that notice the answer to the first question describes the general treatment for federal tax purposes virtual currency is treated as property general tax principles applicable to property transactions apply to transactions using virtual currency your specific questions about what constitutes a business and when you 're considered to be selling the are likely to be considered on a case by case basis by the irs as the amounts involved here are so small relatively speaking my recommendation would be to read through what the irs has published carefully make reasonable assumptions about what scenarios that are described are closest to what you 're doing and document doing so clearly as part of your tax preparations and when in doubt on the side of whichever option incurs more tax is unlikely to be objected to by them of course i 'm not a lawyer or tax advisor i 'm a stranger on the internet so for real advice you should contact somebody qualified i doubt you 'd be too much for not doing so given the amounts involved you could also attempt contacting a local irs office or calling them with your specific questions and they may be able to provide more specific guidance tailored to you though doing so may not save you from an auditor deciding something differently if they were to examine your return later there are also phone numbers to contact specific people listed at the end of notice 2014 21 you could try calling them as well

i invested a small amount of money with prosper and later with lending club i do n't know why there is such a discrepancy but over half of my prosper loans defaulted while only 1 of my lending club loans has defaulted so far i think that p2p lending is for early adopters right now there are regulation issues transparency issues legal issues etc once all of those issues get worked out i think that p2p lending will eventually overtake conventional lending and it will be more profitable for both the lender and the borrower the internet is simply eroding the value that banks are adding to the process primarily aggregation of funds and the system has to change

if the $ 9000 was deposited in february 2016 then it must be declared on your 2015 taxes not 2016 you never have a choice about when to declare a contribution the only choice you have is when to claim it as a deduction and it 's very rarely a good idea to delay claiming it you may want to take a look at your notice of assessment from tax year 2015 to see if the cra noticed the error and adjusted your return for you the text portion would usually mention any such adjustments if you can not find your it can be accessed by logging in to cra 's my account service if your 2015 rrsp contribution amount was not already adjusted for you then this service is also a good way to request a change to your 2015 return   though most people do n't realize it you technically gain your contribution room based on the previous year 's income on january 1st it 's just that you usually do n't know your exact income until you get your t4 this means that on jan 1 2016 you received that $ 6000 room and thus despite being wrong about which tax year the $ 9000 is declared you are still right about being over by $ 3000 you are allowed a little wiggle room on your limit but only $ 2000 so you 'll be charged 1 per month for every dollar in excess of $ 2000 over on january 1 2017 you would have received more contribution room based on your 2016 income and so as of then you are no longer over your limit that should mean that your penalty applies for 11 months for a total of $ 110 you can try calling the cra to see if they will waive or reduce your penalty on the grounds that you were unaware of your employer 's deposit best of luck to answer your final question yes that 3 k over contribution will now basically just be reducing your available contribution room for 2017 think of it as having room left between february 2016 and jan 2017 and then more room was added in january making that a positive number so you do n't need to withdraw or do anything further to fix things other than paying your penalty or getting it waived

the long run goal is to eliminate poverty through wealth creation if that makes for some weird new social interactions i 'd say that 's a reasonable cost   i mention comparing to earlier periods simply as a measure of progress to determine whether or not there is a problem that needs correction such as a specific group in society experiencing real wage stagnation or truly anemic growth rates relative to earlier periods it 's the slope of the trend line for each group that i 'd be worried about where linear or exponential is good and logarithmic should indicate a potential crisis   ultimately i believe that it 's not a persons absolute circumstances that matter but the rate at which those circumstances are improving throughout their lives that most strongly affects their subjective well being but that 's just my theory   as for real estate costs you 're absolutely correct that this is a problem but it 's as easily problem supply is artificially constrained in most of the us due to the need for explicit government permission in the form of building permits and zoning laws in order to build new units basic economics says that when supply is artificially restricted prices will rise   in areas where government is restrictive such as san francisco prices rise sharply in places where government is more like houston prices remain much more reasonable

here 's an example that i 'm trying to figure out   etf firm has an agreement with gs for blocks of ibm they have agreed on daily vwap + 1 for execution price   further there is a commission schedule for 5 mils with gs   come month end etf firm has to do a monthly rebalance as such must buy 100,000 shares at ibm which goes for about $ 100   the commission for the trade is 100,000 5 mils = $ 500 in commission for that trade i assume all of this is covered in the expense ratio such that if vwap for the day was 100 then each share got executed to the etf at 101 1 + 5 mils per share = for a resultant cost basis   the etf then turns around and takes out let 's say 1 as the expense ratio $ per share   i think everything so far is pretty straight forward let me know if i missed something to this point   now this is what i 'm trying to get my head around etf firm has a revenue sharing agreement as well as other relations with gs one of which is 50 back on commissions as soft dollars on top of that gs has a program where if you do a set amount of vwap + trades you are eligible for their corporate well being programs and other sponsorship of etf 's interests including helping to pay for marketing rent computers etc    does that happen do these disclosures exist somewhere

other answers did n't seem to cover it but most 0 bank loans often offered to credit card holders in the form of balance transfer checks aside from less obvious fees like already mentioned late fees also charge an actual loan fee typically 2 3 or a minimum floor amount that was the deal with every single transfer 0 offer i ever saw from a bank so effectively even if you pay off the loan perfectly on time and within 0 period you still got a 3 loan and not 0 assuming 0 period lasts 12 months which is often the case

in theory investing is not gambling because the expected outcome is not random people are expecting positive returns on average with some relationship to risk undertaken and economic reality more risk = more returns historically this is true on average that assets have positive returns and riskier assets have higher returns also it 's true that stock market gains roughly track economic growth valuation current price level relative to fundamentals matters reversion to the mean does exist over a long enough time given a 7 10 year horizon a lot of the variance in ending price level can be explained by valuation at the start of the period on average over time business profits have to vary around a curve that 's related to the overall economy and equity prices should reflect business profits the shorter the horizon the more random noise even 1 year is pretty short in this respect bubbles do exist as do irrational panics and forms of each investing is not like a coin flip because the current total number of heads and tails current valuation does affect the probability of future outcomes that said it 's pretty hard to predict the timing or the specific stocks that will do well etc rebalancing gives you an objective automated way to take advantage of all the noise around the long term trend rather than trying to use judgment to identify when to get in and out with rebalancing and dollar cost averaging you guarantee getting in a bit more when things are lower and getting out a bit more when things are higher you can make money from prices bouncing around even if they end up going nowhere and even if you ca n't predict the bouncing here are a couple old posts from my blog that talk about this a little more

there are two very small catches you have just increased your available credit   in some cases when you want to make a loan they will check your available credit against your creditworthiness your income and credit history in the short term with a greater credit limit you may have more difficulty getting a large loan   on the other hand your greater credit limit will make you seem more creditworthy as you have been walking around with the ability to borrow a whole pile and demonstrated the ability to not go bankrupt the other possible catch is that if something goes wrong and your credit line is maxed maybe you have a episode maybe you give your credit card and pin number to someone who buys a car on you your liability is larger if you can maintain spending discipline and do n't need every ounce of credit head room right now neither of these apply   in the medium to long term a lower credit utilization and a higher total limit will make you more creditworthy

scenario 1 assume that you plan to keep the parking space for the rest of your life and collect the income from the rental you say these spaces rent for $ 250 per month and there are fees of $ 1400 per year are there any other costs like would you be responsible for the cost of at some point but assuming that 's covered in the $ 1400 the net profit is 250 x 12 1400 = $ 1600 per year so now the question becomes what other things could you invest your money in and what sort of returns do those give if say you have investments in the stock market that are generating a 10 annual return and you expect that rate of return to continue indefinitely than if you pay a price that gives you a return of less than 10 i.e. if you pay more than $ 16,000 then you would be better off to put the money in the stock market that is you should calculate the fair price backwards what return on investment is acceptable and then what price would i have to pay to get that roi oh you should also consider what the occupancy rate on such parking spaces is is there enough demand that you can realistically expect to have it rented out 100 of the time when one renter leaves how long does it take to find another and do you have any information on how often renters fail to pay the rent i own a house that i rent out and i had two tenants in a row who failed to pay the rent and the legal process to get them evicted takes months i do n't know what it takes to evict someone from a parking space scenario 2 you expect to collect rent on this space for some period of time and then someday sell it in that case there 's an additional piece of information you need how much can you expect to get for this property when you sell it this is almost surely highly speculative but you could certainly look at past pricing trends if you see that the value of a parking space in your area has been going up by whatever say 4 per year for the past 20 years it 's reasonable to plan on the assumption that this trend will continue if it 's been up and down and all over the place you could be taking a real gamble if you pay $ 30,000 for it today and when the time comes to sell the best you can get is $ 15,000 that 's not so good but if there is some reasonable consistent average rate of growth in value you can add this to the expected rents like if you can expect it to grow in value by $ 1000 per year then the return on your investment is the $ 1600 in rent plus $ 1000 in capital growth equals $ 2600 then again do an roi calculation based on potential returns from other investments

no such evidence exists because many people do beat the market and many people fail to earn market rate of return the way you achieve the former is generally to take risks that also increase the likelihood of the latter the amount of time and effort you invest may bias that result but generally risk and potential reward tend to track pretty closely since everyone else is making the same evaluations you ca n't prove a negative we ca n't prove unicorns do n't exist either we can advise you that hunting for one is probably not productive many others have been trying and if there was one we 'd probably have seen at least something that encourages us to continue looking not impossible but the evidence is far from encouraging market rate of return can be achieved fairy reliably with minimal risk and minimal effort and at mostly long term tax rates i consider that sufficient for my needs others will feel otherwise

prices quoted are primarily the offer prices quoted by the numerous market makers on the stock willing to sell you the stock there is another price which generally is n't seen on these websites the bid prices which are lower prices quoted by buyers and market makers willing to buy your shares from you you would n't see those prices unless you login to your trade terminal how meaningful are they to you depends on what you want to do buy or sell if you want to buy then yes they are relevant but if you want to sell then no and remember some websites delay market information by 15 minutes in case of google you might have seen that the volume is delayed by 15 minutes so you need to consider that also while trading but may n't be a concern unless you are trying to buy out the company

while 's yes is correct a few more points to consider there is no tax penalty for withdrawing any time from a taxable investment that is one not using specific tax protections like 401k ira or esa or hsa but you do pay tax on any income or gain distributions you receive from a taxable investment in a fund except interest on tax exempt aka municipal bonds   and any net capital gains you realize when selling or technically redeeming for non etf funds just like you do for dividends and interest and gains on non fund taxable investments many funds have a sales charge or load which means you will very likely lose money if you sell quickly typically within at least several months and usually a year or more and even some no load funds to discourage rapid trading that makes their management more difficult and costly have a contingent sales charge if you sell after less than a stated period like 3 months or 6 months   for funds that largely or entirely invest in equities or longer term bonds the share value price is practically certain to fluctuate up and down and if you sell during a down period you will lose money if liquid means you want to take out money anytime without waiting for the market to move you might want funds focussing on short term bonds especially government bonds and money market funds which hold only very short bonds usually duration under 90 days which have much more stable prices but lower returns over the longer term

in general lump sum investing will tend to outperform dollar cost averaging because markets tend to increase in value so investing more money earlier will generally be a better strategy   the advantage of dollar cost averaging is that it protects you in times when markets are overvalued or prior to market corrections    as an extreme example if you done a lump sum investment in late 2008 and then suffered through the subsequent market crash it may have taken you 2 3 years to get back to even   if you began a dollar cost averaging investment plan in late 2008 it may have only taken you a 6 months to get back to even dollar cost averaging can also help to reduce the urge to time the market which for most investors is definitely a good thing

you can argue that cash dividend is a kind of split as well by this logic the stock price on ex dividend gets a hit coincidental with the dividend to be paid so one can argue that the investor has the same cash value on the day the dividend was paid as if it would n't be paid at all however for the company to distribute stocks instead of cash may be advantageous if they have low cash reserves but significant amount of treasury stocks and the stocks are of high liquidity   it is also a way for the company to release treasury stocks without diluting the current shareholders and creating taxable income to the company that 's an important factor to consider this is in fact the real answer to your question the main difference between split and stock dividend is that in split the stock distributions proportions do n't change with stock dividend they do while the outstanding share proportions do not change total proportions do because of the treasury stocks being distributed so company has less stocks in its vaults but everyone else still has the same proportions of ownership compare this to split company 's treasury stocks would be split as well and it would continue essentially sitting on the same proportion of stocks that shift of treasury stocks to the outside shareholders this is what makes it a dividend

not sure if i follow your question completely re what if some fraud takes place that 's too big even for it to fund    sipc does not fund anything what it does is takes over the troubled brokerage firm books assets and returns the money faster refer to sipc what sipc covers what it does not and more specifically sipc why we are not the fdic sipc is free for ordinary investors to get the same from elsewhere one has to pay the premium edit the event we are saying is a large brokrage firm takes all of the margin money from customer accounts and loses it and also sell off all the stocks actually shown as being held in customer account that would be to big while its not clear as to what exactly will happens my guess is that the limits per customers will go down as initial payments subsequent payments will only be done after recover of funds from the bankrupt firm what normally happens when a brokrage firm goes down is some of the money from customers account is diverted stocks are typically safe and not diverted hence the way sipc works is that it will give the money back to customer faster to individuals in absence of sipc individual investors would have had to fight for themselves

society   no these things do n't just happen on their own   if what you 're implying were true then there would be no such thing as an expansionary or monetary policy   manipulating and controlling the money supply is the entire reason for the existence of the federal reserve   what is wrong with you   go read a book or something on it fuck me   the federal reserve by setting interest rates mainly and by open market operations and by less frequently changing the reserve requirements which directly controls the money multiplier you know that thing that creates money out of thin air you seem to not be able to understand exists is constantly changing aggregate demand in the economy   aggregate demand is what the curve is about   it 's about the equilibrium between price levels and the level of economic output demanded   but not supplied   that 's aggregate supply and the federal reserve effects that less   but yes you 've simply expanded the scope of things i could talk about that are fucked up about banks and the fed in particular because the federal reserve in manipulating aggregate demand for money actually is destroying money and the efficient use of money at the same time because the lm curve in particular really represents the relationship between real income and the real money supply   real means not nominal but in actual purchasing terms   the fed is manipulating an lm curve that at its base is a piece of logic built on the assumption that what 's going into it are real numbers and yet by definition the fed acting to manipulate it makes those numbers not determined by purely market forces but also by the fed   that makes them less than real   basically the federal reserve pumps up artificial levels of demand in the economy which lasts for a bit to generate growth numbers but in the long term it simply results in inflation and a continually delayed at least for now reckoning where the artificial demand i.e. the government 's ability to borrow can not be further expanded and something has to give   this down the road would be a monetary crisis involving the us dollar being knocked off its as the world 's primary reserve currency and the yields on treasuries skyrocketing to the point that the government is either forced to behave or else print so much money to actually cover interest payments on the debt that the flood of money into the economy causes catastrophic inflation   but anyway my point is that you 're making a circular argument because you 're saying that the fed does n't interfere in or exert tremendous control over the economy because there 's something that we know shows the given price level of money in an economy called the curve falsely implying that everything 's fine with money because it 's determined by mechanical natural laws almost like gravity when in fact the federal reserve 's whole purpose is to manipulate the inputs that go into that curve   it reduces interest rates which artificially increases income   it also increases the velocity of money an input for the lm curve by increasing nominal economic output etc etc   the is and lm curves are not these things that just sort of happen on their own   this may come as a shock but the us has a central bank which has as its sole purpose the manipulation of these curves   its central mandate is control of price levels   its mandate is to preserve the status of the big banks on the top of society which is why the big banks created it in the first place and why they own all the branches this is the root fact behind why some people say that the federal reserve is in fact not federal and is instead privately owned which is n't completely literally true but true enough in the sense that it has a clear conflict of interest between the public good it 's supposed to be and the private interests of the banks that own its branches and exert control over the financial system mainly through the new york branch but that 's not the whole story about the total money supply   there 's also the effect of the money multiplier   it 's as if you 're just pretending these things do n't exist   it 's real i assure you   banks create money out of thin air when they extend credit to you   to pay the obligation to them you use the real money you in fact earned through your own labor or from some real asset you might have   they get the better end of the deal and almost all the money in the economy is by this process this insanely exorbitant privilege they have   and yes i have a problem with it

this is almost a question in financial engineering first i will note that a discussion of the greeks is well presented at these measures are first second and higher order derivatives or rate of change comparisons for information that is generally instantaneous bear with me for example the most popular delta compares prices of an option or other derived asset to the underlying asset price the reason we are able to do all this cool analysis is because the the value of the underlying and derived assets have a direct instantaneous relationship on each other because beta is calculated over a large period of time and because each time slice covered contributes equally to the aggregate then the difference in beta would really just be showing two pieces of information summarizing those two pieces of information into delta beta would not be useful to me for further discussion please see specifically look at the huge difference in calculation of ge 's beta using end of month returns versus calculation using day before end of month returns

closing your oldest revolving account will lower your average age of accounts and hurt your score   no ifs or   the amount it drops is hard to tell and it may only be a few points if your other cards are fairly old as well while the fico scoring algorithm is proprietary and hard to predict you can use the official fico simulator to estimate the impact   based on the information you provided 5 + cards oldest card 5 years your estimate is 750 800   performing the same estimate and only changing the number of cards and age 2 4 cards oldest card 2 4 years the score estimate drops to   both of these estimates assume you have 9 or less utilization   you can probably estimate that your score will drop at least 15 points however it may not matter to you whether your score is maximized   once you get above a certain fico score it does n't matter   for example i recently refinanced a vehicle and asked the loan officer about their lowest apr and found out that they required a 780 fico for it   kind of like the difference between getting a 91 or a 99 in a class an a is an a. some other factors you may want to consider before you make your choice

usually points have different value depending on what you use it for and how much of them you convert for many providers if you have enough 10000 + usually points it is possible to convert them 1:1 which means 1 point converted to 1 cent to either cash or something that is almost as good as cash $ 100 gift card for some popular store or $ 100 amazon.com certificate etc some cards have more exotic ways of getting best value such as transferring money to pay student loans retirement accounts etc so to get the best value i 'd recommend to make a list of what you can get from your program most types of reward are uniform i.e. many gift cards with the same price so the work may be less than it seems and calculate point values of each of those if you want to be really precise take into account that if you buy something with points you do not earn points on that which reduces the value a little in general these days it is very rare to get a card that produces more than 1 back though some have up to 5 for certain categories of purchases

my answer is similar to ben miller 's but let me make some slightly different points there is one excellent reason to get a consolidation loan you can often get a lower interest rate if you are presently paying 19 on a credit card and you can roll that into a personal loan at you 'll be saving over 5 which can add up i would definitely not consolidate a loan at into a loan at then you 're just adding 1 to your interest rate what 's the benefit in this another good reasons for a consolidation loan is psychological a consolidation loan with fixed payments forces you to pay that amount every month you say you have trouble with credit cards it 's very easy to say to yourself oh just this month i 'm going to pay just the minimum so i can use my cash for this other very important thing that i need to buy and then next month you find something else that you just absolutely have to buy and again the next month and the next and your determination to seriously pay down your debt keeps getting pushed off if you have a fixed monthly payment you ca n't you 're committed also if you have many credit cards juggling payments on all of them can get complex and confusing it 's easy to lose track of how much you owe and to budget for payments at worst when there are many bills to pay you may forget one personally i now have 3 bank cards an airline card and 2 store cards and managing them is getting out of hand i have good reasons for having so many cards the airline card and the store cards give me special discounts but it 's confusing to keep track of as to adding $ 3,000 to the consolidation loan very very bad idea you are basically saying i have to start seriously paying down my debt tomorrow today i need a some extra cash so i 'm going to borrow just a little bit more but i 'm going to get started paying it off next month this is a trap and the sort of trap that leads people into spiraling debt start paying off debt now not at some vague time in the future that never seems to come

there is some merit to it in that federal gross receipts are largely uncorrelated with tax wp content federal personal income tax rates tax    there are two somewhat perverse consequences of that fact first raising taxes does n't raise revenues meaning we ca n't actually pay for free stuff from uncle sam merely by adding an offsetting tax increase   and second raising taxes on group x ie the rich to make them pay their fair share flat out does n't work it 's effectively just kicking them in the balls because we grudge them for having more money than we do   now as to whether or not lowering taxes really encourages companies to hire more and pay better that 's an entirely separate issue from whether or not it 's revenue neutral from the perspective of the federal government   fortunately we have a recent historical example reagan did exactly that which in a period of corporate greed and erosion of workers rights not seen since the end of the days of the robber barons   so on the front end trump 's not wrong on the back end he 's trying to sell us unicorn

you could buy bitcoins they are even more deflationary than swiss francs   but the exchange rate is currently high and so is the risk in case of volatility   so maybe buy an altcoin instead see altcoin market capitalization for more information basically all you 'd be doing is changing into bitcoin altcoin   you do n't need a bank to store it you do n't need to stockpile cash at home   stays liquid there 's no stock portfolio albeit a coin portfolio unlike in stocks there are no noteworthy buy and sell commissions and the central bank ca n't just change the bills as in classic cash currency   the only risk is volatility in the coin market which is not a small risk   should coins have been going down then for as long as you do n't need that money and keep some for use on a bank account you can just wait until said coins re climb volatility goes both ways after all

insert usual disclaimer that i 'm just a random guy on the internet not any kind of certified tax professional but once i withdraw the money how is that money taxable if i 'm understanding your situation correctly you want to look at the instructions for form 8889 under excess employer contributions it simply says if the excess was not included in income on form w-2 you must report it as other income on your tax return there does n't look to be any particular wording beyond that so i 'd just put it on form 1040 line 21 other income and label the line really specifically like excess employer contributions distributed from hsa also there is no mention of whether any fica taxes social security and medicare apply to these amounts you say that this was entirely contributed by the employer but even for cases where one contributes directly through payroll with an optional pre tax deduction this is usually implemented as a salary reduction agreement where the company is actually paying less money in salary and thus less showing up on the w-2 and just contributing to the hsa account instead it 's listed on the 8889 as an employer contribution even if in fact one sees it as a deduction on one 's pay stub in either case since the company did n't pay you the money as salary and merely contributed to the hsa instead i would n't expect any fica taxes to be owed on it the fact that the irs wants it listed under other income instead of wages also implies to me that it does n't count as salary that needs fica taxes presumably if people abused this in some way like getting their employer to deliberately over contribute each year and getting a refund in some sort of crazy scheme to try to reduce their ss taxes the government would get rather upset and probably call it some sort of tax evasion but for the amounts involved here particularly as you 're following the instructions listed i just would n't worry about it assuming that i withdraw excess contribution and report everything on form 8889 and form 1040 is there any further action required from my previous employer it 's your hsa so i would n't think so since the eligibility for hsas is based on what you do and not what they do you could for instance get covered by a different hdhp and they would n't be notified nor really care i do n't think they have anything more to do with it also i am not sure how to calculate amount of interest attributable to excess contribution i have only around $ 0.20 of total interest this year the bank holding the hsa could probably help with that as i 'd expect it to be a normal part of the excess contribution withdrawal process if not i 'd just make a reasonable effort based on the interest rate amount involved and number of days that the excess was in the account also keep in mind that in general when filing taxes anything under $ can round to $ 0 at some point one can only be as honest as the law allows

other things equal is sometimes referred to as ceteris paribus the scenario where you compare two currencies or things under the assumption that all other factors that could effect those currencies earthquakes revolutions currency crises ect are not its like using a control group in a lab real interest rates means the rate of that countries interest rate accounting for inflation proportional to the strength of its home currency is referring to how countries with higher rates of interest tend to have stronger currencies relative to other currencies because foreign investment capital will flood into the country seeking those higher rates of return excess demand for the currency will cause it to appreciate so this is also true in reverse as capital will tend to leave a country will ultra low interest rates

basically diversifying the spread of possible results raising   the center of the returns bell curve by reducing the likelihood of extreme results at either the high or low end   it 's largely a matter of basic statistics bet double or nothing on a single coin flip and those are the only possible results and your odds of a disaster losing most or all of the money are 50 bet half of it on each of two coin flips and your odds of losing are reduced to 25 at the cost of reducing your odds of winning to 25 with 50 odds that you retain your money and can try the game again three coins divides the space further the extremes are reduced to 12.5 each with the middle being most likely if that was all there was this would be a zero sum game and pure gambling but the stock market is actually positive sum since companies are delivering part of their profits to their stockholder owners this moves the center of the bell curve up a bit from break even historically to about + 8 this is why index funds produce a profit with very little active decision they treat the variation as mostly random which seems to work statistically and just try to capture average results of a hopefully slightly above average bucket of stocks and/or bonds this approach is boring it will never double your money overnight on the other hand it will never wipe you out overnight if you have patience and are willing to let compound interest work for you and trust that most market swings regress to the mean in the long run it quietly builds your savings while not driving you crazy worrying about it if all you are looking for is better return than the banks and you have a reasonable amount of time before you need to pull the funds out it 's one of the more reliably predictable risk reward trade off points you may want to refine this by the mix of what you 're holding the simplest adjustment is how much you keep in each of several major investment categories large cap stocks small cap stocks bonds and real estate in the form of reits each have different baseline risk return curves and move in different ways in response to news so maintaining a selected ratio between these buckets and adding the resulting curves together is one simple way to make fairly predictable adjustments to the width and of the total bell curve if you think you can do better than this go for it but index funds have been outperforming professionally managed funds after the management fees are accounted for and unless you are interested in spending a lot of time researching and playing with your money the odds of your doing much better are n't great unless you 're willing to risk doing much worse for me boring is good i want my savings to work for me rather than the other way around and i do n't consider the market at all interesting as a game others will feel differently

no   the more legs you add onto your trade the more commissions you will pay entering and exiting the trade and the more opportunity for slippage   so lets head the other direction    can we make a simple risk free option trade with as few legs as possible the not really surprising answer is yes but there is no free lunch as you will see   according to financial theory any riskless position will earn the risk free rate which right now is almost nothing nada 0    let 's test this out with a little example in theory a riskless position can be constructed from buying a stock selling a call option and buying a put option   this combination should earn the risk free rate selling the call option means you get money now but agree to let someone else have the stock at an agreed contract price if the price goes up   buying the put option means you pay money now but can sell the stock to someone at a pre agreed contract price if you want to do so which would only be when the price declines below the contract price   to start our risk free trade buy google stock goog at the oct 3 close    x = $ the example has 100 shares for compatibility with the options contracts which require 100 share blocks we will sell a call and buy a put contract price of $ 500 for jan    therefore we will receive $ 50,000 for certain on jan unless the options clearing system fails because of say global financial collapse or war with according to google finance if we had sold a call today at the close we would receive the bid which is or $ total   and if we had bought a put today at the close we would pay the ask which is or $ total so to receive $ 50,000 for certain on jan we could pay $ for the goog stock minus $ for the money we received selling the call option plus a payment of $ for the put option we need to protect the value   the total is $    if we pay $ today plus execute the option strategy shown we would have $ 50,000 on jan   this is a profit of $ 158 the options commissions are going to be around $ so in total the profit is around $ 120 after commissions    on the other hand in a bank cd for 12 months at 1.1 will yield $ 550 in similarly risk free interest    given that it is difficult to actually make these trades simultaneously in practice with the prices jumping all around i would say if you really want a low risk option trade then a bank cd looks like the safer bet   this is n't to say you ca n't find another combination of stock and contract price that does better than a bank cd but i doubt it will ever be better by very much and still difficult to monitor and align the trades in practice

almost all major no load mutual fund families allow you to do the kind of thing you are talking about however you may need an initial investment of between $ 1000 to $ 3000 depending on the fund   once you have it however annual fee 's are usually very little and the fees to buy that companies funds are usually zero if it 's a no load company vanguard etc   with the larger companies that means you have a pretty large selection of funds but generally each fund has a minimum initial purchase once that 's met then you can buy additional amounts in small quantities without a problem for someone on a smaller budget many low cost brokers etrade as mentioned by scottrade as mentioned by myself in another similar question today allow you to start with smaller initial balances and have a small selection of funds or etf 's that you can trade from without commission   in the case of scottrade they have like 15 etf 's that you can trade comission free   check with the various low cost brokerages such as etrade scottrade and tdameritrade to see what their policies are and what if any funds etf 's they allow you to trade in without commissions keep in mind that for mutual funds there may still be a fund minimum initial investment that applies be sure to check if that is the case or not   the lack of any minimum investment makes etf 's a slightly more attractive option for someone who does n't have the buy in that many funds require

the justification for an act typically comes after the decision is made people operate under a fairly universal set of instincts and social behaviors so i think condemning him for this behavior directly is short sighted    i would ask instead why do people feel that cheating organizations like target is so emotionally easy i would wager that is not the sort of person who would steal his neighbors unlocked bike from his porch or hustle a man for bus fare so what is different   we seem generally as a population to have less emotional investment in strangers than ourselves even less in people from other cultures and even less in animals we will fight hard to save the lives of 5000 of our soldiers less hard to save a million of their and we certainly do n't give a fuck about taking a bee 's honey or killing a chicken and eating it again generally    i would propose that organizations like big box stores fall somewhere between animals and foreign peasants as far as our feelings of responsibility towards them it is a little more complicated than that because obviously a big box store supports the lives of a certain number of people but if a big box store were delicious and did not support people i would wager it would not survive for very long   so the defining difference seems to be whether or not you are a person who makes a rational decision that the store provides more good for your people or if it is a net harmful force whether you have strong ingrained emotional belief structures regarding cheating or and whether your rational mind your emotional decision making mine rarely does though i try   a person who thinks that they do more harm to the population than good even with a strong sense of the of stealing might steal from the store even though they would never steal from another person they would be completely morally justified in this act   similarly a person who thinks that the store does more good than harm and does not steal from the store regardless of whether or not they think stealing is wrong would also be morally just in their actions    a person who thinks they do no harm to the community but has no negative emotional connection to the act of theft might steal from both the store and their neighbor they would obviously not be justified   a person with a strong sense of the of stealing which their rational decision regarding the value of a big box store will not steal but they may not be morally justified in the decision depending on their rational take   i think i fall into the first category i think it is wrong not to do harm to an organization like target when it is possible to do so yet i generally do n't go about this by stealing because getting caught would be much worse than whatever harm i could do by jacking a few dollars worth of merchandise this offer allowed a means of theft without getting caught and had i been aware of it i probably would have availed myself of it   as it stands i just work extremely hard in the field of with the hopes that one day i will contribute to technologies which will allow humans to live and thrive without having to buy food clothes medicine or shit from target

by mentioning gld i presume therefore you are referring to the gold exchange traded fund that is intended to mirror the price of gold without you having to personally hold bullion or even gold certificates while how much is a distinctly personal choice there are seemingly at least three camps of people in the investment world first would be traditional bond fixed income and equity people   gold would play no direct role in their portfolio other than perhaps holding gold company shares in some other vehicle but they would not hold much gold directly secondly at the mid range would be someone like yourself that believes that is in and of itself a worthy investment and makes it a non trivial but not overriding part of their portfolio   your 5 10 range seems to fit in well here lastly and to my taste over the top are the gold gold gold investors that seem to believe it is the panacea for all market woes   i always suspect that investment gurus that are pushing this however have large positions that they are trying to run up so they can unload given all this i am not aware of any general rule about gold but anything less than 10 would seem like at least a not over concentration in the one area   once any one holding gets much beyond that you should really examine why you believe that it should represent such a large part of your holdings good luck

a security is a class of financial instrument you can trade on the market   a share of stock is a kind of security for example as is a bond in the case of your mortgage what happens you take out a loan for $ 180k   the loan has two components a.   the payment stream meaning the principal and the interest from the loan b.   the servicing of the loan meaning the company who is responsible for accepting payments giving the resulting income to whomever owns it many originating banks such as my initial lender do neither of these things they sell the payment stream to a large bank or consortium often fannie mae and they also sell the servicing of the loan to another company the payment stream is the primary value here the servicing is worth essentially a tip off the top   the originating bank lends $ 180k of their own money   then they have something that is worth some amount say $ 450k total value $ 15k per year for 30 years and they sell it for however much they can get for it   the actual value of $ 15k year for 30 years is somewhere in between less than $ 450k more than $ 180k since there is risk involved and the present value is far less   the originating bank has the benefit of selling that they can then originate more mortgages and make money off the fees plus they can reduce their risk exposure then a security is created by the bigger bank where they take a bunch of mortgages of different risk levels and group them together to make something with a very predictable risk   very similar to insurance really except the other way around   one mortage will either default or not at some chance but it 's a one off thing any good statistician will tell you that you do n't do statistics on   one hundred mortgages each with some risk level will very consistently return a particular amount within a certain error and thus you have something that people are willing to pay money on the market for

first let 's look at the tax brackets for single taxpayers in 2016 the cutoff between the 25 and 28 tax bracket is $   you said that your gross is $   this will be reduced by deductions and exemptions at least $ 10,350   your rental income will increase your income but it is offset in part by your rental business expenses for this year you will almost certainly be in the 25 bracket whether or not you receive your this year   next year if you receive your then and your salary is $ 11k higher i 'm guessing you 'll be close to the edge it is important to remember that the tax brackets are marginal   this means that when you move up to the next tax bracket it is only the amount of income that puts you over the top that is taxed at the higher rate   you can see this in the chart above   so if for example your taxable income ends up being $ you 'll be in the 28 tax bracket but only $ 10 of your income will be taxed at 28   the rest will be taxed at 25 or lower   as a result this probably is n't worth worrying about too much a bit more explanation requested by the op here is how to understand the numbers in the tax bracket chart   let 's take a look at the second line $   the tax rate is explained as $ plus 15 of the amount over $ 9,275   the first $ 9,275 of your taxable income is taxed at a 10 rate   so if your total taxable income falls between $ and $ 37,650 the first $ 9,275 is taxed at 10 a tax of $ and the amount over $ 9,275 is taxed at 15   on each line of the chart the amount of tax from all the previous brackets is carried down so you do n't have to calculate it when i said that you have at least $ 10,350 in deductions and exemptions i got that number from the standard deduction and the personal exemption amount   for 2016 the standard deduction for single taxpayers is $ 6,300   if you itemize your deductions you might be able to deduct more   personal exemptions for 2016 are at $ 4,050 per person   that means you get to reduce your taxable income by $ 4,050 for each person in your household   since you are single with no dependents your standard deduction plus the personal exemption for yourself will result in a reduction of at least $ 10,350 on your taxable income

you do not need to inform your employer of your additional activity but it is your responsibility not to work for more than 48 hours per week as long as you are an employee so if you are working 38 hours for your employer you may not work for yourself for more than 10 hours it is however not so easy in practice to draw the line between work and a hobby as long as you are not being paid by the hour the main reason to present your employer with an addition to your work contract is to make it legally very clear that he holds no intentions to claim copyright to your work he may attempt to do something funky like claim your home computer is in fact a work computer because you used it once a month to work from home and your work contract may contain a paragraph that all work performed on a work computer results in copyright ownership for your employer i have no idea how likely this is in practice but this is the reason i know is commonly given as legal advice to have a contract so the normal contract you present your employer with says in order to earn user contribution money from a website you need to register as a sole proprietor and pay trade tax and sales tax alternatively you claim small trade exception which also makes a tax return mandatory i would guess however and this is not legal advice in any way just my guess that a couple of contributions towards server cost in a strictly non profit endeavor is not commercial at all but private in the same way that you may write an invoice to someone you sold your old bike to or a kid may get paid to mow someone 's lawn based on that guess my non legal advice recommendation is to take the contributions and do nothing else as long as the amount is nowhere near breaking even if you count your work input

things are generally fine   a credit balance is not a horrible thing    the argument against maintaining a credit balance is that you are essentially loaning the credit card issuer money at 0 interest   you probably have alternative investments that would pay better interest so it 's usually better to park your money there   all that said it 's unlikely that the interest on whatever balance you have is enough to be more than pennies    the way that a credit card works you run up a balance in one period   then there is a grace period   if you do n't pay off the balance during the grace period they start charging you interest   you also may have a minimum payment to make   if you do n't make that payment they 'll charge you a late fee    the typical period to rack up charges is from the first to the last day of a month   the typical grace period is through the 20th or 25th of the next month   your card may be different   so check the documentation user agreement for your card if you want the real data    it sounds like you paid off some purchases while you were still in the period where you rack up charges   while those purchases were posted to the account they may not be counted in the balance calculation   if your credit balance exactly matches the payment you made that 's probably what happened   it 's also possible that you overpaid the balance   if your credit balance is just a small amount that 's probably what happened    if you really want to be sure you should call the credit card issuer and ask them   at best we can tell you how it normally works   since this is your first month you could just wait for your first bill and respond to that   so long as you pay off the entire balance shown there by the deadline everything should be fine    do n't wait until the last day to pay   it 's usually best to pay a week or so early so as to leave time for the mail to deliver the check and for them to process it   you can wait longer for an online payment but a few business days early to give you a chance to handle potential problems is still good

the answer would depend on the equities held some can weather inflation better than others such as companies that have solid dividend growth and even outpace inflation some industries are also safer against inflation than others such as consumer staples and utilities since people usually have to purchase these regardless of how much $ they have in looking over the data comparing s&p 500 returns dividends and inflation the results are all over the map in the 50 's the total return was with inflation at 2.2 then in the 70 's returns were 5.8 with inflation at percent leading one to think that inflation diminished returns but then in the 80 's inflation was 5.1 yet the return on the s&p was up to either way aside from the 70 's every other decade since 1950 has outpaced inflation as long as you are including dividends hence my first paragraph s&p 500 total and inflation adjusted historical returns also the 7 average stock appreciation you mention is just that an average you are comparing a year over year number 7 inflation with an aggregated one stock performance over x number of years and that is a misrepresentation and is not being weighted for the difference in what those numbers mean finally there are thousands of things that have an effect on the stock market and stocks some are and others are not the idea that any one of them such as inflation has any sort of long term effect on prices that they can not is improbable this is where researching your stocks comes in and if done prudently who cares what the inflation rate is

the answer can depend greatly on whether the interest on a mortgage for the house you live in is tax deductible in the country you are in i assume the mortgage is on the house you live in and not an investment property it will also depend on the difference between the mortgage interest rate and the return of the unit trust your income and your tax rates in essence you would need to do a cost benefit analysis to figure out which option would provide the financial benefit considering the different rates your income and your tax rates basically if you can get a better return from the unit trust than the mortgage interest rate and you can claim a tax deduction for the mortgage interest payments then you may be better off investing in the unit trust rather than putting extra repayments into the mortgage

the time value of money is very important in understanding this issue   money today is worth more than money next year two years from now etc it 's a well understood economics concept and well worth reading about if you have some well time not only is money literally worth more now than later due to inflation but there is the simple fact that assuming you have money for the purpose of doing something being able to do that thing today is better than doing that same thing tomorrow   a bird in the hand is worth two in the bush gets to this rather directly having it now is better than probably having it later   would you rather have a nice meal tonight or eat beans and rice tonight and then have the same nice meal next year that 's why interest exists in part you 're offered some money now for more money later or in the case of buying a bond you 're offered more money later for some money now   the fact that people have different discount rates for money later is why the loan market can exist people with more money than they can use now have a lower discount for future money than people who really need money right now to buy a house to pay their rent whatever    so when choosing to buy a bond you look at the money you 're going to get both over the short term the coupon rate and the long term the face value and you consider whether $ 80 now is worth $ 100 in 20 years plus $ 2 per year   for some people it is for some people it is n't and that 's why the price is as it is $ 80   odds are if you have a few thousand usd you 're probably not going to be interested in this or if you have a very long term outlook there are better ways to make money over that long term   but if you 're a bank needing a secure investment that wo n't lose value or a trust that needs high stability you might be willing to take that deal

i think that author does a disservice by writing such seemingly sensible articles without actually knowing how things work if i did n’t know better i would think this guy was teaching me something it ’s a shame he did not do research before he started writing   let ’s say you buy a classic car you take super good care of it all original mint condition you paid cash for it out of your savings this is a balance sheet transaction that has nothing to do with income you traded your cash asset for a classic car asset   now let ’s say this car is so rare and you keep it in such good condition that it gains value every year maybe it was worth $ 15k when you bought it but this year it ’s already worth $ 17k great job on making a great purchase but is that $ 2k gain counted as income to you no it is not the value of that asset on your balance sheet went up but you did not make anything off of that increase in value because you have not sold it   if you had to pay taxes on the increase in value every year those taxes would essentially force you to sell that car to pay the taxes just because you took care of it additionally in the long term no one would want to own anything so this would destroy the value of everyone ’s stuff but i digress   in this example amazon stock is the car the author is seeing the increase in stock value adding to the balance sheets of the investors who bought the stock and confusing that with income   back to our example let ’s say your car increased in value $ 2k a year for two years and you decide to sell it for $ 19k now we are about to realize some income since you bought it for $ 15k and sold for $ 19k you earned an income of the difference or $ 4k    your income was n’t $ 19k because you originally put $ 15k in cash into the car that cash was already saved from income you made in the past and it is not counted again as income in this sale   because you did not work for this new car sale income but it was derived from asset growth the income is called capital gains you invested your capital $ 15k into the asset car and that asset appreciated when you sold it you received capital money back in exchange for that asset the capital you received is more than what you invested which is to say you gained $ 4k of capital by investing in and then selling your   asset car   because you held the car for two years you qualify for lower long term capital gains tax rate on that $ 4k had you sold it after year 1 you paid your regular normal income tax rate on those capital gains either way you owe the tax when you sell the asset not when it appreciates   i ’m sure you realize this already but if we change the car to amazon stock in my story this is exactly how it works with investors   the author gets several things wrong    1 amazon profits are not passed through to shareholders for income tax purposes if amazon paid dividends those dividends would be taxed at payout at the long term capital gains rate and they would be paid out of cash amazon has left after it already paid corporate taxes on profits    amazon has decided they can add more value to investors by using cash to grow instead of paying dividends when the investors sell the stock they will owe capital gains on the growth of that stock if amazon is correct that using cash to grow then investors will effectively pay more when they sell the stock than they would pay today if dividends were paid   2 asset appreciation is not income those investors will realize the income when they sell the stock and they will pay the tax then    3 he is missing the point entirely on why amazon runs a low profit or how business strategy translates into financials low prices are not a function of low profitability low profitability could be an adverse result of low pricing but being low profit in order to be low price is a ridiculous and failing strategy amazon ’s low pricing is a function of their unparalleled buying power unparalleled consumer and product data amazing logistics prowess clever loyalty programs like amazon prime and many other brilliant things they ’ve done their low profitability is a function of their investment in things like amazon fresh amazon alexa drone delivery automated convenience stores building out cloud computing infrastructure and many other r&amp;d projects $ 4 billion in original content spending for amazon prime video and all kinds of expenditures years ahead of when they become profitable by the time consumers want it amazon already built it three years ago this is the power of amazon sometimes multi billion dollar experiments fail and all that money was for nothing sometimes they lose money for a few years and then become the infrastructure that runs a third of the internet amazon does not let fear of failure stop them they invest in growth with their cash this is how bezos thinks how do we build the future not how can i avoid tax     i do need to make a disclaimer here there could be special tax treatment of classic cars that makes my example not work also classic cars may not appreciate in value i do n’t know anything about classic cars i just picked a politically neutral thing to put in my story and made some assumptions to illustrate how capital gains work my story is definitely how stocks work and probably cars but i just want to point out that i do n’t know shit about car collecting

firstly is not even secondly generally you would pay tax on the sale of the shares whether you buy them back or not even one minute later has nothing to do with it the only reason this would not create a capital gains event is if your country which you have n't specified has some odd rules or laws about this that i and most others have never heard of before

basically the first thing you should do before you invest your money is to learn about investing and learn about what you want to invest in another thing to think about is that usually low risk can also mean low returns as you are quite young and have some savings put aside you should generally aim for higher risk higher return investments and then when you start to reach retirement age aim for less risky lower return investments in saying that just because an investment is considered high risk does not mean you have to be exposed to the full risk of that investment you do this by managing your risk to an acceptable level which will allow you to sleep at night to do this you need to learn about what you are investing in as an example about managing your risk in an investment say you want to invest $ 50,000 in shares if you put the full $ 50,000 into one share and that share price drops dramatically you will lose a large portion of your money straight away if instead you spent a maximum of $ 10,000 on 5 different shares even if one of them falls dramatically you still have another 4 which may be doing a lot better thus your losses to take it one step further you might say if anyone of the shares you bought falls by 20 then you will sell those shares and limit your losses to $ 2000 per share if the worst case scenario occurred and all 5 of your shares fell during a stock market crash you would limit your total losses to $ 10,000 instead of $ 50,000 most successful investors put just as much if not more emphasis on managing the risk on their investments and limiting their losses as they do in selecting the investments as i am not in the us i can not really comment whether it is the right time to buy property over there especially as the market conditions would be different in different states and in different areas of each state however a good indication of when to buy properties is when prices have dropped and are starting to as you are renting at the moment one option you might want to look at is buying a place to live in so you do n't need to rent any more you can compare your current rent payment with the mortgage payment if you were to buy a house to live in if your mortgage payments are lower than your rent payments then this could be a good option but whatever you do make sure you learn about it first make sure you spend the time looking at for sale properties for a few months in the area you want to buy before you do buy this will give you an indication of how much properties in that area are really worth and if prices are stable still falling or starting to go up good luck and remember research research and more research even if you are to take someone elses advice and recommendations you should learn enough yourself to be able to tell if their advice and recommendations make sense and are right for your current situation

generally speaking granting rights to one bank account e.g. making a joint account does not extend rights to other accounts or otherwise let one joint owner create new obligations on the other owner e.g. opening a line of credit that the other owner must pay for except to the extent of the joint account   i assume there are no uk rules that would change this feature the other party can of course withdraw all the money without need for your approval   this also means that the joint account could be exposed to all the creditors of either party   if your account joint tenant has huge debts the creditors could theoretically look to the joint account for satisfaction   at least that would be an issue under us law frankly it may be simpler to get a separate account for the other person if possible and make transfers with online banking   it could also make sense to get a banking card if those are in the uk which works like a debit card and can be through various means sometimes a call sometimes online deposits sometimes in physical stores   there may be fees to getting such a card or a second account of course   the benefit is that the cardholder has no access to your account and you control recharging   such cards are widely available in the us to people who otherwise would not qualify for traditional bank accounts note also the fatca complication with adding a us person to your account   my understanding is that a number of non us banks will simply close the accounts of americans rather than deal with hassles under fatca

generally when you own something you can give it as a collateral for a secured loan that 's how car loans work and that 's how mortgages work your equity in the asset is the current fair value of the asset minus all your obligations secured by it so if you own a property free and clear you have 100 of its fair market value as your equity when you mortgage your property banks will usually use some percentage loan to value to ensure they 're not giving you more than your equity now or in a foreseeable future depending on the type and length of the loan the ltv percentage varies between 65 and 95 before the market crash in 2008 you could even get more than 100 ltv but not anymore for investment the ltv will typically be lower than for primary residence and the rates higher i do n't want to confuse you with down payments and deposits as it does n't matter unless you 're in australia apparently so as an example assume you have an apartment you rent out which you own free and clear lets assume its current fmv is $ 100k. you go to a bank and mortgage the apartment for a loan get a loan secured by that apartment at 65 ltv typical for condos for investment you got yourself $ 65 k to buy another unit free and clear you now have 2 apartments with fmv $ 165 k your equity $ 100 k and your liability $ mortgaging the new unit at the same 65 ltv will yield you another $ 42 k loan you may buy a third unit with this money your equity remains constant when you take the loan and invest it in the new purchase but the fmv of your assets grows as does the liability secured by them but while the mortgage has fixed interest rate usually not always the assets appreciate at different rates now lets be optimistic and assume for the sake of simplicity of the example that in 2 years your $ 100 k condo is worth $ 200k. voila you can take another $ 65 k loan on it the cycle goes on that 's how your grandfather did it

the really simple answer is that compound interest is compound not linear   money invested for longer earns more interest and the sooner you start investing the longer it has to earn interest   these ideas come out of pension investment where 65 is the usual retirement age and what you invest in the 1st ten years of your pension or any other compound interest fund accounts for over 50 of what you will get out 25 to 65 is forty years and $ 100 invested at 7 for 40 years is $ 1400   $ 100 invested every year for 40 years the pot would be worth just under $ 20,000 at 30 years it would be worth under $ 10,000 and at 20 years it would be worth only $   if you double your investment amount every 10 years you would have invested $ and the pot would be worth $ do exactly the same but starting at 35 instead of 25 and your pot would only be worth $

it 's not quite clear what you are asking so i 'll answer a few possible interpretations businesses pay taxes on their profits so if your business took a million pounds in revenue e.g. sold a million pounds worth of stuff then you would subtract roughly speaking everything the business spent on making and selling that stuff and pay taxes only on the profit vat however is a different matter and you would have to pay vat on all of that income technically the vat portion is n't even income it 's tax you are forced to collect on behalf of the government if your business made a million pounds pounds profit it would pay tax on all of that million subject to what a tax accountant can do to reduce that which ought to be considerable   you ca n't subtract your personal living expenses like that however the company can pay you a salary which counts as an expense and the company does n't pay tax on that you might also take some money from the company as dividends both salary and dividends count as personal income to yourself and you will need to pay personal income tax on them   as for the ferrari it depends on whether you can justify it as a business expense a lot of companies provide cars for their employees so that they can use them for business however you have to be able to show that is for business otherwise they are taxed like salary the rules for company cars are quite complicated and you would need an accountant if this is a real rather than hypothetical situation definitely get a tax accountant involved

many folks use bonds to diversify their portfolio since bonds rise and fall in value at different times and for different reasons than stocks bonds pay interest on a regular basis usually monthly or quarterly and so some people invest in bonds in order to match the interest payments to some regular expense they might have the interest payment does not change fixed income   for individual bonds there is a maturity date at which you can expect to receive the face value of the bond the issuer 's creditworthiness is important here you can make a little money on a bond by buying it when its value is lower than its face value and either selling later for a higher value or waiting for it to mature   often the minimum investment for a single bond is high so if you do n't have a large enough amount you can still get the performance of bonds through a bond fund these do not mature so you do n't have a guarantee of a return of your investment however they have access to more bonds than retail investors so the funds can keep your money more fully invested if you do n't need the income you can reinvest the dividends and have a little extra capital growth this way

the assumption that companies listed otc are not serious is far from the truth many companies on the otc are just starting off there because they do n't meet the requirements to be listed on the nasdaq or nyse major stock exchanges like the nasdaq and the nyse only want the best companies to trade on their exchanges the nasdaq for example has three sets of listing requirements a company must meet at least one of the three requirement sets as well as the main rules for all companies these include now do n't assume that the otc does n't have rules either as this is far from the truth as well while there are no minimum level of revenue profits or assets required to get listed on the otc there are requirements for audited financial statements and ongoing filing and reporting to the sec and nasd additionally there are several different levels of the otc including the the and the otc pink each with their own set of requirements for more information about what it takes to be listed on otc look here a company deciding to trade on the otc is making the decision to take their company public and they are investing to make it happen currently the fees to get listed on the otc range from $ 30,000 to $ 150,000 depending on the firm you decide to go with and the services they offer as part as their package now i know i would n't consider $ 30 k or more to not be serious money when i looked into the process of getting a company listed on the tsx the requirements seemed a lot more relaxed than those of the major u.s. markets as well consisting of an application records submission and then a decision made by a tsx committee about whether you get listed more information about the tsx here i think the way that the otc markets have gotten such a bad reputation is from these get rich on penny stock companies that you see pumping up otc company stocks and getting massive amounts of people to buy without doing their due diligence and investigating the company and reading its prospectus then when they loose a bunch of money on an ill informed investment decision they blame it on the company being an otc stock   whether you decide to trade the otc market or not i would n't make a decision based on how many exchanges the company is listed on but rather based on the research you do into the company

i have n't seen any of the other answers address this point shares are a form of ownership of a company and thus they are an entitlement to the proceeds of the company including proceeds from liquidation imagine an extreme contrived example whereby you own shares in a company that is explicitly intended to only exist for a finite and definite period say to serve as the producers of a one time event consider a possible sequence of major events in this company 's life so why would the shares of this hypothetical company be worth anything because the company itself is worth something or rather the stuff that the company owns is worth something even or in my example especially in the event of its dissolution or liquidation besides just the stuff that a company owns why else would owning a portion of a company be a good idea i.e. why would i pay for such a privilege buying shares of a company is a good idea if you believe and are correct that a company will make larger profits or capture more value e.g. buy and control more valuable stuff than other people believe if your beliefs do n't significantly differ from others then ideally the price of the companies stock should reflect all of the future value that everyone expects it to have tho that value is discounted based on time preference i.e. how much more valuable a given amount of money or a given thing of value is today versus some time in the future some notes on time preference but apart from whether you should buy shares in a specific company owning shares can still be valuable not only are shares a claim on a company 's current assets in the event of liquidation but they are also claims on all future assets of the company so if a company is growing then the value of shares now should reflect the discounted future value of the company not just the value of its assets today if shares in a company pays dividends then the company gives you money for owning shares you already understand why that 's worth something it 's basically equivalent to an annuity tho dividends are much more likely to stop or change whereas the whole point of an annuity is that it 's a sometimes fixed amount paid at fixed intervals i.e. reliable and dependable as cqm points out in their answer part of the value of stock shares to those that own them and especially to those considering buying them is the expectation or belief that they can sell those shares for a greater price than what they paid for them irrespective of the true value of the stock shares but even in a world where everyone magically had the same knowledge always a significant component of a stock 's value is independent of its value as a source of trading profit as jesse points out in their answer part of the value of stocks that do n't pay dividends relative to stocks that do is due to the potential differences in tax liabilities incurred between dividends and long term capital gains this however is not the primary source of value of a stock share

the nps is launched by the government of india with a lot of hope but it has not been taken off as it was expected due to some reasons though is working for the betterment of the product still there are disadvantages of the product which i feel are 1 the liquidity is an issue for nps if you are 30 years age and started investing for nps you need to wait for another 30 years for withdrawal of money 2 though there is option of partial withdrawal it 's not so easy during requirement 3 you need to invest in a government approved annuity fund which is mandatory 4 the 20 of the maturity amount is still taxable if you withdraw it lump sum so you should not invest in nps only for the tax saving purpose

the mortgages were pooled with other mortgages and sold off to other firms in theory mitigating the risk however the reason lenders searched out these types of deals was because they could use the lack of credit rating etc as an excuse to charge much higher interest rates    chase and most lenders made their money by borrowing their funds from some other institution and then lender it out to these borrowers so they were always looking for a large yield spread account executives made more money on sub prime because everyone made more money on those deals    that is of course until the pools hit a percentage rate of foreclosures forcing a buy back of the pool then all of the small time players like new century went bust when their investors called them to buy the pools of mortgages back

trusts are a way of holding assets with a specific goal in mind at its simplest a trust can be used to avoid probate a sometimes lengthy process in which a will is made public along with the assets a trust allows for fast transfer and no public disclosure depending on the current estate tax laws the death tax a trust can help preserve an estate exemption e.g. say the law reverts back to a $ 1 m exemption note this is $ 1 m per deceased person not per beneficiary my wife and i happened to have assets of exactly $ 2 m and i die tomorrow now she has $ 2 m and when she passes the estate has that $ 2 m and estate taxes are based on this total $ 1 m fully taxed but if we set up trusts that first million can be put into trust on my death the interest and some principal going to the surviving spouse each year but staying out of the survivor 's estate second spouse dies little or no tax due   this is known as a bypass trust another example is a trust say hypothetically my sister in law ca n't save a nickel to save her life spends every dime and then some so the best thing my mother in law can do to provide for her is to leave her estate in trust with specific instructions on how to distribute some percent each year this is not a tax dodge of any kind it 's strictly to protect the daughter from her own irresponsibility   a medical needs trust is a variant of the above it can provide income to a disabled person without impacting their government benefits adversely   this scratches the surface illustrating how trusts can be used there are more variation on this but i believe it covers the basics with the interest in this topic i 'm adding another issue where the trust can be useful in my article on my death please take a breath i described how an inherited ira was destroyed by ignorance the beneficiary fearing the stock market withdrew it all and was nailed by taxes he was on social security and no other income so by taking small withdrawals each year would have had nearly no tax due and could have avoided market risk by selling within the ira and buying treasuries or cds   he did n't need a trust of course just education the deceased his sister might have used a trust to manage the ira and enforce limited withdrawals mixing iras and trust is complex but the choice between a $ 2000 expense to create a trust or the $ 40 k tax bill he got is pretty clear to me he took pride in having sold out as the market soon tanked but he could have avoided the tax loss as well he was confusing the account in this case an ira but it could have been a 401(k or other retirement account with the investments it contained one can and should keep the ira in tact and simply adjust the allocation according to one 's comfort level   note inheritance tax laws change frequently and my answer above was an attempt to be generic the current 2014 code allows $ m to be left by one decedent with no estate tax

the default of the country will affect the country obligations and what 's tied to it if you have treasury bonds for example they 'll get hit if you have cash currency it will get hit if you 're invested in the stock market however it may plunge but will recover and in the long run you wo n't get hit if you 're invested in foreign countries through foreign currency or foreign stocks that you hold then the default of your local government may have less affect there if at all what you should not in my humble opinion be doing is digging holes in the ground or probably not exchange all your cash for gold although it is considered   a safe anchor in case of monetary crisis so may be worth considering some diversifying your portfolio with some gold splitting between banks might not make any difference at all because the value wo n't change unless you think that one of the banks will fail then just close the account there the bottom line is that the key is diversifying and you do n't have to be a seasoned investor for that i 'm sure there are mutual funds in greece just pick several different funds from several different companies that provide diversified investment and put your money there

after learning about things that happened in the flash crash i always use limit orders in an extremely rare instance if you place a market order when there is a some glitch for example some large trader adds a zero at the end of their volume you could get an awful price   if i want to buy at the market price i just set the limit about 1 above the market price if i want to sell i set the limit 1 below the market price i should point out that your trade is not executed at the limit price if your limit price on a buy order is higher than the lowest offer you still get filled at the lowest offer if before your order is submitted someone fills all offers up to your limit price you will get your limit price if someone perhaps by accident fills all orders up to twice your limit price you wo n't end up making the purchase i have executed many purchases this way and never been filled at my limit price

in a domestic setting letters of credit are often used to build public works needed to support a development   so if you 're a few 3 story buildings to build a 50 story tower the municipality will build appropriate water sewer gas road infrastructure and draw from the developer 's letter of credit to fund it the catch to the developer is that these things usually are n't once the city town etc starts work the developer can not cut off the funding even if the   project is cancelled a letter of credit definitely is n't a consumer financing vehicle the closest equivalent is a line of credit tied to an asset like a home

yes you totally get it i find the previous comment from the other to be the example of what is wrong with the perception of working with an it professional yes there are issues within this industry but there are in every industry yet the level of my employees receive from clients because they perceive us as an intrusion in their day is very draining we 're trying to help tapping your shoes and every 2 minutes that we 're not done yet does n't make the work go faster one of my employees was at by a manager of a client because their network was down new to us client and their previous internal person basically used duct tape to assemble their network we walked into a literal fire what the manager did n't realize is that his managers were n't agreeing to what we proposed and there were over 200 emails back and forth between the talking heads before they would finally agree to the work that needed to be done it was ridiculous   overall though i am glad i posted this it gave me some ideas that hopefully will be really good

generally speaking personal loans have higher rates than car loans   during fairly recent times the market for car loans has become very competitive   a local credit union offers loans as low as which is about half the prevailing mortgage rate   in comparison personal loans are typically in the 10 14 range    even if it made mathematical sense to do so i doubt any bank would give you a personal loan secured by a car rather than car loan   either the brain would not work that way or it would simply be against company policy these questions always interest me why the desire to maximize credit score   there is no correlation between credit score and wealth   there is no reward for anything beyond a sufficiently high score to obtain the lowest rates which is attained by simply paying one 's bills on time   one will always be limited by income when the amount able to borrow is calculated regardless of score    i can understand wanting to maximize different aspects of personal finance such as income or investment return percentage etc   by why credit score   this is further complicated by a evolving algorithm   attempts to game the score today may not work in the future

question are you saying that buying a call is better than buying a vertical spread regardless of fees or only because of fees if the former you are saying that buying a call and selling a vertical spread will always be profitable which effectively means you 're going short an out of the money call while that 's a good strategy it does n't guarantee profit and will lose money exactly when the vertical spread is a better strategy than buying the call outright the most direct answer to your question in comments if the stock goes down you lose less money with the vertical spread than you do with a simple call in return for this lower risk you give up gains if the stock goes above the higher calls strike price

yes you will need to deposit the funds into your hsa then withdraw them to reimburse yourself for the expenses the tax deduction comes when you contribute deposit to your hsa   if you do not deposit the money there you will not be able to claim the deduction   your hsa provider reports the amount of your contributions to the irs so the amount you say you contribute to your hsa on your tax return has to match what your hsa provider reports when you deposit the money to your hsa you need to explicitly tell your provider that the contribution is for tax year 2014   the reason is that you want to make sure that they report the amount of your 2014 contributions to the irs correctly after you 've deposited the amount into your hsa you can withdraw it to reimburse yourself for an eligible medical expense   in order to be eligible it needs to be an expense that was incurred while you had the hsa in place   if you had your hsa account in place before you paid the expense no problem   but if you set up the hsa account after you paid for the expense you might be out of luck the distribution withdrawal will be a part of tax year 2015 and you 'll see this amount included as part of the gross distributions on your 1099-sa form next year when i first set up my hsa i did n't have any extra money to fund the hsa so i handled it just like you are talking about   i would wait until i had a medical bill then deposit the amount i needed into my hsa and withdraw it back out to pay the bill

in the uk at least dealers definitely want you to take finance they get benefits from the bank which are not for doing this these benefits translate directly to increased commission and internal rewards for the individual salesman it 's conceivable that the salesman will be less inclined to put himself out for you in any way by your deal as much as you 'd like if he 's not going to get incentives out of it indeed since he 's taking a hit on his commission from you paying in cash it 's in his best interests to perhaps be with you during price negotiation so will the salesman be frustrated with you if you choose to pay in cash yes absolutely though this may manifest in different ways in some cases the dealer will offer to pay off the finance for you allowing you to pay directly in cash while the dealer still gets the bank referral reward so that everyone wins this is a behind the scenes secret in the industry which is not made public for obvious reasons it 's arguably on fraud if the salesman likes you and trusts you then you may be able to get such an arrangement if this does not seem likely to occur i would not go out of my way to disclose that i am planning to pay with cash that being said you 'll usually be asked very early on whether you are seeking to pay cash or credit the salesman wants to know for the reasons outlined above and there is little use lying about it when you 're shortly going to have to come clean anyway

has provided a good answer i 'm only addressing my comment about the data quality the portfolio optimization technique you employed is very sensitive to the inputs in particular it relies entirely on the mean and assumptions i.e. the first two moments and the results could change drastically with very small amount of change in the inputs to see that you can make up some inputs for the solver you have and try adjusting the inputs a little bit and see the results therefore if you decide to take this approach data quality is very crucial edit what i meant by data quality i have no experience with this website but this should be easy to spot check the answer is usually yes for liquid assets illiquid assets can often be priced at a level with no volume and the bid ask spread could be huge   should i close my eyes on the fact that these are n't perfectly priced in my currency and use another one such as the dollar you seem to have concern about data quality in at least the price quoted in your currency and are thinking about using data quoted in usd but would it be any better the law of one price tells us that there should n't be any discrepancy between prices in different currencies otherwise there would be arbitrage in addition when compared to traditional assets cryptocurrency price data has a shorter data history and with lower liquidity in the market the short history means you have less data to infer the characteristics of the price behavior low liquidity means the volatility may well be underestimated so we have an input sensitive technique combined with not so perfect data i would n't allocate my money solely based on the result of this exercise edit i have quite some reservation about doing portfolio optimization for cryptocurrency personally i 'm not a fan of the technique as is the optimization has an underlying assumption that returns follow a certain distribution and correlation is fixed i do n't know if you can make such assumption for cryptocurrencies from what i read about btc for example it seems to have a high risk exposure concerning chinese monetary policy for that kind of assets perhaps a fundamental analysis approach is a better one   also if you would like to learn more about portfolio optimization try quant se

each way you go is a little bit of a gamble    owning equity in the company is best in situations where you can trade and sell that equity or where the dilution of your royalty product would affect your returns or if you can maintain a certain equity stake without working at the company or if you can hold out on taking equity to reinvest profits for the purposes of growth    the royalty is best in situations where you 're getting a portion of the gross since you get paid as a creditor no matter how the company is performing or if you intend to collect royalties after you leave the company now for your situation if your royalties are fluctuating with profit instead of gross and your equity is tied to your continued partnership and not subject to potential growth then they 're pretty much both for the same thing you 've removed the particular advantages for each way of receiving payment if the company ever does buy out or go public how much of your additional x earning a month would you have to then re invest to get an equity stake   and for royalties if another developer came aboard or your company bought another company how much would this dilute your ip contribution so aside from the gambling nature of the issue i 'm not sure your tax calculation is right   you can take equity profit as dividend as long as you 're collecting a sufficient salary this prevents a business from declaring all profits as a dividend   this would put those profits into a different tax bracket 15 capital gains or if all profits are split you could take part as salary part as dividend   as well as someone who 's making active income off of their ip not passive income you 're supposed to file a schedule c not a schedule e so your royalties would include your self employment taxes   the schedule e is for royalties where the author is n't actively in the field or actually self employed in that area or if you own royalties on something you did n't create   should you keep the royalties then go to another job field or retire then your royalties could go on a schedule e.   now a tax advantage may exist on a schedule c if you can write off certain health and business expenses reducing your income that you ca n't on a schedule e though it 'd probably be difficult to write off more than the adjusted self employment cost savings of a schedule e.

you need to talk to your bank   if you 're unable to contact your bank until monday then wait until monday   do n't on the idea that the transaction may hard post on monday   if it happens it happens but it 's not the end of the world even if the transaction posts it 's not the end of the world   if the retailer is legit they will refund your money although it may take some time for things to get sorted out even if the transaction posts and the retailer is not legit it 's still not the end of the world   your bank may help you in trying to recover the funds   that 's why you need to talk to your bank as you have realized blindly calling the number in the email is not a good idea because if it 's fake you 're calling the scammers   instead what you should do is try to contact your bank through known trusted channels   that is look on your bank 's website   do they have a phone number listed for fraud reporting or related inquiries   is it the same number you see in the email   if so you can call it   if it is not the same number but the number on your bank 's website is a number you can call them at that number and tell them the situation based on what you 've described my own guess would be that the retailer is legit but that the unusual large transaction was flagged by your bank as potentially fraudulent which is why you got the email   the fact that you happened to get the email just after canceling the order could be a coincidence   this is especially true if all this happened in a short time   information about these transactions ca n't be transmitted and analyzed instantaneously nor can emails be sent instantaneously there may have been a delay in sending the email so it only arrived after the cancellation as far as your worries about how got your info it is likely a fraud detection service used by your bank   doing a bit of googling reveals that it appears to be a legit service but there have also been instances of phishing attacks using faked emails   however from what i see these worked by trying to get you to click on a link not call a phone number   also if a scammer is able to send you a scam email that includes your actual order details that 's not a it 's an outright hack   in that case the bank and/or retailer whichever was hacked would certainly want to know about it and would likely fall all over themselves trying to refund your money to avoid negative pr

i do n't think it really matters my understanding is that as a sole trader there is no distinction between your personal and business tax affairs the distinction between your personal and business account is mainly for your own personal benefit to make it easier to differentiate between wages and retained earnings if you want to maintain this distinction with regard to tax then you need to somehow differentiate between tax paid on your wage and tax paid on retained earnings you could then either make two payments or pay from either and transfer the difference from the other either way it 's just a matter of perspective rather than something with a physical difference

a closed end fund is a collective investment scheme that is closed to new investment once the fund starts operating   a typical open ended fund will allow you to buy more shares of the fund anytime you want and the fund will create those new shares for you and invest your new money to continue growing assets under management   a closed end fund only using the initial capital invested when the fund started operating and no new shares are typically created always exception in the financial community   normally you buy and sell an open end fund from the fund company directly   a closed end fund will usually be bought and sold on the secondary market here is some more information from wikipedia some characteristics that distinguish a closed end fund from an ordinary open end mutual fund are that another distinguishing feature of a closed end fund is the common use of leverage or gearing to enhance returns cefs can raise additional investment capital by issuing auction rate securities preferred shares long term debt and/or reverse repurchase agreements in doing so the fund hopes to earn a higher return with this excess invested capital

littleadv 's first comment check the note is really the answer but your issue is   every mortgage i 've had over 10 in my lifetime allows early principal payments the extra principal can only be applied at the same time as the regular payment think of it this way only at that moment is there no interest owed if a week later you try to pay toward only principal the system will not handle it pretty simple extra principal with the payment due in fact any mortgage i 've had that offered a monthly bill or coupon book will have that very line extra principal by coincidence i just did this for a mortgage on my rental i make these payments through my bank 's billpay service i noted the extra principal in the notes section of the virtual check but again the note will explicitly state if there 's an issue with prepayments of principal the larger issue is that your friend wishes to treat the mortgage like a bi weekly the bank expects the full amount as a payment and likely has no obligation to accept anything less than the full amount given my first comment above here is the plan for your friend to do 99 of what she wishes tell her there 's nothing magic about bi weekly it 's a budget clever way to send the money but over a year it 's simply paying 108 of the normal payment if she wants to burn the mortgage faster tell her to add what she wishes every month even $ 10 it all adds up   final note there are two schools of thought to either extreme a pay the mortgage off as fast as you can no debt is the goal and b the mortgage is the lowest rate you 'll ever have on borrowed money pay it as slow as you can and invest any extra money i accept and respect both views for your friend and first group i 'm compelled to add be sure to deposit to your retirement account 's matched funds to gain the entire match $ 1 can pay toward your 6 mortgage or be doubled on deposit to $ 2 in your 401(k if available and pay off all high interest debt first this should stand to reason but i 've seen people keep their 18 card debt while prepaying their mortgage

what would be the best strategy to avoid paying income taxes on the    sale after i move to another us state leaving the us and terminating your us residency before the sale closes otherwise consider checking your home country 's tax treaty with the us in any case for proper tax planning you should employ a licensed tax adviser an ea cpa or an attorney licensed in your state the one you 'd be when the sale closes no one else is legally allowed to provide you tax advice on the matter because the company abroad is i have control over when    and e.g. in how many chunks the earnings of the sale flow into my    llc so i can plan where i live when that money hits my us account i 'm not familiar with the term in this context but form what i understand your description its a shell corporation under your own control this means that the transfer of money between the corporation and your llc is of no consequence you constructively received the money when the corporation got it not the llc your fundamental misunderstanding is that there 's importance to when the money hits your us bank account this is irrelevant the us taxes your worldwide income so it is taxed when you earn it not when you transfer it into the country as opposed to some other countries for example india or the uk as such in your current scheme it seems to me that you 're breaking the us tax law this is my personal impression of course get a professional advice from a licensed tax professional as i defined earlier

judging from your comments you seem to be confused about the way banking works   banks can only lend out money that they actually have whether from deposits or investors or loans taken from other banks government entities   the rules on how this works varies from country to country but the principle is always the same   there is no magic money let 's imagine a closed system   there 's only one town and that town only has one bank   there are 100 people total in town and each has $ 10,000   everyone deposits all of their money in the bank the bank now has $ 1,000,000 in total deposits   you take a loan for $ 100,000 and buy a house   the bank now has $ 900,000   you make your payments of $ per month $ 833 of interest and $ 132 toward principal   in this ideal world the bank has no costs associated with doing business   after one month the bank has $ 1,000,000 in deposits $ in cash on hand $ in loans and $ 833 in profit from interest now here 's the confusing part   you bought a house from someone   that person also lives in town   he takes the $ 100,000 you gave him and deposits it in the bank   the bank now has $ in deposits $ in cash $ in loans and $ 833 in profit assume 10 more people buy houses at $ 100,000 each taking loans for that whole amount for the same terms you did   assume those sellers then deposit the money back in the bank   the bank now has $ in deposits $ in cash $ in loans and $ 833 in profit   the bank is taking in $ per month $ x 11 in loan payments making profit of $ $ 833 x 11 per month from interest this process of loans and deposits and payments can go on forever without any outside influence   this is the primary way money is created   it 's like printing money without the paper of course we 're not in a closed system   banks are limited in endlessly creating money primarily by two things reserve requirements are set by government agencies   they might say banks can lend until their cash on hand or liquid equivalent is at minimum 35 of total deposits   so a bank with $ 1,000,000 in deposits would have to keep $ 350,000 in cash at any given time capital requirements work largely the same way   it 's more the bank saying what happens if a bunch of people want their deposits back   they plan a reasonable amount of cash to have on hand for that scenario

gt no the main difference is dividends do n't take shares out of the marketplace to artificially inflate a quarters eps because buyback decreases shares outstanding it also decreases the company 's total future dividend payouts as well   you have no idea what you are talking about   buybacks are almost exclusively better for shareholders than dividends because they can be taxed at the long term capital gains rate whereas dividends are subject to a higher tax rate   the fact that corporate buybacks have increased so much lately at the expense of dividends is a sign of good management by insiders

fiduciary they are obligated by the rules of the exchanges they are listed with furthermore there is a strong chance that people running the company also have stock so it personally benefits them to create higher prices finally maybe they do n't care about the prices directly but by being a good company with a good product or service they are desirable and that is expressed as a higher stock price   not every action is because it will raise the stock price but because it is good for business which happens to make the stock more valuable

$ 100 k of mortgage debt at 4 30 years will result in a $ mortgage it would take about $ 23 k in income to have 25 of the monthly income cover the mortgage   this means that with no other large debts a bank will lend you about 4x your income   if instead of 25 we decided that having 20 of income go to the mortgage the ratio drops to just over   in the end it comes down to keshlam 's advice regarding a budget i think the question ca n't be answered as asked given the fact that you offer no numbers for the average person credit card debt student loans and cars payments add up to enough to chip away at the amount the bank will lend you since per one of the linked questions the maximum debt service should be 36 you start with that and subtract all current payments   if this does n't suffice let us know what exactly you 're looking for

a junk bond is broadly a bond with a non negligible risk of default   bond ought to be defined elsewhere but broadly it 's a financial instrument you buy from a company or government where they promise to pay you back the principal and some interest over time on a particular schedule the name junk is a bit exaggerated many of them are issued by respectable and reasonably stable businesses junk bonds were required to do large leveraged buyouts   this means the company issued fairly risky fairly high yield debt to buy out equity holders   they have to pay a high rate on the debt because the company 's now fairly highly geared ie has a lot of debt relative to its value and it may have to pay out a large fraction of its earnings as interest what is a junk bond and how does it differ from a regular bond   it 's only a matter of degree and nomenclature   a bond that has a credit rating below a particular level eg s&p is called junk or more politely non investment grade or speculative   it 's possible for an existing bond to be reclassified from one side to another or for a single issuer to have different series some of which are more risky than others   the higher the perceived risk the more interest the bond must pay offer in order to attract lenders why is there higher risk chance of default well why would a company be considered at higher risk of failing to repay its debt   basically it comes down to doubt about the company 's future earnings being sufficient to repay its debt which could be for example

context assessed project as part of a tech internship in an investment bank working in small groups task to design an app using a financial solution that has an ethical impact   we came up with what i hope is the smart sounding idea of an app for impoverished farmers in developing countries who lack the information and market access that larger or farmers would have the app would use some kind of decision tree which may grow with machine learning to assess the best kind of crops to grow given the region and local conditions for max profitability and would provide access to some kind of derivatives market and insurance allowing the farmers a consistent income   struggling with the specifics of how the business finance side of things would work let 's assume the bank builds the app and puts it on the app store as part of some charitable initiative 1 would the farmers go directly to the bank to price and purchase derivatives on their crops 2 options futures forwards which is most appropriate or would it make sense to offer all three 3 is there any way this could be adjusted to provide regular payments with a lump sum at the end would this be something the bank chooses to do or is there an existing financial instrument for this kind of setup 4 how does this tie in with the commodities markets or is that what the derivatives already are 5 probably a long shot but any chance of know your customer implementations for countries with terrible infrastructure   6 probably a dumb question say the farmer sells an option on his crops would this be sold directly to the bank or a 3rd party who 'd be more interested in actually buying the crop or is this a far too simplistic view basically who would the farmer actually deliver the crops to 7 any other issues any ideas to make this sound somewhat viable   it does n't have to strictly be realistic in any sense but it also ca n't be flat out incorrect   in advance edited to make questions clearer

square charges a 2.75 fee which the merchant pays so you would be losing money if you only got a 1.5 cashback bonus i would guess that the real reason square prohibits you from getting cash is because of visa mc state and federal regulations   visa mc probably prohibit it for regular merchants due primarily to laws that are designed to prevent money laundering certain merchants like casinos are allowed to give you cash advances against a credit card but regular merchants are not allowed to do this it is much more difficult to get visa mc to approve merchants to handle cash advances and they are subject to many additional regulations   services like western union will let you send cash with a regular credit card but they are classified as money and must comply with additional state and federal regulations if square were to allow cash advances this would likely subject them to a bunch of additional regulations   it would cost them more to comply with these regulations and is outside their business model so they simply prohibit it

the fed rate is so important because it sets a cost on lending institutions banks credit unions it is the rate of interest that a bank gets by loaning its cash overnight to the fed presumably the fed then loans the cash to other institutions around the world   the banks loan money to individuals at a higher rate savers get a rate between what the fed gives and what the bank gets when times are tough the fed will lower their rate to try to increase the lending that banks do this is called easing   the overnight rate is very low right now that means that the fed can not lower rates to try to stimulate the economy so to enable the fed to do its voodoo they have to raise rates so that later they can lower them if needed

americans are snapping like crazy and not only americans i know a lot of people from out of country are snapping as well similarly to your australian friend the market is crazy hot i 'm not familiar with cleveland but i am familiar with phoenix the prices are up at least 20 30 from what they were a couple of years ago and the trend is not changing however these are not something everyone can buy it is very hard to get these properties financed i found it impossible as mentioned i bought in phoenix that means you have to pay cash not everyone has tens or hundreds of thousands of dollars in cash available for a real estate investment for many americans 30 60 k needed to buy a property in these markets is an amount they can not afford to invest even if they have it at hand also keep in mind that investing in rental property requires being able to support it pay taxes and expenses even if it is not rented pay to property managers utility bills gardeners and plumbers insurance and property taxes all these can amount to quite a lot so its not just the initial investment many times advertised rents are not the actual rents paid if he indeed has it rented at $ 900 then its good but if he was told hey buy it and you 'll be able to rent it out at $ 900 would n't count on that i know many foreigners who fell in these traps do your market research and see what the costs are at these neighborhoods keep in mind that these are distressed neighborhoods with a lot of foreclosed houses and a lot of unemployment it is likely that there are houses empty as people are moving out being out of job it may be tough to find a renter and the renters you find may not be able to pay the rent but all that said yes those who can are snapping

first thing to know about investing is that you make money by taking risks that means the possibility of losing money as well as making it   there are low risk investments that pretty much always pay out but they do n't earn much making $ 200 a month on $ 10,000 is about 26 per year   that 's vastly more than you are going to earn on low risk assets if you want that kind of return you can invest in a diversified portfolio of equities through an equity index fund   some years you may make 26 or more   other years you may make nothing or lose that much or more   on average you may earn maybe hopefully overall investing is a game of making money over long horizons   it 's very useful for putting away your $ 10k now and having hopefully more than that when it comes time to buy a house or retire or something some years into the future   you have to accept that you might also end up with less than $ 10 k in the end but you are more likely to make money than to use it what you describe does n't seem like a possible situation   in developed markets you ca n't reliably expect anything close to the return you desire from assets that are unlikely to lose you money   it might be time to re evaluate your financial goals   do you want spending money now or do you want to invest for use down the road

the principal of the contribution can definitely be withdrawn tax free and penalty free however there is a section that makes me think that the earnings part may be subject to penalty in addition to tax in publication under traditional iras > when can you withdraw or use assets > contributions returned before due date of return > early distributions tax it says the 10 additional tax on distributions made before you reach age 59½    does not apply to these tax free withdrawals of your contributions    however the distribution of interest or other income must be reported    on form 5329 and unless the distribution qualifies as an exception to    the age 59½ rule it will be subject to this tax this section is only specifically about the return of contributions before the due date of return not a general withdrawal as you can see from the first sentence that the penalty does n't apply to contributions which would n't be true of general withdrawals therefore the second sentence must be about the earnings part of the withdrawal that you must make together with the contribution part as part of the return of contributions before the due date of the return if the penalty it is talking about is only about other types of withdrawals and does n't apply to the earnings part of the return of contribution before the due date of the return then this sentence would n't make sense as it 's in a part that 's only about return of contribution before the due date of the return

you should really be talking to a tax adviser ea cpa licensed in your state about taxes and to a lawyer about the liability protection you wo n't find answers from neither of theses here besides the liability protection how do these 2 options affect taxes there 's no liability protection difference between the two talk to a lawyer to verify since you 'll be cosigning them personally either way in the first case loan to the llc everything goes on the 1065 and you get the bottom line on k-1 which transfers to you own tax return in the second case the loan interest is your personal investment expense schedule a deduction while the loan proceeds you moved to the llc add to your basis i 'd suggest getting the loan directly in the llc name if you can however the lawyers seem to agree that this would void the mortgage    because of the due on sale clause in mortgage loans due on sale may or may not be but that 's a risk you 'd be taking yes llc is a separate legal entity as opposed to a living trust to which your second quote seems to be referring so it is definitely a possibility for a lender to call on the loan if you re title it

in principle the us taxes both income and gifts simply thinking good thoughts is not necessarily sufficient to avoid filing or payment obligations giving somebody money with no repayment date no interest and no enforceable note looks an awful lot like either income or a gift a loan normally has interest money sitting in a savings account is insured and other investments generally have an expected return   why would somebody give a loan with no interest with only flexible or informal payment expectations in a way where it has neither deposit insurance nor any expectation of net returns   that looks a lot like a gift at the very least a gift of the time value and the default risk the irs definitely polices loan rates the latest release is revenue ruling 2014 13 the is useful for tax concepts such as original issue discount when issuers sell low interest or no interest bonds or loans at less than face value attempting to recharacterize interest income as return of principal various grantor trusts e.g. and so forth   it 's a simple way for the irs to link to market rates of interest documentation and sufficient interest as well as clear payment schedule and maybe call or demand rights make it a bona fide loan   there is no real way for the irs to distinguish between an informal arrangement and a post hoc lie to conceal a gift   moreover an undocumented loan is generally difficult to enforce so it looks less like a true loan the lender declares the interest payments as income on his form 1040 line and if necessary schedule b.

in 2001 argentina defaulted on it 's debt and started negotiating a haircut with it 's debtors as a result a lot of the debtors sold the bonds they had a fire sale prices thinking better get some back than nothing   one of the guys that bought those cheap bonds was paul singer aka mr. vulture hedge fund i 'll speculate here saying that mr. singer saw that the bond conditions gave him a way to force argentina to pay the full value of the bonds notwithstanding it 's default or negotiated haircut argentina did negotiate a haircut with about 97 of it 's bond holders this meant that although they would lose out on some of the money they would still get some back and argentina could work its way back to its feet eventually    mr. singer and friends were the 3 that did not accept the haircut and took the country to court to get 100 of the bond value back   now the plot i do n't understand if mr. singer knew this or not but the bonds also had a condition that said that no bond holder would be worst off than the highest bond deal argentina offered anyone which basically means if they pay mr. singer 100 they have to pay everybody else 100 now it was well established that argentina could not pay 100 and is not able to pay 100 of the debt hence the 2001 default    meanwhile argentina was paying out the hair cut bonds but holding out on mr. singer and friends as they still did n't agree to pay 100 the courts ruled that they could not do this and had to pay everybody since argentina can not pay everybody 100 it is defaulting on the debt

fico 08 a newer fico formula that many lenders are simultaneously switching to now ignores artificially credit history score by so do n't feel left out in that regard   average age of accounts is affected when closed accounts fall off your credit report which can take 7 years not just by closing them but i 'm not familiar with the latest weightings of these things so its tough to say how significant it will be when that happens there are also newer fico formulas that may become relevant 7 years from now so it is definitely something to be conscious of but they are n't immediately consequential since you can do other things to improve your credit worthiness in the near term

absolutely do not pay off the car if you are n't planning to keep it   the amount of equity that you have from a trade in vehicle will always be a variable when negotiating a new car purchase   by applying cash a hard asset to increase your equity you are trading a fixed amount for an unknown variable amount   you are also moving from a position of more certainty for a position of less certainty   you gain nothing by paying off the car whereas the dealer can negotiate away a larger piece of the equity in the vehicle

i know your pain oh so much   i literally have a 14 gallon container full of i have received   even worse for profit fundraising companies send most of those mailings they take the money and deduct their expenses rigged to consume all your gift   some companies have been caught passing as little as 9 to the charity   first let 's talk about a few issues   authentication   is that outfit really a tax deductible charity    address    is this their genuine address or is it the dropbox of a scammer or one of those evil for profit fundraising companies   acknowledgement    for gifts over a certain size you need a thank you letter from them to show the irs that you really donated   will you get it   the limit is $ 250 no letter deduction rejected but as a practical thing it helps in an audit to show as many donation letters as possible   charities can not issue them retroactively but can issue you second copies of ones they sent previously if the charity drops the ball you lose   obviously enough you go to the post office and spend $ 1 on a money order      this does not authenticate them as a charity it does not assure it goes to their real address   you can do both these things yourself by checking their data on the irs website or on you do n't get an acknowledgement   i mention these because donation websites work much the same way require a higher one time commitment but are much simpler and more efficient after that if you are planning to give $ 5000 in a single year save it up and open a donor advised fund account   a daf is itself a charity    you donate to the daf and take the tax deduction for charitable   then you tell the daf to donate it to other charities on your behalf or anonymously    their concept is you use the daf as a buffer so you can easily make the tax deductible donation when you need to for tax purposes then at your leisure research charities and support them   however i asked my daf most people donate and then immediately re donate the money leaving the fund at zero balance   my daf does n't mind that at all and they charge zero fees for this    its expenses are paid by those of us who leave money sitting around in the daf   mine charges 0.6 a year   this money can be invested sort of like in a 401 k and each investment also has an expense ratio such as 0.18 a year in my chosen index fund   websites like will take any amount of your money and re donate it to the charity you select    they deduct 3 5 for their expenses notably paper stamps and the 2 3 it costs them to process your credit card

401 k accounts both regular and roth generally have loans available there are maximum amounts that are based on federal limits and your balance in the program these rules also determine the amount of time you have to repay the loan and what happens if you quit or are fired while the loan is outstanding in these loan programs the loan comes from your 401 k funds regarding matching funds this plan is not atypical some match right away some make you wait some put in x percent regardless of what you contribute some make you opt out others make you opt in some will direct their automatic amounts to a specific fund unless you tell them otherwise   the big plus for the fund you describe is the immediate vesting some companies will match your investments but then only partially vest the funds they do n't want to put a bunch of matching funds into your account and then have you leave   so they say that if you leave before 5 years is up they will not let you keep all the funds if you leave after 2 years you keep 25 if you leave after 3 years you keep 50 the fact they immediately vest is a very generous plan

the irs provides a little more information on the subject on this faq will i be charged interest and penalties for filing and paying my taxes late if you did not pay your tax on time you will generally have to pay a late payment penalty which is also called a failure to pay penalty some guidance on what constitutes reasonable cause is found on the irs page penalty relief due to reasonable cause the irs will consider any sound reason for failing to file a tax return make a deposit or pay tax when due sound reasons if established include note a lack of funds in and of itself is not reasonable cause for failure to file or pay on time however the reasons for the lack of funds may meet reasonable cause criteria for the failure to pay penalty in this article from u.s. news and world report it is suggested that the irs will generally waive the penalty one time if you have a clean tax history and ask for the penalty to be waived   it is definitely worth asking them to waive the penalty

how do i determine what to pay the person you pay them either what you believe the work is worth to have done for you vs doing it yourself or how much they ask for after negotiation there 's no rule of thumb because it 's driven by the market   there will always be people who are willing and able to do the work for less than you but ca n't always get work which is the reason they are charging less just as there will always be people who charge much more than you and have to turn work away you are at a comfortable medium where you have enough work to charge a moderate rate and can amplify your reputation network client by the work out as an example if i charge $ to do engineering work but i want to subcontract it out then i have to take into account that so let 's say i have a contract for 20 hours of work at $ $ 2,400 and i figure that i can subcontract out all of it   however it 's going to cost me about 4 hours of work to review their 20 hours of work deal with administrative overhead interpret and pass along requirements etc so if i work 4 hours then the maximum i can pay the contractor for 20 hours of work is the remaining 16 hours x $ 120 the contractor would be doing 20 hours for $ to break even on cash and i only make worth of profit for 4 hours worth of work   that 's actually a net loss unless you can already fill those other 16 hours with paying work i do n't think that would be worth it but if the contractor only required $ then you 're paying him $ 1,200 for 20 hours of work and you get to keep $ 1,200 for only 4 hours of your time   the subcontractor has turned your $ rate into $ now you still only net $ 1,200 rather than the full $ 2,400 so your revenue is down but if you can find work for that other 16 hours at your normal rate then you 're still ahead   alternately you might find that working only 12 hours a week is a fine way to live and choose to forgo that revenue for personal time the costs and break even point vary greatly from situation to situation but hopefully this gives you a framework to evaluate the decision for yourself

an experienced individual would n't ask such questions   i do n't say this to take a at you but to provide context   the matter is much more complicated than a simple answer to your question could accomplish the short answer is no not necessarily but it depends on the details generally if the employer matches it 's suggested that you take advantage of the match   it 's free money   that said it comes with some strings attached like a vesting schedule   it 's not yours right away necessarily   choices are limited in a 401k but we should still come out ahead with that free money the investment choices available in a 401k are also a part of the details   if they meet your needs you should certainly consider the 401k even if the employer does n't match there is also the matter of one 's particular tax situation which is certainly an involved matter   a 401k can certainly be a part of judicious tax planning   it 's a matter of working out the details continuing this theme of details and coming back to the employer match if the employer does n't i would make sure that i 'm maxing out an ira before considering the 401k   if the employer matched i would probably contribute to take advantage of that match   however it quickly becomes complicated here   i 'm accustomed to employer matching up to some percentage of pay which typically works out to be less then the contribution limits for a 401k   so i my plan for such a situation is to contribute up to the employer match in the 401k then max out an ira and then return to the 401k to finish contributing up to its yearly maximum there is plenty for you to consider in order to come up with a plan of action   while it 's certainly complicated it 's accessible to most people   you do n't have to be a genius   in fact are regularly by the markets

while there are lots of really plausible explanations for why the market moves a certain way on a certain day no one really knows for sure   in order to do that you would need to understand the minds of all the market players   these days many of these players are secret proprietary algorithms   i 'm not with the specifics of these explanations i have no better just pointing out that these are just really and if the market starts following different patterns they will be tossed into the dust bin of old thinking i think the best thing you can explain to your son is that the stock market is basically a gigantic highly complex poker game   the daily gyrations of the market are about individuals trying to predict where the herd is going to go next and then after that and then after that etc if you want to help him understand the market i suggest two things   the first is to find or create a simple market game and play it with him   the other would be to teach him about how bonds are priced and why prices move the way they do   i know this might sound weird and most people think bonds are esoteric but there are bonds have a much simpler pricing model based on fundamental financial logic   it 's much easier then to get your head around the moves of the bond markets because the part of the price based on beliefs is much more limited i.e. will the company be able pay where are rates going   once you have that understanding you can start thinking about the different ways stocks can be valued there are many and what the market movements mean about how people are valuing different companies with regard to this specific situation here 's a different take on it from the priced in explanation which is n't really different but might make more sense to your son pretend for a second that at some point these stocks did move seasonally   in the late fall and winter when sales went up the stock price increased in kind   so some smart people see this happening every year and realize that if they bought these stocks in the summer they would get them cheap and then sell them off when they go up   more and more people are doing this and making easy money   so many people are doing it that the stock starts to rise in the summer now   people now see that if they want to get in before everyone else they need to buy earlier in the spring   now the prices start rising in the spring   people start buying in the beginning of the year you can see where this is going right   essentially a strategy to take advantage of well known seasonal patterns is unstable   you ca n't profit off of the seasonal changes unless everyone else in the market is too stupid to see that you are simply anticipating their moves and react accordingly

but i think another interesting to this which is relevant at this time is that the orchard wildfire is n't the only thing that can make money disappear   the use of a currency rather than a transferable note means that it can be an independent store of value so there are perverse outcomes that can happen that ca n't happen with ious   so say some particularly wealthy person in the village starts to hoard his money and corners a large fraction of the money supply say he 's anticipating some horrible plague   the number of loddars decreases and the orchard owner starts paying his workers fewer loddars as a result   but their debts are denominated in old loddars which were easier to come by and quickly the workers are unable to pay their debts or have to spend all their money on their debts and have none for anything else   they default on those debts and the money disappears but it does n't disappear for any physical reason the workers are doing the same amount of work it disappears because of a shock to the monetary supply   this is a demand shock versus the supply shock of an orchard catching on fire

others have mentioned the term fiduciary but have n't really gone in to what that is despite the name financial advisor there is no legal in the us mandate as to what that means   often times a financial advisor is little more than a sales rep whose job it is to sell particular financial instruments   these people will give you good generic advice such as make sure you have a nest egg and do n't spend more than you make   however when the rubber hits the road in terms of how to save they will often recommend insist pressure a particular asset security which does n't necessarily meet your risk reward preference tolerance   often times the assets they pitch have high fees   these people wo n't charge you for their time because their time is a loss leader for the commissions they make on selling their products in contrast a fiduciary 's job responsibility is to look out for your interests   they should n't receive any kind of payment based on what assets you buy   this means that you have to pay them for their time the napfa website seems to have good ideas on choosing an advisor

theoretically when a company issues more shares it does not affect the value of your shares   the reason is that when a company issues and sells more shares the proceeds from the sale of those shares goes back into the company using your example you have 10 out of 100 shares of the company for a 10 stake   let 's say that the shares are valued at $ 1,000 each meaning that the market value of the company is $ 100,000 and your stake is worth $ 10,000 now the company issues 100 more shares at $ 1,000 each   the company receives $ 100,000 from new investors and now the company is worth $ 200,000   your stake is now only 5 of the company but it is still worth $ 10,000 the authorized share capital is the amount of shares that a company has already planned on selling   when you buy stock in a company you can look up how many shares exist so you know what your percent stake in the company is   when a company wants to sell more shares this is called an increase of authorized share capital   in order to do this the company generally needs the approval of a majority of the existing shareholders

the banks countrywide was the worst about this failed to uphold lending standards when they were giving out mortgages because it was n't in their self interest   is there such thing as lending standards as in by law or by regulations not ethics   as far as i know the major regulations banks have to follow are the capital ratio requirements basel i ii and the min 4 leverage ratio i 'm assuming the banks kept to the ratios by keeping illiquid loans off their balance sheet   gt;after the banks would give someone a mortgage the banks would make their fees off the mortgage and then bundle these mortgages into securities the banks then had these sub prime mortgages that are now bundled together as securities    from my understanding the bank did originate the loan and they will assign this loan to a trust fund who will the loans into cdos or mortgage backed securities i have 2 questions from this   1 what is wrong with this and   2 if it is unethical or greedy what can be done to solve this stop them from these loans would n't that destroy the reinsurance market   gt;then s&amp;p and other ratings agencies gave them aaa ratings despite nearly everyone in the industry knowing they were time bombs waiting to go off goldman sachs and everyone else knew what was going on but they did n't want to get stuck holding the bag per se so they committed fraud by knowingly misleading their clients to buy these securities   so the responsibility lies more with these guys then goldman sachs were the ones committing fraud and now the sec is going after fannie and freddie the banks did n't break any laws or regulations

it 's not unusual undesirable if everyone prepaid their mortgage banks would not like this but we 're in no danger of that also the amount you are pre paying is not so significant as to make them pay special attention in many cases when a borrower pre pays they will not continue to do so over the life of the loan since it 's so easy to stop at any time and the extra payments are voluntary depending on who originated the it might be sold even more often than in your case it 's no longer commonplace for a bank to hold a mortgage to maturity now that banks and other institutions have separated the origination of the loan from its servicing it 's likely that your mortgage was bundled with others through a process called securitization and will be bought sold based on the bank 's need for or to balance out the maturity of its assets and liabilities whether they need more cash now versus later or based on the types of ways your bank has decided that it wants to make money versus farming out other types of business to others what would substantially change the value of your mortgage to a bank is if it were performing ie you are paying on time but then became non performing ie you fall behind in your payments it 's also possible that if you have a very small mortgage or principal balance that there is very little risk to the bank and little difference between the present and future values of your loan but banks do n't typically make these types of transactions based on the characteristics of an individual loan

i had a chat with a coworker whose spouse also teaches music lessons one interesting insight was that after raising prices the children were much more likely to come prepared because the parents felt more invested when it cost them more they were also less likely to cancel the lessons at the last minute this is an argument in favor of 's suggestion to charge something even if we donate the income to charity along those lines it might also make sense to give discounts if the child comes prepared having practiced daily   i agree that it 's not a lot of paperwork for some additional pay the problem is that i would also be tempted to buy a new piano and find other expenses to reduce the income that 's a discussion for another day   i think the break even point is probably somewhere around $ when i weigh record keeping time verses the income so as long as we exceed that i will probably encourage her to charge for the lessons even if she charges below the market for them i will consider setting up a charitable giving account that they can pay to instead of paying us directly

the essence of your question is whether it 's worth 1000 to you to spread the payments over half a year   the longer payment plan is just a loan and buying the loan costs you more money   the question is whether you think the loan is a good price   i suspect it 's over priced the classic financial analysis would be whether you could get a better return on the loan opportunity costs   but we are talking about what are presumably not terribly big sums of money so it may make more sense to analyze this amount of money in more personalized terms   in that case remember to consider the convenience is it significantly easier to budget with the 6-month plan   watch out for other costs to the loan such as late penalties and other loan fees if you find the periodic payments convenient or you have a short horizon high yield investment then the 6-month loan might work   otherwise if you can afford it it makes more sense to buy the phone upfront

running a sandwich shop and say a software consulting service are quite different things   i had two employees at one point following the kind of thinking in the article   but i found what that meant was that i had to spend more time being a manager and salesperson and much less time doing the work i enjoyed   to make it viable i would have had to scale up to the point where i had at least one salesperson and maybe a manager which would have required more income producing staff to support them   instead i scaled back to just myself and have been very happy with that decision   the article also what can be made in consulting or it contracting   rates well above $ 100/hr are common for people with expertise as opposed to commodity providers and billing at least 40 hours a week is not usually a problem   it 's certainly true that a one man operation is much more likely to put a ceiling on your earnings but a that ceiling can be a lot higher than the article suggests and b depending on the business breaking that ceiling and earning much more is certainly possible in some businesses for example where you have the opportunity to sell your work in product form rather than hourly

first you need to understand how modern insurance companies operate on the front end they write contracts with customers collecting up front premiums and promising to pay out to cover future losses efficient premiums cover exactly what 's paid out if you charge too much customers leave for competition and if you charge too little the company goes under or at least loses money large armies of people are employed to accurately guess future risks hopefully to the point of certainty you have in human mortality   so over time they will pay back those premiums and there 's a constant stream of new premiums coming in to replace money going out so there 's this effective pool of money they can use to buffer against large losses with it 's called float and when the pool of money remains relatively constant they can invest it longer term than the people who comprise the underlying risk large insurance companies like berkshire hathaway function in this manner it 's where warren buffet finds capital to invest while hiding from wall st in nebraska the way these companies profit is by making sure the equation works   profits = premiums payouts + return on float payouts could be just payments for insured risk but they could also be for the whole life insurance you 're running across from time to time these contracts offer the insured the chance to invest their money with the people who invest the float and as long as the return on float is greater than the return they 're offering it 's still profitable for the company since this guarantees suboptimal returns for you it 's usually a good idea to buy term insurance much cheaper and invest the difference yourself

some years ago a call center operator told me a bit more than they probably should have   they like to see a lot of money go through the card but very little staying on the card yes they make money on the interest but one card defaulting blows away the profit on a lot of other cards the 3 take from the merchants is both reliable and up front not 6 months down the line when and if you pay the interest so if you want to make your credit card company happy pay your bills in full every month i have credit far beyond my actual means because i run work expenses on my personal card i was told they did n't care and had already guessed that it was n't my money the point was i was handling things in a way they liked not quite at palladium status but cards with $ 200 annual fees are mine for the asking and i have n't paid interest since the early 1990 's

i dislike shopping for some stuff from amazon because they actually suck at a lot of key e commerce things   their search is pretty bad for some stuff   computer parts for example   the pricing shipping here are 82 sellers some of which count towards the buy $ 25 and get free postage and some that do n't   this is especially bad for things like books where used is just as good in most cases   free shipping   you have massive warehouses in my home town   you can ship any of these items same day if i pay 12 bucks for the privilege   do n't tell me you ca n't get it to me in less than 10 days if i select free shipping   the constant are you really really really sure you do n't want prime   seeming random pricing   i like and it 's worthwhile to order 3 or 4 volumes at a time to get to the free shipping tier   but you 'll have volume 11 $ 9.75 volume 12 $ volume 13 $ 9.75   other vendors comes to mind seem to at least have consistent across the board pricing and discounts

i think with your background you would be well suited to equity research in oil biotech or pharma   not an area i know well but people who have greater understanding of the company 's business are valuable in that field when combined with finance knowledge   by your questions i would definitely advise some more investigation into finance and your motivations for getting into it   what do you want out of finance   how does the field match up with your life goals and your personal values   read some on wall street oasis and some of mergers and if you have n't already   sorry for the unwanted advice rant   just see lots of people attracted to money prestige or perceived of finance without thinking about whether it 's really what they want

i would n't go quite that far     it 's formatted and not written i 'll give you that   i 'd guess it 's written by someone who believes they they have a flair for and the dramatic and writes as they would talk   assume amy hoy is a slightly awkward gal at you and this all seems a little more tolerable     but i find her points somewhat solid     i think she 's presenting from a ideological standpoint where safety and security are paramount and the risk associated with startups is too much risk   but i think the point that s he 's making about the poisonous rhetoric associated with glorious death and working for a startup being very similar is well thought out and quite an interesting perspective   i go to a school whose idea of business is entrepreneurship   i left their business program because my career goals simply can not be sustained by entrepreneurship until a very long while into my career and i found the here 's how to have a startup focus of the bulk of the courses essentially valueless to me where i am now     having seen what the author refers to as the of successful startups great word by the by i can not help but those courses and the ways we were sold on this ideology     much was made about how much money was made by successful startups   much was made of the independence the power the glory of winning the startup lotto and making it big   the guys that did it young were and lauded as the greatest of our generation     no mention was made of the failures   no mention was made of the failure rate   no mention was made of the costs associated with failure   no mention was made of the people who got fucked as these entrepreneurial saints made their fortunes     further the ones that got the most attention were the ones who went back and did it a few more times   anyone clever who won big and cashed out and quit while ahead was mentioned as a success but their retirement or cashing out went   some sort of shameful detail maybe     the guys that won big and went back and tried again were praised for their determination and   if they set themselves back to square one betting on an unsuccessful attempt that was     vcs were praised as the greatest thing that happened to entrepreneurship   we were given no real warnings about hey those contracts can be kinda shady sometimes or they want a big cut yo instead they were the grease to our machine   it was a money making machine   a machine of winners   of the great men and women of our generation   of everything that is good about western society     and we are letting our generation down if we do n't play     seriously     i had a prof tear a strip off a kid for asking something along the lines of but what 's wrong with working for a company that already exists and can pay a steady wage   the prof got started in on how our generation is and just fall into things and accomplish little on our own   he moved into how it 's merely riding someone else 's and it 's not really achieving anything for yourself   the tl;dr of what was a fifteen minute in class of a student who asked what i thought was a reasonable question was if you 're not signing your own you are a huge failure and are contributing nothing of note to society or it 's progress     this particular rant pretty much sealed my withdrawal from the business aspect of my school   if my very goals render me a huge failure in my profs eyes i 'm not interested in what they have to say or in contributing to their employment at the university     but off that somewhat personal tangent the culture of glory of the startup that amy hoy somewhat complains about in her article certainly exists   in the form she 's complaining about     your rebuttal makes sense too it 's not that vc are or are n't a risk it 's not that people do n't have the right and the opportunity to take that risk if they see it as a valid opportunity to make money it 's not like it 's fair to expect a vc to fund you without seeing a profit in the long run     but you 're her thesis with something that does n't actually address it     the culture that she 's complaining about exists in my experience the culture glosses over so much of what you her article with that risks exist and that failures exist and that there are a lot of harsh realities associated with the startup world   the culture does indeed all the best parts of startup dom and creates a toughness challenge that renders no this may not be a good idea because failure are personal while successes are cultural    successful startups and people who have done very well by them are held up as everything startups are supposed to be and look at how their hard work paid off and if yours does n't work it is entirely that you did n't work hard enough   someone who has bought in wholesale holds that there are no bad startups any startup can be successful you just need to bust balls working harder if you fail     startups are akin to gambling   they 're not the roulette of it 's all luck but closer to five card skill plays a lot of a role but there 's still luck involved     startup culture represents all this as far closer to texas hold em where luck in minimized where skill and diligence play the greatest role   it assumes that everyone going in already knows all the things you brought up in your rebuttal without ever actually giving them that information   it keeps just work harder without really saying hey guys check the odds you 're playing with and know when to hold and when to
