if the wording is within 10 days then its 10 days calendar days otherwise they would put 10 business days for example usually if you need to do something within 10 days from today the first day to count is today i would expect within to mean that you can fund in any of the days up to the 10th but that 's me trying to read english as english why do n't you call the bank and ask them

in addition to the other answers i think you would also need to account for the increased utility and maintenance costs on the more expensive house typically it is recommended to budget 1 to 4 the cost of the home per year for routine maintenance while it likely wo n't cost that much every year you will have those expensive items come up e.g. roof hvac that come up periodically the larger house will also cost more to heat cool depending on where you live could also have increased property taxes

alot of these answers have focused on the dilution aspect but from a purely legal aspect there are usually corporate bylaws that spell out what kind of vote and percentage of votes is needed to take this type of action   if all other holders of stock voted to do this so 90 for and you did n't so 10 against it 's still legal if that vote meets the threshold for taking the action as an example of this i known of a startup where employees got $ for their vested shares when the company was sold because the voting stock holders agreed to it   effectively the purchase amount was just enough to cover debts and preferred stock

my revised bottom line advice offer to send a 2nd payment preferably in the form of money order or cashier 's check for the difference you are agreeing to pay i can not imagine any reason why they would object to this there is no fee to cash a check there 's less risk of error and less work involved alternatively offer to send a new check only once the other has been returned do n't issue one more full amount check while the other is still outstanding there is a good reason not to accept partial payment by them which is that accepting a partial payment of a debt comes with a varieties of strings attached depending on the nature of the debt such as with court processes may need to be etc they likely want to avoid such a situation but this does not provide any support for why they ca n't just take a second payment and then cash it all at once as a single full settlement of the debt in a perfect world you could skip all the non sense by simply having your bank put a stop payment on the old check before sending a new one unfortunately this might not work with 100 accuracy but in your case if the partial payment is a significant amount of money to you i 'd go ahead and spend the $ 20 40 to put in the order now as an extra safety on them not doing what they claim if for some incredibly stupid reason you ca n't handle this with a 2nd payment instead of one single full one it turns out banks have lots of surprising and stupid rules like stop payments on a check expiring in 6 months and they may even cash stale checks over a year old no guarantee of a stop being successful etc the real rule is they might cash the check unless you close the account sigh this is one of many reasons i never ever use checks i am not aware of any law that requires a check to be physically returned if requested or proof or destruction provided or anything like that it 's a large part of the reason why we have the ability to stop payment on a check and so void it through the bank without having any physical access to the check but this process is spotty and imperfect and can not be relied upon you can request them to do whatever you like like void it and send it back or destroy it and they can just refuse or say they 'll do it and then just not do it and you have no real useful recourse the main goal should be to avoid losing money if someone accidentally or intentionally cashes both checks so you can ask or demand refuse to pay until they return the check etc and they can respond more or less any way they want as a final piece of future advice consider no longer using checks for purposes like this switch to using something like a cashier 's check or money order offered by your bank which by their very nature takes the money out of your account immediately all ongoing connection to your bank account and is effectively like cash with the added benefit of a paper trail keep the stub and and receipt from the cashier 's check money order in case it is lost or they claim they did n't get the money

this is a tricky question because the financial aid system can create odd incentives good schools tend to price themselves above and beyond any reasonable middle class ability to save and then offer financial aid much of it in the form of internal grants or loans   if you think about it the internal grant is more of a discount than a grant since no money need have ever existed to fund the grant   the actual price to the parents is based on financial aid paperwork and related rules perhaps forming a college price setting cartel   it is these rules that need to be considered when creating a savings plan suppose it is $ 50k year to send your kids to the best school admitting them   that s $ 200k for the 4 years   suppose you had $ 50k now to save instead of $ 10 k and are wondering whether to put it in your son 's college savings whether or not you can do so in a tax advantaged way or to pay down the mortgage   if you put it in your kids savings and the $ 50k becomes $ 75k over time that $ 75k will be used up in a year and a half as the financial aid system will suck it dry first before offering you much help   on the other hand if you put the $ 50k on paying down the mortgage provided the mortgage is healthy not upside down your house payment will still be the same when your kids go to college   the financial aid calculations will consider that the kid has no savings and allocate a grant and some loans the first year and a parental portion that you might be able to tap with a home equity loan or work overtime      generally you should also be encouraging your kids to excel and perhaps obtain academic scholarships or at least obtain some great opportunities   a large college savings fund might be as counterproductive as a zero fund   they should n't be expecting to breeze through some party school with a nice pad and car homework assistance and beer money   unless they are good at a sport like maybe football in which case you wo n't need to be the provider it is not obvious how much the optimal esa amount is   it might not be $ 0   saving like crazy in there probably is n't the best thing to do either

bartering is a tricky discussion yes it definitely applies when you are self employed and do a job that you would charge anyone else for but what if you are helping a friend in your spare time if you receive something in exchange the value of the item you received would be your income but what if you do n't receive anything in exchange if the company bought a computer that they loan to you to do occasional work for them there 's no reason you could n't take the computer home and have that company retain ownership of the property they could still expense the depreciation of the computer without giving it to you if it were a car though you would have to count mileage for personal use as income what if you exchange occasional tech support for the use of an empty desk and internet connection as long as they are n't renting desks for money to others there 's probably no additional marginal cost to them if they allow you to use the space so the fair market value question breaks down

yes the newly bought shares will have a long term holding period regardless of when you sell them   in addition it 's only a wash sale if you sold the first shares for a loss it 's not a wash sale if you sold them for a gain wikipedia mentions this when a wash sale occurs the holding period for the replacement stock includes the period you held the stock you sold example you 've held shares of xyz for 10 years you sell it at a loss but then buy it back within the wash sale period when you sell the replacement stock your gain or loss will be long term no matter how soon you sell it charles schwab also mentions this here 's a quick example of a wash sale on you buy 500 shares of abc at $ 10 per share one year later the stock price starts to drop and you sell all your shares at $ 9 per share on two days later on abc bottoms out at $ 8 and you buy 500 shares again this series of trades triggers a wash sale the holding period of the original shares will be added to the holding period of the replacement shares effectively leaving you with a long term position

you do n't have to use an agent broker as you call it but it is strongly advised in some counties lawyers are required in some not check your local requirements similarly the escrow companies that usually deal with recording and of money you will probably not be able to get a title insurance without using an escrow service i 'm guessing here but it makes sense to me you will not be able to secure financing through a bank or a mortgage broker without an escrow company and it might be hard without an agent agents required by law to know all the details of the process and they can guide you through what to do and what to look into they have experience reading and understanding the inspection reports they know what to demand from the seller disclosures information etc they know how and from where to get the hoa docs and disclosures and can help you negotiate the price knowing the market information comparable sales comparable listings list vs sales statistics etc it is hard to do all that alone but if you do you should definitely get a discount over the market price of the property of about 5 the agents fees are up to 5 mostly i bought several properties in california and in other states and i would n't do it without an agent on my side but if you trust the other side entirely and willing to take the risk of missing a step and having problems later with title mortgage insurance or resale then you can definitely save some money and do it without an agent and there are people doing that

your question is expressed as a run on sentence which i 'm having trouble parsing maybe you could restate   i 'm just pointing out the stupidity of the statist that the debt is not a problem because we owe it to ourselves like to think we 're all in this together but that 's not reality some people are taking from others by force of law   the debt is owed to banks and they want to keep this system going would n't you like to have a legal monopoly on the supply of currency institutions which are funded by loose credit government academia military contractors crony corporations likewise benefit from this system   those who invest in us dollars and those who are from the central planning are the losers in this scheme    but there is more debt than currency so it ca n't ever be repaid so that is a moot point it ca n't even hypothetically be considered    there are however a number of other ways that this system could unwind when it inevitably does the banks could be left to fail and their assets would be bid on by others through the bankruptcy process or the fed could keep issuing currency to keep the banks solvent eventually inflating the whole system into irrelevance

value averaging has you shift the balance of your portfolio over time not the amount of contributions   so you can only do it if you have a portfolio holding both risky assets shares etc and some cash you start out by making a plan about how much you will contribute every month and at what rate you expect the share part of the portfolio to grow   perhaps based on 20th century data you think an 8 growth rate is reasonable   or alternatively if you know your desired final amount obviously you can work backwards to a desired rate from that if in any month the share part is falling below its expected growth path you would put more money into it possibly your whole paycheck contribution plus some from the savings cash account   on the other hand if the share component is growing too fast you would put all your additional savings into cash   so if your investments are doing well you 're not supposed to spend the excess money but rather to put it aside into a dedicated cash account to top up your share component when prices fall in theory this has the auto benefit of dollar cost averaging but even better when prices are high you 'll automatically buy fewer shares or even sell some conversely when prices are low you 'll buy extra shares from your reserve account if it turns out your estimate was unreasonably optimistic and over your lifetime shares only ever average 3 you 'll end up with an entirely share portfolio and a ride than you might have liked   if you have horrible luck and over your entire investing life shares return less than cash which has happened though not yet in the usa then this will be worse than a standard balanced portfolio the original book value averaging by has a pretty good explanation of various cases though i would say some of the examples are worked in excessive detail i have not implemented this myself one reason being that the amount i 'm able to save from year to year varies as it probably does for you and so predicting a path is not quite so simple as he assumes   you could still do it i suppose i think you could get a very crude approximation to this by simply directing your savings into cash when the share market 's rate of growth over the last several years is above what you think is the long term average

costco requires an annual paid membership before you can enter and the the minimum price of any purchase is greater than at other stores because you are getting large bulk of that item   starbucks charges several dollars for a cup of coffee not an essential item   in both cases their clientele are the middle classes not the less well off members of society   consequently it makes business sense for them to pay staff such that are they are substantially similar to the customers   but walmart does serve the less well off   and their management is n't stupid if they believed a doubling of wages would result in greater sales and profitability they would do it in an heartbeat   but it wo n't   and i 'll bet walmart 's customers and employees are as similar to each other as costco 's customers and employees are to each other     walmart 's effects on prices is well   every cent they save customers is a cent those customers can put towards other things or prolong how long a particular amount of money will last   there are numerous claims about them lowering the effects wal mart   so changing nothing else increasing employee wages would decrease customer savings   we could make the cost of living for employees be less by reducing the costs of housing rather than every time house prices go up   and if you believe everyone should have healthcare then ensure everyone has it   if you believe it should be provided via employers along with a bizarre insurance industry a rather peculiar then just make that mandatory in the law   and finally for all the who believe it can be done better go ahead and do so   it is always easier to advocate how and what others should do if walmart are getting it so wrong then show everyone the right way

i am going to break rank slightly with the consensus so far   here 's the deal it probably does help your credit slightly to pay it multiple times per month if it is n't a hassle but the bump is likely to be minimal and very temporary   here 's why a key component of your score is your credit usage ratio that is the ratio of how much of your credit limits you are using you want to keep this number down as low as possible now here is where it gets tricky although you have a grace period to pay off your card with no interest the credit card companies do n't generally report the balance as of the due date they either report the high balance or an average balance over the month that is it is based on how much you use not how much balance you carry over each month it is n't very intuitive but that 's just how it is so technically keeping that balance lower over the course of the month will probably help you but the credit usage ratio is generally a rolling average over the last x months so the effect will wear off quickly so it is probably not worth doing unless you know you are going to apply for a loan in the next 6 months and need a temporary small bump another consideration is that paying early provides no real financial benefit in terms of finance charges but you are giving up liquidity which does have some value     1 you probably could get at least a little interest for keeping the money in your account a few more weeks 2 if you have a major financial emergency e.g. broken down car you might appreciate the fact that you kept your options open to carry that balance over a month

there is nothing illegal about a vehicle being in one person 's name and someone else using it   an illegal straw purchase usually applies to something where for example   the purchaser is trying to avoid a background check as with firearms or is trying to hide assets so they use someone else to make the purchase on their behalf to shield real ownership as for insurance there 's no requirement for you to own a vehicle in order to buy insurance so that you can drive someone else 's vehicle   in other words you can buy liability coverage that applies to any vehicle you 're operating the long and short of it here is that you 're not doing anything illegal or otherwise improper but i give you credit for having the good morals for wanting to make sure you 're doing the right thing

accenture has several levels of partner i 'd be really surprised if it topped out at 250k because that 's not very much even for a public company and also does n't fit with the lifestyle of a few partners i googled around a bit and there was an ama on of all places reddit about a year back from somebody claiming to be a partner at accenture who reported 300k for a new partner up to for more senior ones excluding equity which actually sounds more reasonable to me    second observation higher partner compensation does not systematically imply higher bill rates private companies does n't pay dividends for example and partner compensation is not the only expense bankers in public banks can make that much and none of them are partners ubs amp co. performance based bonus at accenture for non partners and senior executives are not necessarily partners can reach 20k no problem hell a consultant might make almost that

equity can be diluted by future investors royalties get paid on each sale companies can continue selling things even when operating at negative profit back royalties due can be negotiated and at least partially paid in a bankruptcy   from the standpoint of the investor if it does n't look like the company will likely have commercial success with a second product it may be wise to simply take a portion of the product that is actually selling rather than risk your capital on the company 's future successes or failures from the standpoint of the business owner if you believe you have a second product close to the end of the development pipeline it would be wise not to give up equity in the entire enterprise simply to gain required financing to ramp up production and marketing on an existing product   paying a royalty may be advantageous compared to paying interest on a loan as well royalty payments are contingent on the occurrence of a sale while interest is due regardless

at its heart i think the best spirit of donation is helping others less fortunate than yourself but as long as the us remains solvent the chief benefit of paying down the national debt is like paying off a credit card lowering the future interest payments the u.s. taxpayer has to make since the wealthy pay a disproportionately large portion of taxes per capita your hard earned money would be disproportionately benefitting the wealthy so i 'd recommend you do one or both of the following instead target your donations to a charity whose average beneficiary is less fortunate than yourself take political action with an aim towards balancing the federal budget since the us national debt is principally financed in the form of 30 year treasuries the u.s. will be completely out of debt if it can maintain a balanced budget for 30 years see below

tl;dr there is no silver bullet you have to decide how much to invest and when on your own   averaging down definition definition of average down the process of buying additional shares in a company at lower prices than you originally purchased this brings the average price you 've paid for all your shares down breaking down average down sometimes this is a good strategy other times it 's better to sell off a beaten down stock rather than buying more shares   so let us tackle your questions at what percentage drop of the stock price should i buy more shares ex should i wait for the price to fall by 5 or 10 to buy more it depends on the behaviour of the security and the issuer is it near its historical minimum how healthy is the issuer there is no set percentage you can maximize your gains or your losses if the security does not rebound investopedia the strategy is often favored by investors who have a long term investment horizon and a contrarian approach to investing a contrarian approach refers to a style of investing that is against or contrary to the prevailing investment trend   on the other side of the coin are the investors and traders who generally have shorter term investment horizons and view a stock decline as a of things to come these investors are also likely to espouse trading in the direction of the prevailing trend rather than against it they may view buying into a stock decline as akin to trying to catch a falling knife your second question how many additional shares should i buy ex initially i bought 10 shares should i buy or 20 that depends on your portfolio allocation before and after averaging down and your investor profile risk take care when putting more money on a falling security if your portfolio allocation shifts too much that may expose you to risks you should n't be taking you are assuming a risk for example if the market bears down like 2008 averaging down or doubling up works well when the stock eventually rebounds because it has the effect of magnifying gains but if the stock continues to decline losses are also magnified in such cases the investor may the decision to average down rather than either exiting the position or failing to add to the initial holding   one of the pitfalls of averaging down is when the security does not rebound and you become too attached to be able to cut your losses and move on also if you are bullish on a position be careful not to slip the i down and add a t on said position invest with your head not your heart

in theory if a company has 1 m shares at $ 10 and does a 10 for 1 split then the day after it has 10 m shares at $ 1 assuming no market move so both the price and the number of share change keeping the total value of the company unchanged regarding your bis i suspect that the new number of shares has not been reported yet because it 's an etf the number of shares in issue changes everyday due to in out flows your twx example is not ideal either because there was a spin off on the same day as the stock split so you need to separate the two effects some studies have documented a positive stock split effect one of the suggested reasons is that the stock becomes more liquid after the split but other studies have rejected that conclusion so you can probably safely consider that on average it will not have a material effect

this might sound harsh but the first thing i would suggest is to stop making excuses   i was n't able to continue due to pressure from college and family the college i went to was horrible employers can very easily hire foreign work force for    very cheap for example as a citizen if i work $ 10 an hour they can    get someone from outside to work for $ 5 per hour there 's no guarantee that the project will succeed i can not really work and at the same time develop software on my free    time   despite my failures in the past i was not the main person that 's    responsible for those failures even if all of this is true it 's not helping you move forward and it seems to be getting in the way of creating a good action plan and motivating yourself to succeed if you believe based on past experiences that you are doomed to fail then you are indeed doomed to fail you need to take a step back and re evaluate your current circumstances and what you can do to reach your goals you have a couple of things working in your favor here it 's great that you are debt free that already puts you ahead of a lot of your peers   you have the option of living with your parents presumably for no rent or at least much lower rent than you would have to pay if you move out this is worth literally thousands of $ for every year you stay now onto your questions 1 should i quit regular programming for a normal job because i never programming so i can move out of my parents home are you being paid for this regular programming if so are you being paid more than minimum wage if not it 's perfectly acceptable to consider alternative ways to spend your time and generate income however this does n't have to be at the expense of living with your parents have you thought about getting a new or second job while still living with them if you absolutely must move out of your parent 's home consider renting a room in a house with other people to keep the rent costs to a minimum that way even if your main job is low paying you should be able to put aside some money each month for future endeavors   2 should i monetize programming and gamble with the future what does this mean are you thinking you 'll write a mobile app and sell thousands of copies for each that would indeed be a big gamble but maybe that 's not what you meant so you 'll need to clarify 3 would it be wise to essentially quit programming for the sake of a minimum wage job i 'm not sure how this is different from question 1 so i 'll reiterate what i said there moving out is going to be expensive you can still do it but you 're asking on a personal finance site where the focus is usually how to minimize living costs and maximize income without knowing more about where you live employment opportunities cost of living the default recommendation is usually to save money by staying in your parents house tldr do n't focus on anyone else they are not preventing you from getting the job you want look at your own skills and qualifications not just programming consider all of your abilities what are you good at who might need those skills what is the cost of reaching those people commute time moving nearer what is the reward if the reward exceeds the cost start approaching those people show them what you can do

if you 're talking about a single stock you greatly underestimate the chances of it dropping even long term check out the 12 companies that made up the first dow jones industrial average in 1896 there is probably only one you 've heard of ge many of the others are long gone or have since been bought up by larger companies and remember these were 12 companies that were deemed to be the most representative of the stock market around the turn of the 20th century now if you 're talking about funds that hold many stocks up to thousands then your question is a little different over the long term 25 + years we have never experienced a period where the overall market lost value of course as you recognize the psychology of investors is a very important factor if the stock market loses half of its value in a year as it has done a few times people will be inundated with bad news and of this time it 's different and explanations of why the stock market will never recover perhaps this may be true some day but it never has been thus far so based on all the evidence we have if you hold a well diversified fund the chances of it going down long term again meaning 25 + years are basically zero

hi i 'm the writer thanks for the read and the comment with the statement you quoted i 'm trying to dispute the claim that people these days ca n't afford a house because they would have to pay their entire salary just to afford the mortgage which i think is quite common in some circles the data makes no statement as to whether home ownership is more affordable or not but simply shows that those buying property are using around the same percentage of their income to pay for it which the data clearly shows to be true      as it turns out home ownership levels have remained within ~5 of their 1980 levels based on percentage of the total population i think there is an major classification flaw when comparing only sales because a great deal of people inherit property with no sale ever being made

11 111 looks like the old tax number it is used by the tax office to know who you are it is n't good at all for the spanish company it would even change when you move inside germany   vat ids are not exclusive to but a always has one as freelancers you can get at vat id but you do n't always have to   the tax office offers a small business treatment 19 for freelancers kind of an opt out for the vat id as you do not have a vat id this is probably your case it means so what to do if i were you i 'd write them that according to 19 and the european council directive of 28 november 2006 on the common system of value added tax title chapter 1 special scheme for small enterprises you were not assigned a vat id and vat is not applicable to your bill the fact that vat is not applicable in this case does not mean that they are allowed to refuse payment   i heard a but do n't really know that a number similar to the vat id is planned also for freelancers you could go to your tax office and ask them about maybe that yields a number that satisfies spanish afaik you can go to your tax office and ask them to give you a real vat number   but careful that has the serious drawback that you have to do do an advance vat estimate and pay that to the tax office at least quarterly for bigger business monthly and afaik you are not allowed to change back to the small business treatment for several years

from watching the hearings and reading the papers it appears that london office entered into a hedge like position that was meant to hedge against a worldwide economic downturn as far as i know jpm corporate found this position on their own probably alerted by the huge mark to market losses and it was not found by some outside manager   that position itself was a hedge that turned out not to be a very good hedge and upon this finding it was determined that jpm needed to exit this hedge unfortunately the position had lost a substantial amount even by this point this according to dimon was because this particular group had been very successful in previous years and was not subject to the same regulations as most other groups   jpm has been very quiet about the details because they do n't need the position getting any more out of control than it already is i assume some market participants have a good idea on what it is exactly given its size but i do not    it is not really like ltcm which was not hedging and were supposed to be taking arbitrage positions in the market it is also unlike ltcm is myriad ways being 1 major position $ 8b is not the same to jpm as to ltcm jpm will almost 100 take the full loss etc   i would recommend watching 102 dimon clearly thinks the position was very unwise and they are unwinding it but details will be in short supply until jpm gets out of the position

your question has already been answered you divide the amount of shares you own 100 by the total amount of shares however i feel it is somewhat misleading to talk about owning a percentage of the company by owning shares strictly speaking shares do not entitle you to a part of the company but instead give you a proportional amount of votes at shareholder meetings assuming no funky share classes what this means is that someone who owns 30 of a company 's shares ca n't just grab 30 of the company 's assets factories offices and whatever and say that they are entitled to own this what they actually own is 30 of the voting rights in this company this means that they control 30 of all available votes when the company calls a vote on corporate actions choosing a new director etc which is how shareholders exert their influence on a company

you are correct a possible dead cat bounce is forming on the stock markets if it does form it will mean that prices have not reached their bottom as this pattern is a bearish continuation pattern for a dead cat bounce to form prices will need to break through support formed by the lows last week if prices bounce off the support and go back up it could become a double bottom pattern which is a reversal pattern the double bottom would be confirmed if prices break above the recent high a couple of days ago regarding the psychology of the dead cat bounce pattern is that after a distinct and quick reversal of prices from recent highs you have 2 groups of market participants who create demand in the market firstly you have those who were short covering their short positions to take profits and secondly you have those who are looking for a bargain buying at what they think is the low so for a few days you have the bulls taking over the bears   then as more less positive news comes in the bears hit the market again these are more participants opening short positions but more so those who missed out in selling previously because prices fell too quickly seeing another opportunity to sell at a better price so the bears take over again   unless there is very good news around the corner it is likely that the bears will stay in control and prices will fall further how to trade a dead cat bounce assuming you have been stopped out of your long already if you are aggressive you can go short as prices start reversing from the top of the bounce with your stop loss just above the top of the bounce if you are more conservative you would place your entry for a short position just below the support at the start of the bounce with your stop above the top of the bounce you could also place an order for a long position above the top of the bounce if a double bottom a one cancels the other oco would be an appropriate order for such a situation

the gordon equation does not use inflation adjusted numbers it uses nominal returns dividends and growth rates it really says nothing anyone would not already know   everyone knows that your total return equals the sum of the income return plus capital gains    gordon simply assumes perfectly that capital gains will be driven by the growth of earnings and that the dividends paid will likewise increase at the same rate so he used the dividend growth rate as a proxy for the earnings growth rate or capital gains rate you can not use inflation removed estimates of equity rates of return because those returns do not change with inflation   if anything they move in opposite directions   eg in the 1970 's inflation the high market rates caused people to discount equity values at larger rates driving their values down creating losses

you should dispute the transaction with the credit card describe the story and attach the cash payment receipt and dispute it as a duplicate charge there will be no impact on your score but if you do n't have the cash receipt or any other proof of the alternative payment it 's your word against the merchant and he has proof that you actually used your card there so worst case you just paid twice if you dispute the charge and it is accepted the merchant will pay a penalty if it is not accepted you may pay the penalty on top of the original charge depending on your credit card issuer some charge for frivolous charge backs it will take several more years for either the european merchants to learn how to deal with the us half baked chip cards or the american banks to start issue proper chip and pin card as everywhere else either way until then if the merchant does n't know how to handle signatures with the american credit cards just do n't use them pay cash given the controversy in the comments my intention was not to say no do n't talk to the merchant from the description of the situation it did n't strike me as the merchant would even bother to consider the situation a less than honest merchant knows that you have no leverage and since you 're a tourist and will probably not be returning there anyway what 's the worst you can do to them a bad yelp review you can definitely get in touch with the merchant and ask for a refund but i would not expect much to come out from that

we need to be careful what we are talking about here inflation on a economy level scale at an expected rate will not change consumer habits because the price increase is manageable you have to realize that prices are not increasing in isolation wages will have to rise along too   high inflation that is expected will increase consumption of durable goods as people attempt to get rid of their money before the price changes on them a good example of this was post wwi germany where hyperinflation was so bad that offices began to pay their employees twice daily so they could adjust their wages and so that their employees could go out during lunch and after work to buy something with the money before the price changed on them unexpected inflation may cause a temporary dip in spending until wages adjust however consumers still need to buy so they will likely push for higher wages leading to consumption to stay about level there is another effect to inflation as well people who have savings will have their savings eroded over time if the economy is inflationary to preserve their wealth they will invest it in a deflationary environment money will increase in value simply by being hoarded so they will be less willing to invest it deflation also increases the cost of interest on a loan while inflation decreases it so the overall effect is for an increase in spending under inflation and a decrease under deflation the person you have quoted is quite wrong price increases in a particular sector will cause consumer spending to decrease but this is a bad example as it is not inflation but rather a supply demand problem of a particular consumer good they are applying a micro economic model price increases of a single good to a macroeconomic problem price increases in the entire economy when price increases at a global scale have the opposite effects a good theoretical test of this is what would happen if everyone in the us suddenly had twice as much money ignoring international trade of course the answer prices will double and nothing else will change the reason is people will have more money to spend but will require more money for their services so in the end it all cancels out

are you kidding subsidized loans is effectively free money of course they 're going to avail themselves   the real reason is that bernanke did n't want to be playing favorites which he was the level and quality of collateral required for these loans varied wildly with very little explanation   also 16 trillion is a lot of money to be given out as a subsidized loan even if the quality of the collateral was high and the duration was short which is not true for at least a trillion of that money

now to buy in full and essentially have zero savings buy in part £ 10000 deposit followed by a loan of £ 4000 or hp more of the value so you are assessing if the car is worth having with either none or only 4,000 in savings this is the most critical information you have provided    my outright opinion is to always buy a mildly used car as i hate the idea of loans and interest with the amount of money that you currently possess i believe the buy in part option is best as it reduces your interest liability but i do n't believe you should do it currently 4,000 is a rather small cash fund for if something were to go boom in the night    as for your question of interest this is completely dependent on the amount you are able to pay per period and the total interest you are willing to spend rows four and seven respectively this is your money and no one can tell you what 's best to do with it than yourself keep looking for good leasing deals or if you think you can survive financial strife with 4,000 then follow your heart depreciation fluctuates to the buyer so never assume what the car may lose in the next 2 3 years hope it all goes well my friend

the shift to trading at the close began in 2008 traders did not want to be caught off guard by surprise news and there was a lot of volatility during the financial crisis so they would close their position in the evening that s how it began there are two reasons why it sticks around first there has been an increase usage of index funds or passive funds these funds tend to update their positions at the end of the day from the wsj another factor behind the shift has been the proliferation of passively managed investments such as index funds these funds aim to mimic an index like the s&p 500 by owning the shares that comprise it index funds do n’t trade as often as active investors but when they do it is typically near the market close traders say that is because buying or selling a stock at its closing price better aligns their performance with the index they are trying to emulate the second reason is simply that volume attracts volume as a result of what s mentioned above you have a shift to end of day trading and the to that is that there is a liquidity shortage from 10 am to 3 pm thus if you want to buy or sell a stock but there are few buyers or sellers around you will significant move the price when you enter your order obviously this does not affect retail traders but imagine hedge funds entering or closing a billion dollar position it can make a huge impact on price and one way to mitigate that is to wait until there are more market participants to take the other end of your trade just as at the end of the day so this is a self reinforcing trend that has begun in the markets and will likely stick around

this is ridiculous of course some companies do n't pay taxes each year off the top of my head nol 's net operating losses can be carried forward 20 years and will definitely reduce tax liability for that matter a loss during any year prevents paying income tax though sales property ad and other taxes may apply other companies may get capital credits green credits or other subsidies that might prevent a tax liability none of these indicate that a corporation is getting away with anything the irs is a lot better at its job than most people think   the point is you ca n't look at any individual year and make an accurate assessment of a company 's or even an individual 's tax burden it 's completely dishonest reporting   source i 'm a state tax auditor and my job is to make sure corporations pay what they are supposed to   edit additionally 2010 was the heart of the recession for a lot of companies there were a lot of corporations that took losses that year so to say that ge took in billion and paid no taxes is misleading you have to say why they paid no taxes or you 're just blowing hot air taxes are assessed on income not there is a big difference

when you want to invest in an asset denominated by a foreign currency your investment is going to have some currency risk to it you need to worry not just about what happens to your own currency but also the foreign currency lets say you want to invest $ 10000 in us stocks as a canadian today that will cost you $ since just hit you now have two ways you can make money one is if goes up two is if the stocks go up the former may not be obvious but remember you are holding us denominated assets currently with the intention of one day converting those assets back into cad essentially you are long long usd short cad since you are short cad if cad goes up it hurts you it may seem odd to think about this as a currency trade but it opens up a possibility if you want a foreign investment to be currency neutral you just make the opposite currency trade in addition to your original investment so in this case you would buy $ 10,000 in us stocks and then short ie long cad short usd $ 10,000 this is kind of savvy and may not be something you would do but its worth mentioning and there are also some currency hedged etfs out there that do this for you however most are hedged relative to usd and are meant to hedge the target countries currency not your own

each way you go is a little bit of a gamble    owning equity in the company is best in situations where you can trade and sell that equity or where the dilution of your royalty product would affect your returns or if you can maintain a certain equity stake without working at the company or if you can hold out on taking equity to reinvest profits for the purposes of growth    the royalty is best in situations where you 're getting a portion of the gross since you get paid as a creditor no matter how the company is performing or if you intend to collect royalties after you leave the company now for your situation if your royalties are fluctuating with profit instead of gross and your equity is tied to your continued partnership and not subject to potential growth then they 're pretty much both for the same thing you 've removed the particular advantages for each way of receiving payment if the company ever does buy out or go public how much of your additional x earning a month would you have to then re invest to get an equity stake   and for royalties if another developer came aboard or your company bought another company how much would this dilute your ip contribution so aside from the gambling nature of the issue i 'm not sure your tax calculation is right   you can take equity profit as dividend as long as you 're collecting a sufficient salary this prevents a business from declaring all profits as a dividend   this would put those profits into a different tax bracket 15 capital gains or if all profits are split you could take part as salary part as dividend   as well as someone who 's making active income off of their ip not passive income you 're supposed to file a schedule c not a schedule e so your royalties would include your self employment taxes   the schedule e is for royalties where the author is n't actively in the field or actually self employed in that area or if you own royalties on something you did n't create   should you keep the royalties then go to another job field or retire then your royalties could go on a schedule e.   now a tax advantage may exist on a schedule c if you can write off certain health and business expenses reducing your income that you ca n't on a schedule e though it 'd probably be difficult to write off more than the adjusted self employment cost savings of a schedule e.

what the hell is fair inequality      in order for inequality to be justified there needs to be constant growth in the economy such that the ones pulling away and getting rich are producing better products services or inventing more efficient ways to bring products to market    unfortunately more of the rich are turning to rent seeking methods to increase their wealth thus it becomes zero sum at that point because they are taking more wealth for themselves without actually adding any value economically to society      currently our growth is anemic yet the very wealthy keeps pulling farther and farther away from the pack as far as total wealth   this is why as they get richer the rest of us are getting poorer

they 've been around long enough now for there to be past performance figures you can google for i think you 'll find the results are n't very encouraging i personally do n't think there 's a huge risk that the robots will lose all your money but there 's every reason to expect they are n't likely to perform better than traditional managers or beat the market at the end of the day the robots are employing a lot of analysis and management techniques that traditional managers have been using and since traditional managers use computers to do it efficiently there 's not much gain imo yes in theory labour is expensive so cutting it out is good but in practise in this case the amount of money being managed is huge and the human cost is pretty insignificant i personally do n't believe that the reduced fees represent the cost of the human management i think it 's just marketing there might be some risk that the robots can be gamed but i doubt the potential is very great your return might in theory be a fraction of a percent less over time because it 's going on the problem here is that the algorithms are functionally broadly known no doubt every robo adviser has its own algorithms that in theory are the closely guarded secret but in reality a broad swath of the functional behaviour will be understood by many people in the right circles and that gives rise to predictability and if you can predict investment trading patterns you can make money from those patterns that means humans making money taking margin away from the robots or robots making money from other robots that are behind the curve if robo advisers continue to take off i would expect them to under perform more and more

short answer   no longer answer   the only reason to move would be to get out of the condo and into a of equal cost because condos can be quite difficult to sell and you do n't really want that potential burden later on   moving is expensive though and you ca n't afford to spend more when you are already living on the financial edge speaking of living on the edge that 's a recipe for disaster   i make ratio wise a similar sort of income   even accounting for the generous college tuition you should be able to save at least $ 20 k per year at a bare minimum   and if you were careful i figure you should be able to save $ 40k year   you need to figure out where you are dumping all of your money and cut way back on spending and focus entirely on saving money 1   stop eating out   make your own meals   i average about $ 2 per meal per person no junk food   eating out is 6 to 30 times as expensive as making meals at home   do the math   $ 10 2 people number of times you eat out per week 52 $ per year for each time week vs $ 2 2 people 21 3 meals per day 52 $ per year for both of you maximum   now i know some meals are more expensive to prepare but the math is not unrealistic i spend about $ 140 per month on groceries and make the bulk of my own food   eating out is sticker shock for me   the food i prepare is balanced and complete   now i 'm not a complete health nut   i love the occasional deep fried treat or hamburger but those are once every couple of months sort of things which makes them special 2   stop going to starbucks or wherever you go   it takes fuel to get there   it 's also expensive when you get there   bring your own drink if you are hanging out with friends 3   drop golf   or whatever expensive sport you are sinking money into   invest in some cheap running clothes and focus on based   heart health is more important than anything else   if you ca n't live without your sport then find an alternate sport that is equal ish in challenge but a ton cheaper to play   for example if you like playing golf play instead most cities have courses there 's no cost beyond a couple of discs and the challenge is still there 4   drop entertainment   movies at the theater are expensive   drop your cable subscription you are getting financially raped for $   get a netflix subscription and find shows via free online streaming services   buy some dominoes card games and a couple of classic board games   keep entertainment simple and cheap 5   drop your cell phone 's data plan   republic wireless is the only decent cellular provider and even their $ plan is living a luxury lifestyle   if you spend more than $ 10/month person for phone service you are spending too much 6   stop driving everywhere   gas is expensive   cars are expensive   if you have more than two cars sell the extras   if your car is worth more than $ 20,000 sell it and get something cheaper 7   stop drinking alcohol   alcohol impairs mental functions is addictive smells terrible and is ridiculously expensive   there 's no actual need to consume it either by the way do n't go and make major financial changes without the wife 's sign off   finances are the 1 reason for divorce   so get her ok on this stuff   hopefully you already knew that   the above are just some common financial pitfalls where people sink thousands and thousand of dollars and gain nothing   you can still have a full and complete life with just a minimum of the above there is no excuse for living on the edge financially   your story is one i 'm going to share with those who give me the same excuse because they are poor   you are i want to punch you in the face wealthy and you spend every last penny because you think that 's how money works   you are wrong one final piece of advice   find a financial adviser   it is clear to me that you 've been managing money wrong your whole life   a financial adviser will look at your situation and help you far more than someone on the internet ever can   if you attend a church many churches have the excellent crown financial program available which teaches sound financial management principles   the education system does n't show people how to manage money but that 's not an excuse either   once you dig yourself out of the financial hole you 've dug for yourself you can pass the knowledge on how to correctly manage money onto other people

while c c 's have 0 interest this a good mechanism to manage debt but they expect you will pile up a large debt and at then of the interest free period you will get hammered so plan your exit strategy   plan to pay off the 0 cards at the end of the int free period and pay the other cards down alternatively what you could do is pay off the other cards now by drawing down on the 0 card if its possible your debt is at 0 int also you are consolidating your debt into 1 account when the int free period is over move the debt into a single personal loan if you do n't plan on paying it all off in the meantime put you savings into an interest bearing account to maximize the value of your savings

since i have n't seen it in any of the comments so far there 's another reason automation or   how soon will we no longer need humans to work as i have no experience with the trade so i certainly could n't say it 's natural for labor needs to shift over time but if they are shifting more quickly and while shifting are also dwindling one would imagine that it 's more a difficult for a worker to stomach going to another trade school to pick up another trade that wo n't pay as well and for which the demand may evaporate since they are less familiar with the prospects of its automation

in my opinion the risk is about the lost opportunity cost you can find a lot of articles about it on the net in big shortcut opportunity cost takes place each time you have to choose between two or more options and the tradeoff effect have its price it is defined as value of best alternative solution quite good definition from wikipedia is as follows in theory the opportunity cost of a choice is the value of the best alternative forgone in a situation in which a choice needs to be made between several mutually exclusive alternatives given limited resources assuming the best choice is made it is the cost incurred by not enjoying the benefit that would be had by taking the second best choice available note that opportunity cost is not the sum of the available alternatives when those alternatives are in turn mutually exclusive to each other it is the value of the next best use   as you think this situation often happens in financial world where investors always seek best from their point of view way to invest capital

during the hyperinflation of the republic corporate stocks and convertible bonds were thought second only to the species gold silver etc as the only secure currencies   as milton friedman proved inflation is caused solely by the monetary token supply increasing faster than productivity   in the past days of species of currency it was caused by governments the currency e.g. the same amount of silver in 50 coins to 100 coins sudden increases in the supply of precious metals can also trigger it the various gold rushes in 19th century and later improvements in extraction methods caused of inflation most famously the huge amounts of silver the spanish extracted from the new world mines devastated the european economy with high inflation governments use inflation as a form of stealth flat tax money functions as an abstract universal trade good and it all the rules of supply and demand if the supply of money goes up suddenly then its value drops in relation to real goods and service but that drop in value does n't occur instantly the increased quality of tokens has to through the market before the value changes   so the first institution to spend the debased currency can get the full current value from trade the second gets slightly less the third even less and so on in 2008 the federal reserve began printing money and loaning at 0 to insolvent backs who then used that money to buy t bill this had the effect of giving the banks an arbitrary a1 rated asset for their fractional reserve while the federal government got full pre inflation value of the money paid for the t bills as the government spent that money the number of tokens increased fast than the economy   in times of inflation the value of money per unit drops as its supply increases and increases the best hedges against inflation are real assets e.g. land equipment stocks ownership of real assets and convertible bonds which are convertible to stock   it 's important to remember that money is of itself worthless it 's just a technology that and trading which at the base is still a barter system during inflation the barter value of money plunges owing to increased supply but the direct barter value between any two real assets remain the same because their supplies have not changed   the value of stocks and convertible bonds is maintained by the economic activity of the company whose ownership they represent dividends stock prices and bond equity as measured in the inflated currency continue to rise in sync with inflation thus they preserve the original value of the money paid for them not sure why you expect more inflation the only institution that can create inflation in the us is the federal reserve which trump has no direct control off deregulation of banks wo n't cause inflation in and of itself as the private banks can not alter the money supply if banks fail owing to deregulation unlikely i think given the dismal nearly century long record of regulation to date then the federal reserve might fix the problem with another inflation tax but otherwise not

# 424247
congratulations on a solid start here are my thoughts based on your situation asset classes i would recommend against a long term savings account as an investment vehicle while very safe the yields will almost always be well below inflation since you have a long time horizon most likely at least 30 years to retirement you have enough time to take on more risk as long as it 's not more than you can live with if you are looking for safer alternatives to stocks for part of your investments you can also consider investment grade bonds bond funds or even a stable value fund later when you are much closer to retirement you may also want to consider an annuity depending on the interest rate on your loan you may also be able to get a better return from paying down your loan than from putting more in a savings account i would recommend that you only keep in a savings account what you expect to need in the next few years cushion for regular expenses emergency fund etc on stocks stocks are riskier but have the best chance to outperform versus inflation over the long term i tend to favor funds over individual stocks mostly for a few practical reasons first one of the goals of investing is to diversify your risk which produces a more efficient risk reward ratio than a group of stocks that are highly correlated diversification is easier to achieve via an index fund but it is possible for a well educated investor to stay diversified via individual stocks also since most investors do n't actually want to take physical possession of their shares funds will manage the shares for you as well as offering additional services such as the automatic of dividends and tax management asset allocation it 's very important that you are comfortable with the amount of risk you take on investment salespeople will prefer to sell you stocks as they make more commission on stocks than bonds or other investments but unless you 're able to stay in the market for the long term it 's unlikely you 'll be able to get the market return over the long term make sure to take one or more risk tolerance assessments to understand how often you 're willing to accept significant losses as well as what the optimal asset allocation is for you given the level of risk you can live with generally speaking for someone with a long investment horizon and a medium risk tolerance even the most conservative allocations will have at least 60 in stocks total of us and international with the rest in bonds other and up to 80 or even 100 for a more aggressive investor owning more bonds will result in a lower expected return but will also dramatically reduce your portfolio 's risk and volatility pension with so many companies deciding that they do n't feel like keeping the promises they made to yesterday 's workers or simply ca n't afford to the pension is nice but like social security i would n't bank on all of this money being there for you in the future this is where a fee only financial planner can really be helpful they can run a bunch of scenarios in planning software that will show you different retirement scenarios based on a variety of assumptions ie what if you only get 60 of the promised pension etc   this is probably not as much of an issue if you are an equity partner or if the company fully funds the pension in a segregated account or if the pension is defined contribution but most corporate pensions are just a general promise to pay you later in the future with no real money actually set aside for that purpose so i 'd discount this in my planning somewhat fund stock selection generally speaking most investment literature agrees that you 're most likely to get the best risk adjusted returns over the long term by owning the entire market rather than betting on individual winners and losers since no one can predict the future including professional money managers as such i 'd recommend owning a low cost index fund over holding specific sectors or specific companies only remember that even if one sector is more profitable than another the stock prices already tend to reflect this concentration in it consultancy i am concerned that one third of your investable assets are currently in one company the it consultancy it 's very possible that you are right that it will continue to do well that is not my concern my concern is the risk you 're carrying that things will not go well again you are taking on risks not just over the next few years but over the next 30 or so years until you retire and even if it seems unlikely that this company will experience a downturn in the next few years it 's very possible that could change over a longer period of time please just be aware that there is a risk one way to mitigate that risk would be to work with an advisor or a fund to structure and investment plan where you invest in a variety of sector funds except for technology that way your overall portfolio including the single company will be closer to the market as a whole rather than over weighted in it tech however if this it consultancy happens to be the company that you work for i would strongly recommend yourself of those shares as soon as reasonably possible in my opinion the risk of having your salary pension and much of your investments tied up in the fortunes of one company would simply be a much larger risk than i 'd be comfortable with last make sure to keep learning so that you are making decisions that you 're comfortable with with the amount of savings you have most investment firms will consider you a high net worth client so make sure you are making decisions that are in your best financial interests not theirs again this is where a fee only financial advisor may be helpful you can find a local advisor at best of luck with your decisions

a bank is insolvent when it can no longer meet its short term obligations   in this example the bank is insolvent when depositors withdraw more cash than the bank can pay out in this case it 's probably something in the range of $ 600 700k because the bank can borrow money from other banks using assets as collateral in the us we manage this risk in a few ways first fdic insurance provides a level of assurance that in a worst case scenario most depositors will have access to their money guaranteed by the government this prevents bank panics and reduces the demand for cash the risk that remains is the risk that you brought up in your scenario bad debt or investments that are valued we mitigate this risk by giving the federal reserve and in some instances the us treasure the ability to provide nearly unlimited capital to get over short mid term issues brought on by the market in cases of long term structural issues with the bank balance sheets regulators like the fdic federal reserve and others have the ability to assume control of the bank and sell off its assets to other stronger institutions the current financial regime has its in the bank panics of the 1890 's when the shift from an agricultural based economy where no capital is available until the crops come in to an industrial economy revealed the weakness of the unregulated model where ad hoc groups of banks backed each other up good banks were being destroyed by panics until a trusted third party jp morgan stepped in committed capital and make personal guarantees

your question boils down to saving for a house or saving for retirement why not do both if you invest in a roth 401k or roth ira you can withdraw any contributions that are at least 5 years old without penalty assuming you 're willing to put off purchasing a little longer than your original 2 3 years if you qualify as a first time home buyer i.e. you have n't owned a home in at least 2 years you can withdraw investment earnings as well if your distribution is earmarked towards the down payment and is no more than $ 10000 although you wo n't be penalized for using investment earnings for a down payment you will still have to pay taxes on them so this may be more appealing to someone that has enough contributions to avoid dipping into the investment earnings the only other downside is that contributions to a roth investment are not tax deductible like traditional ira and 401k contributions are instead they grow tax free and distributions are tax free when you reach retirement age

nothing can be done well in the past the courts were the mechanism by which something was done and that something was called consent decree where the court would simply order the monopolistic practices to stop immediately or the offenders could instead pay for instance a million dollar per day fine until they came into compliance xerox for instance only opened the specs of what we now call the pc under a court ordered consent decree    this nationwide system of trust busting was dismantled under reagan with the creation of the court of appeals of the federal circuit which was created out of nothing   in order to strengthen so called intellectual property rights the term intellectual property in turn had been crafted by a group of patent lawyers decades earlier in order to promote monopolistic practices    things could go back to the way they were with a major of the court system but as in the 30s it will probably take a sustained economic depression and complete collapse of the stock market to make that happen with mechanisms like the 401 k which also emerged in the reagan era that becomes more and more difficult to achieve without enormous suffering and loss of wealth by typical households

you can expect about a 7 return when investing in the general market if your horizon is ten years or more the market fluctuates which means that you should be absolutely fine with losing 10 or more of your invested money during this period you say yourself that i have been setting aside money into a savings account earmarked for that purpose repairs maintenance so that i do n't have to take out loans it 's obvious from your question that the purpose of this money is not savings this is money that you are already investing not in stocks or bonds but in your house while this money sits around of course you could put it into the market and hope that it grows it all depends on your horizon which in your case sounds like about 1 year is that long enough to be fairly sure you will make a profit from what i 've written so far hopefully you can gather that the answer is no if you choose to invest $ 6,000 but you need that money back in one year you need to be aware of the risk that you 'll instead end up with $ or even less your options are then to if you 're asking for personal advice my opinion would be this you 're already investing in your house the housing market like most markets fluctuate whether you like it or not you 're already a victim or of this value fluctuation the difference is that a house is something you 'll live in for a long time probably that will give you daily joy in a way stocks and bonds wo n't of course saving up money and investing them is always a good idea anyway you should still save a small amount every month and put it into low medium risk bonds in my opinion

if she reported the income on the business return i 'd treat this as a mail audit try to get a clear statement from square confirming what they reported under which ssn ein for what transactions make a copy of that if at all possible get them to send a letter to the irs copy to you acknowledging that they reported it under the wrong number copy the irs 's letter square 's letter and both personal and business 2012 returns write a signed cover letter explaining what had happened and pointing out the specific line in the business return which to the disputed amount so they can see that you did report it properly and did pay taxes on it as business income end that letter with a request for advice on how to straighten this out   certified mail the whole package back to the irs at whatever address the advisory letter gives at worst i 'm guessing they 'll tell you to both returns for 2012 with that income moved over from the business return to the personal return which will make everything match their records but with all of this documentation in one place they may be able to simply accept that square it and correct their files good luck the irs really is n't as unreasonable as people claim if you can clearly document that you were trying to do the right thing they try not to penalize folks unnecessarily

if the intention is after maturing to convert back the rupees into euro its not a good idea   generally the interest rate in euro and the interest rate in rupee are offset by the predicted exchange rate i.e. the rupee will fall compared to euro by similar rate the point at step 5 is generally what is expected to happen at times this can be less or more depending on the local global factors so on average you will not make money some times you will loose and sometimes you will gain plus i have shown flat conversion rates typically there is a buy rate and a sell rate for a pair of currencies there is a difference spread that is the margins of bank typically in the range of 2 to 4 depending on the currency pairs

you need to track all of your expenses first all of your assets and liabilities and set financial goals for example you need to know your average monthly expenses and exactly what percentages interest each loan charges and you need to know what to save for your children retirement large purchases etc then you create an emergency fund keep between 4 to 6 months worth of your monthly expenses in a savings account that you can readily access base the size of your emergency fund on your expenses rather than your salary this also means its size changes over time for example it must increase once you have children you then pay off your loans starting with the loan charging the highest interest you do this because e.g. paying off $ x of a 7 loan is equivalent to investing $ x and getting a guaranteed 7 return the stock market does generally does not provide guarantees starting with the highest interest first is mathematically the most rewarding strategy in the long run it is not a clear whether you should pay off all loans as fast as possible particularly those with low interest rates and the mortgage you need to read up on the subject in order to make an informed decision this would be too personal advice for us to give after you 've created that emergency fund and paid of all high interest loans you can consider investing in vessels that achieve your set financial goals for example since you are thinking of having children within five years you might wish to save for college education that implies immediately that you should pick an investment vessels that is available after 20 year or so and does not carry too much risk e.g. perhaps bonds or deposits these are a few basic advices and i would recommend to look further on the internet and perhaps read a book on the topic of personal finance

if you ended at your second paragraph no it 's simply a refund of your own money same as any time i get any cash back whether due to a credit card reward program or price match   but your 4th paragraph changes this yes you owe tax as it 's clearly not your own money coming back even barter income is taxable   per the new comments appearing this is not a case of bartering i cited bartering as an understandable example of when there 's no cash and yet tax is owed in this situation value is received and it counts as income similar to the barter situations   just because the value is n't in cash does n't negate the tax due i 'd ask how op pays his rent mortgage utilities cell phone bill etc the answer is simple non traditional income as op puts it has a tax due

this does n't answer your question but as an aside it 's important to understand that your second and third bullet points are completely incorrect while it used to be true that swiss bank accounts often came with guarantees of neutrality and privacy in recent years even the swiss banks have been to political pressure from many sides especially us obama with regards to the most extreme cases of criminals that is to say if you 're a terrorist or a child or in possession of nazi assets swiss banks wo n't provide the protection you 're interested in you might say but i 'm not a terrorist or a or profiteering of war crimes but if you 're trying so hard to hide your personal assets it 's worth wondering how much longer until swiss banks make further concessions to start providing information on not to discourage you this is just food for thought the bulletproof protection these accounts used to provide has been compromised i work with online advertising companies and a number of people i know in the industry get sued on a regular basis for copyright or trademark infringement or spamming most of these people still trust swiss bank accounts because it 's still the best protection available for their assets and because swiss banks have n't given up details on someone for spamming yet

the best way to save on clothes is up to you   i have friends who save all year for two yearly shopping trips to update anything that may need updating at the time   by allowing themselves only two trips they control the money spent   bring it in cash and stop buying when you run out on the other hand in my family we shop sales   when we determine that we need something we wait until we find a sale   when we see an exceptionally good sale on something we know we will need basic work dress shoes for example we 'll purchase it and save it until the existing item it is replacing has worn out   our strategy is to know what we need and buy it when the price is right   we tend to wait on anything that is n't on sale until we can find the right item at a price we like which sometimes means stretching the existing piece of clothing it is replacing until well after its prime if you 've got a list you 're shopping from you know what you need   the question becomes how will you control your spending best   carefully shopping sales and using coupons or budgeting for a spree within limits

it 's a trade off the answer depends on your risk tolerance seeking higher rewards demands higher risk if you want advice i would recommend hiring an expert to design a plan which meets your needs as a sample point not necessarily right for anyone else i'm considered an aggressive investor and my own spread is still more conservative than many folks i 'm entirely in low cost index funds distributed as with the money tied up in a defined contribution pension fund being treated as a low yield bond some of these have beaten the indexes they 're tracking some have n't my average yield since i started investing has been a bit over not including the company match on part of the 401k which i consider good enough certainly good enough for something that requires near zero attention from me past results are not a guarantee of future performance this may be completely wrong for someone at a different point in their career and/or life and/or finances i 'm posting it only as an example not a recommendation   regarding when to rebalance set some at which things have too far from your preferred distribution value of a fund being 5 off its target percentage in the mix is one rule i 've sometimes used and/or pick some reasonable usually fairly low frequency at which you 'll actively rebalance once a year 4x year whenever you change your car 's oil something like that and/or rebalance by selecting which funds you deposit additional money into whenever you 're adding to the investments note that that last option avoids having to take capital gains which is generally a good thing you want as much of your profit to be long term as possible and to avoid triggering the wash sales rule generally you do not have to rebalance very frequently unless you are doing something that i 'd consider unreasonably risky or unless you 're managing such huge sums that a tiny fraction of a percent still adds up to real money

you have actually asked several questions so i think what i 'll do is give you an intuition about risk neutral pricing to get you started   then i think the answer to many of your questions will become clear physical probability there is some probability of every event out there actually occurring including the price of a stock going up   that 's what we call the physical probability   it 's very intuitive but not directly useful for finding the price of something because price is not the weighted average of future outcomes    for example if you have a stock that is highly correlated with the market and has 50 chance of being worth $ 20 dollars tomorrow and a 50 chance of being worth $ 10 it 's value today is not $ 15   it will be worth less because it 's a risky stock and must earn a premium   when you are dealing with physical probabilities if you want to compute value you have to take the probability weighted average of all the prices it could have tomorrow and then add in some kind of compensation for risk which may be hard to compute risk neutral probability finance theory has shown that instead of computing values this way we can embed risk compensation into our probabilities   that is we can create a new set up probabilities by adjusting the probability of good market outcomes downward and increasing the probability of bad market outcomes   this may sound crazy because these probabilities are no longer physical but it has the desirable property that we then use this set of probabilities to price of every asset out there all of them equity options bonds savings accounts etc   we call these adjusted probabilities that risk neutral probabilities   when i say price i mean that you can multiply every outcome by its risk neutral probability and discount at the risk free rate to find its correct price     to be clear we have changed the probability of the market going up and down not our probability of a particular stock moving independent of the market   because moves that are independent of the market do not affect prices we do n't have to adjust the probabilities of them happening in order to get risk neutral probabilities anyway the best way to think of risk neutral probabilities is as a set of bogus probabilities that consistently give the correct price of every asset in the economy without having to add a risk premium if we just take the risk neutral probability weighted average of all outcomes and discount at the risk free rate we get the price   very handy if you have them risk neutral pricing we ca n't get risk neutral probabilities from research about how likely a stock is to actually go up or down   that would be the physical probability   instead we can figure out the risk neutral probabilities from prices if a stock has only two possible prices tomorrow u and d and the risk neutral probability of u is q then price = + the exponential there is just discounting by the risk free rate   this is the beginning of the equations you have mentioned   the main thing to remember is that q is not the physical probability it 's the risk neutral one   i ca n't emphasize that enough   if you have what u and d can be then there is only one unknown in that equation q. that means you can look at the stock price and solve for the risk neutral probability of the stock going up    the reason this is useful is that you can same risk neutral probability to price the associated option   in the case of the option you do n't know its price today yet but you do know how much money it will be worth if the stock moves up or down   use those values and the risk neutral probability you computed from the stock to compute the option 's price   that 's what 's going on here   to remember the same risk neutral probability measure prices everything out there   that is if you choose an asset multiply each possibly outcome by its risk neutral probability and discount at the risk free rate you get its price   in general we use prices of things we know to infer things about the risk neutral probability measure in order to get prices we do not know

it is perfectly legitimate to adjust your 1099-b income by broker 's fees   publication 17 p 116 specifically instructs taxpayers to adjust their schedule d reporting by broker 's fees form 1099-b transactions    if you sold property such as stocks bonds or certain commodities through a broker you should receive form 1099-b or substitute statement from the broker use the form 1099-b or the substitute statement to complete form 8949 if you sold a covered security in 2013 your broker should send you a form 1099-b or substitute statement that shows your basis this will help you complete form 8949 generally a covered security is a security you acquired after 2010 report the gross proceeds shown in box 2a of form 1099-b as the sales price in column d of either part i or part ii of form 8949 whichever applies however if the broker advises you in box 2a of form 1099-b that gross proceeds sales price less commissions and option premiums were reported to the irs enter that net sales price in column d of either part i or part ii of form 8949 whichever applies include in column g any expense of sale such as broker 's fees commissions state and local transfer taxes and option premiums unless you reported the net sales price in column d if you include an expense of sale in column g enter e in column f you can rely on your own records and judgment if you feel comfortable doing so   brokers often make incomplete tax reporting   this may have been simpler from their perspective if the broker fees were variable or integrated or unknown for a number of clients party to a transaction   if a taxpayer has documentation of the expenses that justify an adjustment then it 's perfectly appropriate to include that in the calculations it is not necessary to report the discrepancy and it may increase scrutiny to include a written addendum   the schedule d form 8949 and form 1099-b will probably together adequately explain the source of the deduction

first and foremost you must remember that they are people something i do n't think you have trouble with but others might when dealing with increasingly desperate financial struggles it 's not uncommon to allow financial trouble to define you or for others to see you only as poor money is a human creation it 's not real like fire or water and money problems is a misnomer whatever problems they have money is only one symptom often dealing with those deeper human problems such as lack of confidence depression fear or behavioral issues is the key to correcting downstream problems like poor money management not that learning how to manage money is n't important but it does n't sound like that is the primary issue in this case westerners tend to view money trouble as distinct from other problems the answer to money troubles is often understood to be more money or smarter money earn more or spend better it helps to step back and look beyond finances what 's going in their lives how does that make them feel do they feel unimportant or valueless how 's their family life do they have good emotional support or are they running on empty trying to fill the with other things like games for example simply telling them to stop purchasing games for example without finding a better replacement just the feelings of shame and discovering the deeper elements of your friends situation is much more complicated than giving them money or paying for a financial counselor neither of which are bad things but it may make a tremendous difference not just in your friends bank account but in their lives as well my wife and i have experienced all of this first hand so i know the predicament you are in we 've even had people in tough financial situations live in our home with us in all the situations in which we 've been close enough to understand context money was n't the primary issue it 's always been something else more often than not family but not always i 've found the book when helping hurts helpful for gaining some perspective though it 's not a perfect match since it deals more with poverty on a grand scale you may still find it helpful in terms of general principles but ultimately each situation is going to be unique and no one size fits all strategy exists to solve all problems in the end building a deeper relationship is the best path toward finding a long term solution

like joetaxpayer said i do n't know of any difference between the backdoor and a regular roth ira contribution besides the issue with existing pre tax ira money so if it is your practice to contribute at the beginning of the year good for you most people wait until the last minute then doing a backdoor seems like the safe choice some people have speculated that hypothetically the irs could use the step transaction doctrine to treat it as a single direct contribution to a roth ira which then would be disallowed and cause you a penalty until you take it out but i have never heard of this happening to anyone as for the paperwork you just need to fill out one extra form at tax time form 8606 you need to complete two parts of it one for the non deductible contribution and one for the conversion it is pretty straightforward although i 've found that it is a pain to do it in tax software another option would be for you to contribute to a roth ira now but when you discover that you 're over the limit at the end of the year re characterize it as a traditional contribution and then convert it back to roth but this way is not good because then there is a long time between the traditional contribution and the roth conversion and earnings during this time will be taxed at conversion

gt;there is no fact that shows taxing the rich is good or bad   sure there is   what is the outcome you are trying to achieve   what are the consequences of your solution i.e. how does your solution turn into a problem   if you are using concepts like fair as guiding design principles for a system we are still able to articulate our of fairness when presented with specific facts   is there going to be clear consensus   no   i agree with you in that sense it is opinion   when you dig down and move beyond magic words like fair and get at the reasoning why a thing is fair or not that is how you build common truth and consensus   that 's how you have a meaningful discussion beyond yeah huh and nah uh     bringing facts allows you to ground out your argument and explore how principles are actually being applied decisions historically and connect choices with how they fit in our larger system   are there definitive answers   you are again right there are not but ambiguity tolerance is a sign of intelligence not a failing   gt;and my point is n't that republicans are bad but that they are covering their harmful economic policies with helpful ones the obvious implication is n't that they are bad people but that we should be critical of their bad policies and applaud their good ones   let me just concede that you are policy focused   it is fairy also to say that stimulus causes the general public not to feel the effects of tax cuts until years later and so there is less resistance to them   that can be true however while still seeing their choices made in relation to those made by democrats     further when you explain the situation you can just as easily switch which side labeled harmful and helpful    are solutions to social problems which entail tax burdens placed consistently on one portion of the population again and again the harm   is it the tax cut which now an existing outlay   or is it an unhealthy relationship where one group expands and the other tries to reign in which leads to systemic instability   moving away from language like harmful helpful good bad fair unfair challenges us to articulate the history the desired outcome and move away from us vs. them thinking   you do n't get an ideal correct solution with that approach but you do get closer to practical good enough ones that way

if anything the price of an etf is more tightly coupled to the underlying holdings or assets than a mutual fund because of the independent creation destruction mechanism with a mutual fund the price is generally set once at the end of each day and the mutual fund manager has to deal with investments and redemptions at that price by the time they get to buying or selling the underlying assets the market may have moved or they may even move the market with those transactions with an etf investment and redemption is handled by independent authorized participants they can create new units of the etf by buying up the underlying assets and delivering them to the etf manager and vice versa they can cancel units by requesting the underlying assets from the etf manager etfs trade intraday i.e. at any time during trading hours and any time the price too far from the underlying assets one of the authorized participants has an incentive to make a small profit by creating or destroying units of the etf also intraday

diversifying but is n't that what mutual funds already do they diversify and reduce stock specific risk by moving from individual stocks to many stocks but you can diversify even further by selecting different fund types e.g. large cal small cap income bond funds international etc   your target date fund probably includes a few different types already and will automatically reallocate to less risky investments as you get close to the target date i would look at the fees of different types of funds and compare them to the historical returns of those funds   you can also use things like morningstar and other ratings as guides but they are generally very large buckets and may not be much help distinguishing between individual funds so to answer the question yes you can diversify further and probably get better returns and lower fees that a target date fund   the question is is it worth your time and effort to do so   you 're obviously comfortable investing for the long term so you might get some benefit by spending a little time looking for different funds to increase your diversification note that etfs do n't really diversify any differently than mutual funds they are just a different mechanism to invest in funds and allow different trading strategies trading during the day derivatives selling short etc

no getting more credit lowers your credit utilization ratio if you do n't use it which raises your credit rating this can also be done by asking for a higher limit on your existing credit card also there is a chance that the company you got your first card from wo n't pull your credit a second time when they go to the underwriter as any extensions of credit lower your credit score although the credit utilization ratio is weighted more heavily

i think you 're looking for the public float public float or the unqualified term may also refer to the number of    outstanding shares in the hands of public investors as opposed to    company officers directors or controlling interest investors    assuming the insider held shares are not traded these shares are the    publicly traded ones the float is calculated by subtracting    restricted shares from outstanding shares as mentioned treasury stock is probably the most narrow definition of restricted stock not publicly traded but shares held by corporate officers or majority investors are often included in the definition as well in any case the balance sheet is indeed a good place to start

the main problem is that everyone graduates from high school almost everyone gets accepted to college and almost nobody who put minimum efforts fails college classes i know that i was an professor and was told i ca n't fail my students except in extreme cases   in the past to graduate from high school was a hard accomplishment getting accepted to college was a hard accomplishment surviving the first year in college was an accomplishment and getting a degree was an accomplishment   those accomplishments in the past gave you excellent benefits benefits of assured respected jobs income security and being the exception   an example in the past to be a teller in the bank you did not have to finish high school just be good in basic math today a teller in the bank one of the lowest paying jobs you can find requires a bachelor degree does the bachelor degree worth it   basically higher education became an industry that accept as many people as possible charge them as much as it can give degrees to undeserving people and those degrees are almost worthless you ca n't do much with a bachelor degree   the solution is to make the standards for high school and college much higher   everything will fall into place then    fewer students who are actually interested in studies and are qualified for their studies will mean better teaching lower costs and much better benefits for those deserve those benefits   chances of this happening big big zero actually the chances of even lower standards for colleges and schools are 100   so for my son i explained to him to not invest much in an excellent and expensive college for worthless degrees instead while he studies work in the area he is interested in and learn from the masters he works with my son is 13 but since being 11 he works yes he makes money with some computer system he 's interested in   personally i worked since i was 13 study and worked all the time got my bachelor and masters and i am doing extremely well i get paid for what i know which zero of it came from my studies and money i spent in those studies

in the case of mutual funds net asset value nav is the price used to buy and sell shares nav is just the value of the underlying assets which are in turn valued by their underlying holdings and future earnings so if a fund hands out a billion dollars it stands to reason their market cap is a billion dollars less shareholder 's net worth is equal in either scenario but after the dividend is paid they are more liquid for people who need investment income to live on dividends are a cheap way to hold stocks and get regular payments versus having to sell part of your portfolio every month   but for people who want to hold their investment in the market for a long long time dividends only increase the rate at which you have to buy for mutual funds this is n't a problem you buy the funds and tell them to reinvest for free so because of that it 's a prohibited practice to sell dividends to clients

there are some great answers on this site similar to what you asked with either a non or a us centric focus i would read those answers as well to give yourself more points of view on early investing there are a few differences between canada and the us from an investing perspective that you should also then consider namely tax rules healthcare and education i 'll get healthcare and education out of the way quickly just note the difference in perspective in canada of having government healthcare putting money into health savings plans or focusing on insurance as a workplace benefit is not a key motivating factor but more a nice to have for education it is more common in canada for a student to either pay for school while working summer part time jobs or at least taking on manageable levels of debt because it is typically not quite as expensive as private colleges in the us there is still somewhat of a culture of saving for your child 's education here but it is not as much of a necessity as it may be in the us from an investing perspective i will quickly note some common though not universal general advice before getting canadian specific i have blatantly stolen the meat of this section from ben miller 's great answer here oversimplify it for me the correct order of investing once you have a solid financial footing some of canadian investing are below for all the tax specific plans i 'm about to mention note that the banks do a very good job here of tricking you into believing they are complex and that you need your hand to be held i have gotten some criminally bad tax advice from banking reps so at the risk of sounding i recommend that you learn everything you can beforehand and only go into your bank when you already know the right answer the account types themselves just involve a few pages of paperwork to open and the banks will often do that for free they make up their fees in offering investment types that earn them management fees once the accounts are created be sure to separate the investments stocks vs bonds etc vs the investment vehicles canada has tax free savings accounts where you can contribute a certain amount of money every year and invest in just about anything you want from bonds to stocks to mutual funds any income you earn in this account is completely tax free you can withdraw these investments any time you want but you ca n't re contribute until january 1st of next year ie you invest $ 5k today in stocks held in a tfsa and they grow to $ 6k you withdraw $ 6k in july no tax is involved on january 1st next year you can re contribute a new $ 6 k and also any additional amounts added to your total limit annually tfsa 's are good for short term liquid investments if you do n't know for sure when you 'll need the money putting it in a tfsa saves you some tax but does n't commit you to any specific plan of action registered retirement savings plans allow you to contribute money based on your employment income accrued over your lifetime in canada the contributions are deducted from your taxable income in the year you make them when you withdraw money from your rrsp the amount you withdraw gets added as additional income in that year ie you invest $ 5k today in stocks held in an rrsp and get a $ 5k deduction from your taxable income this year the investments grow to $ 6k you withdraw $ 6k next year your taxable income increases by $ 6k note that if the investments were held normally outside of an rrsp you would have a taxable gain of only 50 of the total gain but withdrawing the amount from your rrsp makes the gain 100 taxable on january 1st next year you cannot this amount once withdrawn it can not be except for below items rrsp 's are good for long term investing for retirement there are a few factors at play here 1 you get an immediate tax deduction thus increasing the original size of investment by deferring tax to the withdrawal date 2 your investments compound tax free you only pay tax at the end when you withdraw not annually on earnings and 3 many people expect that they will have a lower tax rate when they retire than they do today some warnings about rrsp 's 1 they are less liquid than tfsa 's you ca n't put money in take it out and put it in again in general when you take it out it 's out and therefore useless unless you leave it in for a long time 2 income gets re characterized to be fully taxable no dividend tax credits no reduced capital gains tax rate and 3 there is no guarantee that your tax rate on retirement will be less than today if you contribute only when your tax rate is in the top bracket then this is a good bet but even still in 30 years tax rates might rise by 20 who knows meaning you could end up paying more tax on the back end than you saved in the short term home buyer plan rrsp withdrawals my single favourite piece of advice for young canadians is this if you contribute to an rrsp at least 3 months before you make a down payment on your first house you can withdraw up to $ 25k from your rrsp without paying tax to use for the down payment then over the next ~10 years you need to money back to your rrsp and you will ultimately be taxed when you finally take the money out at retirement this means that contributing up to 25k to an rrsp can multiply your savings available for a down payment by the amount of your tax rate so if you make you 'll save on your 25k deposited turning your down payment into $ getting immediate access to the tax savings while also having access to the cash for a downpayment makes the home buyer plan a solid way to make the most out of your rrsp as long as one of your near term goals is to own your own home registered pension plans are even less liquid than rrsps tax wise they basically work the same you get a deduction in the year you contribute and are taxed when you withdraw the big difference is that there are rules on when you are allowed to withdraw only in retirement barring specific circumstances typically your employer 's matching program if you have one will be inside of an note that 's and rrsp 's reduce your taxes on your employment immediately if you contribute through a work program that means you get the tax savings during the year instead of all at once a year later on april 30th note that i have attempted at all times to keep my advice current with applicable tax legislation but i do not guarantee accuracy research these things yourself because i may have missed something relevant to your situation i may be just plain wrong and tax law may have changed since i wrote this to

what percent of my salary should i save is tightly coupled with its companion what size nest egg should my husband and i have and by what age interestingly mr 's answer 10 is the number that plugs into the equation that i reference jay 's 25x rule is part of this we start with the assumption that one 's required income at retirement will be 80 of their pre retirement income that 's high by some observations low by others a quick look at the expenses that go away in retirement the above can total 35 40 it would be great if it ended there but there are costs that go up the above extra spending is tough to nail down after all you knew what you spent and what 's going away but the new items crapshoot for non native speakers this refers to a game with dice meaning a random event again referencing mr 's answer financial planners whom you could pay to give you a very accurate number i 'm going to disagree with that consider when retirement is 30 years away you do n't know much if i can offer an analogy i once had the pleasure of hearing jim the played by tom in apollo 13 give a speech he said that for the first 99 of the trip to the moon they simply aimed ahead of their target never directly at the moon in this manner i suggest that with so many variables accuracy is impossible it 's a moving target start young take the 10 offered and keep saving every few years stop and see if you are on target if not bump the number a bit   better to turn 50 and find that after a good decade you 've reached your number and can drop your savings to a minimum perhaps just to capture a 401(k match than to turn 50 and realize you 've and need to bump to an unsustainable level imagine planning ahead in 1999 you 've seen 2 great decades of returns and even realizing that could n't continue you plan for a below average 7 this would double your 1999 balance in 10 years instead you saw zero return for a decade in sum when each variable has an accuracy of + you are not going to combine them all and get a number with even 10 accuracy as if were wrong but the pro would tell you 11 is right for you this is as absurd as packaging up a bunch of c rated debt and thinking that enough of this paper would yield a final product that was aaa

to expand a bit on 's answer when i read your question title i assumed that by retirement funds you meant target date funds that are close to their target dates say the 2015 target fund   when i saw that you were referring to all target date funds it occurred to me that examining how such funds modify their portfolios over time would actually help answer your question if you look at a near term target fund you can see that a smaller percent is invested internationally the same way a smaller percent is invested in stocks   it 's because of risk   since it 's more likely that you will need some of the money soon and since you 'll be cashing out said money in us dollars it 's risky to have too much invested in foreign currencies   if you need money that 's currently invested in a foreign currency and that currency happens to be doing poorly against usd at the moment then you 'll lose money simply because you need it now this is the same rationale that goes into target date funds moving from stocks to bonds over time   since the value of a stock portfolio has a lot more natural volatility than the value of a bond portfolio if you 're heavily invested in stocks when you need to withdraw money there 's a higher probability that you 'll need to cash out just when stocks happen to be doing relatively poorly   being invested more in bonds around when you 'll need your money is less risky similarly being more invested in us dollars than in foreign currencies around when you 'll need your money is also less risky

the really simple answer is that compound interest is compound not linear   money invested for longer earns more interest and the sooner you start investing the longer it has to earn interest   these ideas come out of pension investment where 65 is the usual retirement age and what you invest in the 1st ten years of your pension or any other compound interest fund accounts for over 50 of what you will get out 25 to 65 is forty years and $ 100 invested at 7 for 40 years is $ 1400   $ 100 invested every year for 40 years the pot would be worth just under $ 20,000 at 30 years it would be worth under $ 10,000 and at 20 years it would be worth only $   if you double your investment amount every 10 years you would have invested $ and the pot would be worth $ do exactly the same but starting at 35 instead of 25 and your pot would only be worth $

the answer likely depends a bit on which state you are in but this should be true for most states   i do n't know anything about pennsylvania specifically unfortunately the affordable care act created the shop marketplace which allows small businesses to effectively form larger groups for group coverage purposes   shop stands for small business health options program and requires only one common law employee on payroll this would effectively allow you to offer group coverage without having a group   talk to your tax accountant for more details as this is still very new and not necessarily well understood there are some other options all of which i would highly suggest talking to a tax accountant about as well   health reimbursement accounts allow the employer to set aside pre tax funds for the employee to use for approved medical expenses they 're often managed by a benefits company say wageworks etc   that would allow your employee to potentially pick a higher deductible health plan which offers poorer coverage on the individual marketplace with after tax dollars and then supplement with your there are also the concept of employer payment plans where the employer reimburses the employee for their insurance premiums but those are not compatible with the aca for the most part although there seems to be a lot of disagreement as to whether it 's possible to have something effectively the same work see for example this page versus this for example

it 's an effective way to achieve market segmentation without having to ask your customers how rich they are and you get the benefit of finding out additional information like their address email etc the principle is similar to coupons on cereal boxes anybody can get the rebate discount if they go to the effort but people who are cash rich time poor are less likely to do so than those that really need the money joel wrote about this and various other pricing mechanisms a while back i like to reference the article every few weeks it 's well worth a read now if you 're retired and living off of social security $ 7 an hour sounds pretty good so you do it but if you 're a stock analyst at merrill lynch getting paid $ a year to say nice things about piece of junk internet companies working for $ 7 an hour is a joke and you 're not going to clip coupons heck in one hour you could issue buy recommendations on ten piece of junk internet companies so coupons are a way for consumer products companies to charge two different prices and effectively segment their market into two mail in rebates are pretty much the same as coupons with some other like the fact that they reveal your address so you can be direct marketed to in the future

my point of view is that monopolies happen because politics whether that 's politicians trade boards or oversight allows them to occur it 's a failure of politicians in allowing it to happen not a failure in business as they 're just pursuing their profits when business started to interfere in politics to gain market advantages that 's when monopolies started to form competitive marketplaces are self sustaining unless you create the conditions for monopolies to form   once you what price you sell a good at you 're going down a slippery slope of communism it 's a free market and companies should be able to freely sell a good at whatever price they want if other companies ca n't compete in the market at that price then they are n't as efficient as the other company and it would hurt the economy in the long run to have them operating at higher costs than similar companies who can do it better   i did n't say that the only exit for a startup is acquisition but i digress the reality is that the tech market is dominated by large businesses who in politics to maintain their position such as google and apple colluding in hiring apple and googles wage fixing cartel involved dozens more companies over one million this is bad for everyone and especially for startups and needs to be so that startups and big companies alike can competitively challenge each other in the tech sectors   i think we 're arguing for roughly the same thing but it seems that it 's a different between equality vs equity i might be wrong however

negative yields on bonds is opposite of getting profit on your investment this is some kind of new practice from world wide financial institute   the interest rate is for ten years so a $ 100,000 bond under    those terms would be discounted to $ give or take no actually what you are going to get out from this investment is after 10 years when this investment is mature for liquidation you will get return not even your principle $ 100,000 but principle $ 100,000 minus negative yields times 10 years assume the rates are on simple annual rate   now anyone may wander why should someone going to buy this kind of investment where i am actually giving away not only possible profit also losing some of principle amount   this might looks real odd but there is other valid reason for issuing investing on such kind of bond   from investor prospective every asset has its own expense for keeping ownership of it this is also true for money currency depending on its size and other investment possibility and risk factor the same way people maintain checking account with virtually no visible income vs. savings account where bank issue some positive rate of interest with various time factor like annually half yearly monthly people with lower level of income but steady on flow choose savings where business go for checking one think of millions of ideal money with no secure investment opportunity have to option in real option one to keeping this large amount of money in hand arranging all kind of security which involve extra expense risk and headache where option two is invest on bond issued by government of country owner of that amount will go for second one even with negative yields on bonds where he is paying in return of security and risk free of getting it back on time   on issuing government prospective here government actually want people not to keep money idle investing bonds but find any possible sector to invest which might profitable for both investor + community ultimately country   this is a basic understanding on issue buy selling of negative interest bearing bond on market    hope i could explain it here not to mention english is not my 1st language at all so ignore my typo grammatical error and welcome to fix it   cheers

assuming the question is will they close it for inactivity alone the answer is nope unequivocally update < my answer is geared to credit cards issues by companies that deal in credit not merchandise i.e. store cards retailer cards etc   retailers like amazon etc want to sell goods and are in the credit card business to generate sales   banks and credit companies about whom i am referring make their money primarily on interest and secondarily on service charges either point of use charged to the vendor that accepts payment or fees charged to the user > the only major issuer i will say that it might be possible is discover because i never kept a discover card   i also do n't keep department store cards which might possibly do this but i do doubt it in either of those cases too my answer is based on having 2 amex cards and blue and multiple other visa mc 's that i never use and most of these i have not for over 10 + years since i am also presuming that you are also not talking about an account that charges a yearly or other maintenance fee   why would they keep the account open with the overhead statements and other mailings etc because you might use it   you might not be able to pay it off each month   because you might end up paying thousands in interest over many years   the pennies they pay for maintaining your account and sending you new cards with chip technology etc are all worth the gamble of getting recouped from you   this is why sales people waste their time with lots of people who will not buy their product even though it costs them time and money to prospect because they might buy naturally there are a multitude of reasons for canceling a card but inactivity is not one   i have no less than 10 + inactive cards one that has a balance and two i use infrequently   i really would not mind if they closed all those accounts but they wo n't so enjoy your amex knowing that your visa will be there when you need want it the bank that issues your visa is banking on it presuming you do n't foul up financially cheers

their workers food budgets and medical budgets that is money that ought to be coming out of walmart 's pocket   they are not forced to work there it is really their choice they also have the ability to supplement their own budgets by working more or at another company this is a choice and the safety nets that the taxpayer subsidizes are supporting these choices and are not a direct support for walmart people have free will if you ca n't understand this then we may as well stop the argument right here   everybody who does n't come from money is forced to work unless you do n't mind living outside without medical care fresh food or family if you happen to have poor access to education or failed to achieve for some reason then you 're forced to take what you can get   i grew up poor government housing the works i find it amusing that the majority of people who want to argue about this type of topic with me actually come from a much more well off situation than me and then want to make it sound like they know what they are talking about i never blamed low paying companies for my situation my parents could have and should have worked harder and the same goes for many of my poor friends growing up i see human beings as powerful amazing things not victims who are helpless to the whims of others   gt;if that job does n't offer a living wage than you 'll have to pick up a few extra shifts or another job altogether   this is my point exactly it 's just reality folks i 'm in that situation myself right now but i 'm not blaming a business owner for trying to make money themselves sometimes you 're given a shitty situation life has dealt you a shitty hand and you have to find your way out of it it 's hard but sometimes that 's life   gt;let 's talk about the one that you espouse where high school dropouts get to negotiate with corporations for a living wage and if it does n't work out that 's just fine after all nobody is forcing them to take a job   i do n't remember saying high school dropouts get to negotiate for a living wage i 'm pretty sure i said i support legislation that will force these corporations to pay a living wage please do n't put words in my mouth   gt;people should n't have to work more than 40 hours a week just to put food on the table or pay their medical bills   i agree i think the government subsidized by taxpayers obviously should provide 100 free medical care to it 's citizens this should n't be an issue about a company not paying enough to support an entire family a greeter at walmart was never supposed to be able to feed a family of five sorry and it 's never been that way in the past some jobs are not meant to be high paying and should n't be but i do support universal healthcare and at least a living wage enough to support oneself in one 's city

i would pass on their deal if they will only match if you invest in their stock   think about when if the company falls on bad times what happens to the stock of a company when bad times come the board of directors will reduce or eliminate the dividend payout   current and potential investors will take notice current owners of the stock will sell potential investors will avoid buying the price of the stock with go down and quite likely the company will lay off workers   if when that happens you would find yourself without a job and holding almost worthless stock as your savings that would be quite a bad situation to be in

yes you should incorporate if you plan on seriously investing in real estate this not only limits liability in terms of paying back the debt but also in case your tenants sue you   pass through entities typically an llc but it depends on the state if they have good or bad llc laws pennsylvania is a state where you would not want to incorporate as an llc other options include s corps and   loans are taken out by corporations against the property typically mortgage loans are non recourse if you set up a company for each property this further insulates you against the bank capturing other properties within the pool however recourse can still end up getting you on the hook personally for the loans these typically include voluntary bankruptcy you would very rarely have to file for bankruptcy anyway for your real estate investments at worst it will end in foreclosure but banks typically would prefer deed in lieu just because it is faster and easier for them too you just turn over the keys and walk away it will have very little impact on your personal finances or record everyone in real estate walks away from properties and leaves them with the bank it 's a fact of doing business and your lender should have been comfortable owning your property at the basis they lent money to you if they were n't they were just stupid   yes every real estate investment requires equity in the property typically it 's a 20 equity check but if the lender the property to a lower value than what you purchased it for you may have to line up more expensive financing

the real value of a share of stock is the current cash value of all dividends the owner will receive plus the current cash value of the final liquidation if any   since people with different needs may judge the current cash value of an income stream differently there would be a market basis for people to buy and sell stocks even if everyone could predict all future payouts perfectly if shareholders knew that a company would n't pay any dividends until it was liquidated in the year it would pay $ then each share would in 2016 effectively be a fifty year zero coupon bond with a $ 2000 maturity value   while some investors would be willing to trade in such an instrument the amount of money a company could charge for such an instrument would be far lower than the money it could charge for one with payouts that were more evenly distributed through time since the founders of most companies want their companies to be around for a long time that would mean that shareholders would have no expectation of their shares ever yielding anything of value within any foreseeable timeframe   even those who would be more interested in share price appreciation than dividends would n't be able to see share prices rise if there was n't any likelihood of the stock being bought by someone who wanted the dividends

so obviously realtors are not economists and have a strong bias here   a lot of actual features the tax deductions economists think the mortgage deduction is nonsense and does n't actually promote home ownership countries without the deduction have about the same ownership rates as the u.s.   worth noting that this proposal does n't actually scrap the mortgage deduction it just makes the standard deduction bigger some people will end up better off with the new standard deduction and those with more expensive homes can keep using the mortgage deduction   this is one of the few proposals coming out of the republican congress that actually helps poor people more than rich people

i say before investing your real capital into the stock market play around on the virtual stock exchange game it let 's you invest with virtual capital and you can gain experience with the stock market i would n't start investing in stock until i 'm sure i can cover losses though if you do intend to invest stocks so early in your career then you should learn how to read sec filings not necessary but helpful in understanding how investors think such as documents so you can predict profitability and growth of companies you invest in once you become a veteran of the stock market game you probably wo n't need to read the sec filings into too much detail especially if you have a diverse portfolio good luck the one takeaway from this message would probably be stop and play around on virtual stocks before yourself in the real thing

although this has been touched upon in comments i think the following line from the currently accepted answer shows the biggest issue there is a clear difference between investing and gambling the reality is that the difference is n't that clear at all tens of comments have been written arguing in both directions and looking around the internet entire essays have been written arguing both positions the underlying emotion that seems to shape this discussion primarily is whether investing especially in the stock market is a form of gambling people who do invest in this way tend to get relatively emotional whenever someone argues that this is a form of gambling as gambling is considered a negative thing the simple reality of human communication is that words can be ambiguous and the way investors will use the words investments and gambles will differ from the way it is used by gamblers and once again different from the way it 's commonly used what i definitely think is made clear by all the different discussions however is that there is no single distinctive trait that allows us to differentiate investing and gambling the result of this is that when you take dictionary definitions for both terms you will likely end up including lottery tickets as a valid form of investment   that still however leaves us with a situation where we have two terms with a strong overlap which have a distinctive meaning in communication and the original question whether buying lottery tickets is an investment over on there is an absolutely amazing strongly recommended essay which explores countless of different traits in search of a difference between investing and gambling and they came up with the following two definitions investing any activity in which money is put at risk for the purpose of making a profit and which is characterized by some or most of the following in approximately descending order of importance sufficient research has been conducted the odds are favorable the behavior is risk averse a systematic approach is being taken emotions such as greed and fear play no role the activity is ongoing and done as part of a long term plan the activity is not motivated solely by entertainment or compulsion ownership of something tangible is involved a net positive economic effect results gambling any activity in which money is put at risk for the purpose of making a profit and which is characterized by some or most of the following in approximately descending order of importance little or no research has been conducted the odds are unfavorable the behavior is risk seeking an approach is being taken emotions such as greed and fear play a role the activity is a discrete event or series of discrete events not done as part of a long term plan the activity is significantly motivated by entertainment or compulsion ownership of something tangible is not involved no net economic effect results the very interesting thing about those definitions is that they capture very well the way those terms are used by most people and they even acknowledge that a lot of investors are gambling and that a few gamblers are investing read the essay for more on that and this fits well with the way those two concepts are understood by the public so in those definitions normally buying a lottery ticket would indeed not be an investment but if we take for example 's operation example if you have $ 1000 and need $ 2000 by next week or else you ca n't have an operation and you will die and you ca n't find anyone to give you a loan your optimal strategy is to gamble your $ 1000 at the best odds you can get with a possible outcome of $ 2000 so even if you only have a 1/3 chance of winning and getting that operation it 's still the right bet if you ca n't find a better one this can suddenly change the perception and turn gambling into high risk investing

first ianal this is going to depend on the kind of points if it 's an internal point system that the business is doing on their own then they may very well give you that many extra points they may really not care specially if the cost of the points is low enough remember that steak dinner that you paid $ 60 for only really cost them $ 2 and that they use $ 60 worth of points on it   if the point system is tied to a bank or credit card then it 's far more likely that the just use them is not the proper answer the company doing the reimbursing is giving the location $ 60 and using your points the points have a much higher value   with that said your responsibility is to notify and follow their rules so notify them in writing and use the rewards card as you normally would if your being honest then the worst that happens is that your point balance is a little negative because you spent 100 points but really only had 98 after adjustment   most likely if your being honest they will just eat the few points over that you went on accident   if you get an answer in writing to just keep the points then i guess you know where your daughter 's wedding reception will be let 's hope it 's a place of course as a good person or maybe a stupid person i should call them wait 30 minutes in the queue and then try to explain the issue to the service desk i actually did that and the guy thought i am nuts to even call and told me to just use them they are yours now i do n't feel like calling again and again until i get someone that believes it just to return them their points you will want to do this in writing email will work but you really want a paper trail either way i could just toss the card and forget about it however i had quite some points on it that really belong to me so that feels like i pay for their fault there is no need to do this it 's like a bank error talk to them and they will give you an answer in the mean time do your best to only use the points you actually have use them and play stupid it 's not my duty to check their math right probably nobody will ever care let 's keep religious considerations out here what would be the consequences if they do realize their error some day in the far future i understand this borders on a legal question nope do n't do this if you play dumb and spend 5000 points when you know you only have around 100 best case scenario you end up with points effectively canceling the benefit of the card you may also be banned form the program the location the network etc worst case scenario they want the monetary value of the points and sue you for it and the legal fees it may even be considered fraud   tl;dr use your card but be honest and handle the mistake in writing

the assumption that house value appreciates 5 per year is unrealistic over the very long term real house prices has stayed approximately constant a house that is 10 years old today is 11 years old a year after so this phenomenon of real house prices staying constant applies only to the market as a whole and not to an individual house unless the individual house is maintained well one house is an extremely poorly diversified investment what if the house you buy turns out to have a mold problem you can lose your investment almost overnight in contrast to this it is extremely unlikely that the same could happen on a well diversified stock portfolio although it can happen on an individual stock thus if non leveraged stock portfolio has a nominal return of 8 over the long term i would demand higher return say 10 from a non leveraged investment to an individual house because of the greater risks if you have the ability to diversify your real estate investments a portfolio of diversified real estate investments is safer than a diversified stock portfolio so i would demand a nominal return of 6 over the long term from such a diversified portfolio to decide if it 's better to buy a house or to live in rental property you need to gather all of the costs of both options including the opportunity cost of the capital which you could otherwise invest elsewhere the real return of buying a house instead of renting it comes from the fact that you do not need to pay rent not from the fact that house prices tend to appreciate which they wo n't do more than inflation over a very long term for my case i live in finland in a special case of near rental property where you pay 15 of the building cost when moving in and get the 15 payment back when moving out and then pay a monthly rent that is lower than the market rent the property is subsidized by government provided loans i have calculated that for my case living in this property makes more sense than purchasing a market priced house but your situation may be different

if something in any transaction in life financial or otherwise make you feel comfortable and the choice is between saving money with one thing versus another do n’t sell your personal needs short pay more elsewhere that treats you the way you expect to be treated in the long run the $ $ $ you save in a cheaper transaction might cost you more in the headaches and annoyance you have to swallow in dealing with this bargain in the future your question is this do his sales tactics indicate other underlying problems how can i deal effectively with those tactics and you state this as well to make a long story short the dealer 's aggressive sales tactics have made me somewhat uncomfortable and finally ask how can i deal effectively with those tactics okay first and foremost if you feel discomfort in anything in life not just a financial situation just walk away you might have to say no when doing this but it ’s not always the case you will have to counter aggression with aggression and specifically in the case of a purchase like this you need to also ask yourself is this discount being offered me worth the headache i am getting at the end of the day money is meaningless and has it ’s main worth as an economic motivator someone has a need and someone else has something that can solve that need what would it take for the side of need to connect to the side of solution to that need this is the basic concept surrounding all economics so that said i have personally avoided buying things for less money and paid slightly more elsewhere for a service experience that made me feel comfortable at the end of the day if you feel happy in the transaction it helps in the long run more than let ’s say the $ 20 to $ 40 you save by buying from someone else also on the side of customer service this person ’s sales techniques sound like something out of a very old fashioned sales playbook nowadays it ’s all about relationships and service the immediate sale is not as important for competent and reputable businesses because they know a better customer service experience will bring people back so it does n’t matter how long this guy has been in business it could be that he ’s been in business a long time just because he has been in business a long time that said and in the case of musical instruments maybe this guy is really good at care and upkeep of instruments but has crappy sales techniques keep that in mind as well and just push back on their sales methods for things like musical instruments people might be jerks on the sales side but in the maintenance and repair side they are great will you need to go to them if when your instrument needs repair or you do n’t care at the end of the day go with your gut and if your gut says no then just go somewhere else and spend your money on an item you like from a place that treats you the way you need

rebalancing a portfolio helps you reduce risk sell high and buy low i 'll use international stocks and large cap us stocks   they both have ups and downs and they do n't always track with each other international might be up while large cap us stocks are down and vice versa if you started with 50 international and 50 large cap stocks and 1 year later you have 75 international and 25 large cap stocks that means that international stocks are doing relatively well to large cap stocks     comparing only those two categories large cap stocks are on sale relative to international stocks    now move so you have 50 in each category and you 've realized some of the gains from your international investment sell high and added to your large cap stocks buy low the reason to rebalance is to lower risk    you are spreading your investments across multiple categories to manage risk    if you do n't rebalance you could end up with 95 in one category and 5 in another which means 95 of your portfolio is tied to the performance of a single asset category i try to rebalance every 12 months and usually get it done by every 18 months   i like being a hands off long term investor and this has proven often enough to beat the s&p500

to a certain extent small cap companies will in general follow the same trends as large cap companies the extent of this depends on numerous factors but a prime reason is the presence of systemic risk i.e. the risk to the entire market in simple terms is the risk that your portfolio will approach as you increase its diversification and it 's why hedging is also important   that being said small cap businesses will in general likely do worse than large cap stocks for several reasons this was is certainly the case in the great recession   small cap businesses have on average higher betas which is a measure of a company 's risk compared to the overall market this means that small cap companies on average outperform large cap companies during boom times but it also means that they suffer more on average during bear times the debate over whether or not the standard beta is still useful for small cap companies continues however some economists feel that small cap companies are better measured against the russell 2000 or similar indexes instead of the s&p 500   small cap companies may face problems accessing or maintaining access to lines of credit during the great recession major lenders decreased their lending to small businesses which might make it harder for them to weather the storm   on a related point small businesses might not have as large an asset base to use as collateral for loans in bad times one notable large cap company that used its asset base to their advantage was ford which gave banks partial ownership of its factories during hard times this a gave ford a good amount of cash with which to continue their short term operations and b gave the banks a vested interest in keeping ford 's lines of credit open ford struggled but it never faced the financial problems of gm and chrysler   despite political rhetoric about main street vs. wall street small businesses do n't receive as much government aid in times of crisis as some large cap companies do for example the small business lending fund a brilliant but poorly implemented idea in 2010 allocated less than $ 30 billion to small businesses the actual amount loaned was considerably less compare that to the amounts loaned out under tarp discussions about corporate lobbying power aside small businesses are n't as crucial to the overall stability of the financial system small businesses do n't always have the manpower to keep up with changes in regulation when the dodd frank act passed large banks as an example could hire more staff to understand it and adapt to it relatively easily small banks however do n't always have the resources to invest in such efforts   there are other reasons some of which are industry specific but these are some of the basic ones   if you want visual confirmation that small cap businesses follow a similar trend here is a graph of the russell 2000 and s&p 500 indexes   here is a similar graph for the russell 2000 and the dow jones industrial average    if you wanted to confirm this technically and control for the numerous complicated factors overlap between indexes systemic risk seasonal adjustment etc just ask and i 'll try to run some numbers on it when i have a chance keep in mind too that looking at a pretty picture is no substitute for rigorous financial econometrics a basic start would be to look at the correlation between the indexes which i calculate as and respectively as you can see they 're pretty close once again however the reality is more complicated technically and a sufficiently detailed analysis is beyond my capabilities just a quick side note these graphs show the logarithm of the values of the indexes which is a common statistical nuance that is used when comparing time series with radically different magnitudes but similar trends   s&p500 and russell 2000 data came from yahoo finance and the dow jones industrial average data came from federal reserve economic data fred per usual i try to provide code whenever possible if i used it here is the stata code i used to generate the graphs above this code assumes the presence of and downloaded from yahoo finance and downloaded from fred in the current directory   fidelity published an article   on the subject that you might find interesting and seeking alpha has several pieces related to small cap vs. large cap returns that might be worth a read too

if you 're toward stocks because you have a long time horizon you 're looking at them for the right reasons i 'm twice your age   i have a mortgage two of them actually a wife and a six year old   i ca n't really justify being terribly risky with my money because i have others depending on my income you 're   unless you 've gotten a really early start on life and already have a family you can take on a lot more risk than stocks   you have time to try things income things that i wish i would have tried at that age like starting a business   the only thing that would push me to do that now would be losing my job and that would n't be the rush i 'd like that 's not to say that you ca n't make a lot of money with stocks but if that 's what you 're looking to do really dig in and research them   you have the time   whether the tide makes all boats rise or sink is a matter of timing the economy but some of the companies will ride the waves   it takes time to find those more often than not which blue chips are likely to ride the waves   i have no clue   but i 'm not invested in them at the moment so it does n't matter

if he did n't lie i do n't see the issue he did not force anyone to buy anything his opinion was stock x is good he publicized it and it turned out to be true at least temporary what 's wrong with it   it is customary for people who have either fiduciary duty towards the clients or are perceived as independent analysts to disclose their interest and potential conflict of interest lest they lose the respect of the public as independent and trustworthy sources of financial information jackson never had that express or implied and never had the duty to provide anybody with impartial financial analysis so he can say anything he wants he can invest into the company and promote it and make money from it is n't it what was called business once why is it even being questioned

i know you 're making a joke but i really think tesla could kill off train transportation entirely if you can get in a car anywhere in the country and travel anywhere else in the country more or less in a straight line instead of following the few rail routes available then it just comes down to price if they 're able to make long distance travel affordable with cheap renewable electricity charging up the cars then will be history

no you 're incorrect because there 's protectionist countries that are doing just fine but it 's all the socialist top down government controlled economies that are failing it is not protectionist polices that ruined venezuela this is well known it 's that you are trying to argue otherwise

credit reports have line items that if all is well say paid as agreed a car loan almost certainly gets reported in your case it probably says the happy paid as agreed   it will continue to say that if you pay it off in full you can get the happy paid as agreed from a credit card too   you can get it by paying the balance by the due date every month or paying the or anything in between on time but you 'll blow less money in interest if you pay each bill in full each month you do n't have to carry a balance in the us you can get a free credit report once a year from each of the three credit bureaus here 's the way to do that with minimal upsell cross sell hassles   in your situation you 'd probably be smart to ask for a credit report every four months from each bureau in turn so you can see how things are going   they do n't give you your fico score for free but you do n't really care about that until you 're going for a big loan like for a condo it might be good to take a look at one of those free credit reports real soon as you prepare to close out your car loan if you need other loans consider working with a credit union they sometimes offer better interest rates and they often are diligent about making credit bureau reports for their good customers they help you build credit you mentioned wanting to cut back on insurance coverage it 's a worthy goal but it 's generally called self insuring in the business   if you cancel your collision coverage and then wreck your car you absorb the cost of replacing it so think about your personal ability to handle that kind of risk

how can i get quarterly information about private companies ask the owner(s   you have a relationship and they 're interested in helping you they will likely tell you no as there 's no compelling reason for them to do so   it 's a huge benefit of not taking a company public

the article appears to be making the opposite point it thinks it is making   the author appears to be talking about income disparity but if more and more people are making 6 figure salaries to the extent that it 's no longer a rich people thing that would mean income disparity is shrinking at least if you only look at salary alone and not equity which is really what wealth is about   the top 1 or even 10 should be making vastly more than the middle class that 's to be expected   otherwise why would they be 1   from time to time the income disparity folks do n't seem to understand their own points

if you are willing to use one main credit card for shopping use a grocery points rewards card like pc financial mastercard    pay for the groceries using the card to earn points and use those points to reduce costs   the only limitation is that you must shop at superstore no frills it works out to $ 1 = 10 points and 20,000 points = $ 20   so that works out to spend $ 1 to earn back $ 0.01

worth of electricity to generate   the cost of bitcoin always tracks the price of bitcoin    there is a fixed amount of bitcoin available to be mined every day   the cost to mine bitcoin rises because of competition they increase the difficulty of the problems to maintain a fixed supply of bitcoin   the electricity cost to mine bitcoin is directly related to the amount of miners which is directly related to the current cost of bitcoin more people want to mine when the price is high   if you really think about it what you are really saying is that the intrinsic value of bitcoin is the value of bitcoin its a completely circular mirage

for now it could possibly happen assuming there are that many people wanting to offload their coins and recent charts are showing that trading volume is pretty damn low right now even with prices being so high   i 'm going to guess most people with bitcoin plan to hold onto it for a while   considering bitcoin can only be divisible to 8 decimal points 1 bitcoin = 1 ^ 8 prices will start to skyrocket once supply and if demand continues to rise   or so it should if it ever reaches that point   most naysayers believe it 'll die before it reaches that point

as said by others buying shares of a company will not support it directly but let 's think about two example companies company a which has 90 stocks owned by supporters and company b which has only 1 of stocks owned by supporters both companies release bad news for example profits have decreased in company b most investors might want to sell their stock quickly and the price will plummet in company a the supporters continue believing in the company and will not want to sell it the price will drop less usually but it can drop even more if the sellers of company a are very desperate to get rid of the stock so why is it important for the company to have a high stock price in the short term it 's not important one example is that the company can release more stocks and receive more financing by doing that other reasons are listed here

because bankers are crooks is a very close answer just accept the truth that financial industry is the only service industry that could turn into giant parasite chopping pieces from real economy i am not anti financial because greed is not banker 's fault but just one significant part of human nature every human being has greed and fear built in it but financial industry is the only one which is built on exploiting greed and fear governments are throwing gasoline into that fire in desperate extinguish attempts trying to regulate but only making it worse with all that counter counter terrorism and counter everything efforts ordinary people will be hurt as always

i normally just do a buy limit at the price i want to buy it at then it executes when it 's that price or lower but there 's still a chance you might purchase some shares at a larger price but since we 're small fry and using brokerages there 's not much we can do about it

the role of the market maker is to make sure there is a bid and ask on a particular stock   that 's it   the market maker ensures that there is a price at which you can buy and a price at which you can sell immediately but these are not necessarily the best prices   the majority of trades do not involve market makers and occur between two third parties whoever said a market order trades with the market maker is thinking of the way stock markets were years ago not the way they are now market orders are supposed to execute immediately and at one time trading with the market makers was the method for executing immediately if you issue a market order today it executes with the best available limit on the other wide of the trade   this may or may not involve a party that identifies as a market maker

banks also need in house web developers so if you do n't want to switch from doing that then it should be possible especially if you are up for working with mobile ubiquitous computing side of things that seems to be the next step for retail banking anyway for investment banking i 'm not really sure of the need of web developers i guess some offer different forms of online platforms e trading stuff but most of what developers do is internal stuff that never see outside customers those could be built using similar technologies i guess

there are services usually associated with real estate agents that provide apartment search services for relocating professionals i was very when i was offered the use of such a service and did better on my own but i did have the company paying for a hotel room while i searched so i had time to investigate alternative channels and in fact found and took a place being offered by a co worker 's father but if you 're really looking for a room in a shared living situation and you are n't already on campus talking to other students i agree that the school 's housing office or the dorms and/or houses and/or independent living groups are your best bet   in a college town most roommate openings get snapped up pretty quickly and are more likely to go to someone who is a known or for quantity

some good honest questions there will be people who come in here and claim one side or the other but the answer is yes   it 's a little bit of all those things   some of those things actually on each other as one a problem the other worsens as well so y is bad but is it because of x     for example overly if people ca n't get a loan for a new home would this effect the number of new homes being built   if home builders ca n't sell homes at a certain price because banks are n't willing to lend x dollars to someone with y credit worthiness they drop their prices to y credit which effects used homes sales which means more people are still under water for their current home value and chose not to sell their used home which leads to less inventory as well     there 's a million scenarios a million   none of which i have

@joetaxpayer gave a great response to your first question here are some thoughts on the other two 2 transaction fees for mutual funds are tied to the class of shares you 're buying and will be the same no matter where you buy them a shares have a front end load the fee charged and the lowest expenses and can be liquidated without any fees b shares have no up front load but come with a 4 7 year period where they will charge you a fee to liquidate technically called contingent deferred sales charge and slightly higher management fees after which they often will convert to a shares c shares have the highest management fees and usually a to 18-month period where they will charge a small percentage fee if you liquidate there are lots of other share classes available but they are tied to special accounts such as managed accounts and 401-k plans not all companies offer all share classes c shares are intended for shorter timeframes eg 2 5 years a and b shares work best for longer times use a b share if you 're sure you wo n't need to take the money out until after the fee period ends most fund companies will allow you to exchange funds within the same fund family without charging the edit no load funds do n't charge a fee in or out usually they are a great option if they are available to you most self service brokerages offer them few full service brokerages offer them the advantage of a brokerage versus personal accounts at each fund is the brokerage gives you a single view of things and a single statement and buying and selling is easy and convenient 3 high turnover rates in bond funds depending on how actively the portfolio is managed the fund company may deliver returns as a mix of both interest and capital gains and the management expenses may be high with a lot of churn in the underlying portfolio bond values fall as interest rates rise so at least in the usa be prepared to see the share values of the fund fall in the next few years the biggest risk of a bond fund is that there is no maturity date so there is no point in time that you have an assurance that your original investment will be returned to you

most likely this will not work they way you think first things first to get a loan the bank needs to accept your collateral note that this is not directly related to the question what you plan to do with the loan example you have a portfolio of stocks and bonds worth usd 2 million the bank decides to give you a loan of usd 1 million against that collateral the bank does n't care if you will use the loan to invest in foreign re or use it up in a casino it has your collateral as safety so from the way you describe it i take it you do n't have the necessary local collateral but you wish to use your foreign investments as such in this case it really does n't matter where you live or where you incorporate a company the bank will only give you the loan if it accepts the foreign collateral from professional experience with this exact question i can tell you there are very few banks that will lend against foreign property and there are even less banks if any that will lend against foreign projects to sum it up just forget banks you might find a private lender to help you out but it will cost you dearly the best option you have is to find a strategic partner who can cough up the money you need but since he is taking the bigger risk he will also take the bigger profit share

the fed does n't exactly have a specific schedule when they decide to create a new dollar instead they engage in open market operations creating and destroying money as is necessary to preserve a certain interest rate for lending and borrowing it 's an ongoing process when the fed meets periodically and they see that inflation is getting out of hand they will raise that rate when they see that the economy is weak they will lower it they change the target rate from time to time but they seldom tell people exactly what they 'll do in advance aside from them recently saying that rates will remain incredibly low for an extended period of time there are people who trade futures contracts based on what they think these rates will be and the fed does publish information on what the market thinks the probabilities are that 's probably the closest thing to telling you how much and when if you want to know about the size of the money supply ask the federal reserve you probably want series money stock measures for an explanation of what the data series there means ask wikipedia you 're probably interested in m2 because that 's what actually affects the economy though is closer to what they actually print currency bills and coins and deposits at the central bank if you 're concerned about the actual real value of your dollar dropping the actual value drop is better understood by looking at either the inflation rate or an exchange rate against a foreign currency and depending on what you were hoping to use that dollar for there are a couple of different inflation rates the standard inflation rate which measures what happens in your day to day life is the consumer price index published by the bls there are a variety of forecasts of this but i 'm not aware of any official government agency forecasts

gt a the base value from infrastructure is derived on a per capita basis it is a fixed cost as opposed to a variable one in other words roads are just as useful to me as they are to you regardless of my net worth a tank a missile a police officer protects me the same as it does anyone else   a trucking company making millions of dollars a year on us highways derives more value from the roads than i do    honestly anyone who says that they do n't need to pay for roads because of their level of benefit from them is limited and i will call you a liar unless you are living in a box in the woods 100s of miles away from civilization you absolutely rely on the road system even if you never set foot on it    though at the same time a national highway system was something no business would ever make as it derives too little value for an individual business for the scale required to reach enough of the market this is a perfect example of a project that is good for society but wo n't see the tab picked up by business voluntarily    gt b as a percentage of income infrastructure is far more valuable to low income individuals than high income individuals a simple example if i have $ 5 m in net worth i can invest it in the stock market and stay home if you do n't have that option you need to go to work and that will likely require roads i wo n't be taking unemployment benefits but you are far more likely to and so on   it is foolish to assume your market value increases do not rely on infrastructure to happen as much as paper trading inflates value for the most part it is still tied to some kind of real work or rather the expectation of being done somewhere that assumption of ability for a corporation to serve it 's shareholders is based on the fact that companies have infrastructure needs handled and that expanding delivery to three new markets wo n't be hampered because the company must first complete the highway to serve these markets   the existence of infrastructure not only supports the market but allows you to exploit it the internet here makes a great example prior to funding and a push by the government to standardize military and academic networks and technology as well as make more powerful in order to stay ahead in tech race we had a mish mash of proprietary networks with very poor abilities to use them today we have the internet a largely private system today however it would not exist without the involvement and funding from the government for the multiple programs that led to it 's existence   gt c the activities of business owners generate massive tax revenues these far outweigh their personal utility from infrastructure   if the taxes really outweighed utility businesses would not operate in the area at all the thing is they do n't and taxes are not preventing businesses from growing     gt d society captures the majority of individual commercial efforts estimates vary but typically 85 in other words if i generate $ 10.00 of value as an entrepreneur i will realistically be able to capture only $ 1.50 of that   yes but that is because unless you are doing it all yourself then you did not generate that $ 10 as a business owner you are in charge of managing resources to help generate that $ 10 you yourself however did not generate that $ 10 you had employees and contractors and people managing your building payroll and yes even taxes every person involved in getting the product or service from idea to the door are all part of that $ 10 if your efforts in that co are netting you 15 of the total then you are beating the market already and i am not sure what your problem is if you are looking to double or triple your investments you are looking for las vegas not wall st or main st.   i think the issue i see among people with your opinion is a failure to understand 2nd and 3rd order effects your bubble extends to what you do in your daily life and the parts of it you visibly see and touch the world you see and touch every day is supported and made comfortable by a whole system and people whom you will never see or know
