no in your situation it is not possible mostly only three types of accounts are available to individuals so a complete foreigner can open account in india only if he is working in india a type of savings account and that account too will be linked to his resident status if he leaves work he needs to close this account edit there are business accounts and current accounts but those are available only to businesses further read at sbi gives a good snapshot

credits are expensive so it 's a great advantage to pay in cash obviously it 's even more an advantage to pay in cash for a house or a car of course if you can afford it but as annoying as it could be there are some services where you 're out of option to pay in cash or even to pay by bank transfer one of the most prominent examples google play ok as i 've learned there are prepaid cards but for example has none with the further expansion of internet and e economy there will be more cases like that where paying in cash is no more an option booking of hotels or is already mentioned there are some that provide no other booking option that giving your credit card number however even if the do for example bank transfer of say 20 as reservation fee please note that international money transfer can be very expensive and credit card is usually given only for security in case you do n't come and if you do come and pay in cash no money is taken = no expensive fee for international money transfer and/or currency exchange rate

hi    this is treated as a electronic balance transfer there may be a fee for performing this cash advance interest will apply on the you may get a teaser rate for a limited amount of time after it expires the normal cash advance interest rate for the credit card will kick in    check your credit card statement somewhere you 'll see a section listing the interest rates one for retail purchases one for cash transactions    do not do this if you need to borrow money to pay off a large debt do one of the following   1 switch to the lowest interest rate card your bank offers   2 apply for a credit card with another bank that is offering a great teaser rate transfer the balance cut your living expenses and send every penny to paying off the balance before the teaser rate expires   3 if you can not get access new credit or switch credit cards seek advice from a professional credit counsellor on your options and the best one to choose   sorry to ramble i 've seen far too many people fall into the debt trap you do n't want to go there    source i work for a bank which offers credit card products

of course you 've already realized that some of that is that smaller estates are more common than larger estates   but it seems unlikely that there are four times as many estates between $ 10 and $ 11 million as above that range    people who expect to die with an estate subject to inheritance tax tend to prepare    i do n't know how common it is but if the surviving member of a couple then the new spouse gets a separate exemption   and of course spouses inherit from spouses without tax   in theory this could last indefinitely   in practice it is less likely   but if a married couple has $ 20 million the first spouse could leave $ 15 million to the second and $ 5 million to other heirs   the second spouse could leave $ 10 million to a third spouse after and another $ 5 million to children with the first spouse   all without triggering the estate tax    people can put some of their estate into a trust   this can allow the heirs to continue to control the money while not paying inheritance tax   supposedly ford of ford motor company took that route    another common strategy is to give the maximum without gift tax each year   that 's at least $ 14k per donor and recipient per year   so a married couple with two kids can transfer $ 56k per year   plus $ 56k for the kids spouses   and if there are four grandchildren that 's another $   great grandchildren count too   that 's more than a million every five years   so given ten years to prepare parents can transfer $ 2 million out of the estate and to the heirs without tax    consider the case of two wealthy siblings   they 've each maxed out their gifts to their own heirs   so they agree to max out their gifts to their sibling 's heirs   this effectively doubles the transfer amount without tax implication    also realize that they can assets at the current market rate   so if a rich person has an asset that is currently undervalued it may make sense to transfer it immediately as a gift   this will use up some of the estate exemption   but if you 're going to transfer the asset eventually you might as well do so when the value is optimal for your purpose    these are just the easy things to do   if someone wants they can do more complicated things that make it harder for the irs to track value    for example the bezos family invested in amazon.com when jeff bezos was starting it   as a result his company could survive capital losses that another company might not   the effect of this was to make him rich and his parents richer than they were   but he wo n't pay inheritance tax until his parents actually transfer the estate to him and i believe they actually put it in a charitable trust   if his company had failed instead he still would have been supported by the capital provided by his parents while it was open e.g. his salary   but he would n't have paid inheritance tax on it    there are other examples of the same pattern   fred smith of fedex donald trump bill gates of microsoft etc   the prime value of the estate was not in its transfer but in working together while alive or through a family trust   the child 's company became much more valuable as a result of a parent 's wealth   and in two of those examples the child was so successful that the parent became richer as a result   so the parent 's estate does count   meanwhile another company might fail leaving the estate below the threshold despite a great deal of parental support    and those are n't even   those children started real companies and offered their parents real investment opportunities   a family that wants to do so can do a lot more with arrangements   of course the irs may be looking for some of them    the point being that the estate might be more than $ 11 million earlier but the parents can find ways to reduce it below the inheritance tax exemption by the time that they die

as the record date is 7th august you need to hold stocks on the 7th august closing you need not hold it till 2nd sept. the list as taken on 7th august would be processed and instructions given to bank and the dividends credited by 1st sept.   edit to clarify victor 's comment typically from the time one sells the stocks to the time it actually gets transferred has a clearing cycle most stock exchanges have 2 or 3 days cycles i.e. if i sell the stock today it is still in my name the money is still with the buyer on day 1 the positions are arrived at on day 2 the stock gets credited to the buyer and the funds gets credit to seller   as the question was specific whether to hold the stock till 7th or 22nd sept my initial answer was simple the illustration by victor is more accurate

would you consider the owner of a company to be supporting the company if you buy stock in the company you own a small part of that company your purchase also increases the share price and thus the value of the company increased value allows the company to borrow more money to say expand operations the affect that most individuals might have on share price is very very small that does n't mean it is n't the right thing for you to do if it is something you believe in after all if enough people followed those same convictions it could have an impact on the company

when i play railroad tycoon iii i often send my company deep into debt to get cash on hand to buy back shares effectively increasing my ownership of the company as an absolute percentage then i issue massive dividends until my company goes bankrupt and start a new company it 's a way to shuttle money borrowed against a company 's assets into my personal bank account at no risk to me in the msft case maybe they think there will be inflation and this is a hedge against holding so many dollars in cash already if they can borrow a couple billion in 2010 dollars and pay it back in 2015 dollars they 're probably going to end up ahead if all they do is buy back shares paying dividends with the money seems stupid vs. buying back shares they 're just driving up income taxes for investors

there are four sides to this transaction you increase in money a debit increases your current assets if you will you also gain the requirement to pay that money in the future a credit definitely a liability when you repay the money your cash will decrease a credit and your liabilities will also decrease which is a debit since you do n't have to repay the money anymore the account would be short term loans the money does n't have a name it 's just cash and would go into whatever cash accounts you have the bookkeeping entry would be the same as you would make for any short term loan

be very careful about buying property because it has been going up quickly in recent years   there are some fundamental factors that limit the amount real estate can appreciate over time   in a nutshell the general real estate market growth is supported by the entry level property market   that is when values are appreciating people can sell and use the capital gains to buy more valuable property   this drives up the prices in higher value properties whose owners can use that to purchase more expensive properties and so on and so forth at some point in a rising market the entry level properties start to become hard for entry level buyers to afford   the machine of rising prices throughout the market starts grinding to a halt   this price level can be calculated by looking at average incomes in an area   at some percentage of income people can not buy into the market without crazy loans and if those become popular watch out because things can get really ugly   if you want an example just look back to the us in 2007 2009 and the nearly apocalyptic financial crisis that as with most investing you want to buy low and sell high   buying into a hot market is generally not very profitable   buying when the market is abnormally low tends to be a more effective strategy

there 's no reason for the employer not to deduct the whole amount before you leave the fsa salary deduction has to be periodical but it does n't have to be calculated over a year it just means that an equal amount will be deducted from your every paycheck and if the employer and you know that your last paycheck is on june 30th even before the year starts there 's nothing to stop the employer from calculating the periodic payments so that it will cover your full fsa amount before you leave that is of course other than mere convenience it may be easier cheaper to just give you the extra $ than to deal with the special case deduction calculation this is different from unexpected termination resignation where the employer could n't have made such an assumption and thus the periodic payments were calculated over a year see pub 969 the selection is annual the deductions are periodical

you can calculate your exposure intuitively by calculating your fx sensitivity take your total usd assets let 's assume $ 50k convert to eur at the current rate let 's assume 1 eur 1.1 usd resulting in eur if the usd strengthens by 1 this moves to a rate of resulting in eur value for the same 50k of usd investments from this you can see that for every 1 the usd strengthens you gain 500 eur for every 1 the usd weakens you lose 500 eur the simplest way to reduce your exchange rate risk exposure is to simply eliminate your foreign currency investments ie if you do not want to be exposed to fluctuations in the usd invest in eur only this will align your assets with the currency of your future expenses assuming you intend to continue living in is not possible of course if you would like to maintain investments in us assets   one relatively simple method available to invest in the us without gaining an exposure to the usd is to invest in usd assets only with money borrowed in usd ie if you borrow $ 50k usd and invest $ 50k in the us stock market then your new investments will be in the same currency as your debt therefore if the usd strengthens your assets increase in relative eur value and your debt becomes more expensive these two impacts wash out leaving you with no net exposure to the value of the usd there is a risk to this option you are investing with a higher financial leverage ratio using borrowed money to invest increases your risk if your investments fall in value you still need to make the periodic interest payments many people view this increased risk as a reason to never invest with borrowed money you are compensated for that risk by increased returns because you have the ability to earn investment income without contributing any additional money of your own whether the risk is worth it to you will depend on many factors you should search this site and others on the topic to learn more about what those risks mean

applying for a mortgage is a bit of paperwork but not too bad of an experience rates are pretty tight if one lender were more that 1/4 lower than another they 'd be inundated with applications above a certain credit score you get the best rate a search will show you the rates offered in your area   if you are a first time buyer there are mortgages that might benefit you if you are a vet for non native english readers a veteran who served in the us armed forces not a who is an animal doctor there are mortgages that offer low to no down payment with attractive rates   yes avoid pmi it 's a crazy penalty on your overall expense of home purchase if banks qualify you for different amounts it should n't be a huge difference a few percent variation but the standard ratios are pretty liberal even today and getting the most you 'd qualify for is probably too much   using the standard 28/36 ratios a bank will qualify you for 4x your income as a loan e.g you make $ 50 k they 'll lend you $ 200k. this is a bit too much in my opinion   if you come up short you are really looking to borrow too much and should probably wait if you owe a bit on loans it should squeeze in between those two ratios 28/36 but i would n't borrow on a credit line to add to the purchase that 's asking for trouble

you ask about the difference between credit and debit but that may be because you 're missing something important regardless of credit debit there is value in carrying two different cards associated with two different accounts the reason is simply that because of loss fraud or your own mismanagement or even the bank 's technical error any card can become unusable for some period of time exactly how long depends what happened but just sending you a new card can easily take more than one business day which might well be longer than you 'd like to go without access to any funds in that situation you would be glad of a credit card and you would equally be glad of a second debit card on a separate account so if your question is i have one bank account with one debit card and the only options i 'm willing to contemplate are a do nothing or b take a credit card as well then the answer is yes take a credit card as well regardless of the pros or cons of credit vs debit even if you only use the credit card in the event that you drop your debit card down a drain so what you can now consider is the pros and cons of a credit card vs managing an additional bank account unless you seriously hate one or more of the cons of credit cards the credit card is likely to win my bank has given me a debit card on a cash savings account which is a little scary but would cover most emergencies if i did n't have a credit card too of course the interest rate is rubbish and i sometimes empty my savings account into a better investment so i do n't use it as backup but i could your final question can a merchant know if i give him number of debit or credit card is already asked can merchants tell the difference between a credit card and debit card yes they can and yes there are a few things you ca n't or might prefer not to do with debit the same could even be said of visa vs. mastercard leading to the conclusion that if you have a visa debit you should look for a mastercard credit but that seems to be less of an issue as time goes on and almost everywhere in europe apparently takes both or neither if you travel a lot outside the eu then you might want to be loaded down with every card under the sun and three different kinds of cash but you 'd already know that without asking

it 's my understand that leasing is never the better overall deal with the possible exception of a person who would otherwise buy a brand new car every 2 or 3 years and does not drive a lot of miles note in the case of a company car canadian taxes let you deduct the entire lease payment which clearly has some principal in it if you lease while if you buy you can only deduct the interest and must depreciate the car according to their schedule this can make leasing more attractive to those buying a car through a corporation i do n't know if this applies in the us the numbers you ran through in class presumably involved calculating the interest paid over the term of the loan can you not just redo the calculation using actual interest and lease numbers from a randomly chosen current car ad i suspect if you do you will discover leasing is still not the right choice

when considering whether to pay off the student loan note that because you work for a non profit some or all of that debt may be forgiven after 10 years under the public service loan forgiveness program i would also like to be slightly contrarian on the main question i like having lots of savings and little debt as much as the next person but unless you have been planning your life with the expectation that you would receive this bequest it is a windfall if you were n't already doing an excellent job of saving for emergencies and retirement or had a lot of consumer debt i 'd say you should use the money to stabilize your finances before doing anything else but your finances do seem stable so take some of the windfall and do something nice with it travel to the home of your late grandmother a small scholarship in her memory buy some small luxury that you could never manage on your own salary i 'm not suggesting you spend it all but using 20 of it on something otherwise out of reach will give you good memories while still leaving you materially better off   saving for the future is important paying off debt is important enjoying life when you can is also important balance is everything

the idea is correct the details are a little off you need to apply it to the actual cash flow the bond would create the best advice i can give you is to draw a time line diagram then you would see that you receive £ 35 in 6 months £ 35 in 12 months £ 35 in 18 months and £ in 24 months   use   the method you 've presented in your question and the interest rate you 've calculated 3 per 6 months to discount each payment the specified amount and you 're done ps   if there were more coupons say a 20 year quarterly bond it would speed things up to use the present value of an annuity formula to discount all the coupons in one step

americans are snapping like crazy and not only americans i know a lot of people from out of country are snapping as well similarly to your australian friend the market is crazy hot i 'm not familiar with cleveland but i am familiar with phoenix the prices are up at least 20 30 from what they were a couple of years ago and the trend is not changing however these are not something everyone can buy it is very hard to get these properties financed i found it impossible as mentioned i bought in phoenix that means you have to pay cash not everyone has tens or hundreds of thousands of dollars in cash available for a real estate investment for many americans 30 60 k needed to buy a property in these markets is an amount they can not afford to invest even if they have it at hand also keep in mind that investing in rental property requires being able to support it pay taxes and expenses even if it is not rented pay to property managers utility bills gardeners and plumbers insurance and property taxes all these can amount to quite a lot so its not just the initial investment many times advertised rents are not the actual rents paid if he indeed has it rented at $ 900 then its good but if he was told hey buy it and you 'll be able to rent it out at $ 900 would n't count on that i know many foreigners who fell in these traps do your market research and see what the costs are at these neighborhoods keep in mind that these are distressed neighborhoods with a lot of foreclosed houses and a lot of unemployment it is likely that there are houses empty as people are moving out being out of job it may be tough to find a renter and the renters you find may not be able to pay the rent but all that said yes those who can are snapping

the problem is that while there are a lot of statistics that can be created from basic market data such as prices and volume along with the fundamentals of the company i think that if you talk to 8 different day traders you 'll get 12 different theories of how to interpret and trade based on those numbers   also quite likely the more successful someone is at day trading the more closely they are likely to guard their secrets and not want to divulge them if there was any uniform they you 'd see all the doing the same thing and moving as a group shortly after which you 'd get contra folks who would try to gain by moving in opposition or folks who would try to front run the pack and i think you can see where this leads   a better idea might be to just work on educating your self firstly with regard to nomenclature and terms and then move on to reading some stuff about how markets work    etc   i 'd suggest starting with a book like wall street words and/or a random walk down wall street since both are great to things and move on from there   note that both of those books have gone through multiple editions so be sure to get the most recent one especially if you are trying to save money and buy a used version    you are also likely to find an nearly endless supply of seminars that will offer to teach you somebody 's proven method for a fee or for free but after which you find our you need to use their special tools or data sources etc which cost money to use their system   either of which makes me think that their system ca n't be that great if they figure it 's a thing to charge for teaching or tools services than it is to use their system otherwise they 'd just shut up practice what they preach and make money that way instead   it might be worth attending the free ones just to get exposure to someone 's theory on how to game the system provided you are not an easy mark and can withstand the high pressure sales pitch for their books software services etc that pays their bills and almost invariably comes along with such a seminar

what exactly is call protection is no normal for a cd    a callable cd or one without protection can be revoked before maturity by the issuer for example if interest rates drop they might recall the cd since they can borrow money at a lower rate a callable cd should offer a better return in exchange for this is first coupon date the first time it actually pays interest    yes given that the first coupon date is in 6 months and it 's semiannual is it fair to assume that this pays every six months    yes given that the maturity date is this is really a 15-year cd right    it depends cds can be resold on the market so it is at least a 15 year cd it could also be a 20 year cd originally issued in 2005 what does price ask mean it says 100 does that mean you buy in chunks of $ 100    yes more accurately they are $ 100 per cd   what is yield to worst ask is this the worst yield that this cd will return    the lowest potential yield that can be received on a bond without the issuer actually defaulting 3.25 is the best yield i 've seen from something as stable as a cd would it be silly though to lock money up in an investment like this for 15 years      there is no way to really say without a crystal ball if you are n't willing to accept more risk and think that interest rates will remain at these historic lows for a long while then it is probably a good deal if you think interest rates are due to go up substantially then it is probably smarter to ladder your investments in shorter term cds in investment circles this is known as interest rate risk

sales tactics for permanent insurance policies can get pretty sleazy sending home a flier from school is a way for an insurance salesperson to get his her message out to 800 families without any effort at all and very little advertising cost just a of paper and some toner the biggest used are the just pennies per day and in case they get some devastating medical condition and become uninsurable sure both are technically true but are definitely used to trigger the grown ups having said that and having been in the financial business for a time which included selling insurance policies there is a place for insurance of children a small amount can be used to offset the loss of income for the parents who may have to take extended time away from work to deal with the event of the loss of their child and to deal with the costs of funeral and burial let 's face it the percentage of families who have a sufficiently large emergency fund is extremely small compared to the overall population personally i have added a child rider to my own term insurance policies that covers any all of my children it does add some cost to my premiums but it 's a small cost on top of something that is already justifiably in place for myself one other thing to be aware of if you 're in a group policy any life insurance where you 're automatically accepted without any underwriting process like through a benefit at work or some other club or association the healthy members are subsidizing the unhealthy ones if you 're on the healthy side you might consider foregoing that policy in favor of getting your own policy through an insurance company of your choice if you 're healthy it will always be cheaper than the group coverage

assuming the numbers work out roughly the same and you can frankly whip up a spreadsheet to prove that out a defined benefit scheme that pays out an amount equal to an return from a 401(k is better   the reason is not monetary it is that the same return is being had at less risk put another way if your defined benefit was guaranteed to be $ 100/month and your 401(k had a contribution that eventually gets to a lump sum that if for the same life expectancy gave you $ 100/month the db is better because there is less chance that you wo n't see the money or put even simpler which is more likely that new york goes bankrupt and is relieved of all pension obligations or the stock market underperforms expectations   neither can be ruled out but assuming even the same benefit lower risk is better now the complication in your scenario is that your new job pays better   as such it is possible that you might be able to accumulate more savings in your 401(k than you might in the db scheme   then again even with the opportunity to do so there is no guarantee that you will   as such even modelling it out really is n't going to dismiss the key variables as such can i suggest a different approach   which job is going to make you happier now   part of that may be money part of that may be what you are actually doing   but you should focus on that question the marginal consideration of retirement is really moot in theory an ira contribution can be made that would equalize your 401(k negating it from the equation   grant you there is very slightly different tax treatment and the phaseout limits differ but at the salary ranges you are looking at you could in theory make decisions that would have the same retirement outcome in any event the real question is then not what is the effect in 20 years but rather which makes you happier now

the implied intent is that balance transfers are for your balances not someone else 's   however i bet it would be not only allowed but also encouraged   why   because the goal of a teaser rate is to get you to borrow typically there is a balance transfer fee that allows the offering company to break even   in the unlikely event that a person does pay off the balance in the specified time frame the account and is then closed then nothing really lost its hard to find past articles i 've read as all the search engines are trying to get me to enroll in a balance transfer   however about 75 of 0 balance result in converting to a interest being accrued   if you are familiar with the amount of household credit card debt we carry as a nation that figure is very believable to answer your question i would assume they would allow it   however i would call and check and get their answer in writing   why   because if they change their mind or the representative tells you incorrectly and they find out they will convert your 0 credit card to an 18 or higher interest rate for violating the terms   same as if a payment was missed from the credit card company 's perspective they would be really smart to allow you to do this   the likelihood that your family member will pay the bill beyond two months is close to zero   the likelihood that a payment will be missed or late allowing them to convert to a higher rate is very high   this then might lead to you being overextended which would mean just more interest rates and fees   credit card company wins   i would not be surprised if they beg you to follow through on your plan from your perspective it would be a really dumb idea but as you said you knew that faced with the same situation i would just pay off one or more of the debts for the family member if i thought it would actually help them   i would also require them to have some financial accountability    its funny that once you require financial accountability for handouts most of those seeking a donation go elsewhere

the following advice assumes that you have a significant amount already in the account in cash equivalents if you are only talking a few hundred bucks or so then just jump in at the next dip like today 's if you have a larger amount to move into equities the safest approach is to gradually move it into investments over some period of time at regular intervals regardless of what is going on in the market this mitigates the risk of investing it all into an fund that is peaking at the exact moment you buy   so for example you might invest 20 of the total amount each month for 5 months to gradually get into the market the larger the amount you are investing the more you probably want to spread it out but do n't spread it out much further than a year or you are losing opportunity cost by leaving your money in cash type investments with likely a very poor rate of return this strategy is called dollar cost averaging if you want to research it more

the basic optimization rule on distributing windfalls toward debt is to pay off the highest interest rate debt first putting any extra money into that debt while making minimum payments to the other creditors if the 5k in other debt is credit card debt it is virtually certain to be the highest interest rate debt pay it off immediately do n't wait for the next statement once you are paying on credit cards there is no grace period and the sooner you pay it the less interest you will accrue second keep 10k for emergencies but pretend you do n't have it keep your spending as close as possible to what it is now check the interest rate on the auto loan v student loans if the auto loan is materially higher pay it off then pay the remaining 20k toward the student loans added this comment about credit with a view towards the op 's future something to consider for the longer term is getting your credit situation set up so that should you want to buy a new car or a home a few years down the road you will be paying the lowest possible interest you can jump start your credit by taking out one or two secured credit cards from one of the banks that will in a few years your account return your deposit and leave no trace you ever opened a secured account that 's the route i took with citi and wells fargo while over spending on credit cards can be tempting they are with a solid payment history the single most important positive attribute on a credit report and impact fico scores more than other type of credit or debt so make an absolute practice of only using them for things you would buy anyway and always always pay each monthly bill in full this one thing will make it far easier to find a good rental buy a car on the best terms or get a mortgage at good rates and remember credit is not equal to debt maximize the former and minimize the latter

exxon mobil is one of the most profitable corporations in the world   their annual earnings are typically in the $ 10s of billions of dollars   they have revenues in the hundreds of billions of dollars per year   they also return $ 10 + billion dollars to their stockholders each year in dividends and stock purchases   that 's with $ market capitalization meaning they return 3 of their total market cap each year to their shareholders aside from any movement in the stock itself on the other hand their total current liabilities are around $   that 's what six months revenue   who 'd you rather lend to exxon or anyone else   aapl and goog maybe better risks but not by much   almost every other company on the planet is a more dangerous risk judging them solely by assets is silly they do n't exactly sit on the oil they extract   they take it out of the ground and sell it to people

and i 'm mad that everyone 's mad stop being mad d   but seriously chill out there are legitimate reasons to keep money in your checking account and it is not a moronic move a more moronic move would be to have no money available on hand in the event of an emergency like if your own a house and your boiler breaks or if you get in an accident and have to shell out money for medical bills or if you want to save up so you can pay your larger loans off in full so you do n't accrue interest on them e.g. college loans

the way to resolve your dilemma is to consult the price to rent ratio of the property according to the price to rent ratio is a measure of the relative affordability of renting and buying in a given housing market it is calculated as the ratio of home prices to annual rental rates so for example in a real estate market where on average a home worth $ 200,000 could rent for $ 1000 a month the price rent ratio is that ’s determined using the formula $ 200,000 ÷ 12 x $ 1,000 also goes on to give a table comparing different cities price to rent ratio and then claim that the average price to rent ratio is currently if your price to rent ratio is lower than then yes your rents are more expensive than the average house claims that a high price to rent ratio is an argument in favor of tenants renting properties while a low price to rent ratio favors people buying either to live in the property or to just rent it out to other people so let 's apply the price to rent ratio formula towards the properties you just quoted there 's a specific house i could buy for 190 perhaps even less that rents for exactly 2000 month 12 = there 's a house for sale asking 400 been on the market 2 yrs could probably get for 350 which rents for 2800   12 = 12 = one can quite easily today buy a house for that would rent out for 1700 2100 month   lower bound 12 = upper bound 12 = even so the rental returns here seem ridiculously high to me based on other markets i 've noticed considering how the average price to rent ratio is and your price to rent ratio ranges from to you are indeed correct they are indeed ridiculously high qualification i was involved in real estate and used the price to rent ratio to determine how long it would take to recover a person 's investment in the property keep in mind that it 's not the only thing i care about and obviously the price to rent ratio tends to expenses involved in actually owning properties and trying to deal with periods of vacancy there 's also the problem of taking into account demand as well according to detroit mi has the lowest price to rent ratio with which should suggest that people should buy properties immediately in this city but that 's probably more of a sign of people not wanting to move to detroit and bid up the prices of properties edit i should also say that just because the properties are ridiculously expensive right now does n't mean you should expect your rents to decrease rather if rents keep staying at their current level i 'd predict that the property values will slowly increase in the future thereby raising the price to rent ratio to non ridiculous mode

the formula you are looking for is pretty complicated it 's given here you might prefer to let somebody else do the grunt work for you this page will calculate the probability for you in your case you 'd enter standard and standard oh you did n't say what you 're paying on your debt let 's say it 's 6 i.e. .06 note that this page will give you the probability that the actual number will be less than or equal to the standard score enter all that and click the magic button and the probability that the investment will produce less than 6 is or 34 the handy rule of thumb is that the probability is about 68 that the actual number will be within 1 standard deviation of the mean 95 that it will be within 2 standard deviations and that it will be within 3 which is n't exactly what you want because you do n't want within but less than but you could get that by just adding half the difference from 100 for each of the above i.e. instead of 68 95 it would be 84 98 99.9 oh i missed that in a follow up comment you say you are paying 4 on a mortgage which you are adjusting to 3 because of tax implications probability based on mean and sd you gave of getting less than 3 is 26 i did n't read the article you cite i assume the standard deviation given is for the rate of return for one year if you stretch that over many years the sd goes down as many factors tend to even out so while the probability that money in a given say mutual fund will grow by less than 3 in one year is fairly high the 25 35 we 're talking here sounds plausible to me the probability that it will grow by an average of less than 3 over a period of 10 or 15 or 20 years is much less further thought there is of course no provably true formula for what makes a reasonable risk suppose i offered you an investment that had a 99 chance of showing a $ 5,000 profit and a 1 chance of a $ loss would you take it i would n't even though the chance of a loss is small if it happened i 'd lose everything i have is it worth that risk for the modest potential profit i 'd say no of course to someone who has a billion dollars this might be a very reasonable risk if it fails oh well that could really cut in to what he can spend on lunch tomorrow

well yes you 've implicitly made many assumptions such as that the embedded option has longer maturity the important thing to consider is when this option pays out the premium will obviously be adjusted   for a concrete example consider an equity option on an option the outer option has strike 110 the inner option has strike 100 spot = forward = 100 then the inner strike pays out when gt 100 but the outer option has zero value there the overall option only pays out if gt 110 reducing the structure to a call option with strike 110

most online high yield savings accounts are paying just above 1   that would be 1.05 for american express personal savings or 1.15 for currently depending on the length of the season you might want to work in some cd 's   six months cds can be had at 1.2 and 9 month at 1.25   so if you know you wo n't need some of your earnings for 9 months you could earn 1.25 on your money however i would proceed with caution on anything other than the high yield savings account   with your one friend having such a low emergency fund there is very little room for error   perhaps until that amount is built up into something significant it is just best to stick with the online savings of course one solution would be to find a way to create income during the off season   that will go a long way into helping one build wealth

a call gives you the right but not the obligation to buy a stock at a particular price the price called the strike price is fixed when you buy the option let 's run through an example aapl trades $ you think it 's going up over the next year and you decide to buy the $ 280 call for $ 12   here are the details of this trade your cost is $ 1200 as options are traded on 100 shares each you start to have the potential to make money only as apple rises above $ 280 and the option trades in the money it would take a move to $ for you to break even but after that you are making $ 100 for each dollar it goes higher at $ 300 your $ 1200 would be worth $ 2000 for example a 16 move on the stock and a 67 increase on your money on the other hand if the stock does n't rise enough by january 2011 you lose it all   a couple points here american options are traded at any time if the stock goes up next week your $ 1200 may be worth $ 1500 and you can sell if the option is not in the money its value is pure time value there have been claims made that most options expire worthless this of course is nonsense you can see there will always be options with a strike below the price of the stock at expiration and those options are in the money of course we do n't know what those options were traded at   on the other end of this trade is the option seller if he owns apple the sale is called a covered call and he is basically saying he 's ok if the stock goes up enough that the buyer will get his shares for that price for him he knows that he 'll get $ the $ 280 plus the option sale of $ 12 for a stock that is only $ today if the stock stays under $ 280 he just pocketed $ 12 4.6 of the stock value in just 3 months this is why call writing can be a decent strategy for some investors especially if the market goes down you can think of it as the investor lowering his cost by that $ 12 this particular strategy works best in a flat to down market of course in a fast rising market the seller misses out on potentially high gains   i 'll call it quits here just to say a put is the mirror image you have the right to sell a stock at a given price it 's the difference similar to shorting a stock as opposed to buying it if you have a follow up question happy to help edit apple closed on jan 21 2011 at $ the $ 280 call would have been worth $ vs the purchase price of $ 12 nearly 4x return a gain in just over 4 months for a stock move of 26 this is the leverage you can have with options any stock could just as easily trade flat to down and the entire option premium lost

a check is simply an order to the bank to pay money to someone the payor 's signature on the front of the check is all that 's needed to make that order binding if you read the check carefully you 'll see that it says pay to the order of that 's the payor 's instruction to the bank and as payee you can make a further order to pay the money to someone else in which case you 'd have to endorse the check to make your order binding but nobody does that any more instead people always just deposit checks into their accounts when you deposit a check the payor 's signature is all that 's needed to tell the payor 's bank that it should pay the money if your bank insists on a signature as well that 's just to pretend that they 're paying attention in case it turns out that you stole the check in reality banks do n't pay attention to signatures nor to the name of the payee i once put the wrong check into an envelope and the phone company got a check for something over $ 700 on a bill of less than $ 50 payable to some completely different company they deposited it and gave me a credit for the balance none of the banks in the transition chain questioned it

as joetaxpayer has commented the markets are littered with the of those who buy into the idea that markets submit readily to formal analysis    financial markets are amongst the most complex systems we know of   to borrow a concept from mathematics that of a chaotic system one might say that financial markets are a chaotic system comprised of a structure of chaotic for example the unpredictable behaviour of a single big market participant can have dramatic effects on overall market behaviour in my experience becoming a successful investor requires a considerable amount of time and commitment and has a steep learning curve   your actions in abandoning your graduate studies hint that you are perhaps lacking in commitment most people believe that they are special and that investing will be easy money   if you are currently entertaining such thoughts then you would be well advised to forget them immediately and prepare to show some humility tl dr it is currently considered that behavioural psychology is a valuable tool in understanding investors behaviour as well as overall market trends   also in the area of psychology confirmation bias is another aspect of trading that it is important to keep in mind   quantitative analysis is a mathematical tool that is currently used by hedge funds and the big investment banks however these methods require considerable resources and given the   performance of hedge funds in the last few years it does not appear to be worth the investment if you are serious in wanting to make the necessary commitments then here are a few ideas on where to start there are certain technical details that you will need to understand in order to quantify the risks you are taking beyond simple buying and holding financial instruments   for example how option strategies can be used limit your risk how margin requirements may force your hand in volatile markets how different markets impact on one another e.g. the relationship between bond markets and equity markets and a host of other issues   also to repeat it is important to understand how your own psychology can impact on your investment decisions

it appears you can elect to classify some or all of your scholarship money as taxable   if you do this you would be deemed to have used the scholarship funds for non deductible purposes e.g. room and board and you could be eligible to claim the american opportunity credit based on the money you used to pay for the tuition out of your own pocket i found this option in the section of publication 970 about coordination with pell grants and other scholarships specifically example 3 the facts are the same as in example excluded from income i.e. bill receives a $ scholarship and paid $ for tuition if unlike example 2 bill includes $ 4,000 of the scholarship in income he will be deemed to have used that amount to pay for room and board the remaining $ 1,600 of the $ scholarship will reduce his qualified education expenses and his adjusted qualified education expenses will be $ 4,000 bill 's agi will increase to $ 34,000 his taxable income will increase to $ and his tax before credits will increase to $ based on his adjusted qualified education expenses of $ 4,000 bill would be able to claim an american opportunity tax credit of $ 2,500 and his tax after credits would be $ you can only income in this way to the extent that your scholarship allows you to use that money for nonqualified expenses such as room and board   you should carefully check the terms of the scholarship to determine whether it allows this   the brief paragraph you cite from the fellowship document is not totally clear on this point at least to my eye   you might want to ask the fellowship administrators if there are restrictions on how they money may be used in addition i would be cautious about attempting to do this unless you actually did pay for the nonqualified expenses yourself so you can treat the money as fungible   if for instance your parents paid for your room and board it 's not clear whether you could legitimately claim that you used the scholarship money to pay for that since you did n't pay for it at all although in this case your parents could possibly be able to claim the themselves   i mention this because you say in your question that you only used the scholarship for tuition and fees   i 'm not sure how exactly you meant that but it seems from the example cited above that in order to claim the scholarship as taxable income you have to actually have nonqualified expenses which you can say you paid for with the scholarship   also of course you had to actually receive the money yourself   if the scholarship money was given directly to your school as payment of tuition then you never had any ability to use it for anything else

if one has established a liquid emergency fund of 3 to 6 months income as suggested in several places here as well as being recommended by many financial planners then a savings account is a great place to keep that money all things being equal between the savings and checking account the limited transfers should be a non issue since ideally you wo n't be using that money and if you need to in an emergency you could move a whole months worth of expenses to checking in one transfer   the savings account gives you a place to keep the emergency fund segregated from your normal funds out of sight out of mind as it were a savings account also gives you a place to stash funds intended for short term goals away from normal use funds one such example i can use is that i am purchasing several plane tickets for various family members to come visit for christmas i have those funds set aside in a savings account so they do n't interfere with my budgeting of my normal living expenses while these are just examples and your situation may vary they are both examples of where a savings account would be useful even if it is identical to a checking account   edit   using other types of accounts can also accomplish the same thing since we are using the assumption that the checking and savings accounts are identical the benefit of using a savings account is that it is usually inherently linked to the associated checking account without any additional effort on the part of the account holder any other account type would require additional effort however minor on the part of the account holder to link them in such a way that would make transfers between accounts as easy as possible

i have an indirect answer for you it is not a numeric answer but it is a procedure the challenge with paying taxes for an employee besides their share of social security and medicare is that you have no idea what their state and federal taxes are   are they married single head of household is this their entire families income or is it   extra money to make ends meet what about state taxes   it looks like you will need a w-4 from them   as you know the irs tax topic has all the info you need federal income tax withholding you are not required to withhold federal income tax from wages you pay    to a household employee however if your employee asks you to    withhold federal income tax and you agree you will need a completed    form w-4 pdf employee 's withholding allowance certificate from your    employee see publication 15 circular e employer 's tax guide    which has tax withholding tables that are updated each year   form w-2 wage and tax statement if you must withhold and pay social security and medicare taxes or if    you withhold federal income tax you will need to complete form w-2    pdf wage and tax statement for each employee you will also need a    form w-3 pdf of wage and tax statement see what forms    must you file in publication pdf for information on when and    where to furnish and file these forms to complete form w-2 you will    need an employer identification number ein and your employees    social security numbers if you do not already have an ein you can    apply for one using the online ein application available on irs.gov    this service is available monday through friday 7 a.m. to 10 p.m.    eastern time you can also apply for an ein by mailing or a    completed form pdf application for employer identification    number international applicants may apply by calling 941 1099    not a toll free number monday through friday 6 a.m. to 11 p.m.    eastern time to obtain their ein refer to topics and for    further information do n't forget federal unemployment tax pub 15 will have tables so you can determine how much you should have been withholding if you had gone that route it will be easiest to use a spreadsheet to do the calculations so that what you gave them in their checks is their net pay not their gross the tables are constructed under the assumption you know their gross pay

this is excellent advice i would make sure that you arm yourself with some solid questions about the company including some of the questions that they ask you interviews should be a two way conversation the more you get them talking the more comfortable they 'll be to recommend you some questions to ask 1 tell me a bit about your interviewer background this gets them talking a bit and allows you to relate with them 2 where do you see the company moving in the next 5 years 3 why is this job opening available 4 can you tell me a bit about the corporate culture 5 how can the company invest in me 6 what are the qualities that will make me successful in this job 7 tell me a bit about our competitors you should know some of them and what sets this company apart make sure you 're armed with as much information about the company as possible one of the things that set me apart when i interviewed at the company i 'm working at now was i came into the interview with the company 's financial report and started asking specific questions about details on that report also make sure to get a business card or contact information before you leave thank you letters are an annoying formality but it is necessary do n't rely on the recruiter to give you that information

cornerstone strategic value fund inc. is a diversified closed end management investment company it was incorporated in maryland on may 1 1987 and investment operations on june 30 1987 the fund ’s shares of common stock are traded on the nyse mkt under the ticker symbol that essentially means that is a company all of whose assets are held as tradable financial instruments or equivalently is an etf that was created as a company in its own right that it was founded in the 80s before the modern definition of etfs really existed it is probably more helpful to think of it by the first definition as the website mentions that it is traded as common stock so its stock holds more in common with stock than etfs 1

thanks it has taken me some time to understand how all this works and there are still many gray areas i want to understand further   the fed interest rate is the rate charged by banks to loan to each other to balance overnight reserves but only using the reserves they hold at the fed that adds no new money to the system but increases the money multiplier a little since perhaps more loans can be made    basically one bank with excess reserves can loan to another bank that needs reserves the fed injects no money here only sets the rate for banks to do this with each other   when the fed buys securities that effectively adds that many more dollars into circulation which then gets hit by the money multiplier adding a lot of new liquidity   i think historically the latter tracks increases in the money supply much better than the former i think the st. louis fed has records online for all this dating back to the 1940 's or so

in most cases an rent with option to buy is structured as follows the renter buyer will place a deposit premium not the same as a security deposit that purchases the option the right to buy the home at a future date at a specific price the renter buyer will often pay extra rent in addition to market rent   many times this additional rent is contracted to be applied to the purchase price of the home the risks to the renter buyer are as follows also something to note many people will recommend that you use the additional rents to be applied specifically towards the downpayment   be wary of this   there are no institutional lenders available today that will allow the additional rent money to be applied towards your downpayment   that means you must come up with the downpayment in cash before closing   the additional rent payments can   be used towards the price    hope that helps   good luck

like joetaxpayer said i do n't know of any difference between the backdoor and a regular roth ira contribution besides the issue with existing pre tax ira money so if it is your practice to contribute at the beginning of the year good for you most people wait until the last minute then doing a backdoor seems like the safe choice some people have speculated that hypothetically the irs could use the step transaction doctrine to treat it as a single direct contribution to a roth ira which then would be disallowed and cause you a penalty until you take it out but i have never heard of this happening to anyone as for the paperwork you just need to fill out one extra form at tax time form 8606 you need to complete two parts of it one for the non deductible contribution and one for the conversion it is pretty straightforward although i 've found that it is a pain to do it in tax software another option would be for you to contribute to a roth ira now but when you discover that you 're over the limit at the end of the year re characterize it as a traditional contribution and then convert it back to roth but this way is not good because then there is a long time between the traditional contribution and the roth conversion and earnings during this time will be taxed at conversion

i 'm not sure what you expect in terms of answers but it depends on personal factors it pretty well has to depend on personal factors since otherwise everyone would want to do the same thing either everyone thinks the current price is one to sell at or everyone thinks it 's one to buy at and there would be no trades you would n't be able to do what you want except on the liquidity provided by market makers once that 's hit the price is shifting quickly so your calculation will change quickly too purely in terms of maximising expected value taking into account the time value of money it 's all about the same the market should already know everything you know which means that one time to sell is as good as any other the current price is generally below the expected acquisition price because there 's a chance the deal will fall through and the stock price will plummet that 's not to say there are n't clever sure fire trading strategies around acquisitions but they 're certain to be based on more than just timing when to sell an existing holding of stock if you have information that the market does n't and assuming it is legal to do so then you trade based on that information if you know something the market does n't that 's going to be good for price hold if you know something that will reduce the price sell now and know can be used in a loose sense if you have a strong opinion against the market then you might like to invest based on that nothing beats being paid for being right finally bear in mind that expected return is not the same as utility you have your own investment goals and your own view of risk if you 're more risk averse than the market then you might prefer to sell now rather than wait for the acquisition if you 're more risk prone than the market then you might prefer a 90 chance of $ 1 to that 's fine hold the stock the extreme case of this is that you might have a fixed sum at which you will definitely sell up put everything into the most secure investments you can find and retire to the caribbean if that 's the case then you become totally risk averse the instant your holding crosses that line sell and order cocktails

the etf supply management policy is arcane   etfs are not allowed to directly arbitrage their holdings against the market   other firms must handle redemptions deposits   this makes etfs slightly costlier than the assets held for etfs with liquid holdings its price will rarely vary relative to the holdings slippage of the etf 's holdings management notwithstanding   this is because the firms responsible for depositing redeeming will arbitrage their equivalent holdings of the etf assets prices with the etf price for etfs with illiquid holdings such as emerging markets the etf can vary between trades of the holdings   this will present sometimes large variations between the last price of the etf vs the last prices of its holdings if an etf is shunned its supply of holdings will simply drop and vice versa

this is a good idea but it will barely affect your credit score at all   credit cards while a good tool to use for giving a minor boost to your credit score and for purchasing things while also building up rewards with those purchases are n't very good for building credit    this is because when banks calculate your credit report they look at your long term credit history and weigh larger longer term debt much higher than short term debt that you pay off right away   while having your credit card is better than nothing it 's a relatively small drop in the pond when it comes to credit    i would still recommend getting a credit card though it will if you have n't already started paying off a debt like a student or car loan give you a credit identity and rewards depending on the credit card you choose   but if you do do not ever let yourself fall into delinquency   failing to pay off loans will damage your credit score   so if you do plan to get a credit card it is much better to do as you 've said and pay it all off as soon as possible    edit   in addition to the above using a credit card has the added benefit of having greater security over debit cards and ensures that your own money wo n't be stolen though you will still have to report a fraudulent charge

well sure but that rate wo n't continue for the next 18 years a lot of the increase in public school cost is due to government funding cuts and the increase stops once funding reaches 0   when you look at private schools say the average over the last 18 years is 4.6 a year higher than inflation 2.3 for sure but no where as bad as the overall numbers would suggest

i recently moved out from my parents place after having built up sufficient funds and gone through these questions myself i live near louisville ky which has a significant effect on my income cost of living and cost of housing factor that into your decisions to answer your questions in order when do i know that i 'm financially stable to move out when you have enough money set aside for all projected expenses for 3 6 months and an emergency fund of 4 10 k depending on how large a safety net you want or need note that part of the reason for the emergency fund is as a buffer for the things you wo n't realize you need until you move out such as pots or chairs it also covers things being more expensive than anticipated should i wait until both my emergency fund is at least 6 months of pay    and my loans in my parents names is paid off to free up money 6 months of pay is not a good measuring stick use months of expenses instead in general student loans are a small enough cost per month that you just need to factor them into your costs when should i factor in the newer car investment how much should i    have set aside for the car do the car while you are living at home this allows you to put more than the minimum payment down each month and you can get ahead that looks good on your credit and allows refinancing later for a lower minimum payment when you move out finally it gives you a sense of the monthly cost while you still have leeway to adjust things   depending on new used status of the car set aside around 3 5 k for a down payment that gives you a decent rate without too much haggling trouble should i get an apartment for a couple years before looking for my own    house not unless you want the flexibility of an apartment in general living at home is cheaper if you intend to eventually buy property in the same area an apartment is throwing money away if you want to move every few years an apartment can depending on the lease give you that how much should i set aside for either investment apartment vs    house 10 20 k for a down payment if you live around louisville ky be very about the price of your house and this gives you the best of everything the biggest mistake you can make is trying to get into a place too early banks pay attention to the down payment for a good reason it indicates commitment care and an ability to go the distance in general a mortgage is 30 years you wo n't pay it off for a long time so plan for that is there anything else i should be doing taking advantage of with my    money during this living at home period before i finally leave the    nest if there is something you want now 's the time to get it you can make snap purchases on furniture motorcycles games and not hurt yourself take vacations since there is room in the budget if you 've thought about moving to a different state for work travel there for a weekend week and see if you even like the place look for deals on things you 'll need when you move out towels furniture and so forth can be bought cheaply and you can get quality but it takes time to find these deals pick up activities with monthly expenses boxing dancing gym memberships and so forth become much more difficult to fit into the budget later they also give you a better credit rating for a recurring expense and allow you to get a feel for how things like a monthly utility bill will work finally get involved in various investments a 401k is only the start so look at penny stocks indexed funds etfs or other things to diversify with check out local businesses or start something on the side experiment and have fun

the advantage of pictures or video is that it is fast to get your records up to date pan a video camera over a bookshelf or cd rack and you can later pause it and either say 200 or 40 ps4 games or you can actually list out all the titles so you can go and replace things take a picture of your tv dvd player radio receiver and later you can determine the manufacturer and model from the picture or whatever expensive electronics you have that you treat as furniture and do n't remember the technical details about my house was broken into and robbed the insurance people were not content with we had a tv they wanted to know the make and model they did n't ask for proof but they wanted to know the make and model an inventory to this level of detail is insanely boring to create even if you write up a digital document and only update it with things you bought this year taking an hour to wander around your house recording video which you could add to if you wanted is much quicker should you suffer a loss you will then have to do the insanely boring work of producing the list but you will have the video to use for that purpose no loss no writing up the inventory needed and even if insurance does n't want to know the exact titles you want to replace or how tall the in the living room were you may want it and the pictures or video will help with that

from although pharmacy coverage is an optional benefit under federal medicaid law all states currently provide coverage for outpatient prescription drugs to all categorically eligible individuals and most other within their medicaid programs this is related to the medicaid drug rebate program which offsets the federal and state costs of most outpatient prescription drugs to medicaid patients approximately 600 drug manufacturers currently participate in this program all fifty states and the district of columbia cover prescription drugs under the medicaid drug rebate program i ca n't give you any specific details about patient assistance programs but links to information about various patient assistance programs and general information about medicaid 's and medicare 's prescription drug offerings it 's conceivable that you may be eligible for a patient assistance program but not medicaid for all i know the reverse may be true but it 's difficult to tell without contacting the specific company some patient assistance programs only apply to generic versions of the drug while some state medicaid programs will pay for brand names obviously this varies from state to state

prop proprietary traders trade using huge amounts of a bank 's money i.e. other people 's money so the reason why they have such low commissions and they certainly do is that the firms for which they work negotiate low commissions as the quantities and volumes as they also trade very frequently will be high and so the total commission will be very high there is no such thing as a prop trading account unless you are a big bank with a very large bank roll tens of millions of usd so you can not open one to enjoy those benefits unless you have enough money that you can negotiate your commission with brokers 25k cad is definitely not enough money to even start a conversation about those sorts of commissions note prop traders are generally banned from trading intraday with their own money by their employers and the law as it is a massive conflict of interests those who do and get caught face lengthy prison sentences

i had a similar situation a while ago and here 's what i learned what are our options here to ensure that this company ca n't to take our money again via ach close existing account and create a new one that has different account number yes as a temporary solution keep balance in the account so that their request for $ ca n't be fulfilled however would our bank incur any fees because of insufficient funds each time the other company tries to charge us again bad idea you may incur penalties for returned payment or the bank may honor the payment and charge you overdraft fees provide to our bank the service termination notice that proves that we    are not in business with the other company anymore and effectively    block them however termination notice has only our signature bank does n't care ach withdrawal is akin to a check the assumption is that the other side has entitlement you can put stop payment once its processed and try to reverse it claiming fraud but the end result will be 1 you 'll end up getting a new account set up while they try to recover the money this is one of the reasons i 'm reluctant allowing standing ach authorizations any more generally the american banking system is very much geared against the consumers and in many ways is very retarded in a more advanced countries which is almost any other country than the us the standing withdrawal authorization goes through your bank and can be revoked

its a good question off the top of my head i would suggest to revoke their licenses to do business and involuntary dissolution of the corporate entity mandatory sale of all assets including customer lists and other intangibles to the highest bidder the entity would essentially be absorbed by other businesses in their industry so the industry and economy as a whole probably would n't be affected too much by the execution the shareholders would lose a lot obviously because the proceeds from the fire sale would probably be way lower than fmv but fuck the shareholders investing carries risk and their business failed the relatively innocent employees could go work in the other businesses that bought up 's assets higher level corporate executives should have to take personal responsibility legally this is similar to how sox requires the ceo and cfo to take personal responsibility for the financial statements they prepare and publish with penalties up to and including millions of dollars of fines and jail time   but of course as long as i 'm dreaming i 'd like a pony too as the saying goes

as some others have pointed out it 's key to remember the difference in market value and accounting value   to simplify things book value is the only item that specifically depreciates it happens in the world of accounting to try to time when did i use a long term asset with when did i obtain value from that asset for a house governments usually allow owners to claim depreciation of the building over a set period of time this does not affect your resale value of the house   similarly for a commercial property governments set laws for how an individual or a company can time the use of that asset vs. their accounting some companies can have totally depreciated zero cost assets that are still very productive    market property values are derived from 3 specific sources value in trade is an estimate of the value that others would be willing to pay for a similar asset that 's why you can buy a house today and in a normal market the same house should be worth a similar amount of money in the future value in use can be more interesting this is where a farmer can extract $ 100,000 in value per year from 10 acres of land but as a region develops a manufacturing company can generate $ 300,000 per year from the same 10 acres of land the company can buy out the farmer at a fair price > $ 100,000 per year and still net positive from the investment   income approach tends to be focused on properties that have a cash flow but can be adapted to other property estimates it evaluates the current business case for any property with the cost of money down the overall investment price and the expected value from any returns   remember the market value is very simply the price you could obtain if you sold the asset at a given time it is rarely considered in terms of how much will this go down   book value is an accounting exercise and declines by a set amount every year because it means you can estimate the cost of owning an asset vs the value it generates in a particular time period

yes the value of a stock is completely 100 determined by what people are willing to pay for it in conjunction with what people who have it are willing to sell it for if something really bad happened to a company like their only factory burned to the ground and the traders did n't care then i guess in that scenario the value of the stock would not change but you can spin all sorts of hypotheticals of that sort if dogs could talk would german speak german etc any answer is pretty meaningless because the premise is wildly unlikely as cqm notes traders in this context means everyone who buys or sells stock if you buy stock that includes you they 're not some cabal somewhere if you see a stock listed at whatever $ 50 and you are not willing to pay more than $ 40 for it then you refuse to buy and so you tend to force the price down if you 're not a billionaire then your impact on the market is tiny but the market is made up of millions of people each with tiny influence note that all this is true not just of the stock market but of every product on the market a product is worth whatever the owner is willing to sell it for and people are willing to pay this is what determines the price of everything from houses to it 's a little theory i 've invented that i like to call the law of supply and demand

generally speaking granting rights to one bank account e.g. making a joint account does not extend rights to other accounts or otherwise let one joint owner create new obligations on the other owner e.g. opening a line of credit that the other owner must pay for except to the extent of the joint account   i assume there are no uk rules that would change this feature the other party can of course withdraw all the money without need for your approval   this also means that the joint account could be exposed to all the creditors of either party   if your account joint tenant has huge debts the creditors could theoretically look to the joint account for satisfaction   at least that would be an issue under us law frankly it may be simpler to get a separate account for the other person if possible and make transfers with online banking   it could also make sense to get a banking card if those are in the uk which works like a debit card and can be through various means sometimes a call sometimes online deposits sometimes in physical stores   there may be fees to getting such a card or a second account of course   the benefit is that the cardholder has no access to your account and you control recharging   such cards are widely available in the us to people who otherwise would not qualify for traditional bank accounts note also the fatca complication with adding a us person to your account   my understanding is that a number of non us banks will simply close the accounts of americans rather than deal with hassles under fatca

many of the major indices    today because of this news why how    do the rising budget deficits and debt    relate to the stock markets the major reason for the market is the uncertainty regarding the us dollar if the us credit rating drops that will have an inflationary effect on the currency as it will push up the cost of us treasuries and reduce confidence in the usd if this continues the loss of usd confidence could bring an end to the usd as the world 's reserve currency which could also create inflation as world banks could reduce their usd reserves this can make us assets appear overvalued why is there such a large emphasis on    the s&p rating s&p is a large trusted rating agency so the market will respond to their analysis much like how a bank would respond to any change in your rating by transunion consumer credit bureau does this have any major implications    for the us stock markets today in the    short term and in july if you are a day trader i 'm sure it does there will be minor fluctuations in the market as soon as news comes out either of its extension or any expected delays in passing that extension what happens when the debt ceiling is    reached since the us is in a deficit spending situation it needs to borrow more to satisfy its existing obligations in short it pays its debt with more debt as a result if the debt ceiling is n't raised then eventually the us will be unable to pay its existing obligations we would be in a default situation which could have devastating affects on the value of the usd how hard the hit will depend on how long the default situation lasts the longer we go without an increased ceiling after the exhaustion point the more we default on in reality congress will approve a raise but they will drag it out to the last possible minute they want to appear as if they are against it but they understand the catastrophic effects of not doing so

first there are mlm businesses that are legitimate and are not ponzi schemes i actually work with one i will not name it lest i give the impression of trying to sell here one thing i learned was how to respond when a prospect raises objections related to the actual scams which are abundant the answer being to point out and you mentioned this yourself that in an illegitimate scheme there is no actual product being offered the only thing money is ever spent on is the expectation of a future profit ask your friend would you buy the product this company sells at the price they ask if there were not a financial opportunity attached to it if not how can you expect anyone else to buy it from you there are only 3 ways he can respond to this question he can realize that you 're right and get out now he can change the subject to the concept of making money by climbing the ranks and earning off of a salesforce in which case it 's time to educate him on ponzi or he can claim to be able to sell something he does n't believe in in which case you should run fat far away if he does indicate that he would be a customer even without the chance to sell the product then offer him the chance to prove it by giving you one sales pitch on the condition that he is not allowed to breathe a word about joining the business do him the courtesy of listening with an open mind and decide for yourself whether you could ever be a customer if the possibility exists even if not today he has found one of the few legitimate mlm companies and you should not try to stop him if not you 'll have to determine whether it 's because the product just is n't for you or because it 's inherently worthless and whether you should encourage or discourage your friend going forward

october 18 2017 by john goldman sachs making too little money is not the worst of the world ’s problems but inside the investment bank ’s new york headquarters it feels like an insult   goldman is not suffering a financial crisis as it did in 2008 when it officially converted to being a bank holding company amid panic that the whole of wall street could collapse it faces something deeper an identity crisis   it used to be the role model for many rival banks even while for its single minded focus on investment banking and trading but as tuesday ’s disclosure of a 26 per cent fall in its bond trading revenues confirmed banking has changed instead of lenders such as jpmorgan chase wanting to become as glamorous as goldman it needs to be more like them   this is a telling moment albeit less dramatic than 2008 investment banking enjoyed a lucrative two decades spurred by globalisation and financial goldman ’s revenues rose from its initial public offering in 1999 to 2007 and boomed in 2009 it could do no wrong financially although it turned out to have done wrong to some of its customers   but guess what regulation works governments and central bank supervisors set out to make complex trading in bonds and derivatives the securities business in which goldman specialised more expensive and less profitable the rules now favour deposit taking and lending instead of   no one really planned the second aspect of the bank ’s difficulty the huge dose of monetary easing since the crisis has volatility and made markets more predictable hedge funds themselves under pressure no longer need to reward goldman and others for taking on financial risk   goldman ’s bond and commodities trading division from which emerged a of leaders including lloyd blankfein its chairman and chief executive tells its own story it used to occupy two floors of the new york office but has shrunk to one as wall street ’s total bond trading revenues have halved since 2009 more prices are calculated by computers than humans   when you rely heavily on one engine and that engine you are in trouble the bank ’s financial advisory and capital raising division is performing well and it has an investment management arm but it lacks a consumer powerhouse like morgan stanley ’s wealth management operation or the lending and credit card activities that drive banks such as jpmorgan   the truth for goldman is that us retail banking has become not only more reliable than investment banking but more profitable jpmorgan ’s balance sheet is three times the size of goldman ’s and its retail banking arm made a 19 per cent return on equity in the third quarter compared with goldman ’s 11 per cent   the best historical comparison for goldman ’s predicament is ironically the jpmorgan of the 1990s jpmorgan was a blue chip corporate bank but found that this business was no longer profitable enough as lending margins fell it launched an effort to return to investment banking having been separated from morgan stanley in by the glass steagall act   jpmorgan had a good stab at it compensating for the fact that goldman and others dominated wall street ’s bulge bracket by credit derivatives which later turned out badly but it could not make enough progress alone and settled for being bought by chase manhattan in 2000   both banks have struggled to keep pace with the rapid growth of the leading investment banks which are in businesses that have been far more lucrative than the lending business at the core of commercial banking the new york times noted in its account of the merger years and one financial crisis later jpmorgan has reversed this order of profitability   so goldman is now trying to do the opposite of the old jpmorgan by adding banking to investment banking jpmorgan ’s former dilemma has not gone away lending to blue chip companies is not much of a a more tempting target is the high margins that banks make on credit cards   hence marcus goldman ’s online lender named after its founder marcus goldman which offers loans to prime us consumers as an alternative to credit card debt marcus which will launch next year in the uk accounts for $ of the $ in new lending and financing planned by goldman in the next three years as it diversifies   but it is no simpler for goldman to break into main street than it was for the old jpmorgan to break back into wall street $ on a balance sheet of $ is an interesting financial experiment not a revolution it would need to inflict on consumer banking with technology what amazon did to the retail industry to rival fully jpmorgan and bank of america   we ’re a bank and we ’re committed to being a bank says one partner firmly but selling personal loans and mortgages which could be marcus ’s next target is not a job designed for masters of the universe this is goldman ’s identity crisis regulation and economics are rendering it ordinary

how you answer is actually dependent on when they ask if it is early in the process the question answer is to determine the type of loan you are looking for auto loan home loan home improvement loans education loans all have products that are geared to those uses in many cases they will use the item you are purchasing as collateral for the loan in return for this they will offer you a low interest rate because they know they can protect their money be the collateral   for these standard loans they will ask for more specifics before they give a check for the money because they need to know exactly what you are spending the money on and they will need to file legal paperwork to protect their money if it is n't one of those standard loans then you are looking at a loan that is only backed by your signature that loan could have a high interest rate they are asking as part of the process of assessing their risk unless you are putting a lie on a form i am not sure being puts you in jeopardy   in some cases they do n't care people get lines of credit without knowing exactly what they are going to spend the money on

with permanent contract in germany you should n't have any problem getting a loan it 's even more important than how much do you earn generally you should ask for a house mortgage with annuity as a type of credit to save on interest besides you usually get a better conditions with a saving bank sparkasse or a popular bank situated in the area where your house is situated you also should n't combine your credit with extra products the simpler is the product the better is for you maybe i 'll write later an extra piece on the common pitfalls in this regard probably you could find a bank that would give you such a loan but it would be very expensive you should save at least 40 because then the bank can refinance your loan cheaply and in return offer you a low interest taxes depend heavily on the place where you buy a house when you buy it you pay a tax between 3.5 and 6 look up here then you pay a property tax it depends on community how much do you pay the leverage is called here 's example notary would cost ca 1.5 of the house price all and all you should calculate with 10 a country independent advice if you want to save on interest in the long run you should take an annuity loan with the shortest maturity pay attention to effective interest rate now to germany specifics do n't forget to ask about extra amortization an option to amortize usually banks offer 5 p.a the interest rate is usually fixed for 8 years however ask about it this period is called it sound ridiculous but in southern lands you usually get better conditions as in berlin or the gap could be as big as 0.5 p.a of effective interest rate in germany they often use so called initial rate of as a parameter

first let 's define some terms your accrued benefit is a monthly benefit payable at your normal retirement age usually 65 it is usually a life only benefit but may have a number of years guaranteed or may have a survivor piece it is defined by a plan formula ie it is a defined benefit a lump sum is how much that accrued benefit is worth right now lump sums are based on applicable interest rates and mortality tables specified by the irs interest rates are released monthly mortality annually your plan can either use the same interest rates for a whole year or they can use new ones each month affecting your lump sum is whether your accrued benefit is payable now immediately you are age 65 or later deferred you are now age 30 for example instead of being paid an annuity assume you are paid just one payment of $ 1,000 on your birthday the lump sum of that for a 65 year old would be $ 1,000 since there would be no interest discount and no chance of dying before payment for a 30 year old at 4 interest the lump sum would be about $ 237 including mortality discount at age 36 the lump sum is $ so the lump sum will get bigger just because you get older very important is the interest discount at age 30 in the example 2 interest would produce a $ lump sum and at 6 $ the bigger the rate the smaller the lump sum because interest helps an amount now grow bigger in the future to complicate things since 2008 the irs bases lump sums on 3 different interest rates the annuity payments made within 5 years of the lump sum date use the 1st rate past 5 and within 20 years use the 2nd rate and past that use the 3rd rate since you are age 30 all of your monthly annuity payments would be made after 20 years so that makes it simple since we 'll only have to look at the 3rd rate when you reach age 45 the 2nd rate will kick in here is the table of interest rates published by the irs you 'll find your rates above on the 2013 line for that means your lump sum is being made in 2013 and it is being based on the month august 2012 most likely your plan will use the same rates for its entire plan year but what is your plan year if it is the calendar year then you would have a 5 month for the rates but if is a september to august plan year with a 1 month the rates would have changed between august and september your august lump sum would be based on your september on would be based on see the all line for for comparison a 30 year old with a $ 100 annuity payable at age 65 would have a lump sum value of $ at but a lump sum value of $ at the change in your accrued benefit by month will obviously have some impact on the lump sum value but not as much as the change in interest rates if there is one the amount they actually contribute to the plan has nothing to do with the value of the lump sum though

from a purely financial standpoint psychology aside the choice between paying off debt and investing on risky investments boils down to a comparison of risk and reward   yes on average the stock market has risen an average of 10 give or take per year but the yearly returns on the s&p 500 have ranged from a high of in 1995 to a low of in 2008   so there 's a good chance that your investment in index funds will get a better return than the guaranteed return of paying off the loan but it 's not certain and you might end up much worse   you could even calculate a rough probability of coming out better with some reasonable assumptions e.g. if you assume that returns are normally distributed which historically they 're not but your chances are probably around 30 that you 'll end up worse off in one year your odds are better the longer your investment horizon is   if you can tolerate meaning you have both the desire and the ability to take that risk then you might come out ahead    the non financial factors however the psychology of debt the drain on discretionary cash flow etc can not be dismissed as irrational   paying off debt feels good   yes finance disagree with dave ramsey and his approaches but you can not deny the problems that debt causes millions of households both consumer debt and student loan debt as well   if that makes them mindless because they follow a plan that worked for them then so be it disclosure i am a and a fan but do n't agree 100 with him

in my mind when looking at a five year period you have a number of options you did n't specify where you are based which admittedly makes it harder to give you good advice if you are looking for an investment that can achieve large gains equities are impossible to ignore by investing in an index fund or other diverse asset forms such as mutual funds your risk is relatively minimal however there has historically been five year periods where you would lose your money if this was to be the case you would likely be better off waiting more than five years to buy a house which would be frustrating when markets rebound they often do it hard if you are in a major economy taking something like the top 100 of your stock market is a safe bet although admittedly you would have made terrible returns if you invested in the polish markets while they often achieve lower returns than equity investments they are generally considered safer especially government issued bonds if you were willing to sacrifice returns for safety you must always consider them   this is an interesting new addition and i ca n't comment on the state of it in the united states however in europe we have a number of platforms which do this in the uk for example you can achieve returns yoy using sites like funding circle if you invest in a diverse range of businesses you have minimal risk from and individual company not paying elsewhere in europe although not appropriate for me as everything i do is denominated in sterling you can secure 12 in places like georgia poland and estonia this is a very good rate and the platforms seem reputable and guarantee their loans however unlike funding circle they are for consumer loans the risk profile in my mind is similar to that of equities but it is hard to say whatever you do you need to do your homework and ensure that you can handle the level of risk offered by the investments you make i have n't included things like savings accounts in here as the rates are n't worth bothering with

founder makes available 100 equity but uses a reasonable amount of the proceeds to pay him herself a salary or wage and from that salary invests in the same initial offering to acquire shares for him herself    i see several problems    what is a reasonable salary    also this leaves the door open to the following scam   founders say that they are going to follow this plan   however instead of buying shares they simply quit after being paid the salary   they use knowledge gained from this business to start a competitor   investors are left holding an empty company    tax consequences   the founder would pay income tax on the salary   by contrast if the founder instead sells shares that would be capital gains tax which is lower in many countries e.g. the united states    why would i want to invest in a business where the founders do n't believe in it enough to take a significant equity stake    consider the amazon.com example   jeff bezos makes a minimal salary around $ 80,000 a year less than many of his employees   but he has a substantial ownership position   if the company does n't make money he wo n't   would investors really value the stocks with a p e of in 2016 if they did n't trust him to make the right long term decisions    it 's also worth noting that most initial public offerings ipos are not made when the founder is the only employee   a single employee company instead looks for private investors often called angel investors   companies generally do n't go public until they are established in some way often making money   negotiating with angel investors is different from negotiating with the public   they can personally review the books and once invested tend to have input on how the money is spent    in other words this is mostly solving the wrong problem if you talk about ipos   this might make more sense with a venture as that replaces a few angel investors with many individuals   but most ventures tend to approach things from the opposite direction   instead of looking for investors they look for customers   if they offer a useful product they will get customers   if not they never get the money    beyond all this if a founder is only going to get a fair salary some of the time then why put in any sweat equity   this works fine if the company looks valuable after a year   what if it does n't   the founder is out a year of sweat equity and has nothing in return   that happens now too but the possibility of the big return offsets it   you 're taking out the big return    i do n't think that this is good for either founders or investors   the founder trades a potentially good or even great return for a mediocre return   the investors trade a situation where both they and the founder benefit from a successful company to one where they benefit a lot more than the founder   that 's not good for either side

if all the property is going up and down at the same rate it 's probably a bit of a wash however there are markets e.g. the front range of colorado where i live where property at different price levels and locations has performed very differently for a place to live i think it 's most useful to look at housing as a consumption decision like buying a car rather than an investment decision like buying art since it is similarly illiquid consider what you need and want features location how important the own vs rent tradeoffs are to you including the risk of losing your equity and what you can comfortably afford then do n't worry so much about price trends this it seems to me is the lesson of the recent housing bust

gt;if you do n’t have a lot of money the presence of a sizable sum in the house or even in the bank means that you ’ll be constantly tempted to dip into it   the psychology behind statements like this are a source of amusement to me they seem to that those who have less money are bad with it kind of a chicken and egg issue that assumes one over the other   it makes me think that authors researchers and have likely never felt the degree of financial insecurity that drives behaviors such as the ones being discussed   if you do n't have a lot of money the possession of a sizable sum presents other problems such as issues of needs and purchases that have been put off due to a lack of resources while you prioritized for survival you put off buying the washing machine because your car needed repairs how else were you going to be able to get to work you can limp by using a or doing laundry at your parents house but you likely put off all sorts of other needs as well and now you have to find the best way to allocate a sizable sum that likely is n't going to be enough to address all of the needs you have put off   while you 're trying to decide how to best allocate this resource do n't forget the talking heads that lecture you on the importance of an emergency fund disregard for a moment that when cash is such a scarce resource any unexpectedly dire circumstance which would be best resolved by your having more of it probably constitutes an emergency

most of this advice applies to the uk where i work in motor insurance pricing for a large personal lines insurer but a lot of it is more general a loyal customer is usually an overpaying customer the guiding most financial services companies go by is that there 's no point rewarding loyalty except to create it where none exists i.e. by giving massive discounts to desirable new customers   shop around every time your policy comes up for renewal and whenever your circumstances change never allow your policy to automatically renew you may be charged a higher premium by default if you do phone up your current insurer and haggle to see if they can beat the best quote you find their agents will usually be able offer a discount if applicable in your country use price comparison websites use at least two different insurers sometimes offer different rates on different sites competing harder on some than on others especially if the price comparison website happens to be owned by one of the insurance companies that quotes on it one example of this is which is owned by rsa group a major insurer if there are no price comparison websites for your country try purchasing your policy through a broker they 'll get quotes from a panel of insurers and offer you the cheapest they can be especially helpful if you have a problematic driving history e.g. drink driving convictions as many mainstream insurers will decline to quote for such people other suggestions chris rea 's answer is a good starting point but i would disagree about cutting back on cover in the uk at least many insurers often charge an equal or greater amount for lower levels of cover because the people who choose these policies tend to be worse risks re switching vehicles a cheap old car will not necessarily be much cheaper to insure than a new expensive one as you can still people with it or crash into other people 's cars and the newer car will probably have better safety features however a less powerful and smaller vehicle typically poses less of a threat to others and will therefore be cheaper to insure another tactic not mentioned so far is reverse fronting fronting where the main driver poses as an additional driver and a less risky driver as the main driver is illegal but the reverse adding a less risky driver as an additional driver is legal and can sometimes reduce premiums this is because only one of you can drive the car at any one time and sometimes it 'll be the less risky one so especially if you 're male and aged < 25 see if adding your safest parent as a named driver makes a difference if you have the choice of storing your car on a driveway or on the street get quotes for both and see which is cheaper if you live in an area where is commonplace thieves are more likely to steal cars left on driveways as they can break into the owner 's home and steal the keys if not the driveway is better as it reduces the risk of a collision if you have previously driven another vehicle e.g. motorbike or or if you 've been insured as an additional driver on someone else 's car call up insurers directly and ask if they can offer you a no claims bonus for this quotes from price comparison websites tend to limit you to the numbers of years of no claims you 've accrued as a main driver and may not reflect your full available no claims bonus extreme measures some insurers give you the option to install a tracking device in your car that can tell them various things e.g.   some people may be uncomfortable sharing this much information with their insurer but for particularly risky drivers i 'm looking at you males < 25 it can sometimes result in a substantial saving one insurer that offers this is finally if every insurer you can find is quoting in excess of £ 10,000 for a year 's cover you may find it cheaper instead to purchase a vintage agricultural vehicle and get it covered on a specialist farmer 's policy

the idea is that the premiums or costs associated with the plan are a business expense you know that already   the distinction here is that employees do n't pay premiums they elect to contribute the company sponsors a plan the employees then choose to accept less salary in order to participate in the employer 's plan   the idea is that you 're foregoing income why is the employee not taxed on this cost   one major reason is that the employee has no say in and often no idea what the gross costs are some find out if they ever receive cobra election paperwork there are more benefits than strict healthcare that are section 125 eligible   the government has a vested interest in keeping the population healthy and when the erisa laws and section 125 were written it was and still is a pretty low friction way to get health insurance out to more people   at this point taking away the tax break from the employees would be a huge government take away from most of the population   try to get a politician to take something away from taxpayers why does n't the deduction exist in kind to people buying individual coverage   ask your legislators   there are thousands of preferential tax treatment where some industry will get some sort of benefit or break   i 'm not sure what leads you to think there needs to be some supremely logical reason for this to exit

a derivative contract can be an option and you can take a short sell position much the same way you would in a stock when buying options you risk only the money you put in however when selling do n't have the securities or cash to cover all potential losses options you are borrowing brokers force you to maintain a required amount of cash called a maintenance requirement when selling naked calls theoretically you are able to lose an infinite amount of money so in order to sell this type of options you have to maintain a certain level of cash in your account if you fail to maintain this level you will enter into what s often referred to as a margin call and yes they will call your phone and tell you your broker has the right to liquidate your positions in order to meet requirements ps from experience my broker has never liquidated any of my holdings but then again i 've never been in a margin call for longer then a few days and never with a severe amount the margin requirement for investors is regulated and brokers follow these regulations

one reason for this is that many people do n't simply allow their houses to rot and decay if you 're talking about a house built in 1980 and left vacant and for 35 years it probably will be in pretty poor shape   but a homeowner generally wants to preserve their house and maintain it in good condition so they invest in things like new roofs siding gutters windows paint new furnaces hot water heaters air conditioners etc all this stuff costs money and for tax purposes can often be factored into the cost basis of the house when it is sold but it maintains the value of the property a small hole in the roof may be fairly cheap to fix but if left it could eventually cause much of the building to rot making the structure near worthless if a car into your living room you do n't generally leave it there most people repair the damage   it 's not uncommon in some areas to have 100 year old houses or 300 + year old houses in some countries that were built well in the first place and have been well maintained in the interim   people also renovate their homes ripping out outdated construction and appliances and sometimes building new additions decks etc this also serves to make the property more attractive and increases its value

i 'm assuming that all the savings are of defined contribution type and not defined benefit as per 's comment to the original question aside from convenience of having all the pension money in one place which may or may not be something you care about there may be a benefit associated with being able to rebalance your portfolio when you need do say you invest your pension pot in a of equities and bonds respectively due higher risk reward ratio of the equities part in the long run equities tend to get overweight turning your mix into 70%/30 or even therefore raising your overall exposure to equities general practice is to rebalance your portfolio every now and then in this case by selling some equities and buying more bonds sell high buy low now if you have few small pockets of pension money it makes it harder to keep track of the overall asset allocation and actually do the rebalancing as you can not see and trade everything from one place

i 've consulted to a few companies before and i have to say the biggest problem i found among them was their inability to understand growth   now most companies become ambitious and in a sense want to grow and increase their profits but are completely off in how to do it   this can be seen from a manufacturing sales engineering perspective and administrative functions the idea that always sticks in their minds is they have to add personal if they wish to grow though that is n't always true   as an external person with no set bias you should be able to figure out a creative way to their problems even if they have n't noticed them yet    another area i 've come to see problems in is debt i 've seen successful companies held down by their they run a cash only business to others that took on too much debt   there is no easy solution to this yet a gradual and conservative approach to this area can help them in the long run   on the same topic i often think there are lots of inefficiencies in finances and the support groups that can be in an easy manner    lastly the biggest problem i 've seen with every single small business is customer service   as they grow the lack of training is apparent and there is no common ground as to how employees should be their company     good luck

businesses are free to decide what payment methods they accept for their goods and services businesses sometimes advertise what credit cards they accept by posting some stickers at their door when your credit card is n't among them and you do n't have enough cash with you ask about your card before you order if a business does n't accept your credit card your best recourse is to take your business elsewhere when you already ate there and got into an awkward situation because you assumed that they would accept your card you might also want to write an online review of the place and warn others to bring cash for their visit but please be fair in the review when the food and service are decent a restaurant does n't deserve a one star rating just because they do n't take credit cards note that businesses have good reasons to not accept credit cards it often means additional cost for them in form of but there is also a more shady reason taking payment in cash means that there is no electronic trail of the transaction that makes it far easier for an establishment to their income they might under report it to evade taxes or over report it to launder money both are illegal of course

if the $ 9000 was deposited in february 2016 then it must be declared on your 2015 taxes not 2016 you never have a choice about when to declare a contribution the only choice you have is when to claim it as a deduction and it 's very rarely a good idea to delay claiming it you may want to take a look at your notice of assessment from tax year 2015 to see if the cra noticed the error and adjusted your return for you the text portion would usually mention any such adjustments if you can not find your it can be accessed by logging in to cra 's my account service if your 2015 rrsp contribution amount was not already adjusted for you then this service is also a good way to request a change to your 2015 return   though most people do n't realize it you technically gain your contribution room based on the previous year 's income on january 1st it 's just that you usually do n't know your exact income until you get your t4 this means that on jan 1 2016 you received that $ 6000 room and thus despite being wrong about which tax year the $ 9000 is declared you are still right about being over by $ 3000 you are allowed a little wiggle room on your limit but only $ 2000 so you 'll be charged 1 per month for every dollar in excess of $ 2000 over on january 1 2017 you would have received more contribution room based on your 2016 income and so as of then you are no longer over your limit that should mean that your penalty applies for 11 months for a total of $ 110 you can try calling the cra to see if they will waive or reduce your penalty on the grounds that you were unaware of your employer 's deposit best of luck to answer your final question yes that 3 k over contribution will now basically just be reducing your available contribution room for 2017 think of it as having room left between february 2016 and jan 2017 and then more room was added in january making that a positive number so you do n't need to withdraw or do anything further to fix things other than paying your penalty or getting it waived

bargaining existed before the government officially granted people that right    collective bargaining is an ambiguous term that could refer to many concepts there is voluntarily agreed to collective bargaining which has nothing wrong with it and then there are laws that force the employer to collectively bargain with a union if a union requests it which is a mandate and violates the employer 's contract liberty   gt;however we 've been through that in this country and child labor unsafe working conditions and 80 hour weeks    i r business to this claim made by another redditor as well   gt;the prevalence of child labor was decreasing long before any law was created prohibiting it child labor is necessary in poor countries because people are far less productive per hour worked as productivity increases parents can afford to send their children off to school instead of working since their own work is enough to support the family   labor is something that needs to disappear on its own in response to changing economic conditions if you introduced a law prohibiting child labor in a poor country like cambodia right now it would lead to widespread hardship and an increase in mortality   gt;in other words no government mandate created due to union pressure can possibly lead to beneficial change since laws that limit people 's economic rights under the assumption that 51 knows what 's better for the minority than they themselves do generally do much more harm than good   nothing good comes for the country from using the threat of violence as all laws do to deny people a right to manage their own property how they see fit   gt;like all laws there is a balance to be struck between individual rights and the common good and what can be seen as a right for one can often be seen as a right to violate another 's rights for someone else   there is no game reason to assume or empirical evidence that suggests that violating people 's property ownership rights leads to a greater betterment of the common good than would have happened with property ownership rights intact   gt;&gt;the mighty is those who use the force of government or the threat of violence e.g. violent strikes to prevent another party from exercising their contract liberty and firing them   gt;this is some pretty extreme hyperbole and hard to take seriously   as history over the last century has shown it 's no hyperbole labor unions backed regulations soft socialism has succeeded in spite of the resistance of employers   membership in this country has dwindled to around 10 down from around 50 during the middle of the century and the erosion of the middle class has been the undeniable result   because unions have destroyed nearly every major industry where they had a natural tendency to form large scale capital intensive manufacturing operations where large numbers of workers were concentrated in one place    in no union dominated industries did unions fade due to greater power by employers vehicle manufacturing low value high volume consumer goods manufacturing ship building passenger rail service us steel in all of these industries the number of unionized employees declined because the industries themselves contracted in the us   the force of government you know we may have the right to strike in this country but there 's no law that says a company ca n't hire replacement workers indefinitely   the force of government prevents companies from refusing to collectively bargain with a labor union   of violence violent strikes this is a straw man if i 've ever seen one who is threatening violence here   this existed before government laws were created that made legal threats on behalf of employees that want to keep unionized employees employed and force companies to collectively bargain with a union   now of course the themselves are not directly threatening violence since they are backed by the force of government   when you look at the wealth disparity in this country it 's pretty hard to argue that the right to collective bargaining has resulted in an unfair advantage for workers   collectively bargaining does n't benefit workers in general it benefits in the short term those workers who are employed and unionized at the expense of long term wage growth and employment opportunities for the unemployed and non unionized employees

if you have enough medical expenses to empty your hsa tax free that is certainly an option however you have another option you could roll your hsa funds over to a different hsa that has better investment options doing this has a huge advantage over any other taxable account or retirement account it will grow tax free and you will be able to withdraw tax free at anytime as long as you accumulate enough medical expenses to cover your gains   if you do n't have a lot of money in your hsa now it might not be worth the effort to maintain an hsa and continue to track your medical expenses but if you have enough in there to invest moving it to an investable hsa is probably a better option than simply moving it to a taxable account

this seemed very unrealistic i mean who would do that but to my immense surprise the market price increased to 5.50 $ in the following week why is that this is strange it seems that people mistakenly believe that the company should be at 5.5 and currently available cheap this looks like irrational behaviour most of the past 6 months the said stock in range bound to 4.5 to 5 the last time it hit around 5.5 was so this is definitely strange if the company had set a price of 6.00 $ in the rights offering would the price have increased to 6 $ obviously the company thinks that their shares are worth that much but why did the market suddenly agree possibly yes possible no it can be answered more often the rights issue are priced at slight discount to market price why did this happen obviously management thinks that the company is worth that much but why did the market simply believe this statement without any additional information i do n't see any other information if the new shares had some special privileges in terms of voting rights dividends etc then yes however the announcements says the rights issues is for common shares

to sum up my question came from misunderstanding what cost basis applies to now i get it that it applies to stocks as physical entities consider a chain of buys of 40 stock a with prices $ qty 10 each time then irs wants to know exactly which stock i am selling and when i transfer stocks to different account that cost basis transfers with them cost basis is included in transfers so that removes ambiguity which stock is being sold on the original account in the example above cost basis of 20 stocks moved to a new account would probably be $ 1 x 10 and $ 4 x 10 i.e. fifo also applies to transfers

think about the credit card business model they have two revenue generators interest and fees from borrowers and commissions and fees to merchants the key to a successful credit card is to both sign up lots of borrowers and lots of merchants credit card fortunes have improved dramatically since the 1990 's when formerly off limits merchants like grocery stores began to accept cards so when a credit card lets you just pull cash out of any atm there are a few costs they need to account for when pricing the cost for such a service credit card banks have managed to make cash advances both a profit center and a self serving perk knowing that you can always draw upon your credit line for an emergency when cash is necessary makes you less likely to actually carry cash and more likely to just rely on your credit card

that is a decision you need to make but some of the pros and cons you could consider to help your decision making include pros if bought at the right time in the property cycle and in a good growth area it can help you grow your net worth much quicker than having money in the bank earning near zero interest you would be replacing rent payments with mortgage payments and if your mortage payments are less than your current rent you will have additional money to pay for any expenses on the property and have a similar cashflow as you do now you will be able to deduct your interest payments on the mortgage against your income if you are in the usa thus reducing the tax you pay you will have the security of your own house and not have to worry about moving if the landlord wants you out after your lease expires cons if bought in a bad area and at the top of the property cycle you may never make any capital gains on the property and in fact may lose money on it long term if the mortgage payments are more than your current rent you may be paying more especially at the start of your mortgage if you buy a house you are generally stuck in one spot it will be harder to move to different areas or states as it can cost a lot of money and time to sell and buy elsewhere if renting you can generally just give notice and find a new place to rent property maintenance costs and taxes could be a drain on your finances especially if the mortgage repayments are more than your current rent if your mortgage payments and property expenses are way more than your current rent it may reduce what you could be investing in other areas to help increase your net worth

tl;dr if your currently held bond 's bid yield is smaller than another bonds ask yield you can swap your bond for bigger returns let 's imagine you buy a long bond for $ 12000 face value of $ 10000 and it has 6 coupon the cash flows will have an internal return rate of this is the published ask yield in 2014 of the bond after six years prices have fallen inflation and yields went up so you can sell it for only $ 10000 if you would do it the irr will be only so there will be less return than if you keep it   but if you would undo the transaction then the future cash flows would yield this is the bid yield in 2020 of the bond if you can find an offer that yields more than you have better returns if you sell your bond and invest that $ 10000 in the other bond   but as other answers pointed it out you rarely have this opportunity as the market is very effective assuming everything else is equal

major in cs   i 'm 26 with a bs in finance with accounting minor i wish i went with a cs back in the day but oh well i 'm learning programming and computer science on my own now while i work full time fortunately i 'm well on my way towards a strong it career since i work in business intelligence and big data it can be a grind while working full time though   do n't think you are not good at science classes i used to think the same they 're not easy which means you will just have to read and study more and better keep at it develop leadership skills and organize study groups meet with your professors and if you must do n't be afraid to ask questions ever   also consider getting a minor in something it 'll be harder but usually well worth it pick a minor in a field you find interesting every field and industry needs cs majors and you will make yourself that much more valuable a major in cs with a minor in finance would make you look but do n't go with finance though i suggest a science any bio physics or chemistry is good you 'll end up with a nice paying job i consider my cs skills beginner but i 'm above average compared to the general population and already get paid very well

i would go with the family route if i was you and i think many other people would if they were fortunate to have such a great option   this will allow you to move faster when your trying to buy a new house because you can easily get a mortage if you see a stellar deal also you can establish credit in much cheaper ways than paying the 4 or so on a mortgage finance a car that you have the money to buy because the interest rates are much lower and you build the credit while paying less interest or even better try and make most of your purchases on a 0 fee credit card and every 6 8 months get a new credit card to have multiple lines of ongoing credit   to use the mortage to establish credit is nt worth the 4 hit in wealth that it offers now mind you if your options were to buy the house with your own money outright or get a mortgage i would say get the mortgage because the added leverage would help your investments beat the market most years figure if you get 6 an average portfolio each year and you can write off the taxes on your mortgage you will be ahead by more than 2

i 'm guessing you 're in the us if so yes you can be prosecuted but it 's unlikely   fraud crimes are up to a prosecutor to pursue there are a lot of fraud cases and take low priority i 'm assuming you 're passively complicit not actively   if this is the case it 's best to work with the bank to get your situation cleaned up and move on   these days most banks have dealt with wire fraud at least once and they 're familiar with cashiers check fraud    a fair warning the bank will report you if they think you 're involved so if you are not a complete bystander you may want to lawyer up   so hopefully you did n't try to spend any of the fraudulent money and hopefully you have proof of a third party because they will want a connection to that person name number other to file their report

unless you are getting the loan from a loan shark it is the most common case that each payment is applied to the interest accrued to date and the rest is applied towards reducing the principal   so assuming that means 26 equally spaced payments during the year the interest accrued at the end of the first fortnight is $ x = $ and so the principal is reduced by $ $ = $ for the next payment the principal still owing at the beginning of that fortnight will be $ = $ and the interest accrued will be $ x = $ and so slightly more of the principal will be reduced than the $ of the previous payment   lather rinse repeat until the loan is paid off which should occur at the end of 17.5 years or after biweekly payments if the loan rate changes during this time since you say that this is a variable rate loan the numbers quoted above will change too and no it is not the case that just 5.75 of the $ 2300 is interest and the rest comes off the principle sic interest is computed on the principal amount still owed $ for starters and then decreasing not the loan payment amount edit   after playing around with a spreadsheet a bit i found that if   payments are made every two weeks 14 days apart rather than 26 equally spaced payments in one year as i used above interest accrues at the rate of 5.75 x for the 14 days rather than at the rate of for the time between payments as i used above each 14 days $ is paid as the biweekly mortgage payment instead of the $ stated by the op then payments slightly less than 17.5 calendar years when leap years are taken into account will pay off the loan   in fact that payment should be reduced by 65 cents   in view of rounding of fractional cents and the like i doubt that it would be possible to have the last equal payment reduce the balance to exactly 0

companies are expected to make a profit otherwise there is no point to their existence and no motivation for investment that profit comes back to shareholders as growth and/or dividend if a company is doing well and has a healthy profit to turn back into investment to facilitate increased future earnings it increases shareholder equity and share price if a company is doing well and has a healthy profit to pay out in dividend it makes the shares more attractive to investors which pushes the price up either way shares go up share prices drop when companies lose money or there are market affecting all companies recessions or when individual companies fail averaged over all companies over the long term decades stocks can be reasonably expected to go up

borrow money from the central bank wrong premise they can not borrow as much as they want and they can not borrow without collateral i.e. government debt instruments they hold or any other instrument with value   and banks do n’t have unlimited collateral to borrow against   secondly central banks are n’t in the business of lending unlimited money the more money they lend out the more is the money supply which inflation which will eventually lead them to stop lending at any point of time they want a certain amount of money movement so they can control inflation and interest rates within an agreed limit and as limited by their economy no sane central bank would want to by printing money at will e g helicopter money so the only other way for banks is to accept deposits from private individuals you can also argue that banks make money by connecting lenders and borrowers and make their profit by being the middleman without using their assets so you can say they are making a profit with the minimum usage of their capital albeit they have the central bank looking over their shoulder to police their behaviour while some banks do charge fees for keeping deposits yes but many provide certain extra services for which they charge that is how they differentiate between no fee accounts and fee paying accounts

it seems that you 're interested in an asset which you can hold that would go up when the gold price went down it seems like a good place to start would be an index fund which invests in the general stock market when the gold market falls this would mainly affect gold mining companies these do not make up a sizable portion of any index fund which is invested broadly in the market unfortunately in order to act on this you would also have to believe that the stock market was a good investment    to test this theory i looked at an etf index fund which tracks the s&p 500 and compared it to an etf which invests in gold   i found that the daily price movements of the stock market were positively correlated with the price of gold this result was statistically significant   the weekly price movements of the stock market were also correlated with the price of gold this result was also statistically significant   when the holding period was stretched to one month there was still a positive relationship between the stock market 's price moves and the price of gold this result was not statistically significant   when the holding period was stretched to one year there was a negative relationship between the price changes in the stock market and the price of gold   this result was not statistically significant either

if you 're worried about investing all at once you can deploy your starting chunk of cash gradually by investing a bit of it each month quarter etc dollar cost averaging   the financial merits and of this have been debated but it is unlikely to lose you a lot of money and if it has the psychological benefit of inducing you to invest it can be worth it even if it results in slightly less than optimal gains more generally you are right with what you say at the end of your question in the long run when you start wo n't matter as long as you continue to invest regularly   the boglehead style index fund based theory is basically that yes you might save money by investing at certain times but in practice it 's almost impossible to know when those times are so the better choice is to just keep investing no matter what   if you do this you will eventually invest at high and low points so the ups and downs will be moderated also note that from this perspective your example of investing in 2007 is incorrect   it 's true that a person who put money in 2007 and then sat back and did nothing would have barely broken even by now   but a person who started to invest in 2007 and continued to invest throughout the economic downturn would in fact reap substantial rewards due to continued investing throughout the lows   happily i speak from experience on this point

this is always a judgement call based on your own tolerance for risk   yes you have a fairly long time horizon and that does mean you can accept more risk more volatility than someone closer to starting to draw upon those savings but you 're old enough and have enough existing savings that you want to start thinking about reducing the risk a notch so most folks in your position would not put 100 in stocks though exactly how much should be moved to bonds is debatable one traditional rule of thumb for a moderately conservative position is to subtract your age from 100 and keep that percentage of your investments in stock for stock bond age will find lots of debate about whether and how to modify this rule i have gone more aggressive myself and have n't demonstrably hurt myself but past results are no guarantee of future performance a paid financial planning advisor can interview you about your risk tolerance run some computer models and recommend a strategy with some estimate of expected performance and volatility if you are looking for a semi rational approach that may be worth considering at least as a starting point

closing a credit card decreases your total available balance which can have a small negative effect if that credit card is a significant portion of your available credit   if it is not then it likely will have little impact on your credit in that department however the case you explained get a card use it for a short while then dump it wo n't have much long term impact to your available credit since you will end up with the same amount as you started the second factor will be the average age of accounts   this will affect you both in the short and long term if you 've had accounts open for a fairly long time but wo n't impact you much if your credit history is fairly short   even closed accounts affect the average age of accounts for fico scores but not for some other scoring methods such as vantagescore   if you have only one other account and it was 10 years old then opening and closing this decreases your average age of accounts from 10 to 5 years a significant hit which will not go away for years 10 + years in some cases though usually 7 years   this will lower your score some   if you have had a lot of accounts though including things like mortgage student loan etc this wo n't have as significant of an impact and if you had a short history in the first place it wo n't hurt you much either the third factor will be the hard credit pull   that will have a small negative impact for around six months so do n't do this just before getting a mortgage but mostly this wo n't be a significant for you

you seem to think that you are mostly paying interest in the first year because of the length of the loan period this is skipping a step   you are mostly paying interest in the first year because your principle the amount you owe is highest in the first year   you do pay down some principle in that first year this reduces the principle in the second year which in turn reduces the interest owed your payments stay the same so the amount you pay to principle goes up in that second year this continues year after year and eventually you owe almost no interest but are making the same payments so almost all of your payment goes to principle it is a bit like compounded interest but it is compounded principle reduction reducing your principle increases the rate you reduce it as you did n't reduce your principle until the 16th year this has zero impact on the interest you owed in the first 15 years now for actual explicit numbers   you owe 100,000 $ at 3 interest   you are paying your mortgage annually keeps it simpler and pay 5000 $ per year the first year you put 3000 $ against interest and 2000 $ against principle by year 30 you put 145 $ against interest and $ against principle   because your principle was tiny your interest was tiny

first your question contains a couple of false premises options in the u.s. do not trade on the nyse which is a stock exchange   you must have been looking at a listing from an options exchange there are a handful of options exchanges in the u.s. and while two of these have nyse in the name referring to nyse by itself still refers to the stock exchange companies typically do n't decide themselves whether options will trade for their stock   the exchange and other market participants market makers decide whether to create a market for them the toronto stock exchange tsx is also a stock exchange   it does n't list any options   if you want to see canadian listed options on equities you 're looking in the wrong place next yes does have listed options in canada here are some   did you know about the montreal exchange mx   the mx is part of the group which owns both the toronto stock exchange tsx and the montreal exchange you 'll find lots of canadian equity and index options trading at the mx   if you have an options trading account with a decent canadian broker you should have access to trade options at the mx finally even considering the existence of the mx you 'll still find that a lot of canadian companies do n't have any options listed   simply smaller and/or less liquid stocks do n't have enough demand for options so the options exchange market makers do n't offer any it is n't cost effective for them to create a market where there will be very few participants

no you ca n't deduct any of that what they 're talking about is a flexible spending plan otherwise known as use it or lose it money   you choose to put pre tax dollars into a restricted fund   this money is not taxed in fact technically it 's not even income   you can only spend out of that fund to buy parking tolls transit tickets things like that     any money not used for those purposes in a suitable time period evaporates    gone and   you ca n't even take the loss as a tax deduction you have to set this account up with your employer    you ca n't just dig up your old transit and parking receipts and stick those on your schedule a.    take 3 people    as you can see fran is shooting herself in the foot this is where these plans can go wrong

17.5 thousand miles year is pretty high mileage   you could find an accord or civic of comparable age with much lower mileage than that and it would n't be a stretch for someone even with your limited credit history to get a loan on an old car like that   you might try to have your parents cosign on a loan depending on their financial circumstances   that 's how i bought my first car 13 years ago the biggest surprise you might want to consider is the cost of full collision auto coverage which will be required by whatever bank you finance through   get quotes for that before signing any papers   i spent $ 2000 more on a motorcycle because the more powerful one cost $ 2000 less year to insure just a few years after i bought that first car   speaking of which another thing to consider given the nice la weather is a motorcycle   the total cost of ownership is much lower than a car   you will probably not want to pursue that option if you do not have medical insurance and you may not want to anyway

if you are to company 's financial reports and offerings the required source for companies to disclose the information is the website under the company disclosure tab   this includes annual statements for the last 5 years prospectus for any shares debentures buy back etc which is being offered ipo offers and shareholders meetings you may also find it useful to check the research section of the website where some of the public listed companies have voluntarily allowed independent research firms to monitor their company for a couple of years and produce a research report if you are referring to filings under the companies act these can be found at the accounting and regulatory authority website and you can also purchase of specific filings under the to understand the singapore public listing system and the steps to public listing you may find it useful to purchase one of the resource documents available for singapore law finance tax and corporate which are sold by specifically for public listing the singapore listing manual may help   it is common practice for companies here to employ law firms and research firms to do the majority of this research instead of doing it themselves which i one of the reasons this information is online but perhaps not so visible i hope i have understood your question correctly

your logic breaks down because you assume that you are the only market participant on your side of the book and that the participant on the other side of the book has entered a market order here 's what mostly happens large banks and brokerages trading with their own money we call it proprietary or prop trading will have a number of limit and other more exotic orders sitting on both sides of the trading book waiting to buy or sell at a price that they feel is advantageous some of these orders will have sat on the book for many months if not years these alone are likely to prevent your limit orders executing as they are older so will be hit first even if they are n't at a better price   on more liquid stocks there will also be a number of participants entering market orders on both sides of the book whose orders are matched up before limit orders are matched with any market orders this means that pairing of market orders at a better price will prevent your limit order executing in many markets high frequency traders looking for arbitrage opportunities for example will enter a few thousand orders a minute some of these will be limit orders just off touch others will be market orders to be immediately executed the likelihood that your limit order being as it is posited way off touch is hit with all those traders about is minimal on less liquid stocks there are market makers large institutional traders who effectively set the bid and offer prices by being willing to provide liquidity and fill the market orders at a temporary loss to themselves and will in most cases have limit orders set to provide this liquidity that will be close to touch they are paid to do this by the exchange and inter dealer brokers through their fees structure they will fill the market orders that would hit your limit if they think that it would provide more liquidity in such a way that it their obligations only if there are no other participants looking to trade on the instrument at a better price than your limit which of course they can see unless you enter it into a dark pool and there is a market order on the opposite side of the book will your limit order be instantaneously be hit executed and move the market price

and the weird shit is that it 's actually kind of good thing for the banks to do that   if there is lot 's of money around on people it means they can invest it on something that investment helps new businesses to emerge and employ more people   if there would be less money around the rich dudes would still invest but there could not be so much competition in investing so they could ask for higher interests    this would mean that the system is rewarding someone more not because he is taking bigger risks or because he is driving the economy into efficient direction but because there just happens to be shortage of money   does more money imply that more people will invest yes because of inflation they have to invest not to lose actually that 's why governments maintain inflation so that people are forced to invest

this is rob bennett the fellow who developed the valuation informed indexing strategy and the fellow who is discussed in the comment above the facts stated in that comment are accurate i went to a zero stock allocation in the summer of 1996 because of my belief in robert shiller 's research showing that valuations affect long term returns the conclusion stated that i have said that i do not myself follow the strategy is of course silly if i believe in it why would n't i follow it it 's true that this is a long term strategy that 's by design i see that as a benefit not a bad thing it 's certainly true that vii presumes that the efficient market theory is invalid if i thought that the market were efficient i would endorse buy and hold all of the conventional investing advice of recent decades follows logically from a belief in the efficient market theory the only problem i have with that advice is that shiller 's research the efficient market theory there is no one stock allocation that everyone following a vii strategy should adopt any more than there is any one stock allocation that everyone following a buy and hold strategy should adopt my personal circumstances have called for a zero stock allocation but i generally recommend that the typical middle class investor go with a 20 percent stock allocation even at times when stock prices are insanely high you have to make adjustments for your personal financial circumstances it is certainly fair to say that it is strange that stock prices have remained insanely high for so long what people are missing is that we have never before had claims that buy and hold strategies are supported by academic research those claims caused the biggest bull market in history and it will take some time for the widespread belief in such claims to diminish we are in the process of seeing that happen today   the good news is that once there is a consensus that buy and hold can never work we will likely have the greatest period of economic growth in u.s. history the power of academic research has been used to support buy and hold for decades now because of the widespread belief that the market is efficient turn that around and investors will possess a stronger belief in the need to practice long term market timing than they have ever possessed before in that sort of environment both bull markets and bear markets become logical emotional extremes in one direction emotional extremes in the other direction the stock market has been more emotional in the past 16 years than it has ever been in any earlier time this is evidenced by the wild p numbers that have applied for that entire time period now that we are seeing the losses that follow from investing in highly emotional ways we may see rational strategies becoming exceptionally popular for an exceptionally long period of time i certainly hope so the comment above that this will not work for individual stocks is correct this works only for those investing in indexes the academic research shows that there has never yet in 140 years of data been a time when valuation informed indexing has not provided far higher long term returns at greatly diminished risk but vii is not a strategy designed for stock pickers there is no reason to believe that it would work for stock pickers thanks much for giving this new investing strategy some thought and consideration and for inviting comments that help investors to understand both points of view about it rob

we played as kids when it was the most popular blog baseball the small and big kids dream game in the world way ahead of soccer and basketball was still a poor third we played it in the school yard using a tennis ball and became the highlight of every school boy ’s day   we knew and followed the basic rules of the game although we did not use or we played barefoot because we went to school barefoot we were children and we had the time of our life   the rules of baseball are not really that complicated almost anyone who can run swing a bat or throw a ball can join the fun later on we kids found out that there was such a thing as which was for girls but using a bigger ball that was thrown from the hip level instead of overhead   watching real baseball and games during athletic meets gave us a better understanding and appreciation of the game how we would have wanted to have all the uniform gears and field to play with but all we could afford was an old tennis ball and a homemade 2 in x 3 in lumber for a bat and bases made of stones or wood scraps   baseball as officially required has the following rules   1 basic features of the baseball game and field dimensions   baseball is played on a diamond shaped field with the base corner designated as the home base a player with a bat or a batter tries to hit the ball as far away from any of the opposing fielding team in order to reach all three bases and finally make it back to the home base if a player makes it to a base or two after he bats he must wait for his own team mates to hit the ball and give him the opening to move on around the bases   strategy and team play are important in maximizing the team ’s chance to score sometimes a team may sacrifice a batter just for a player to steal a base or score a run one point can spell the difference between winning and losing and such brilliant plays come in handy   2 team composition   each team has 9 players to fill up the following positions in the field when the opposing team is on the bat first base second base third base short stop right left and substitute players may also be included   3 regulations   the team on the bat is given three attempts to hit the ball thrown by a within the boundaries of the baseball field marked by the two lines made by the base first base and the home base third base a missed ball is called a strike and three strikes puts batter out of the field a team that gets three outs gets to field next while the other team bats   4 playing the ball   a flying ball that falls outside of the field boundaries is called a foul ball and gives a batter another chance to hit are unlimited a ball that is hit and falls inside the two lines is either caught in the air to put the batter out or if it rolls on the ground must be retrieved and often thrown to the first base player who will tag the batter with the ball to put him out failing to tag the batter who steps on or touches the base puts the batter safe on first base or wherever the batter may be as other move on around the diamond   a player who makes it safely back to home base scores a point if it is a meaning the ball is hit out of the filed or steals straight home if the defending team the ball two points are gained while a single point is given to a player who eventually goes round all the bases through one or more   5 other game features   when a team is struck out it take the field and lets the other team bat and attempt to score a foul ball which is caught will also count as an out multiple outs can be made such as when bases are loaded all three bases have and the batter on the plate hits a good ball and makes it to first base and the ball is retrieved and thrown back before the player running to second base reaches it then to home base before the player on third base scores a run and finally to third base to tag the player running to it three outs in one play   it is during such fast plays when the ball changes hands so rapidly and players are for bases that the excitement runs high it is cause for celebration for the scoring team and a big for the other who must probably feel like they were hit on the head with a bat several times for losing the big opportunity to score big and ending up with nothing   6 who wins   the team that makes the most runs after nine or rounds wins the game sometimes though the game will stop at the top of the 9th or before the other team is supposed to go to final bat if that team is already ahead in points as the lagging team will not be able to catch up anyway   some of the most memorable games end at the bottom of the when a team tries to catch up we might have heard of the familiar radio voice saying it ’s the bottom of the and bases are full and the new york are behind by four and has the bat the count is two strikes and three balls the winds up and throws the ball swings hard and the ball flies out of the stadium for a and a win or something to that effect   that imagined scene a dream every child and adult lover of baseball hopes to accomplish once in a lifetime you want to see and hear the whole stadium explode with people jumping and shouting as you take your sweet time running through the bases smiling waving your cap and finally kissing the home base   when a great player makes a good play everybody wins in baseball you have to be the eternal child to enjoy it and there are so many people out there who still enjoy it to this day

investment banks do n't have to buy anything if they do n't think the stock is worth buying they wo n't if they think it is others on the secondary market will probably think so too initial public offering is offering to the public i.e. theoretically anyone can participate and purchase stocks the major investment firms are not buying the stocks for themselves but for their clients who are participating in this ipo i for example receive email notifications from my brokerage firm each time there 's another ipo that they have access to and i can ask the brokerage to buy stocks from the ipo on my behalf when that happens they do n't buy the stocks themselves and then sell to me no what happens is that i buy a stock through them and they charge me a commission for the service usually ipo participation commissions are higher than regular trading commissions most of the time those who purchase stocks at ipo are institutional investors i.e. mutual funds pension plans investment banks for their managed accounts etc retail investors would probably not participate in the ipo because of the costs limited access not all the brokerage firms have access to all the ipos and the uncertainty and rather purchase the stocks later on a secondary market

the portfolio described in that post has a blend of small slices of vanguard sector funds such as vanguard pacific stock index   and the theory is that rebalancing across them will give you a good risk return tradeoff   caveat i have n't read the book only the post you link to similar etfs are available from vanguard ishares and state street   if you want to replicate the exactly pick from them   if you have questions about how to match specific funds in australia just ask another question   so i think you could match it fairly exactly if you wanted to however i think trying to exactly replicate the gone portfolio in australia would not be a good move for most people for a few reasons brokerage and management fees are generally higher in australia smaller market so dividing your investment across ten different securities and rebalancing is going to be somewhat more expensive if you have a middle class sized portfolio of somewhere in the tens of thousands to low millions of dollars you 're cutting it into fairly small slices to manually allocate 5 to various sectors   to keep brokerage costs low you probably want to buy each etf only once every one two years or so   you also need to keep track of the tax consequences of each of them if you are earning and spending australian dollars and looking at the portfolio in australian dollars a lot of those assets are going to move together as the australian dollar moves regardless of changes in the underlying assets   so there is effectively less diversification than you would have in the us the post does n't mention the 's approach to tax   i expect they do consider it but it 's not going to be directly applicable to australia if you are more interested in implementing the general approach of rather than the specific details what i would recommend is the vanguard and superannuation diversified funds have a very similar internal split to the with a mix of local first world and emerging market shares bonds and property trusts   this is pretty much fire and forget contribute every month and they will take care of rebalancing spreading across asset classes and tax calculations   by my calculations the cost is very similar the diversification is very similar and it 's much easier the only thing they do n't generally cover is a precious metals allocation and if you want that just put 5 of your money into the asx gold etf or something similar

i 've been taking all the cheap fixed rate debt banks would like to give me lately what rate in practice i find the only way i get a low enough rate on a term fixed rate loan is to use collateral that is auto loans and home loans i have n't seen any personal loans with a low enough fixed rate student loans may be cheap enough if they 're subsidized i guess here 's how i think of the rate if you look at the average annual return on 80 bonds 20 stocks is 6.7 with worst year that 's a nominal return not a real return if you subtract taxes say your marginal rate the rate you pay on your last dollar of income is 28 federal plus 5 state then if you have no tax deferral the 6.7 becomes about a 4.5 average with reasonably wide variation year by year you can mess with this e.g. using tax exempt bonds and tax efficient stock funds etc which would be wise but for deciding whether to take out debt getting too detailed is false precision the 6.7 number is only an average to begin with not a guarantee say you pay 4.5 on a loan and you keep your money in very conservative investments that 's probably at least going to break even if you give it some years it certainly can and sometimes will fail to break even over some time periods but the risk of outright catastrophe is low if your annual loss is 10 that sucks but it should not ruin your life in practice i got a home loan for close to 4.5 which is tax deductible so a lower effective rate and got an auto loan subsidized by the manufacturer for under 3 both are long term fixed rate loans with collateral so i was happy to borrow this money paying about a 3 effective rate in both cases well below my rough threshold of 4.5 i do not however run a credit card balance even though one of my cards is only 7 right now 7 is too high and it 's a floating rate that could rise the personal loans i 've seen have too high rates also thoughts overall i think using debt as a tool requires that you 're already financially stable such that the debt is n't creating a risky situation the debt should be used to increase liquidity and flexibility and perhaps boost investment returns a bit where you 're likely to get into trouble is using debt to increase your purchasing power especially if you use debt to buy things that are n't necessary for me the primary reason to use debt is flexibility and liquidity and the secondary bonus reason is a possible spread between the debt rate and investment returns

hopefully this $ 1000 is just a start and not the last investment you will ever make assuming that there are a couple of big questions to consider one what are you saving for are you thinking that this is for retirement 40 or 50 years from now or something much sooner like buying a car or a house you did n't say where you live in the u.s. if you put money into an ira or a 401k or some other account that the government classes as a retirement account you do n't pay taxes on the profits from the investment only on the original principal if you leave the money invested for a long period of time the profits can be many times the original investment so this makes a huge difference   like suppose that you pay 15 of your income in state and local taxes   and suppose you invest your $ 1000 in something that gives a 7 annual return and leave it there for 40 years of course i 'm just making up numbers for an example but i think these are in a plausible range and i 'm ignoring the difference between regular income tax and capital gains tax etc etc it does n't change the point if you put the money in a classic ira you pay 0 taxes the year you open the account so you have your full $ 1000 figure that compound interest for 40 years you 'll end up with crunch crunch crunch the numbers $ then you pay 15 when you take it leaving you with $ the end result with a roth ira is exactly the same feel free to crunch those numbers but now suppose you invest in a no retirement account so you have to pay taxes every year your original investment is only $ 850 because you have to pay tax on that and your effective return is only because you have to pay 15 of the 7 so after 40 years you have crunch crunch $ quite a difference but if you put money in a retirement account and then take it out before you retire you pay substantial penalties i think it 's 20 if you plan to take the money out after a year or two   that would really hurt two how much risk are you willing to take the reality of investment is that almost always the more risk you take the bigger the potential returns and vice versa investments that are very safe tend to have very low returns as you 're young if you 're saving for retirement you can probably afford a fairly high amount of risk if you lose a lot of money this year odds are you 'll get it back over the next few years or at least be able to put more money into investments to make up for it if you 're 64 and planning to retire next year you want to take very low risk investments in general investing in government bonds is very safe but has very low returns corporate bonds are less safe but offer higher returns stocks are a little more of course different companies have different levels of risk new start ups tend to be very risky but can give huge returns commodities are much higher risk buying on margin or selling short are ways to really leverage your money but you could end up losing more than you invested mutual funds are a relatively safe way to invest in stocks and bonds because they spread your risk over many companies three how much effort are you willing to put into managing your investments how much do you know about the stock market and the commodities market and international finance and so on and how much are you willing to learn if your answer is that you know a lot about these things or are willing to dive in and learn a lot that you can invest in individual stocks bonds commodities etc if your answer is that you really do n't know much about all this then it makes a lot of sense to just put your money into a mutual fund and let the people who manage the fund do all the work

it 's pretty simple the 10 is any savings for retirement   preferably it 's in a retirement account but that 's not mandatory it 's great that you save for a vacation computer house deposit etc but that 's not what these articles are referencing   edit in response to the running comments on 's answer the mortgage issue is worth further discussion i 'm saving toward a home purchase it may be $ 50 k saved but that 's not money for retirement the house savings never is i get the $ 200 k mortgage my balance sheet is net neutral less fees closing costs of course but my retirement savings again is unchanged i put $ 10 k toward principal the balance sheet again is $ 10 k better but retirement account unchanged last i pay off the mortgage retirement account unchanged but my retirement budget requirement is $ 1000/mo less the mortgage payment and my number drops by $ 300 k or so this is based on the 4 rule to withdraw $ 1000/mo requires $ 300 k in retirement assets it may seem pedantic but there 's an important distinction to be made here it 's easy to distinguish retirement savings from all other wise financial transactions paying debt off is wise but not retirement savings any actions that reduce your ongoing expenses clearly wise and it reduces the number needed to cover your retirement budget but it 's distinct from retirement savings for those that enjoy the intellectual exercise of insisting there 's always a grey area i 'll give it to you the family with 3 kids in the $ 1.2 m 5 bedroom house the parents know they will move into their paid off summer house upon retiring and sell this family house in his wisdom hubby has planned for the mortgage to be paid in full well ahead of retirement and for purposes of planning only view the house as worth $ the house does have a relationship to the retirement savings but the action of planning for alice 's retirement the maid they will no longer need once they move is not savings but rather an adjustment down in their retirement budget   i think you 'll find most conflicts regarding this issue resolved by understanding this distinction

i think your question might be coming from a misunderstanding of how corporate structures work specifically that a corporation is a legal entity sort of like a person that can have its own assets and debts to make it clear let 's look at your example we have two founders albert and brian and they start a corporation called corptech when they start the company it has no assets just like you would if you owned nothing and had no bank account in order to do anything corptech is going to need some money so albert and brian give it some they can give it as much as they want they can give it property if they want too usually people do n't just put money into a corporation without some sort of agreement in place though in most cases the agreement says something like each member will own a fraction of the company that is in proportion to this initial investment the way that is done varies depending on the type of corporation but in general if albert ends up owning 75 and brian ends up owning 25 then they probably valued their contributions at 75 and 25 of the total value these contributions do n't have to be money or property though they could just be general know how or connections or an expectation that they will do some work the important thing is that they agree on the value of these contributions and assign ownership of the company according to that agreement if they do n't have an agreement then the laws of the state that the company is registered in will say how the ownership is assigned now what ownership means can be different depending on the context when it comes to decision making you could own one percentage of the company in terms of votes but when it comes to shares of future profits you could own a different amount this is why you can have voting and non voting versions of a company 's stock for example so this is a critical point the ownership of a company is independent of the individual contributions to the company the next part of your question is related to this what happens when corptech sees an opportunity to make an investment if it has enough cash on hand because of the initial investment or through financing or reinvested profits then the decision to make the investment is made according to albert and brian 's ownership agreement and they spend it the money does n't belong to them individually anymore it belongs to corptech and so corptech is spending it they are just making the decision for corptech to spend it this is why people say the owners are not financially liable beyond their initial investment if the deal is bad and they lose the money the most they can lose is what they initially put in on the other hand if corptech does n't have the money then they have to figure out a way to get it they might decide to each put in an amount in proportion to their ownership so that their stake does n't change or albert might agree to finance the deal 100 in exchange for a larger share of ownership or he could agree to fund all of it without a larger stake because brian is the one who set the deal up or they might take out a loan and not need to invest any new money or they might find an investor who agrees to put in the needed money in exchange for a a 51 share in which case albert and brian will have to figure out how to split the remaining 49 if they agree to the deal the details of how all of this would work depend on the structure llc llp c corp s corp etc but in general the idea is that the company has assets and debts and the owners can have voting rights equity rights and rights to future profits in any type of split that they want regardless of what the companies assets and debts are or what their initial investment was

buying the right shares gives higher return buying the wrong ones gives worse return possibly negative the usual recommendation even if you have a pro advising you is to diversify most of your investments to reduce the risk even though that may reduce the possible gain a mutual fund is diversification in a can it requires little to no active maintenance yes you pay a management fee but you are n't paying per transaction fees every time you adjust your holdings and the management costs can be quite reasonable if you pick the right funds minimal in the case of computer managed index funds if you actively enjoy playing with stocks and bonds and are willing able to accept your failures and less than great choices as part of the game and if you can convince yourself that you will do better this way go for it for those of us who just want to deposit out money watch it grow and maybe rebalance once a year if that index funds are a perfectly good choice i spend at least 8 hours a day working for my money the rest of the time i want my money to work for me   risk and reward tend to be proportional to each other when they are n't market prices tend to move to correct that you need to decide how much risk you 're comfortable with and how much time and effort and money you 're willing to spend managing that risk personally i am perfectly happy with the better than market rate of return i 'm getting and i do n't have any conviction that i could do better if i was more involved your milage will vary if folks did n't disagree there would n't be a market

your question is expressed as a run on sentence which i 'm having trouble parsing maybe you could restate   i 'm just pointing out the stupidity of the statist that the debt is not a problem because we owe it to ourselves like to think we 're all in this together but that 's not reality some people are taking from others by force of law   the debt is owed to banks and they want to keep this system going would n't you like to have a legal monopoly on the supply of currency institutions which are funded by loose credit government academia military contractors crony corporations likewise benefit from this system   those who invest in us dollars and those who are from the central planning are the losers in this scheme    but there is more debt than currency so it ca n't ever be repaid so that is a moot point it ca n't even hypothetically be considered    there are however a number of other ways that this system could unwind when it inevitably does the banks could be left to fail and their assets would be bid on by others through the bankruptcy process or the fed could keep issuing currency to keep the banks solvent eventually inflating the whole system into irrelevance

in theory you can buy shares directly from someone else who owns them in practise if the stock is listed on an exchange they are unlikely to own them directly they are likely to own them through an intermediary you will have to pay fees to that intermediary to transfer the shares to your name there are thousands of small companies owned by the guy who started it and a few other investors you can buy stock in that kind of company directly from the existing owners as long as they are willing to sell you some it 's a super high risk investment strategy though this is the kind of deal that happens on dragons den

what you 're asking for is a short term large return investment when looking for big returns in a short period of time risk is inevitable the more risk you are willing to assume the higher your potential returns of course the flip is is that the higher your risk the higher the potential to lose all your money since this is an exercise for school and not real money and not your life savings your best bet is to go big or go home you can safely assume 100 risk do n't look for value stocks dividend stocks or anything that pays a steady return over a long period of time instead look for something risky that has the potential of going up up up in the next few months are you allowed to trade options in your fake portfolio options can have big risk and big reward potential penny stocks are super volatile too do some research look for a fad in other words you will most likely lose it all but you get a little lucky you could win this thing outright by making some risky investments a 5 chance of winning $ 3000 vs 95 of going broke may be pretty good odds if everyone else is value investing for just a few months you will need to get lucky go big or go home

the cause of the increase in 2006 2011 was the financial crisis where if you recall the global banking system came close to collapse for reasons that are well documented rightly or wrongly gold is seen as a safe haven asset in times of crisis the price of gold began to decline in 2011 when the markets decided that the risk of a global banking system collapse had passed without further incident in the period leading up to 2006 the price of gold was in a flat to down trend because there was little net buying interest in gold and large gold sales had been executed by various central banks around the world who felt that gold no longer had a place in central bank reserves    in modern economies gold is seen as a fringe asset   it has no role to play   the recent financial crisis may have that perception but those dents are now being forgotten and the price of gold is returning to its long term downward trend   when the next financial banking crisis is upon us the price of gold will again probably rally   the extent of the rally will depend on the extent of the crisis
