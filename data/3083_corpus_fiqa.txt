a bona fide company never needs your credit card details certainly not your on back of card to issue a refund   on an older charge they might have to work with their merchant provider   but they should be able to do it within the credit card handling system and in fact are required to   asking for details via email does n't pass the sniff test either   to get a credit card merchant account a company needs to go through a security assessment process called pci security gets into you pretty good   of course they could be using one of the dumbed down services like square but those services make refunds ridiculously easy    how did you come to be corresponding on this email address   did they initially contact you   did you find it on a third party website   some of those are fraudulent and many others like yelp it 's very easy to insert false contact information for a business consumer forums even moreso   you might take another swing at finding a proper contact for the company   stop asking for a cheque   that also the credit card system   and obviously a scammer wo n't send a check at least not one you 'd want   if all else fails call your bank and tell them you want to do a chargeback on that transaction   this is where the bank to reverse the charge   it 's rather straightforward especially if the merchant has agreed in principle to a refund but requires some paperwork or e paperwork    do n't chargeback lightly   do n't use it casually or out of laziness or unwillingness to speak with the merchant e.g. to cancel an order   the bank charges the merchant a $ 20 or larger investigation fee separate from the refund   each chargeback is also a strike too many strikes and the merchant is barred from taking credit cards it 's serious business    as a merchant i would never send a cheque to an angry customer   because if i did they 'd cash the cheque and still do a chargeback so then i 'd be out the money twice plus the investigation fee to boot

personally i would just dispute this one with your cc   i had a situation where a subscription i had cancelled the prior year was billed to me   i called up to have a refund issued they could n't find me in their system under three phone numbers and two addresses   the solution they proposed was send us your credit card statement with the charge to which i responded there 's no way in hell i 'm sending you my cc statement   then i disputed the charge with the cc bank and it was gone about two days later   i partially expect to have the same charge appear next year when they try to renew my non existent subscription again now whether or not this is a normal practice for the company or just a call center person making a good faith but insecure attempt to solve your problem is irrelevant   fact of the matter is you tried to resolve this with the merchant and the merchant asked for something that 's likely outside the bounds of your cc terms and conditions sending your entire number via email    dispute it and move on   the dispute process exists for a reason

if it is a well known company that wants to give you a refund i would not worry about giving them your credit card number   however i would never type my credit card number into an e mail message e mail messages are very insecure and can be read by many people along its way to the destination they also can be archived in many places meaning that your number will continue to be posted out there for someone to grab in the future   if you need to give this company your credit card number do it over the phone   having said that ultimately you are not generally responsible for fraudulent charges if your card number is stolen and misused i 've had so many fraudulent charges despite my being relatively careful with my number that i do n't really worry much anymore about losing my number i just check my statement for false charges and when they happen   the bank cancels the charge and issues me a new number it has happened to either my wife or i maybe 5 times over the last two years

while i agree with ben a lot i feel like his answer is really poor here you do not call a number to give your credit card information out for a refund   that is ridiculous   just from his answer he has had 5 cases of fraud lately you should know that you should n't follow this advice i personally do n't ever give my credit card number over the phone unless it is the very very very last resort   it is not just about money and safety but it is about time   every time that you give your number out over the phone there is a chance that the employee on the other end by either scam or legitimate business will use or sell your info   so you need to determine if the time saved by doing a transaction over the phone is worth hours days of your time if your card has a fraud issue   and note that fraud sometimes is easily negated but if done smartly can be hard to prove via a quick call or email to card company what should you do tell company that you will simply get the refund through your credit card company and if we go back to time element   you fill out form on card website   card company goes back to vendor and says why are you asking for card numbers via email   card company either cancels vendor contract or more likely helps them understand the technology available so they do n't have to do this   therefore that quick form that you filled out will now keep this company from bugging you again   by going through their archaic systems you are enabling their behavior

i used to work for a online payment posting company anytime a payment is made via credit card to a company that does not have pci the ability certification to store credit card information there is a the confirmation code not the credit card information that get sent to the company from the tree paypal etc the company should be able to send this information back to the processor in order to refund the payment   if the company is n't able to do this to be honest they should n't be taking online credit card payments and by all means do not send your credit card information in an email as said above call the company 's customer service line and give them the info to credit your account

definitely push for a check they may not do anything nefarious with your credit card number however someone else may be able to read the email before it gets to its final destination it 's never safe to give out credit card number in a less than secure interface also if this is a well known company then the person interacting with you should know better than to ask for your information through email

in older days the merchants and their merchant service providers would take funds in their currency say in this case usd when the charge hits the issuer bank the merchant and merchant bank gets there usd and were happy the user would get charged in local currency in this case the rate applied by his bank and card provider visa master also take a cut is the standard shelf rate to individuals    when business growing and banking becoming more sophisticated lots of merchant banks and merchants have created a new business if you offer to all users then you have lots of that you can convert into usd so in this model the merchant makes some more profit from fx spread the merchant bank makes good money in fx your bank and card network loose out you stand to gain because you potentially get a better rate all this theory is good but the rates are moving and its quite difficult to find out if the rates offered directly by ei ai would be better than those offered by your bank i have no experience in this example but i have tried this with large shops buy 2 items one charge in gbp and other in local currency around 2 3 times spread over a year the difference in rate was close to identical at times better or worse in range of .02

the value of an option has 2 components the extrinsic or time value element and the intrinsic value from the difference in the strike price and the underlying asset price with either an american or european option the intrinsic value of a call option can be locked in any time by selling the same amount of the underlying asset whether that be a stock a future etc   further the time value of any option can be by delta hedging the option i.e. buying or selling an amount of the underlying asset weighted by the measure of certainty delta of the option being in the money at expiry instead the extra value of the american option comes from the financial benefit of being able to realise the value of the underlying asset early for a dividend paying stock this will predominantly be the dividend but for non dividend paying stocks or futures the buyer of an in the money option can realise their intrinsic gains on the option early and earn interest on the profits today but what they sacrifice is the of the option   however when an option becomes very in the money and the delta approaches 1 or -1 the discounting of the intrinsic value i.e. the extra amount a future cash flow is worth each day as we draw closer to payment becomes larger than the theta or time value decay of the option then it becomes optimal to early exercise abandon the optionality and realise the monetary gains upfront for a non dividend paying stock the value of the american call option is actually the same as the european the spot price of the stock will be lower than the forward price at expiry discounted by the risk free rate or your cost of funding this will exactly offset the monetary gain by exercising early and banking the proceeds however for an option on a future the value today of the underlying asset the future is the same as at expiry and its possible to fully realise the interest earned on the money received today hence the american call option is worth more for both examples the american put option is worth more slightly more so for the stock as the stock 's spot price is lower than the forward price the owner of the put option a higher intrinsic profit from selling the stock at the higher strike price today than waiting till expiry as well as realising the interest earned liquidity may influence the perceived value of being able to exercise early but its not a tangible factor that is added to the commonly used maths of the option valuation and is n't really a consideration for most of the assets that have tradeable option markets it 's also important to remember at any point in the life of the option you do n't know the future price path you 're only modelling the distribution of probable outcomes what subsequently happens after you early exercise an american option no longer has any bearing on its value this is now zero whether the stock subsequently crashes in price is what is relevant is that when you early exercise a call you give up all potential upside protected by the limit to your downside from the strike price

they will pay that 's for sure it 's something common in many countries sometimes it is stolen money like said sometimes is money from mafia or terrorist groups that needs to be transferred so they use naive people whose profile would n't be suspicious if they get sums of money they will look your past transactions to determine the amount of money they could transfer to you without alerting someone why because lets say you are a criminal if you sell 10 kilos of cocaine some bombs or girls for and receive the money lets say one million dollars in just one deposit in one bank account someone will be knocking at your door very soon it will be easy to prove the illegal source of the and you get nothing if you have 25 guys working for you and they receive transfers and deposits of less amount frequently from let 's say 150 different accounts belonging to account holders with no criminal record it is harder to be noticed and you could say they are legal activities 15000 a month received from entrepreneurs or 2500 from a housewife is not too much it will be harder to prove that all the transactions come from illegal money and by the time it is proven usually the money has already gone somewhere else by using another network of mules like your friend 's i do n't know the laws where you are but this is illegal in many countries if you enter they wo n't let you out of the network and when something goes wrong you will need to explain a lot

i 'll use similar logic to dave ramsey to answer this question because this is a popular question when we 're talking about paying off any debt early   also consider this tweet and what it means for student loans to you they 're debt to the government they 're assets if you had no debt at all and enough financial assets to cover the cost would you borrow money at interest rate to obtain a degree   put it in the housing way if you paid off your home would you pull out an equity loan line for a purchase when you have enough money in savings   i ca n't answer the question for you or anyone else as you can probably find many people who will see benefits to either i can tell you two observations i 've made about this question it comes a lot with housing over time   first it tends to come up a lot when stocks are in a bubble to the point where people begin to consider borrowing from 0 interest rate credit cards to buy stocks or float bills for a while   how quickly people forget what it feels and looks like when you see your financial assets drop 50 60   it 's not wall street that 's greedy it 's most average investors   second people asking this question generally overlook the behavior behind the action as carnegie said concentration is the key to wealth and concentrating your financial energy on something instead of throwing it all over the place can simplify your life   this is one reason why lottery winners do n't keep their winnings their financial behavior was rotten before winning and simply getting a lot of money seldom changes behavior   even if you get paid a lot or little that 's irrelevant to success because success requires behavior and when you master the behavior everything else like money happiness peace of mind etc follows

i 'm expanding on what had added to his answer the assumption of same tax bracket in retirement is convenient but simplistic if you are in for instance the second lowest bracket now and happen to remain in the second lowest bracket for retirement then roth and traditional account options may seem equal and your math backs that up on the surface but that 's making an implicit assumption that tax rates will be constant yet tax brackets and rates can change and they do the proof i.e. your 15 bracket could become say the 17 bracket or perhaps the 13 bracket all the while you might remain in the second lowest bracket so given the potential for fluctuating tax rates it 's easy to see that there can be a case where a traditional tax deferred account can yield more after tax income than a roth post tax account even if you remain in the same bracket when your tax bracket 's tax rate declines so do n't just consider what bracket you expect to be in consider also whether you expect tax rates to go up down or remain the same for twenty something young folk retirement is a long way away ~40 years and i think in that time frame it is far more likely that the tax brackets wo n't have the same underlying tax rates that they have now of course we ca n't know for sure which direction tax rates will head in but an educated guess can help is your government deep in debt or flush with extra cash on the other hand if you do n't feel comfortable making predictions much better than simply assuming brackets and rates will stay the same as now so it does n't matter is to instead hedge your bets save some of your retirement money in a roth style account and some in a traditional pre tax account consider it tax diversification see also my answer at this older but related question

shares in a company represent a portion of a company if that company takes in money and does n't pay it out as a dividend e.g. apple the company is still more valuable because it has cold hard cash as an asset theoretically it 's all the same whether your share of the money is inside the company or outside the company the only immediate difference is tax treatment   of course for large bank accounts that means that an investment in the company is a mix of investment in the bank account and investment in the business value of the company which may investors who are n't particularly interested in buying amounts of bank accounts known for low returns and would prefer to receive their share of the cash to invest elsewhere or in the business portion of the company companies like apple have in fact taken criticism for this your company could also use that cash to invest in itself growing the value of its profits or buy other companies that are worth money essentially doing the job for you of course they can do the job well or they can do it poorly a company could also be acquired by a larger company or taken private in exchange for cash or the stock of another company this is another way that the company 's value could be returned to its shareholders

with every caveat that rick said plus many many more lets have some fun   one common way to measure risk is volatility of returns roughly how much the value of your asset jumps around   interestingly the following ordering is fairly similar for many other common measures of risk the first three on the list would be mostly interchangeable   generally putting your money in cash investments has no real day to day price variability and the main risk is that the bank wo n't give you your money back at the end   money market funds are last as they can break the buck to get a feel for the next few on the list i 'm using previous 360 day volatility numbers for representative broad indices 2014 10 27   while these volatility values can move around quite a bit the order is actually remarkably stable hedge funds might seem out of place here but remember that hedge funds can hold be long and short at the same time and this can cancel out daily variation   however hedge funds do have plenty of risks that may not be well accounted for by this measure    for derivatives i 'll refer to back to rick 's answer this is a measure for broad investment in these categories your particular investment in long term capital management or bonds may vary it is important to note that your return on your investment generally grows as you go toward more risky investments down this list as people generally expect to be rewarded   in the long term for risky investments

i would go to the bank and just express the concern that the check sent to you might not fully clear you do n't want to spend it until you 're sure it cleared i 'd ask for a manager to tell you when it will clear then confirm after that date that it 's cleared with the same guy   perhaps someone in the industry can explain how long the bank has before deciding the check is bad 10 days 2 weeks really it should either clear or bounce by the second night   i 'd not risk doing this for anyone anyone i know personally can cash their own check and i 'd not get involved with anyone i do n't know on a financial matter like this edit see littleadv comment below good checks clear fast a forged check has time for the victim to go to the bank and challenge the signature and cashing of the check the victim can have 60 days to do this that 's the issue i am wrong the bank manager could n't confirm the check was good so soon

like almost all investing question it depends boring companies generally appreciate slowly and as you note pay dividends more speculative investing can get you some capital gains but also are more likely to tank and have you lose your original investment the longer your time horizon and the more risk you are willing to take then it is reasonable to tilt towards but not exclusively invest in more speculative stocks a shorter horizon or if you have trouble sleeping at night if you lose money or are looking for an income stream would then tend towards the boring side good luck

i ca n't find the underlying legislation but a few online resources suggest that if you contact a lender about a payment plan they should put repayments on hold temporarily we do n’t think it ’s fair if your lender does n’t help you    get on top of things if you ask for help or breathing space to sort    things out if you 've had problems repaying the loan you can complain if your payday lender did not offer to freeze interest and charges if you are able to make payments under a reasonable repayment plan by law they must suspend recovery of the debt for a reasonable period if you ’re developing a repayment plan with a debt adviser or on your own i 'd start by making an immediate complaint to the lender make them aware that you 're unable to meet basic living expenses because of the money they took and ask for them to suspend collection temporarily and for the money to be returned i would also dispute the charge with your bank on the grounds that it should not have been taken given the circumstances and ask for them to credit your account while they investigate the dispute they may not be too keen given it 'll leave you overdrawn if they later reject the dispute but it 's worth asking in parallel with that contact citizens advice and/or the financial ombudsman details in the links and see if there 's anything they can do or suggest

is a latin phrase that simply means irregular deposit it 's a concept from ancient roman contract law that has a very narrow scope and does n't actually apply to your example there are two distinct parts to this concept one dealing with the notion of a deposit and the other with the notion of i 'll address them both in turn since they 're both relevant to the tax issue i also think that this is an example of the problem since your proposed solution give my money to a friend for safekeeping is n't the right solution to your actual problem how can i keep my money safe the currency issue is a complication but it does n't change the fact that what you 're proposing probably is n't a good solution the key word in my definition of is contract you do n't mention a legally binding contract between you and your friend an oral contract does n't qualify because in the event of a breach it 's difficult to enforce the agreement legally there is n't any proof of an oral agreement and emotionally taking your friend to court might cost you your friendship i 'm not a lawyer but i would guess that the absence of a contract implies that even though in the eyes of you and your friend you 're giving him the money for safekeeping in the eyes of the law you 're simply giving it to him in the us you would owe gift taxes on these funds if they 're higher than a certain amount in other words this is n't really a deposit it 's not like a security deposit in which the money may be held as collateral in exchange for a service e.g. not trashing your apartment or a financial deposit where the money is held in a regulated financial institution like a bank this is n't a solution to the problem of keeping your money safe because the lack of a contract means you incur additional risk in the form of legal risk that is n't present in the context of actual deposits also if you do n't have an account in the right currency but your friend does how are you planning for him to store the money anyway if you convert your money into his currency you take on exchange rate risk unless you hedge which is another complication if you do n't convert it and simply leave it in his safe house car boot etc you 're still taking on risk because the funds are n't insured in the event of loss   furthermore the money is n't necessarily safe with your friend even if you ignore all the risks above without a written contract you have little recourse if a your friend decides to spend the money and not return it b your friend runs into financial trouble and creditors make claim to his assets or c you get into financial trouble and creditors make claims to your assets the idea of giving money to another individual for safekeeping during bankruptcy has been tested in us courts and ruled invalid if you do decide to go ahead with a contract and you do want your money back from your friend eventually you 're in essence loaning him money and this is a different situation with its own complications look at this question and this question before loaning money to a friend although this does apply to your situation it 's mostly irrelevant because the irregular part of the concept of irregular deposit is a standard feature of currencies and other legal tender it 's part of the of modern currencies and does n't have anything to do with taxes if you 're only giving your friend physical currency if you 're giving him property other assets etc for safekeeping it 's a different issue entirely but it 's still probably going to be considered a gift or a loan you 're basically correct about what means but i think you 're overestimating its reach in modern law in roman times it simply refers to a contract in which two parties made an agreement for the depositor to deposit money or goods with the and withdraw equivalent money or goods sometime in the future although this is a feature of the modern deposit banking system it 's one small part alongside contract law deposit insurance etc these other parts add complexity but they also add security and risk mitigation your arrangement with your friend is much simpler but also much riskier   and yes there probably are taxes on what you 're proposing because you 're basically giving or loaning the money to your friend even if you say it 's not a loan or a gift the law may still see it that way the absence of a contract makes this especially important because you do n't have anything speaking in your favor in the event of a legal dispute besides what you meant the money to be furthermore the money is n't necessarily safe with your friend and the absence of a contract exacerbates this issue if you want to keep your money safe keep it in an account that 's covered by deposit insurance if you do n't have an account in that currency either a talk to a lawyer who specializes in situation like this and work out a contract or b open an account with that currency as i 've stated i 'm not a lawyer so none of the above should be interpreted as legal advice that being said i 'll reiterate again that the concept of is a concept from ancient roman law trying to apply it within a modern legal system without a contract is a potential recipe for disaster if you need a legal solution to this problem not that you do i think what you 're looking for is a bank talk to a lawyer who understands modern law since ancient roman law is n't applicable to and wo n't pass muster in a modern day court

it sounds like gross receipt tax is essentially the same thing most states call sales tax which is always handled this way prices displayed are pre tax tax is added when the final price is calculated   one reason for doing it that way is that most prices result in taxes that involve fractions of pennies and calculating from the total produces a more accurate result than calculating tax on each item individually it is theoretically possible to set prices so the numbers come out evenly when tax is added but that requires that the prices be in fractional cents   potentially to many decimal places and in fact in some places it is illegal to display only the with tax price otherwise i 'm sure some stores and restaurants would be willing to deal with the mils and purely on principle or as a marketing gimmick since customers have learned to expect sales tax it really is n't worth the effort to fight it the closest i 've seen has been occasional we 'll pay your sales tax offers or statewide sales tax holidays once a year

from your explanation the sole trader option is more appropriate and certainly easier to manage   there are many differences but the pertinent and most important ones are as follows the main difference in your case would be tax and administration   as a sole trader you would need to do a tax return once a year and if you earned less than £ you would n't have to pay any uk tax assuming you have no other income and are a standard tax payer   the current tax allowance is £ although this can change submitting your own tax return is relatively although you may want to consult an accountant   it is generally easier to run as sole trader versus a limited company ie less paperwork and if you go down the limited company route the company would be liable to pay corporation tax on any profits and this process is more complicated and you would probably need an accountant to do that for you which is likely to cost a few hundred pounds every year   you can do it yourself but the process is not as simple as doing your own income tax return also as a sole trader you can do what you like with any income you can spend it and treat it as your own wages   you ca n't do that if you set up a limited company as the income is owned by the company and so you would need to in effect pay yourself a wage from the company   in other words it 's more complex than if you are a sole trader the main advantage to a limited company is that it is easier to sell the business if you want to at a later date   there is nothing stopping you setting up a limited company later on after a sole trader if you want to   they can also be more tax efficient but this would not be relevant to your case if you are earning relatively small sums if your income increases then you may want to reconsider you can see more information here   i have been both a sole trader and also set up my own limited company

buying pressure means there are more interested buyers than there are ready sellers putting upward pressure on prices that might include institutional buyers who are slowly executing buy orders because they still want the best prices possible without clearing out the market buying pressure does n't have to be related to volume at all if everyone who owns shares think they are going to be worth far more than recent market prices they will not offer them for sale that means there is more demand to buy than there is a supply of shares to be bought that condition can exist regardless of trading volume

another reason to think it 's a scam fake paypal email notifications are a thing   i 've seen one that was quite convincing but it was n't mine to properly analyse or report so the payment may be a fake from another account belonging to the scammer and you 've just transferred money to the scammer the fake email can include links to log in to a fake paypal website which can be quite convincing as the mark will give the login details which can be used to scrape data   links not going to where they say is the giveaway here

the proper answer is that you run the numbers and see whether what you 'll save in interest exceeds the closing costs by enough to be interesting   most lenders these days have calculations that can help with this on their websites and/or would be glad to help if asked rule of thumb if you can reduce interest rate by 1 or more it 's worth investing

it 's worth noting that there have been several studies with differing results for minimum wage in general and now specifically for seattle it 's unwise to take any single one as the study best to look at them all in context   i think the broad consensus is that there 's an elasticity of somewhere between and   so a minimum wage increase of 10 will lead to a decrease in employment of somewhere between 0.5 and 2     it just comes down to how you value the tradeoff between higher wages for the working and fewer hours worked and where you place that elasticity   i think there 'd be pretty broad support if you could double the minimum wage and only see a 5 decline in hours worked

actually there is no law that makes insider trading illegal except for actual company insiders people working at the company insider trading as you describe is just a court precedent set in the 80s i think it was the 80s and it 's based on the concept of fraud whereby you are information that you should not have   so no insider trading is n't illegal in that sense and the jury is out as to whether it 's even bad or not for the markets that does n't mean i would recommend doing it or really anything even closely resembling it since they 're pretty aggressive about pursuing those cases

this is because volatility is cumulative and with less time there is less cumulative volatility the time value and option value are tied to the value of the underlying   the value of the underlying stock is quite influenced by volatility the possible price movement in a given span of time   thirty days of volatility has a much broader spread of values than two days since each day benefits from the possible price change of the prior days   so if a stock could move up to + 1 in a day then compounded after 5 days it could be + 5 + 0 or -5   in other words this is compounded volatility less time means far less volatility which is geometric and not linear   less volatility lowers the value of the underlying   see black scholes for more technical discussion of this concept a shorter timeframe until option expiration means there are fewer days of compounded volatility   so the expected change in the underlying will decrease geometrically   the odds are good that the price at days will be close to the price at much more so than the prices at or additionally the time value of an american option is the implicit put value or implicit call   while an american option lets you exercise prior to expiry unlike a european option exercised only at expiry there 's an implicit put option in a call or an implicit call in a put option   if you have an american call option of 60 days and it goes into the money at 30 days you could exercise early   by contract that stock is yours if you pay for it or in a put you can sell whenever you decide in some cases this may make sense if you want an immediate payoff or you expect this is the best price situation but you may prefer to watch the price   if the price moves further your gain when you use the call may be even better   if the price goes back out of the money then you benefited from an implicit put   it 's as though you exercised the option when it went in the money then sold the stock and got back your cash when the stock went out of the money even though no actual transaction took place and this is all just implicit so the time value of an american option includes the implicit option to not use it early   the value of the implicit option also decreases in a nonlinear fashion since the value of the implicit option is subject to the same valuation principles but the larger principle for both is the compounded volatility which drops geometrically

find a mechanic in the area that will for a fee do a pre approval inspection   then when you call the seller to inquire you can ask them to let you take the vehicle there as part of your test drive i 'm not sure how many rv mechanics there are that do n't work for a dealership and those that do may be less inclined to assist you in purchasing from a private party   you could also have a friend or family member who is a mechanic or good with vehicles come along   also the seller may not want to bother with the extra hassle and if it really is a good deal they likely wo n't need to    of course the other option is to just test drive it and trust your gut   this does n't sound like a huge risk at   even if it breaks down right away and ca n't be repaired for a reasonable price you could scrap the vehicle and hopefully make up a significant portion of the purchase price

a lot of this example is idealistic and the analysis stops right at the point the loan is issued     if you use generous interest rates you could just skirt by the bare minimum debt service coverage ratio for an asset backed loan if you found a lender to approve it   however he does n't address any of the issues of running a business that will be insolvent if expenses rise more than about ~2 above the monthly average in a given month those pesky period months equipment repairs heating cooling in winter summer etc or you have a similarly small in sales selling in january     most companies doing lbos have skin in it and a plan to make the company more valuable not run it exactly the way it is this allows them to either acquire more debt capital than just a percentage of the collateral and so they can finance capital projects to improve the business deal with fluctuations in cash flow and/or implement plans to increase the free cash flows above how it was running previously   this site 's advice is a bit like teaching someone the basics of how to take off in an airplane and then telling them they 're ready to fly

yes you must file north carolina and south carolina income tax if you live in one state and work in another the income is potentially taxed twice most states give a credit for taxes paid to the other state often you pay the tax in the state where you worked and then if the tax rate in the state where you live is higher you pay the difference but the details depend on the tax laws of the two states involved i 'm not an expert on either carolina 's tax laws start by getting the forms and instructions from both states and see what they say or if you 're using tax software see if it handles this case if someone else on here knows the specifics of the tax laws for the i gladly yield many states establish reciprocity agreements with other states usually the neighboring states that generally say that if the state you live in and the state you work in are both party to the agreement then you only pay tax in the state you live in this simplifies things a lot unfortunately neither north carolina nor south carolina have such agreements with each other or with any other state

i 'm no accountant but i think the way i 'd want to approach this kind of thing in gnucash would be to track it as an asset since it is it sounds like your actual concern is that your tracked asset value is n't reflecting its current market value presumably because it 's risky it 's also illiquid so you 're not sure how much value it should have on your books your approach suggested here of having it as just as expense gives it a 0 value as an asset but without tracking that there 's something that you own the two main approaches to tracking an investment in gnucash are of course both of these approaches do assume that you have some notion of your investment 's current value which is what you 're tracking as the section on estimating valuation of the concepts guide says of valuing illiquid assets there is no hard rule on this and in fact different accountants may prefer to do this differently if you really think that the investment is n't worth anything at the moment then i suppose you should track it at 0 but presumably you think it 's worth something or you would n't have bought it right even if it 's just for your personal records part of a regular maybe annual review of your investments should include coming up with what you currently value that investment at perhaps your best guess of what you could sell it for assuming that you could find a willing buyer and updating your records accordingly of course if you need a valuation for a bank or for tax purposes or the like they have more specific rules about how they are tracking what things are worth but presumably you 're trying to track your personal assets for your own reasons to get a handle on what you currently own so do that take the time to get a handle on the worth of what you currently own and do n't worry about getting the value wrong just take your best guess since you can always update it later when you learn new information about what your investment is worth

the dividends on cd 's typically get put back on the balance of the cd depending on the   that money then becomes available to withdraw if you so decide but if you leave it in the account you will earn more interest   the interest is compounded off the total balance which any dividends that have been added in the cd   you essentially only get paid out once typically on a cd which is the time of maturity   after that you have 10 days to either roll this into a new cd and cash it out   the dividends typically get paid out or put back on the cd quarterly but it depends on the institution as well    try going to the following website to find out how much you will make   you will need to ask your institution if they pay out monthly or quarterly first   put in the beginning balance how often it 's paid out the interest and months and it will tell you your ending balance my suggestion   stay away from cd 's at this time the interest rates are too low to bother with

as says cfds are a derivative of the underlying stock in this case if you are from the usa then they are prohibited in the usa as has also been mentioned they are not prohibited however in many other countries including australia   we can buy or short sell on a limited number of securities cfds on australian securities usa securities and securities from many other countries on fx and different commodities the reason you are paying much less than the stock price is worth is because you are buying on margin when you go long you pay interest on overnight positions and when you go short you recieve interest on overnight positions that is if you hold the position open overnight most cfds are over the counter however in australia do n't know about other countries we also have exchange traded cfds called asx cfds i have tried both asx cfds and over the counter cfds and prefer the over the counter cfds because the broker provides a market which closely but not exactly follows the underlying prices the exchange traded cfds there was low liquidity due to being quite new so there was the potential to be gapped quite considerably this might improve as the market grows all in all once you understand how they work and what is involved in trading them they are much easier than options or however if you are going to trade anything first get yourself educated have a trading plan and risk management strategy and paper trade before putting real money on the table and remember if you are in the usa you are actually prohibited from trading cfds regarding the price of aapl at $ 50 the price should be the same as that of the underlying stock it is just that your initial outlay will be less than buying the stock directly because you are buying on margin your initial outlay may be as little as 5 or lower depending on the underlying stock

this page from the cra website details the types of investments you can hold in a tfsa you can hold individual shares including etfs traded on any designated stock exchange in addition to the other types of investment you have listed   here is a list of designated stock exchanges provided by the department of finance   as you can see it includes pretty well every major stock exchange in the developed world if your bank 's tfsa only offers mutual funds gics and saving deposits then you need to open a tfsa with a different bank or a stock company with an execution only service that offers tfsa accounts   almost all of the big banks will do this   i use hsbc invest direct and td though my tfsa 's are all with hsbc currently   you will simply provide them with details of your bank account in order to facilitate money transfers tfsa contributions since purchasing foreign shares involves changing your canadian dollars into a foreign currency one thing to watch out for when purchasing foreign shares is the potential for high foreign exchange spreads   they can be excessive in proportion to the investment being made   my experience is that hsbc offers by far the best spreads on fx but you need to exchange a minimum of $ 10,000 in order to obtain a decent spread typically between 0.25 and 0.5   you may also wish to note that you can buy unhedged etfs for the us and european markets on the toronto exchange   this means you are paying next to nothing on the spread though you obviously are still carrying the currency risk   for example an unhedged s&p500 trades under the code bmo unhedged or ishares unhedged in addition it is important to consider that commissions for trades on foreign markets may be much higher than those on a canadian exchange   this is not always the case   hsbc charge me a flat rate of $ for both toronto and new york trades but for london they would charge up to 0.5 depending on the size of the trade   some foreign exchanges carry additional trading costs   for example london has a 0.5 stamp duty on purchases edit one final thing worth mentioning is that in my experience   holding us securities means that you will be required to register with the us tax authorities and with those us exchanges upon which you are trading   this just means fill out a number of different forms which will be provided by your stock broker exchange registrations can be done electronically however us tax authority registration must be submitted in writing   dividends you receive will be net of us withholding taxes   i am not aware of any capital gains reporting requirements to us authorities

lenders may sell your mortgage to other lenders for a fee   for example   your lender might sell your mortgage to the highest bidder who may want to purchase your mortgage by making a one time payment   for your lender that 's a quick profit for the new owner of your mortgage that 's long term returns for a one time fee   for your lender that is forgoing long term returns for short term gains and transfer of risk in case you default    very similar to how bonds work in a stock exchange what does this mean to you nothing   you will still keep making payments to your original lender    what does transfer of ownership has not been publicly recorded mean it means when you are asked about ownership details regarding your mortgage and this could be in tax forms or refinancing etc you would enter your original lender 's information and not mac 's pro tip there are lots of scams based on this   you might receive an official looking letter in mail claiming your loan has been sold and you should start making payments to the new owner do not fall for this call your original lender use the phone number from your loan papers not mail you received and verify this information    and if this were to happen your original lender would always inform you first    and hey congrats on your new home

true blue preferred shares are considered loose hybrids of credit and equity   they are more senior than common equity in bankruptcy liquidation but pay out a dividend which is not mandatory financial institutions issue the bulk of genuine preferred shares because of their need for more flexibility than a bond but not so much that they can afford the cost to shareholders by diluting common equity since it is a credit like security that receives none of the income from operations but merely pays out a potentially unpredictable yet fixed amount of income it will perform much more like a bond rising when interest rates fall and vice versa and since interest rates do not move to the extent of common equity valuations price variances will correspond much more to bonds than common equities   if the company stops paying the preferred dividend or looks to become in financial trouble the price of the preferred share should be expected to fall there are more modern preferred however   it has now become popular to fund intermediate startups with convertible preferred shares   because these are derivatives based upon the common equity they can be expected to be much more variant

yes you can do that and it it wise to do so however you should make sure that the general trend of the stock is upwards and you buy during a in the uptrend so basically if the stock is making higher highs and higher lows on the daily or weekly charts then you would want to buy around one of the higher lows before the ex dividend date if the stock is making lower lows and lower highs then it is in a downtrend so never buy in this instance it is better to miss out on a dividend of $ 1 rather than to buy just for this $ 1 dividend and lose $ 5 or more when the price continues to drop further

your account entries are generally correct but do note that the last transaction is a mixture of the balance sheet and income statement   if quickbooks does n't do this automatically then the expense must be manually removed from the balance sheet the expense should be recognized on the balance sheet and income statement when it accrues and it accrues when the prepaid rent is extinguished when consumed by the landlord so that is when the second entry in your question should be booked the cash flow statement will reflect all of these cash transactions immediately

the only reason taxes are needed is because the people are to ignorant to know there are better more moral systems out there for instance instead of stealing hard earned money from people tax the money they spend ie federal sales tax how is that any different because a sales tax is n't theft it just raises the price of products you want to buy this way there is no tax dodging and no imprisonment for keeping what you earned and what is rightfully yours

i agree with the answer by that this number does n't exist   it 's hard to see what use it would have and it would be difficult to track i 'm writing a separate answer because i also disagree with the premise of your question   individual shares of stock have never to my knowledge had such a number   your comment about numbers on stock certificates identifies the certificate document which will generally represent multiple shares of stock   that number no more identifies a single share of stock than the serial number on a $ 10 bill identifies any one of the ten dollars it represents   even at the collective unit of $ 10 when the bill is eventually replaced with a new one the new bill has a new number   no continuity

meanwhile lets look at the people of india   while this is broadly speaking you can divide the population along the spectrum of wealth income into two groups those who have a middle class lifestyle or better and those who do not   among those who have made it a strange trend emerges a western like 2.3 children per couple rate emerges those impoverished millions maintain their rapid rate of reproduction   this minimum income solution does not include the nasty problems where girls are hidden away until they turn 18 just to emerge without any education still their parents china has a nasty problem of post birth for girls as well and now their entire country is on the verge of social collapse as reproductive rates have fallen from the sexual imbalance much less from the inevitable population decline   but unless we create a global government it becomes up to each country to implement a minimum income on their own terms or it could be enforced via trade negotiations

are you planning to not pay taxes any time someone has income in the u.s. it is subject to u.s. taxes you must file tax returns and pay taxes if necessary if you have income above a certain threshold regardless of whether you 're not authorized to work or not if you plan to intentionally not pay taxes then that 's a whole other matter from working without authorization working without authorization is an immigration issue it probably violates the conditions of your status which will make you to automatically lose your status that may or may not affect when you want to want to visit to or get other immigration benefits in the u.s. in the future and at worst you may be deported it 's a complicated topic but not really relevant for this site

ramsey promotes growth mutual funds and says he can screen out examples of good funds with a solid history of 10 returns in a couple of minutes on morningstar   the 12 in the video is fairly unrealistic but 10 or 8 are realistic especially when you buy into the market every month at all levels rather than chasing winners buying high at 10 you will still get $ 3 million in 40 years and at 8 you 'll get $ 1.5 million you need to make sure you include reinvestment of dividends as well as mere price appreciation in these calculations of returns on investment so yes you could probably drive really nice cars this way without breaking the bank like any financial endeavor this requires hard work patience and discipline the actual work in this case would be fairly minimal in comparison to the patience and discipline if you get really lucky you might end up with millions of dollars 40 years from now if a health disaster job loss children 's college etc strikes then you it might save you from financial ruin both are better than the rat race i agree his predictions are too rosy but this ad is an emotional sales pitch designed to change goals and behavior compare it to the psychology and unrealistic claims in some of the auto commercials you see on tv

timing the market and by extension the efficient market hypothesis is one of the most hotly debated subjects in finance academia if you are to believe the majority of finance professors and phd 's out there chances of timing a market like the nyse nasdaq or lse is not possible if you are to take into account the huge amount of hedge funds and money managers who make it their job to prove the efficient market hypothesis wrong then you may have a chance my opinion is that the emh is true and that timing a highly efficient market like the nyse is very difficult or impossible even for those who spend their whole lives trying to beat it for someone whose primary job is n’t in investments i would put the idea of timing the markets out of your head

i think what you really want to look into is put options you can essentially replicate the same thing without worrying about margin calls check out this site a quick glance seems to show it to be pretty good   the way you would limit downside risk is to buy a put option allowing you to sell anytime within the next n months for the current price assuming american this will allow you to limit downside risk however potential profits do go down due to fees as another answer suggests this could be cost prohibitive this type of strategy is also known as a protective put if you wanted to be more refined you could use 's bands although you have to be looking for that specific outcome also due to complexity this can become a taxing in terms of time invested and risky if you are wrong investment either way i think you need to study payoff curves a little more

to speak to this a little more broadly apart from groups like hedge funds and other investors investing for purely speculative purposes one of the major purposes of forwards and for that matter futures for companies in the real economy is to lock in a particular price in advance or to reduce the risk of some kind of investment or transaction investopedia defines a currency forward as follows with a few key points emphasized a currency forward is a binding contract in the foreign exchange market that locks in the exchange rate for the purchase or sale of a currency on a future date a currency forward is essentially a hedging tool that does not involve any upfront payment the other major benefit of a currency forward is that it can be tailored to a particular amount and delivery period unlike standardized currency futures this can be a major advantage for planning and risk management purposes for example if i know i 'm going to have to pay $ 1 million usd in the future and most of my revenue is in euros the actual amount i 'll have to pay will vary based on the exchange rate between euros and dollars thus it 's very worthwhile for me to be able to lock in a particular exchange rate so that i know exactly how much i 'm going to pay relative to my projected revenue the goal is n't necessarily to make money off the transaction maybe they do maybe they do n't as much as to reduce risk and improve planning ability the fact that it does n't involve an up front payment is also a major advantage it 's usually a bad practice to sit on cash for a year if you can avoid it another key point savings accounts pay less interest than inflation if inflation is 3 and your savings account pays 1 that looks remarkably like a guaranteed 2 loss to me

this is an excellent question one that i 've before as well here 's how i 've reconciled it in my mind why should we agree that a stock is worth anything after all if i purchase a share of said company i own some small percentage of all of its assets like land capital equipment accounts receivable cash and securities holdings etc as others have pointed out notionally that seems like it should be worth something   however that does n't give me the right to lay claim to them at will as i 'm just a very small minority shareholder the old adage says that something is only worth what someone is willing to pay you for it that share of stock does n't actually give me any liquid control over the company 's assets so why should someone else be willing to pay me something for it as you noted one reason why a stock might be attractive to someone else is as a potentially tax advantaged revenue stream via dividends especially in this low interest rate environment this might well exceed that which i might obtain in the bond market the payment of income to the investor is one way that a   stock might have some inherent value that is attractive to investors as you asked though what if the stock does n't pay dividends as a small shareholder what 's in it for me without any dividend payments there 's no regular method of receiving my invested capital back so why should i or anyone else be willing to purchase the stock to begin with i can think of a couple reasons expectation of a future dividend you may believe that at some point in the future the company will begin to pay a dividend to investors dividends are paid as a percentage of a company 's total profits so it may make sense to purchase the stock now while there is no dividend banking on growth during the no dividend period that will result in even higher capital returns later this kind of your question a non dividend paying stock might be worth something because it might turn into a dividend paying stock in the future expectation of a future acquisition this addresses the original premise of my argument above if i ca n't as a small shareholder directly access the assets of the company why should i attribute any value to that small piece of ownership because some other entity might be willing to pay me for it in the future in the event of an acquisition i will receive either cash or another company 's shares in compensation which often results in a capital gain for me as a shareholder   if i obtain a capital gain via cash as part of the deal then this proves my point the original non dividend paying stock was worth something because some other entity decided to acquire the company paying me more cash than i paid for my shares they are willing to pay this price for the company because they can then reap its profits in the future if i obtain a capital gain via stock in as part of the deal then the process in some sense maybe the new stock pays dividends otherwise perhaps the new company will do something to make its stock worth more in the future based on the same future expectations the fact that ownership in a stock can hold such positive future expectations makes them worth something at any given time if you purchase a stock and then want to sell it later someone else is willing to purchase it from you so they can obtain the right to experience a positive capital return in the future while stock valuation schemes will vary both dividends and acquisition prices are related to a company 's profits this provides a connection between a company 's profitability expectations of future growth and its stock price today whether it currently pays dividends or not

there are two components of option valuation the value that 's in the money and the time value in the case of the $ put that option was already in the money and it will move less than the stock price by a bit as there will still be some time value there $ is intrinsic value the right word for in the money and the rest is time the $ 365 strike is still out of the money but as implied the chance of it going through that strike is better as it 's $ closer   looking at the options chain gives you a better perspective on this if apple went up $ 20 monday and down $ 20 tuesday these prices would be higher as implied volatility would also go higher   now i 'd hardly call a drop of under 2 tanking but on the i 'd not call the 25 jump in the option price skyrocketing options do this all the time curious what prompted the question are you interested in trading options this stock in particular

you have not answered the question of total market and total amount that works out poorly for municipalities you keep listing examples where it went badly and have not compared that to the total size and those that went well without that ratio one can not make a reasonable informed decision the total municipal bond market has about $ 3.7 trillion in it you and the article list problems totaling in the tens of billions of dollars let 's round up to 100 billion that is still less than 3 of them going bad which is a pretty good default rate if 97 of such projects were a success and i 'm not claiming they are then they should continue   gt;not included are the hundreds of smaller venues such as and ice hockey facilities that almost never produce the sorts of economic benefits promised   yes you keep listing only one side i asked for the other sides data which you still have not provided   if i only list those auto incidents that result in kids dying you 'd conclude that airbags are bad and must be removed however by avoiding honest data you 'd be making a mistake all i ask for in this case is the honest dat not stories only about when municipal bonds fail the statistics seem to me to be that the vast amount of them are not included in these stories of problems   gt;why does the public have to foot the bill   because they often choose to and cities certainly complain pretty loudly when a big name team moves away so apparently cities like having sport teams

these are two different ways of processing payments they go through different systems many times and are treated differently by the banks credit card issuers and the stores merchants pay different fees on transactions paid by debit cards and by credit cards debit transactions require pin and are deducted from your bank account directly in order to achieve that the transaction has to reach the bank in real time otherwise it will be declined this means that the merchant has to have a line of communications open to the relevant processor that in turn has to be able to connect to the bank and get the authorization all that while on line the bank verifies the pin authorizes the transaction and deducts the amount from your account while you 're still at the counter many times these transactions can not be reversed and the fraud protections and warranties are different from credit transactions credit transactions do n't have to go to your card issuer at all the merchant can accept credit payment without calling anyone and without getting prior authorizations even if the merchant sends the transaction for authorization with its processor if the processor can not reach the issuing bank they can still approve the transaction under certain conditions this is however never true with debit cards even if used as credit they 're not deducted from your bank account but accumulated on your credit card account they 're posted there when the actual transaction reaches the card issuer which may be many days and even many months after the transaction took place credit transactions can be reversed in some cases very easily and enjoy from a higher level of fraud protection in some countries and most if not all of the eu fraudulent credit transactions are never the consumer 's problem always the bank 's not so with debit transactions banks may be encouraging you to use debit for several reasons merchants will probably prefer credit because consumers will probably be better off with credit because

we need to be careful what we are talking about here inflation on a economy level scale at an expected rate will not change consumer habits because the price increase is manageable you have to realize that prices are not increasing in isolation wages will have to rise along too   high inflation that is expected will increase consumption of durable goods as people attempt to get rid of their money before the price changes on them a good example of this was post wwi germany where hyperinflation was so bad that offices began to pay their employees twice daily so they could adjust their wages and so that their employees could go out during lunch and after work to buy something with the money before the price changed on them unexpected inflation may cause a temporary dip in spending until wages adjust however consumers still need to buy so they will likely push for higher wages leading to consumption to stay about level there is another effect to inflation as well people who have savings will have their savings eroded over time if the economy is inflationary to preserve their wealth they will invest it in a deflationary environment money will increase in value simply by being hoarded so they will be less willing to invest it deflation also increases the cost of interest on a loan while inflation decreases it so the overall effect is for an increase in spending under inflation and a decrease under deflation the person you have quoted is quite wrong price increases in a particular sector will cause consumer spending to decrease but this is a bad example as it is not inflation but rather a supply demand problem of a particular consumer good they are applying a micro economic model price increases of a single good to a macroeconomic problem price increases in the entire economy when price increases at a global scale have the opposite effects a good theoretical test of this is what would happen if everyone in the us suddenly had twice as much money ignoring international trade of course the answer prices will double and nothing else will change the reason is people will have more money to spend but will require more money for their services so in the end it all cancels out

interest is a fee that you pay in order to use someone else 's money once you 've made the deal pretty much anything you do that reduces the total interest that you pay does so by reducing the time for which you get to use their money as an extreme example consider a thirty year interest only loan with a balloon payment at the end if you pay it off after fifteen years you pay half as much interest because you had the use of the money for half as long the same thing happens when you make biweekly payments you reduce the total interest that you pay by giving up the use of some of the borrowed money sooner that 's not necessarily bad but it 's also not automatically good

typically investing in only two securities is not a good idea when trying to spread risk even though you are in the vti which is spread out over a large amount of it should in theory reduce portfolio beta to zero or in this case as close to it as possible the vti however has a beta of 1.03 as of close today in new york this means that the vti moves roughly in exact tandem as the market usually against the s&p 500 so this means that the vti is slightly more volatile than that index in theory beta can be 0 this would be akin to investing in t bills which are assumed to be the risk free rate so in theory it is possible to reduce the risk in your portfolio and apply a more capital protective model i hope this helps you a bit

without getting to hung up on terminology here the management of a company will often attempt to keep stock prices high because of a number of reasons ideally companies keep prices up through performance   in some cases you 'll see companies do other things spending cash and/or issuing bonds to continue to pay dividends e.g. ibm or spending cash and/or issuing bonds to pay for stock buybacks e.g. ibm   these methods can work for a time but are not sustainable and will often be seen as acts of desperation   companies that have a solid plan for growth will typically not do much of anything to directly change stock prices bonds are a bit different because they have a fairly straight forward valuation model based on the fact that they pay out a fixed amount per month   the two main reason prices in bonds go down are the key here is that bonds pay out the same thing per month regardless of their price or the price of other bonds available   most stocks do not pay any dividend and for much of those that do the main factor as to whether you make or lose money on them is the stock price the price of bonds does matter to governments however   let 's say a country successfully issued some 10 year bonds last year at the price of 1000   they pay 1 per month to keep the math simple   every month they pay out $ 10 per bond   then some stupid politicians start threatening to default on bond payments   the bond market freaks and people start trying to unload these bonds as fast as they can   the going price drops to $ 500   next month the payments are the same   the coupon rate on the bonds has not changed at all   i 'm oversimplifying here but this is the core of how bond prices work you might be tempted to think that does n't matter to the country but it does   now this same country wants to issue some more bonds   it wants to get that 1 rate again but it ca n't   why would anyone pay $ 1000 for a 1 per month bond when they can get the exact same bond with basically the same risks for $ 500   instead they have to offer a 2 per month rate in order to match the market price a government or company could in fact put money into the bond market to bolster the price of it 's bonds i.e. keep the rates down   the problem is that if you are issuing bonds it 's generally caveats apply because you need cash that you do n't have so what money are you going to use to buy these bonds   or in other words it does n't make sense to issue bonds and then simply plow the cash gained from that issuance back into the same bonds you are issuing   the options here are a bit more limited   i have to mention though that the us government via a quasi governmental entity did actually buy it 's own bonds   this policy of quantitative easing qe was done for more complicated reasons than simply keeping the price of bonds up

i 'm a software engineer not an academic   from the way you have viewed things that everything can be measured by quantity you are in fact coming from an academic perspective the same as the idiot manager mba 's   gt;my assumption is that you can measure things like average on a checkout line or number of widgets assembled on an assembly line and possibly the defect rate of those widgets or pounds of fries dumped in the trash because they got cold before being served relative to fries served is this not the case   no it is not the case certainly not as you seem to imagine it   a single fast food worker does not simply stand in front of the french fry making fries all day long and the metric of the fries dumped in the trash because they got cold before being served relative to fries served is used in the management of the overall operation how many fries to make and when but they are emphatically not used as a performance measure for the general workers how could   they be the worker does not decide how many fries to make the system and the shift manager makes those decisions   likewise with the number of widgets assembly on the assembly line again the defect rate is known and typically only varies when something major has gone wrong with one of the machines processes seldom is the actual worker responsible for anything major as far as defects people with qa responsibilities might be for failing to catch a bad batch a signal that they are likely simply not doing their job at all rather than the quality of work but the actual quantities produced are a matter of scheduling amp planning via systems aka or ii and erp   so as i said your ignorance which has then turned into arrogance is showing   gt;in my field we measure things like the change in average time to launch or the revenue impact of features or the change in performance metrics etc    lol   the attempts to measure software engineering are among the most failed category of performance measurement   everyone in management basically keeps repeating the same stupid mistakes that were already proven worthless in prior iterations   gt;they're all proxy measurements though poor performers are generally much easier to spot than high performers mediocre performers can generally get through things but may not earn promotions etc   do n't kid yourself poor performers in terms of actual quality amp quantity of code will often still be promoted for several political reasons they are probably better at managing up than the better coders are iow they suck up to the idiot manager mba boss better regurgitate the latest party line of buzzwords phrases on a regular basis are not seen as troublesome adamant on quality or consistency and are seen as team players etc   about the only poor performers that will be easily spotted are those who are totally incompetent unqualified and really they are an indication of poor management in that they should never have been hired in the first place   and the true high performers in software are in fact fairly easy to spot provided you know what to look for and do n't get caught up in ridiculously inane and worthless proxy performance metrics which are all too often how well often did you kiss the boss 's arse comply with some meaningless process steps

i remember reading in an earlier version of pub 590 or possibly the instructions for form 8606 that timely contributions for year x to an ira are deemed to have been made on january 1 of year x regardless of when they were actually made but i do n't seem to be able to find it now in current versions of pubs or 590b and so can not include a citation of chapter and verse be that as it may the calculations on on form 8606 part i effectively track basis on an annual basis rather than on a daily basis and so the fact that the traditional ira has a zero balance and basis 0 too at some time during the year does n't matter in the least   in detail though you did n't ask for it note that the whole $ 6500 that you put in remains non deductible in its entirety but you owe taxes on only $ of that $ 100 k that you rolled over into a roth ira and not on the whole $ 100 k as you were assuming would have been the case so in effect of that $ 6500 nondeductible contribution to your traditional ira you did really get to deduct $ from your taxable income for 2016 and make only a $ 400 nondeductible contribution exactly equal to your basis in your traditional ira as per the form 8606 calculations   i can only assume that the software package that you are using the above calculations exactly and does what the irs says you must do on form 8606 rather than what you get by tracking the basis on a daily basis irs regulations and instructions are not necessarily the same as what the tax law says they are interpretations of the tax law based on what the irs understands the tax law to say people have challenged various specific irs regulations and interpretations as being different from what the law says in tax court and been successful in some cases and failed in others if you believe that tracking basis on a daily basis is what the law says instead of just being reasonable and rational and rationality are not required either of congress in the laws that they write or the irs regulations that interpret the laws you should take up the matter with the irs or the tax court

it depends on the seller   if the seller wants they can collect the information from you and send it to the payment gateway   in that case they of course have everything that you provide at some point   they are not supposed to keep the security code and there are rules about keeping the credit card number safe    the first four digits of the credit card number often indicate the bank although smaller banks may share   but for example a capital one card would indicate the bank    other sellers work through a payment gateway that collects the information   even there the seller may collect most of the information first and send it to the gateway   in particular the seller may collect name email phone and address information   and in general the gateway will reveal that kind of information   they will not give the seller credit card info other than the name on the card expiration date and possible last four digits   they may report if the address matches the card 's billing address addresses may mean fraud    buying through someone like paypal can provide the least information   for a digital good paypal can only expose the buyer 's name which may be a business name and email associated with the payment account   however paypal still has the other information and may expose it under legal action e.g. if the credit card transaction is reversed or the good sold is illegal   and even paypal will expose the shipping address for physical goods that require shipping

the short answer to your question is yes   index funds are about the easiest and most efficient diversified way to invest your money   vanguard 's are among the cheapest and best be aware though that passive income does n't mean you do nothing for your money   in the case of investing what you are doing is bearing risk   that is you are being paid on average to put your money in a situation where you may lose money   if you keep your eye on the long term prize then when not if you sustain losses in your investment account you will have the patience to leave the money in there i 'm a little confused by your wording about increasing your salary   normally we think of index funds as a way to increase our wealth   if you are making new investments presumably you have more salary than you need right now   normal index funds will reinvest dividends automatically so you will see the value of your investments rise but will not see any cash flows per se unless you are selling your holdings   if you want actual cash coming out of your investment you can use etf 's to achieve the same type of investment and treat the dividends as a supplement to your income   note however that some gains in your etf will be in the form of capital gains and some will be dividends   think more like 2 year per in dividend payments and the rest in capital gains if your objective is to save for retirement please consider investing through an ira roth ira or through your 401(k   no need to give uncle sam a gift from your hard earned money

gt;every major car company is doing research there is going to be massive competition   you failed to address the part where i said tesla wants major car companies to compete   that has been the entire point all along from the very start   and competition would be good for tesla because instead of tesla alone having to spend resources on educating the ignorant public e.g. you this way other auto manufacturers would be able to help   and tesla would have other to compare to and to say see we 're better than them   tesla welcomes this   auto companies are behind the times because they 've outsourced nearly all of their engineering expertise   they are good at volume production and engines   that 's most of what 's left of any major auto manufacturer   so take away the engine and they have nothing   to make a compelling ev they need to start from scratch and it takes years to develop a car   this is why competition has n't come and why compelling competition is n't coming   the only companies with somewhat compelling offerings are those who started very early bmw and nissan or those who have partnered with tesla mercedes and sort of toyota   porsche has a chance since they still have engineers but they 're dragging their feet   everyone else is basically fucked   and not just because of the lack of engineering but because of the nature of large companies   it takes a lot to right a large ship   companies will be loathe to release compelling evs because they will compete against themselves they will have to advertise the evs as if they are better than their gas offerings which still make up 99 of their sales   this puts them in a sort of paralysis and they ca n't do anything about it   someone is going to take bites out of their market share and it 's either going to be them or it 's going to be tesla   gt in the real world there is specialization some companies design cars others design batteries   have you seriously never heard of vertical integration   my previous paragraph talks about the perils of the sort of specialization you 're talking about   because automakers have spun off all their expertise they are not nimble enough to compete in a changing market   vertical integration is not the answer to everything but it is a very good way to make your company nimble and keep costs down if you can do it   that 's what tesla is aiming for   it 's not a new concept and the fact that you 've never heard of it confirms my view that you do n't understand the issues   gt the actual battery companies would n't do it but you think musk knows more about batteries than the actual battery companies   tesla has particular expertise about automotive batteries yes   they do their own battery research and have their own ip and patents which they 've opened related to it   and they have a partner panasonic who is the leader in batteries   did you know that   did you know that panasonic is partnering in the battery factory   because it sounds like you did n't which confirms my view that you do n't understand the issues     panasonic is partnering in their battery factory and will be responsible for much of the production   and panasonic has been making quite a tidy profit on their battery manufacturing for several years thanks to tesla   gt;the actual battery companies declined to spend massive capital for a plant to supply tsla cars   literally in the same exact call that this article is about on the same day panasonic and tesla announced that panasonic is spending massive capital for a plant to supply tsla cars   not only have they increased production at their own plant tremendously over the course of the last few years they will end up spending a billion dollars on the tesla plant on the call elon said tesla will provide 40 50 of the total cost panasonic about 20 states 10 and other partners depending on how vertical they go with the factory panasonic has already committed 200 300 million for the initial per the press release on earnings day and will be onboard for at least a billion but elon thinks they may do more in the end   so no you really really do n't understand it

there is no law requiring someone to return a refused check you need to clarify whether this payment is to establish a retainer or to pay for services rendered either way you should stop payment on the check and send them a certified letter explaining that you are stopping payment on the check because they refused it if the payment is to establish a retainer then the issue is simple the lawyer requires $ 10,000 as a retainer before you can engage them and until then you have no relationship with them if that is the amount they want then less than that is not accepted if the payment is for services rendered already and you owe them money then it is a completely different situation refusing partial payment means they are getting ready to sue you in a collection suit the larger the amount is the better normally someone owed money will only refuse a partial payment if they anticipate having to sue the debtor and they want to maximize their leverage in case of a court judgement in their favor a creditor has the right to refuse a partial payment

i 'm no expert on this but i would say that if you own the business entirely yourself there is nothing terribly wrong with using it for your own purposes as you would any other asset that you own   what is wrong is not keeping accurate records that distinguish between your money and the business 's   as you say this is wrong strategically but it can also be dangerous legally because if you mix your money and the business 's money and do n't keep track you could find for instance that you 've failed to pay the taxes you were supposed to there is also a concern that might not fall under what people refer to as ethics but more good corporate citizenship   basically people tend not to like companies that just shovel all their gains into the owners pockets   this is especially true if there are ways the money could be used to improve the business   in other words if you 're able to live high on the hog with the profits while paying all your employees a pittance the public may not look favorably on your business

right now the unrealized appreciation of vanguard tax managed    small cap fund admiral shares is of nav as long as the fund    delivers decent returns over the long term is there anything stopping    this amount from ballooning to say 90 fifty years hence i 'd have a heck of a time imagining how this grows to that high a number realistically   the inflows and outflows of the fund are a bigger question along with what kinds of changes are there to capital gains that may make the fund try to hold onto the stocks longer and minimize the tax burden if this happens wo n't new investors be scared away by the prospect of    owing taxes on these gains for example a financial crisis or a    superior new investment technology could lead investors to dump their    shares of tax managed index funds triggering enormous capital gains    distributions and if new investors are scared away wo n't the fund be    forced to sell its assets to cover redemptions even if there is no    disruptive event leading to larger capital gains distributions than    in the past possibly but you have more than a few assumptions in this to my mind that i wonder how well are you estimating the probability of this happening finally do etfs avoid this problem assuming it is a problem yes etfs have creation and redemption units that allow for in kind transactions and thus there is n't a selling of the stock   however if one wants to pull out various unlikely scenarios then there is the potential of the market being shut down for an extended period of time that would prevent one from selling shares of the etf that may or may not be as applicable as open end fund shares i would however suggest researching if there are hybrid funds that mix open end fund shares with etf shares which could be an alternative here

so how often do investors really lose money the short answer is every day let 's first examine your assumptions if the price of the share gets lower the investor can just wait until    it gets higher what are the chances that it wo n't forever or for    years there are many stocks whose price goes down and then down further and then to zero the most apparent example is of course enron the stock went from about $ 90 per share to zero in about 18 months for it to have been sold at $ 90 obviously someone had to buy it almost no matter where they sold it they lost money if they did n't sell it when the stock was worthless they lost money there are more modern examples of companies that are declining in a rapidly changing market for example sears holdings is getting beat down by amazon and many other on line retailers i suspect that if you buy it today and wait for it to go higher you will be disappointed the more common way to lose money is to either not have a plan or not stick to the plan disciplined investors typically plan to buy quality stocks at a fair price and hold them long enough for increasing sales and profits to bring the stock price up if later he hears a bit of bad news about his stock and decides to sell out of panic or fear and become a trader instead of keeping to the plan to remain a disciplined investor he is likely to lose money he will lose because no one can predict accurately that a stock is going down and will never recover nor can he predict accurately when a stock is going up and will never falter the chance of bankruptcy especially for huge companies like apple is    really low as i see it but i may be wrong thousands of people lost billions of dollars thinking that about enron too i too believe apple is a fine stock with excellent prospects but technology changes and markets change twenty or thirty years from now it may be a different case

you say you want a more stable system recall from your introductory economics courses that money has three roles a medium of exchange here is $ give me goods a unit of account you owe me $ the business made $ last year and a store of value i have saved $ for the future i assume that you are mostly concerned with the store of value role being eroded due to inflation but first consider that most people still want regular currency so as a medium of exchange or accounting unit anything would face an uphill battle if you discard that role for your currency and only want to store value with it you could just buy equities and commodities and baskets of currencies and debt in a brokerage account possibly using mutual funds to store your value trillions of dollars worth of business takes place this way every year already virtual currency was a bit of a dot com bubble thing the systems which did n't go completely bust and are still around have been by money laundering and otherwise remain largely an ignored niche an online fiat currency has the same basic problem that another currency has you need to trust the central bank not to create more money and cause inflation or even just with the funds or go bankrupt get sued perhaps the federal reserve may be jerking us around on that front right now they 're still a lot more believable than a small private institution some banks might possibly be trustworthy enough to launch a currency but it 's hard to see why they 'd bother it ca n't be a big profit center because people are n't willing to pay too much to just use money and an online currency that 's backed by commodities e.g. gold is going to be subject to potentially violent swings in the prices of commodities imagine getting a loan out for your house denominated in terms of e gold and then the price of gold ouch

i would apply extra cash left over at the end of the month as follows in order of priority realize though that this is my take on priority my experience has been that a liquidity crisis is much more stressful than having a mortgage or other debt illiquid wealth is almost useless when you need cash so if you still have strong feelings about retiring that debt after considering the liquidity issue go ahead and swap 3 and 4 above make plans to pay off the mortgage over the next 10 years find a mortgage payoff calculator and make extra monthly payments that keep you on a 10 year schedule i 'd strongly suggest making sure your retirement savings are on track though time is on your side here and your required monthly contribution will be low now while you 're still in your 20s

you are the way you and the other co founders are paid for guaranteeing the loan to capital shares trying to determine payments by equity distribution is hard it is a practice that many small companies particularly the ones in their initial stage fall into i always advise against trying to make payments with equity weather it is for unpaid salary or for guaranteeing a loan such as your case instead of thinking about a super sophisticated algorithm to distribute the new shares between the cofounders and the new investors given a set of constraints which will most probably fail to make the satisfactory split you should simply view the co founders as debt lenders for the company and the shareholders as a capital contributor   if the co founders are treated as debt lenders it will be much easier to determine the risk compensation for guaranteeing the loan because it is now assessed in monetary units and this compensation is equal to the risk premium you see fit taking into consideration the probability of default on the other hand capital contributors will gain capital shares as a percentage of the total value of the company after adding sba loan

hope this helps   i understand that a reverse mortgage can be paid out in two ways a lump sum and monthly payments i figure that if you take the lump sum eventually the bank wants you to start paying it back answer    actually there are 3 payout options or 4 if you consider a combination payout as another one there 's a lump sum a line of credit or the monthly payout or a combination   i figure that if you take the monthly payments eventually the bank stops paying out and wants you to pay it back in both situations interest accrues and this is how the bank makes money off of the deal   answer the only time the monthly payments would stop would be if the borrower defaults on the lenders terms or they no longer live at home you are right though and interest does accrue on whichever payment is decided on i 'm not sure how the lender makes money probably by the interest but i know borrowers are protected against high rates and owing more than your house here 's an article i found that goes over the protections more in detail   but what determines when you have to begin paying back the reverse mortgage some sources online seem to say that it 's based only on if you die or would like to sell move that ca n't be right in all situations because you could end up with a massive debt on a property more than its value   answer there are a lot of protections or regulations in place to protect anyone who takes out a reverse mortgage one being you ca n't owe more than your house is valued at during the time of repayment a reverse mortgage is a non recourse loan in the instance that your house is less than you owe you either sell the home and the proceeds are used to pay the loan and you keep the rest or if you owe more than the house proceeds of the home go to the lender either way you 're not left paying for a mortgage without the house in the case the parent grandparent passes then the heirs would have a choice of either paying back the reverse mortgage in payments or they can sell the house heirs are protected during this as well to make sure they 're not left with major debt in case of anything   is there a formula to figure out when the bank stops the monthly payments and then wants it back   amount becomes due if loan terms are not met but the lender will discuss the options if it comes to that   is there a different formula for when the lump sum would have to be paid back   answer each payout option has the same terms and the same pay back terms as long as terms are met the lender ca n't ask for early repayment

i 'm not the op but i 'm happy to give a brief overview   basically pre jobs act there were a lot of limits on who could make an equity investment in a non public company i.e. a startup or even a hedge fund there were some loopholes but basically you had to be an accredited investor an accredited investor was someone who either has made $ 200,000 + $ 300,000 + for married people for the past two years and expects to make that much again in the current year alternately they could have a net worth of $ 1 million excluding the value of their primary residence there was also a limit of 500 investors for a non public company before the company had to become public they did n't really have to ipo but they did have to file their financials with the sec so the effect was basically the same finally non public companies were prohibited from seeking investment through advertising basically they could n't take out an ad in a paper or event send a mass email and say hey we 're looking to raise a $ 1 million funding round contact us if you 're interested   okay now after the jobs act   the jobs act changed a the number and type of investors who could make equity investments in a non public company b the regulation of advertising for investments   post jobs private companies could have 2,000 shareholders and 500 of those could be unaccredited e.g. regular people like you and i the change in the number of shareholders is n't really that important because it 's just shareholders of record but that 's another post for another day there are still some requirements for unaccredited shareholder which i do n't remember off the top of my head i think you have to have income of at least $ 40k they also changed the solicitation ban so it 's possible that you might see an ad in the wsj someday for a startup company venture capital fund hedge fund etc   there are some other things it changed but imo those are the two most important

in addition to the prior answer talking from experience you get into trouble if you surpass the contribution limit and your employer continues to deposit money above the irs maximum allowed when that happens you have until april to take out the excess contribution and earned interest on that chunk of money and included in your tax return or else you get a steep tax penalty in addition to being double taxed for the current and next tax year also from experience payroll departments will most likely get this wrong and it will end up in a compliance mess with you picking up the tab on your tax bill do n't let it happen

an answer from a psychological viewpoint money does not have a linear value to people if you have $ 10.000 losing one dollar does n't really matter losing all $ 10.000 is more than 10.000 times as bad as a simple example of a non linear function let 's use the square root function let 's say that having $ 100 is ten times as good as having $ 1 and having $ 10000 is ten times as good as having $ 100   now this means that an insurance may have a negative expectation when expressed in dollars since the insurance company is making a profit but the expected value still can be positive let 's assume the premium is $ 150 and there 's a 1 chance it will pay $ 10.000 clearly in dollars the expected loss is $ 50 but in the value to you using that same square root function the premium is just and the expected payout is 1   intuitive you wo n't notice the premium if you 're rich enough that you do n't need the insurance but once you do need the insurance you could now be so poor that you appreciate the payout as a side effect this also shows that you want an insurance with a fairly high deductible if a $ 10.000 loss is a risk you can bear then you do n't need insurance for losses in the order of $ 100 and that 's even ignoring the fact that such small payouts have relatively high administrative costs for insurance companies which is why the premium discount for high deductibles can be high

all the time for high volume stocks it may be tough to see exactly what 's going on e.g. the bid ask may be moving faster than your connection to the broker can show you   what i 've observed is with options the volume on some options is measured in the 10 's or 100 's of contracts in a day i 'll see a case where it 's $ bid ask and by offering $ 1.90 will often see a fill at that price since i may be the only trade on that option in the 15 minute period and note that the stock was n't moving more than a penny during that time i know that it was my order that managed to fill between the bid ask

the next phase   by       one mind boggling question is this good for the economy   20   september   2012   thursday ph    i want to share this to all the brilliant economists in this world    let 's talk on qe     by   m.   qe is not a cure it is a qe is synthetic no more no less qe is artificial it can not and will never hold water qe is only a temporary relief not an outright total solutions qe is absolutely not a guaranty not an assurance for recovery or growth qe is a very good tool this acts as an oxygen to a dying patients to breathe qe is now and forever taking away the oxygen the patient will going to die qe is a big balloon continues to expand amplify waiting to explode to burst qe will keep you moving today but not for the rest of your life qe is the more you move the more you get sucked down qe will bring joy today later it will bring tears pouring in your eyes that could not stop qe is worthless injecting precious blood highly precious dollar to a zombie economy a economy an absolute waste qe is brainless simply do not know what will going to be the consequences to the economy do not have the idea of what will going to be the final result qe is only a dream being over optimistic that one day everything will go back to normal that at the end of the day the economy will recover and finally would realize growth qe is just a fantasy meaning punching the moon the stars thinking it will resolve the year 2008 economic meltdown qe is an investment yes a massive investments to a dying economy absolutely wrong investments qe will keep you running it is like a ticking time bomb qe is not good for the economy the government acts or play as an investor instead of the businessman qe is being very kind and generous to businessman while keeping the country the state 's economy at stake or in jeopardy qe is putting more money to a business supporting the company to stay to exist for the time being and later on will literally closed shop qe is killing the mighty precious dollar slowly but surely qe is hide and seek like suze orman of cnbc say 's show me the money qe is treasure hunting ultra rich millionaires billionaires is keeping it they hide it where are those precious dollars making the economy sick crippled dead qe is a money making machine printing press once the economy becomes weak all they have to do is just print qe is putting plenty of money to a basket full of holes truly very few will benefit and so many will going to suffer   this is inequality   disparity is very disturbing counter to a good economy qe is experimental trial and error testing probability never done before qe is good at the start year 2008 after spending investing releasing trillions and trillions of mighty precious dollars big companies millions of jobs were blessed saved rescued   and like magic america the wealthiest and most powerful country in the   universe is now going to act again today to spend invest release again and again and again and again trillions and trillions of mighty precious dollars for the economy to keep moving my god what an abnormal cycle of the economy qe is a wild guess absolutely speculative before only big businesses huge companies are at stake   today it is now the whole country is at risk   not yet talking of the whole wide world with special mention to my my beloved country the philippines   this is certainly   absolutely domino effect   no one not one will ever be spared qe is very before only america needs to be saved to be today all countries is in distress suffering badly needs a rescue qe is keeping inflation very low yes absolutely for today but not for tomorrow   the medicine that they used during the 2008 economic slump is luckily still moving   meaning still working    but once this medicine starts to slowdown and begins to die down   you may call all the saints above   and the true inflation you are looking for searching for will surely and definitely come into your midst    inflation will going to kill us all qe is a wrong medicine temporary patch or qe is it is just an easy money and definitely not a hard earned labor generated money qe is a gamble trillion dollars is at stake if we are lucky the dying person or the economy will live if we are not lucky the dying person will die the economy will going to collapsed and still we have to pay all the debts as long as we live qe is the economy today is at the mercy of qe   the economy is captive hostage by qe interest rates is a lose lose situations keeping it zero   the u.s.a government will lose trillions   and trillions of dollars that is badly needed   now raising this rates will surely and definitely starts   the u.s.a markets and precisely the world economy to react pulling down the unstable economies   of the whole world to jeopardy   now which one would you like to choose again which one would you prefer qe is trial and error a complex complicated solutions   healing one part of the body and the other part will swell and burst qe is evaporation using taxpayers money pension funds retirement benefits and all entitlements is going to fade will vanished in thin air qe are waiters simply waiting day and night for growth for recovery qe is it dries up the u.s.a treasury qe is debt a never ending debt keep in mind there is no such thing as unlimited debt or debt unlimited do n't be fooled qe will going to keep you in good sleep but will wake you up bankrupt qe is not an answer it is the culprit qe is universal it was copied all over the world worldwide qe is an absolute solutions yes for all dumb economists a hopeless desperate solutions qe to be specific is going back again to the 1930 's depression or the great depression part 2 yes precisely but with a big bang qe before is only a staggering risk today it is now debt simple as it keeps on giving birth by the hour the minutes the seconds and after eight long years the final   the end result is massive pure debt very sorry to say not growth and or definitely not recovery qe is a dying move no one not one ever dared to affirm to attest to certify that this is a correct solutions qe is mad it will make you crazy because of debt qe is the only options yes absolutely when your big brains is not working qe is easing the pain correct for a very short period of time but will going to destroy the economy in the long or short run qe is history it will you forever and ever qe what more can i say    fb

firstly most option traders do n't want to actually buy or sell the underlying stock this is completely utterly false perhaps the problem is that you are only familiar with the buy side of options trading on the sell side of options trading an options desk engages in delta hedging when we sell an option to a client we will also buy an appropriate amount of underlying to match the delta position of the option during the life time of the option we will readjust our hedge position whenever the delta changes those who follow black scholes will know that normally that comes from underlying price changes however we lose money on each underlying change we have to cross the bid ask spread for each trade that is why we lose money when there is volatility that is why we are said to be short vega or short volatility so one way to think about buying options is that you are paying someone to execute a specific trading strategy in general those who sell options are also happy to buy options back at a discount of course so we make a profit but when doing so we need to our hedging position and that again incurs a cost to us the bank finally since this is money stackexchange rather than finance you are most likely referring to warrants rather than options which are listed on stock exchanges the exchange in most regions give us very specific and restrictive regulations that we must abide by one very common one is that we must always list a price which we are willing to buy the warrants back at which may not be an unreasonable spread from the sell price since an option is a synthetically created investment instrument when we buy back the option from the investor we simply unwind the underlying hedging positions that we booked to the options with source i 've worked 2 years on a warrant desk as a desk developer

gt i think people should prevent themselves from being homeless by developing skills to work   you are right of course let me try to rephrase my question   if someone 's problem is that they do n't have the skills to work and you put pressure on them is it not more likely that they will try to resolve the pressure quickly with the skills they have rather than endure the pressure while learning a new skill   for example if someone is too unreliable to get a job and you tie his next meal to getting and keeping a job is n't that person much more likely to start stealing food rather than learning to be reliable while being hungry   gt do you think it 's moral to steal from someone who worked hard smart and give it to someone who did n't and is now homeless   i object to the word steal the bottom line is that some of the hard smart worker 's money is going to go handling the homeless person whether it be feeding him or hiring police to handle the crimes he commits

in a well managed company employees bring more dollars to their employers than the employers pay the employees salary and benefits   employees trade potential reward for security a regular paycheck   employers take on the risk of needing to meet payroll and profit from the company 's income minus expenses the potential rewards are much higher as an employer self or otherwise so the ones that do make it do quite well   but this is also consistent with your other statement that the reverse is not true the risk of self employment is high and many self employed people do n't become millionaires

the point here is actually about banks or is in reference to banks they expect you know how a savings account at a bank works but not mutual funds and so are trying to an erroneous notion that you might have that the will insure your investment in the fund   banks work by taking in deposits and lending that money out via mortgages the mortgages can last up to 30 years but the deposits are on demand which means you can pull your money out at any time   see the problem they 're maintaining a fiction that that money is there safe and sound in the bank vault ready to be returned whenever you want it when in fact it 's been loaned out and ca n't be called back quickly either they know only a little bit of that money will be demanded by depositors at any given time so they keep a percentage called a reserve to satisfy that er demand   the rest again is loaned out gone   and usually that works out just fine except sometimes it does n't when people get scared they might not get their money back and they all go to the bank at the same time to demand their on demand deposits back this is called a run on the bank and when that happens the bank fails 'cause it ai n't got the money   what 's failing in fact is the fiction that your money is there whenever you want it and that 's really bad because when that happens to you at your bank your friends the customers of other banks start worrying about their money and run on their banks which fail which cause more people to worry and try to get their cash out lather rinse repeat until the whole economy crashes see the great depression   so various governments introduced deposit insurance where the government will step in with the cash so when you panic and pull all your money out of the bank you can go home happy cash in hand and do n't freak all your friends out therefore the fear that your money might not really be there is and it does n't spread like a mental everyone can comfortably go back to believing the fiction and the economy goes back to chugging along   meanwhile with mutual funds etfs everyone understands the money you put in them is invested and not sitting in a gigantic vault and so there 's no need for government insurance to maintain the fiction   and that 's the point they 're trying to make   poorly i might add where their wording is concerned

based on your question details i doubt you 'll like this answer but first things first you need to focus on rebuilding your credit and your savings $ 1 k is n't a huge loan amount so i 'm going to assume you 've made some poor decisions in the past to get to this point i 'm a small business owner and i make it a goal to have 3 6 months of expected expenses in an account should my circumstances ever drastically change or something happen that would keep me from working    without knowing your living situation and daily expenses here 's some general advice on building a small business without a loan   1 find steady employment anywhere you can   2 pay off outstanding debts and rebuild a savings account to rebuild your credit score    3 if you need fast cash sell some stuff you do n't need gaming systems home electronics etc also minimize your unnecessary expenses dining out etc   4 once your debts are paid off create a business startup savings plan put away as much as you can afford every week until you reach your goal    5 once your goal is reached you can begin your flipping business open a bank account and separate your profits into buckets for operations self pay and taxes if you declare this income which i hope you do for myself i put away 35 for income taxes which i do not touch until my taxes are paid i put 40 away for daily operations this keeps my business running allowing me to pay for the equipment i need the products i deliver and advertising to keep my business running i pay myself 25 this is a simple method but it works well for me

never co sign a loan for someone especially family   taking out a loan for yourself is bad enough but co signing a loan is just plain stupid think about it if the bank is asking for a co signer its because they are not very confident that the applicant is going to be paying back the loan so why would you then step up and say i 'll pay back the loan if they do n't make me a co signer please here is a list of things that people never think about when they cosign a loan for somebody   now if you absolutely must co sign a loan here is how i would do it i the co signer would be the one who makes the payments to ensure that the loan was paid on time and i would be the one collecting the payment from the person who is getting the loan its a very simple way of preventing some of the worst situations that can arise and you should be willing to make the payments anyway after all that s what it means to cosign a loan your just turning things around and paying the loan upfront instead of paying after the applicant defaults and ruins every ones credit source user 's own blog post never co sign a loan for someone especially family

in my experience earning interest is not enough to keep the account in a non dormant state if payment of interest was the trigger to reset the clock then no savings account would ever be considered dormant in general as the account got close to the deadline we were notified that a single transaction moving money into or out of the account would reset the clock i have had this happen in recent years with a bank account and a credit union account   in researching for the exact definition of a dormant account i found this regarding interest on the fdic website that means that the state law may set the definition it also means that you should look at the information regarding the bank policy i did try and see if the rules for a credit union are the same the added twist with a credit union is that if the account is closed they are no longer a share holder and that brings into the discussion voting rights so the policy guidelines is even more complex if the account does go inactive state law will define what happens to the account and how you can get the funds back

according to the book of hull american and european calls on non dividend paying stocks should have the same value american puts however should be equals to or more valuable than european puts the reason for this is the time value of money in a put you get the option to sell a stock at a given strike price if you exercise this option at t=0 you receive the strike price at t=0 and can invest it at the risk free rate lets imagine the rf rate is 10 and the strike price is this means at you would get if on the other hand you exercise the option early at you would simply receive the strike price 10 $ basically the strike price which is your payoff for a put option does n't earn interest another way to look at this is that an option is composed of two elements the insurance element and the time value of the option the insurance element is what you pay in order to have the option to buy a stock at a certain price for put options it is equals to the s 0 where k = strike price and stock price   the time value of the option can be thought of as a risk premium it 's difference between the value of the option and the insurance element if the benefits of exercising a put option early earning the risk free rate on the proceeds outweighs the time value of the put option it should be exercised early yet another way to look at this is by looking at the upper bounds of put options for a european put today 's value of the option can never be worth more than the present value of the strike price discounted at the risk free rate if this rule is n't respected there would be an arbitrage opportunity by simply investing at the risk free rate for an american put since it can be exercised at any time the maximum value it can take today is simply equals to the strike price therefore since the pv of the strike price is smaller than the strike price the american put can have a bigger value bear in mind this is for a non dividend paying stock as previously mentioned if a stock pays a dividend it might also be optimal to exercise just before these are paid

so i liked the source biased and outdated on a lot of things but still very informative i will concede that fda regulations are far from infallible and deserve to be and the process that being said the discussion was n't whether that was the case it was whether the fda is the cause of high drug prices this site did not to my knowledge make that case at least for the present time period it did n't    here we see that the companies spend a lot more on marketing than they do on r&amp;d of which fda compliance is just a small part furthermore assuming that they 'd still be doing some sort of testing themselves they would n't save the full costs from reducing fda regulations they 'd also have to spend even more on marketing to deal with the increased competition we 're talking pharma girls for   the problem with the free market solution is that the drug companies end up getting politicians to shill out to protect them from legal harm as governor of indiana mike pence signed a right to try law which drug makers of legal responsibility for untested at ill patients   okay so now the onus is on the doctors well that 's barely any better because doctors are individuals with very little free time and with so many new drugs coming out and no way for the doctors to test them they just have to take the drug company 's word for them in other words the drug company is n't liable the doctor is and the doctor has no way of knowing whether the drug company is being until it 's too late for both the doctor and the laws like this mike pence law were n't around when that site was publishing

gt;and a lot of people that have communist party wealth are afraid that there will be an uprising against them so they are preparing escape plans   my guess would be more along these lines albeit maybe a bit less dramatic   there were a lot of dubious things that party members did over the past hundred years to stash away cash for themselves   siphoning off public resources investing with them and as long as the investments made money keeping the results for example played a significant role in some of the complaints that farmers had about local officials   if they keep money in china and there 's some sort of fallout or charges that go through my guess is that it 's a lot easier to seize a corrupt official 's resources   on the other hand if you just bought a bunch of land in the us that 's a lot less easily and harder to immediately get ahold of for chinese officials   there 's also the more legit possibility that china quite arguably has a real estate bubble in investable real estate and the result is that if you want to invest in land and reduce your risk to a bubble deflating you want to do so overseas

is jim right to be worries yes since the statute of limitations for refunds for 2012 is close and he might lose any tax refunds he might be entitled to for that year also the pattern itself may raise some flags of suspicion and trigger audits both because of such a variance in income and because of the medical expenses which are generally considered a red flag so he might get audited however if all the income and expenses are properly documented audit itself should not be a problem

if you are providing vat liable services you are and you register normally for vat then you will be able to reclaim vat on your buisness purchases but you will have to charge vat to your clients so the question really comes down to will your clients regard you adding vat to their invoices as a price increase or not that is likely to depend on whether your clients are in a position to claim back the vat you charged them if you are working mostly for vat registered who perform vat liable including zero rated activities then registering for vat is likely in your financial interests though it does mean more paperwork the flat rate scheme may be better still if you are working mostly for private individuals non vat registered or which perform vat exempt activities then registering for vat when you do n't have to is most likely not in your financial interests note vat exempt and zero rated for vat are very different things even though they look similar to the customer

i have seen the notation written on documents in the place where you put an identifying number of some kind it stands for known to branch and means the tellers recognize you it 's been written on documents of mine when i was depositing cheques large enough that someone else had to come and initial the transaction and i presume that some people might have also had to show extra id but i did n't   just a month or so ago i was in line behind an old man at a branch where everyone has to put their card in and enter a pin to do transactions i heard him tell the teller i do n't have a card never did do n't hold with that another teller came by and said something quietly to the teller i presume it was that 's old mr smith we all know him and the transaction appears to have taken place without any id being passed across the counter   so yes at least in canada if the tellers recognize you the requirements for id are less than you might think it 's a bit of a long con to spend 25 years going into a branch and conducting all your business under a particular name just so you can do a transaction or two without id though

a simple and low interest loan is probably the least likely to cause aside from a direct gift you seem to be describing an equity stake in their house where some portion of the appreciation in value accrues to you relative to your initial investment   an equity stake in their house probably does n't make much sense   you sound as though you 're not going to do any of the work aside from the contribution of money   equity might make sense as a way to reward you for efforts such as home design or renovation that increase the value of the home   you probably do n't want to be in a position where you are together improving the property and your payback only comes when she sells for more money   what if you have different ideas of how to do it   she has to live there and may want improvements for her needs rather than for buyers   what if she asks you to pay for a portion of the improvement costs or you not offering   what if she does n't want to sell for some reason so your money is locked up with her family choices   renovations can often be stressful so these decisions may be made at difficult times either a gift or a low interest family loan may be simpler for your needs   you can just set the loan terms you want say payoff over 10 years or a deferred payment schedule   if she gets in trouble you could perhaps delay or forgive payments   i do n't know the uk tax consequences of a loan of this nature if any as a general proposition it 's best to set clear and simple expectations at the beginning and avoid agreements that require multiple decisions to be made in the future possibly during a time of stress

the reason your 401k match is always counted as pre tax whether you are contributing to a traditional 401k or a roth is that the money is contributed by the employer and is not counted as income and that contribution is not taxed as income should you wish to pay taxes on it and convert it to a roth you can do that though perhaps not until you change jobs

say for example a trade totals $ 10,000   a flat tax of 0.2 would be $ 20   this is not much for the buy amp holder b c he only makes a few trades a year say 10 transactions a year   so their tax is only about $ 200 per year heck we could even drop it to 0.1   but will routinely do 10 trades a day or over 3000 trades a year   so using that same 10 k trade above that could hypothetically be = $ 60,000 per year in taxes   computer traders will do hundreds of trades per day   say 30,000 trades per year   so that is $ 600,000   so you can see how hardly affects legitimate investors while making the hf traders control themselves a bit   this is what we want   the exchanges charge the flat tax with the transaction like a sales tax   it avoids excess regulation the sec already monitors trades or is supposed to and it hurts the gamblers hfts while not the good guys investors

fortunately this can be solved by simply going to the website unfortunately the website is not very well designed so it took a while to find it however looking at the section about entering your own meter reading in it is clear that this is indeed a credit meaning they owe you money   notice how the costs break down   they estimated an energy usage cost equivalent of £ which resulted in a bill of £ credit   then the customer entered a meter reading which resulted in an actual energy usage cost equivalent of £   since it was £ higher it went from a credit to a debit of £    were £ credit to mean money was owed to they would owe a bit over £ 68 instead given the higher energy charges you can see this help page to inquire about getting a refund or simply allow this to carry over to your next bill   or consider doing a self entered meter reading if one has n't been done recently to make sure that any actual excessive usage comes out of your credit rather than being a shock at one time

also note that a share of voting stock is a vote at the stockholder 's meeting whether it 's dividend or non dividend that has value to the company and major stockholders in terms of protecting their own interests and has value to anyone considering a takeover of the company or who otherwise wants to drive the company 's policy similarly if the company is bought out the share will generally be replaced by shares in whatever the new owning company is so it really does represent a slice of the company in several vary practical ways and thus has fairly well defined intrinsic value linked to the company 's perceived value if its price drops too low the company becomes more vulnerable to hostile takeover which means the company itself will often be motivated to buy back shares to protect itself from that threat one of the questions always asked when making an investment is whether you 're looking for growth are you hoping its intrinsic value will increase or income are you hoping it will pay you a premium for owning it non dividend stocks are a pure growth bet dividend paying stocks are typically a mixture of growth and income at various trade off points what 's right for you depends on your goals timeframe risk tolerance and what else is already in your portfolio

in the us the title company usually collects all money being paid by parties to the sale including the buyer seller and mortgage companies and then pays out money where its due to the respective parties the seller and possibly mortgage companies housing inspectors etc   if you have equity meaning that you sold your house for a price greater than what you owed on your mortgage you 'll typically get them money from the title company but they are really passing through money that they got from the buyer less whatever fees are going to the title company itself and other third parties involved one misconception however is that if you paid off part of your mortgage over time that you automatically have equity   that 's really only true if you find a buyer willing to pay a price greater than what 's left on your mortgage   when housing prices decline it 's possible that you as the seller may need to bring a check to closing and do not get any money back they buyer is presumably bringing a bigger check but you would need to make up the difference between what the buyer pays and what you still owe on your mortgage

etiquette or not it is hurting the seller the transaction fees have usually minimums so if the actual transaction is below the minimum they 'll pay larger fee on the transaction relatively as an example assume minimum fee for a debit card swipe is 20 cents or 2 of the transaction for a transaction of $ 10 and above the fee will be 2 of the transaction but for $ the fee becomes 12 of the transaction 6 times more expensive for the seller basically the sale was most likely at a loss for them they usually have very low margins especially for a dollar store so take that into account as well

is it true that due the to the increase in interest rates that inflation is likely to increase as well it is typically the reverse where inflation causes interest rates to rise interest rates fundamentally reflect the desire for people to purchase future goods over present day goods   if i loan money to someone for 5 years i lose the ability to use that money   in order to entice me to loan the money the borrower would have to offer me an incentive that is they would have to give me additional money at the end of that 5 years   this additional money is the interest rate and it reflects the desire of people to spend money in the future versus the present day   if offered the same amount of money today versus 5 years from now almost everyone would chose to take the money now   money in the present is more valuable than the same amount of money in the future interest rates would still exist even with a currency that could not be printed i would still prefer to have the currency today than in the future if the currency is continually devalued i.e. the issuer is printing more of the currency than borrowers may charge additional interest to compensate for the loss in purchasing power when they make a loan also it is hard to compare interest rates and inflation   inflation is very difficult to calculate new products and services as well as ever changing consumer desires continually change the mixture of goods in the market so it is nearly impossible to compare a basket of goods today to a basket of goods 5 10 20 or 30 years ago

the easiest way to find a buyer should be to ask the company to connect you to some of their other shareholders i imagine they are much more likely to take those shares off you than a random investor on the street otherwise well talk to people at a golf club maybe valuation is not going to be very straightforward basically you 'll get whatever someone is willing to pay that 's what fmv means when there 's no real market realistically the price is mainly going to be based on history and the company 's assets discounted for risk and liquidity you 're currently feeling the reason for the latter discount

what the hell is fair inequality      in order for inequality to be justified there needs to be constant growth in the economy such that the ones pulling away and getting rich are producing better products services or inventing more efficient ways to bring products to market    unfortunately more of the rich are turning to rent seeking methods to increase their wealth thus it becomes zero sum at that point because they are taking more wealth for themselves without actually adding any value economically to society      currently our growth is anemic yet the very wealthy keeps pulling farther and farther away from the pack as far as total wealth   this is why as they get richer the rest of us are getting poorer

i dislike this argument that government pressure to make bad loans is the origin of subprime loans    in fact the term subprime is because those type of loans ca n't be underwritten by the government   usually the concept of government forcing bad loans is government forcing banks to give minorities and low income people loans for their first houses    the government requires w-2 income and a base credit score to procure these loans   at the peak of the bubble the majority of home sales were for investment purposes not homeownership purposes    those who declared the housing market was wildly unstable and who were proven right were talking about the problem of mortgage brokers being incentivized to lie about a person not being qualified for prime government loans in order to make more money by putting them in lucrative subprime loans or simply advising them they were better off in subprime and could get cash out up front   also liar no doc loans were booming and speculators and house flippers were getting multiple properties in order to flip them for profit   once upon a time these speculators would make sure they could rent out the house for the carrying costs if they needed to   0 down 0 interest meant a whole different ballgame     ah but maybe these speculators would n't have anyone to sell to if low income people could n't get prime loans from the gov   all evidence points to them selling to other speculators until there was no fool left to hold the bag   see miami las vegas etc   edit   i forget that the argument has from fannie to the end of to the cra and now to changes made to the cra where the argument finally gains a bit of traction gt law professor michael s. a treasury department official under president stated that approximately 50 of subprime loans were made by independent mortgage companies that were not regulated by the cra and another 25 to 30 came from only partially cra regulated bank subsidiaries and affiliates noted that institutions fully regulated by cra made perhaps one in four sub prime loans and that the worst and most widespread abuses occurred in the institutions with the least federal oversight   further the discussion into whether the idea and enthusiasm of the rest started as a seed from the regulated banks how much removing risk by wall street with non government backed home loans through credit instruments had its origination in the cra and how much of the failure of ratings agencies to properly rate those credit instruments has to do with the us government and the cra and not regular wall street   so originally i stated no relationship but yes once you get into the complexity of it all i 'm sure we could find a way to say a global mania in speculation in real estate is due to the american government getting poor people into their first home and generally has nothing to do with the human condition of wanting something for nothing and getting excited when the government allows you to sell blue sky returns to foolish speculators

i 'm of the opinion that it does n't matter much unless something in your life changes in retirement and since many retirement planners assume a default income target of 80 percent of pre retirement income i figure many people 's tax bracket is n't moving much the most interesting reason i know to go roth in a 401k is limits you can only contribute like $ 17k whether roth or not in a traditional contribution some of the 17k you put in goes to taxes when taken out but in a roth contribution you pay taxes up front so if you have more than $ 17k to invest roth lets you sneak some more into the system

any accounting software should be able to handle this   when you invoice them set the invoice date to the date of the event   then receive a partial payment against that invoice   this will cause your accounting software to display the service income in the correct period as well   so if you sent them invoice for august 7 2014 event on may 5th 2014 and they gave you $ 500 due you would see this income in august $ 500 on cash basis $ 1000 on accrual basis   when you received the other $ 500 in august you would see $ 1000 for both methods   you would not see any income in may when you created the invoice   this is better for revenue matching with the correct period when you send them same invoice say 30 days before the event set the software to show payments already received   it seems that most online accounting software will do this by default   here is an example in     here is an example in xero   seems they both display information on when you can expect payment on the their respective    in the desktop version of quickbooks which i use a lot it will not show the balance of the customer by default on an invoice   you will have to modify the invoice template   there are more details on that here   in desktop version of quickbooks you can look at cash flow forecast report to see the expected amount coming in    i hope that helps and good luck

the pure numbers answer says you want the refund to be close to $ 0   you can even argue as some answers have that you want to try to maximize the payment without receiving any sanctions for underpaying during the year if you trace the money it 's easy to see why   let 's say you get a paycheck   tag some of the dollars for uncle sam   these are the dollars that eventually will be given to the irs   now consider the following scenarios from the raw numbers like this its clear that you lose utility by setting yourself up for a large refund check   the money was yours the entire time but you chose to give it to uncle sam instead however the raw numbers are only part of the puzzle   if you 're a cold numbers person they 're the part that matters   when the are playing their tax evasion games this is the only thing they are paying attention to   however real humans have a few psychological reasons they may choose to lose utility in terms of raw dollars in exchange for psychological assistance these attitudes exist and may be ideal for any one person   obviously the financially savvy answer of minimize your refund is the ideal answer from a dollars and cents perspective but its up to you to see whether that attitude is right when you account for all of the non measurable things like stress   in general i would lead anyone to minimize your refund but i would be if i did n't include the very real psychological reasons people choose to deviate from it

in the united states the general policy is that the irs would consider it income when you have access to the money i work for a company that has a contract with another company near the end of the year i turn in a time card that has my hours that i worked as of that date because they do n't pay me until early january the money on the check is counted in the new year i could n't touch the money until they issued the check if they had paid me on december 31st it would have counted as the old year even if i only had a short window to have access to it before the year ended it would even count as old year money if i held on to the december check but did n't deposit it until march so it would become income when you could use it so if you could access it via a check or debit card or transfer it to the bank it is now income of course that is in the united states you would need to see what the situation is in singapore the edge cases always depend on the country

sensitive topic inflation is a consequence of the mismatch between supply and demand   in an ideal world the amount of goods available would exactly match the demand for those goods    we do n't live in an ideal world one example of oversupply is dollar stores where you can buy from companies that demand   most recently we 've seen wheat prices rise as fires outside moscow damaged the harvest and the russian government banned exports and that introduces the danger of inflation inflation is a signal like the pain you feel after an injury   if you simply took a you may completely ignore a broken leg until took your life governments sometimes ban inflation by fixing prices   both the and venezuelan governments have tried this recently   the consequence of that is goods become unavailable as producers refuse to create supply for less than the cost of production as pointed out governments do desperately want to avoid deflation as much as they want to avoid hyperinflation there is a correct level and that has resulted in the monetary policy called inflation where central banks attempt to manage inflation into a target range usually around 2 to 6 the reason is simply that limited inflation drives investment and consumption   with a guaranteed return on investment people with cash will lend it to people with ideas   consumers will buy goods today if they fear that the price will rise tomorrow if prices fall as they have done during the two decades of deflation in japan then the result is lower levels of investment and employment as companies cut production capacity   if prices rise to quickly as in zimbabwe and venezuela then people can not save enough or earn enough and so their wealth is drained away add to this the continual process of innovation and you see how difficult it is to manage inflation at all   innovation can result in increased efficiency which can reduce prices   it can also result in a new product which is sufficiently unique to allow predatory pricing the apple iphone new types of medicines and so on the best mechanism we have for figuring out where money should be invested and who is the best recipient of any good is the price mechanism   inflation is the signal that investors need to learn how best to manage their efforts we hide from it at our peril

i disagree   employee pay has always been a budgetary line item to large business owners   that 's just the way it is   much of the reason for the decrease in the percent of revenue going to employees is because companies nowadays do n't need to hire as many people   technology has reduced the number of employees most industries require while still maintaining or boosting productivity   i think a more fair way of looking at these figures would be to look at the sum of both employee pay and capital expenses as a percent of revenue

my advice to you act like responsible adults and owe up to your financial commitments   when you bought your house and took out a loan from the bank you made an agreement to pay it back if you breach this agreement you deserve to have your credit score trashed   what do you think will happen to the $ 100k+ if you decide to stiff the bank the bank will make up for its loss by increasing the mortgage rates for others that are taking out loans so responsible borrowers get to subsidize those that their responsibilities if you were in a true hardship situation i would be inclined to take a different stance but as you 've indicated you are perfectly able to make the payments you just do n't feel like it real estate fluctuates in value just like any other asset if a stock i bought drops in value does the government come and bail me out of course not what i find most problematic about your plan is that not only do you wish to breach your agreement but you are also looking for ways to conceal your breach please think about this best of luck with your decision

i think it 's easiest to illustrate it with an example if you 've already read any of the definitions out there then you know what it means but just do n't understand what it means   so we have an ice cream shop we started it as partners and now you and i each own 50 of the company it 's doing so well that we decide to take it public   that means that we will be giving up some of our ownership in return for a chance to own a smaller portion of a bigger thing with the money that we raise from selling stocks we 're going to open up two more stores   so without getting into too much of the nitty gritty accounting that would turn this into a valuation question let 's say we are going to put 30 of the company up for sale with these stocks leaving you and me with 35 each we file with the sec saying we 're splitting up the company ownership with 100,000 shares and so you and i each have 35,000 shares and we sell 30,000 to investors   then and this depends on the state in the us where you 're registering your publicly traded corporation those shares must be assigned a par value that a shareholder can redeem the shares at many corporations will use $ 1 or 10 cents or something nominal   and we go and find investors who will actually pay us $ 5 per share for our ice cream shop business we receive $ 150,000 in new capital but when we record that in our accounting $ 5 in total capital per share was contributed by investors to the business and is recorded as shareholder 's equity $ 1 per share totalling $ 30,000 goes towards actual shares outstanding and $ 4 per share totalling $ 120,000 goes towards capital surplus   these amounts will not change unless we issue new stocks the share prices on the open market can fluctuate but we rarely would adjust these edit i could n't see the table before dumbcoder has already pointed out the equation capital surplus = stock par value + premium per share number of shares based on my example it 's easy to deduce what happened in the case you 've given in the table in 2009 your company xyz had outstanding common stock issued for $ that 's probably a in thousands and b at a par value of $ 1 per share on those assumptions we can say that the company has shares outstanding for year end 2009   then if we guess that 's the outstanding shares we can also calculate the implicit average premium per share ÷ = = $ note that this is the average premium per share because we do n't know when the different stocks were issued at and it may be that the premiums that investors paid were different frankly we do n't care   so clearly since common stock in 2010 is up to $ it means that the company released more stock someone else can chime in on whether that means it was specifically a stock split or some other mechanism it does n't matter for understanding this you just need to know that the company put more stock into the marketplace = = more shares to be exact with the mechanics of rounding to the thousands i would guess this was a stock split   now what you can also see is that the capital surplus also increased = = the shares were issued into the market at an average premium of ÷ = = $ so investors probably paid or were given by the company an average of $ at this split   then in 2011 the company had another small adjustment to its shares outstanding the common stock went up and there was a corresponding increase in its capital surplus   without details around the actual stock volumes it 's hard to get more exact you 're also only giving us a portion of the balance sheet for your company so it 's hard to go into too much more detail hopefully this answers your question though

the issue is should you get one large policy or several smaller policies multiple polices have flexibility becasue if the need goes away you can drop the policy the problem with multiple small policies is that there is overhead that you pay for multiple times assume that you want 100 k coverage and are age x. that policy will cost you a certain amount based on a base amount plus a percentage of the coverage the percentage is based on age sex smoking health if you double the coverage the price does n't double becasue the base amount is constant this base amount covers the cost of setting up your policy and maintaining the records and billing   keep in mind that the coverage you are asking about is not the mortgage insurance the lender makes you purchase when you have a small down payment you are asking about a policy to cover your debts and still provide money for survivors go with your current agent company and ask them to run the numbers new additional policy increasing amount of current policy go with what meets your needs buying a house is one of those life events where you should review your insurance and retirement needs and adjust accordingly

i would n't like to say either way what you should do not being an financial advisor or lawyer but i did find an interesting article on walk away from your mortgage   that you might also find helpful to frame your decision it has some interesting information on defaults it says this mortgage holders do sign a promissory note which is a promise to pay but the contract explicitly details the penalty for nonpayment surrender of the property the borrower is n’t escaping the consequences he is suffering them in some states lenders also have recourse to the assets like their car and savings accounts a study by the federal reserve bank of richmond found that defaults are lower in such states apparently because lenders threaten the borrowers with judgments against their assets but actual lawsuits are rare and given that nearly a quarter of mortgages are underwater and that 10 percent of mortgages are delinquent white of the university of arizona is surprised that more people have n’t walked he thinks the desire to avoid shame is a factor as are overblown fears of harm to credit ratings probably homeowners also labor under a delusion that their homes will quickly return to value white has argued that the government should stop default scare stories and indeed should encourage borrowers to default when it ’s in their economic interest this would correct a prevailing imbalance homeowners operate under a powerful moral constraint while lenders are trying to maximize profits more important it might get the system if lenders feared an avalanche of strategic defaults they would have an incentive to renegotiate loan terms in theory this could produce a wave of loan modifications the very goal the treasury has been pursuing to end the crisis

it 's probably important to understand what a credit score is    a credit score is your history of accruing debt and paying it back   it is supplemented by your age time at current residence time at previous residences time at your job etc a person with zero debt history can still have a decent score provided they are well established a little older and have a good job   the top scores are reserved for those that manage what creditors consider an appropriate amount of debt and are well established   in other words you 're good with money and likely have long term roots in the community   after all creditors do n't normally like being the first one you try out being young and having recently moved you are basically a flight risk   meaning someone who is more likely to just pick up and move when the debt becomes too much so you have a couple options   the first is to simply wait   keep going to work keep living where you are etc   as you establish yourself you become less of a risk    the second is to start incurring debt   personally i am not a fan of this one   some people do well by getting a small credit card using some portion of it each month and paying it off immediately   others do n't know how to control that very well and end up having a few months where they roll balances over etc which becomes a trap that costs them far more than before if i were in your position i 'd likely do one of two things   either buy the phone outright and sign up for a regular mobile plan or take the cheaper phone for a couple years

so my read on the question is how do i invest 300k such that it earns me a living wage without the ongoing grind inherent in most formal employment   reading the other answers to date it looks like most of them are thinking in terms of investment accounts and trying to live off of the earnings from such   i wanted to throw out a couple of alternative choices that may be worth considering the first is real estate investing   $ 300k should allow you to pick up 2 or 3 single family with little or no mortgage   turning them into rentals placed with a good property management company should easily pay their expenses and provide a consistent income with minimal effort attention from you   similar story with buying into multifamily housing or commercial real estate your key concern here is picking the right market in which to buy and finding a reputable manager to handle the day to day issues on your behalf note that you are not overly concerned with the potential resale value of the but the probable rental income they can generate these are separate concerns that may not align with each other second is buying founding a business that has a general manager other than yourself   franchise ownership may be a potential option for you under the circumstances   the key concern here is picking the business location and manager that make you comfortable in terms of the risk involved   you need the place to make enough money to pay for itself and the salary of everyone working there with enough left over for you to live on   sounds easy enough but not so much in practice   generally you can expect at least a few years of being hands on and watching things very closely to make sure it is going the way you want it to   finding a mentor who has done this type of transition before to walk you through it would be strongly advised   so would preparing yourself for a failure or two before you work out the exact combination of factors that work for you

generally etfs work on the basis that there exists a pair of values that can be taken at any moment in time a net asset value of each share in the fund and a trading market price of each share in the fund   it may help to picture these in baskets of about 50,000 shares for the creation redemption process if the nav is greater than the market price then arbitrageurs will buy up shares at the market price and do an in kind transaction that will be worth the nav value that the arbitrageurs could turn around and sell for an immediate profit if the market price is greater than the nav then the arbitrageurs will buy up the underlying securities that can be exchanged in kind for shares in the fund that can then be sold on the market for an immediate profit what is the etf creation redemption mechanism would be a source on this though i imagine there are others now in the case of vxx there is something to be said for how much trading is being done and what impact this can have from a july 8 2013 yahoo finance article at big option trade in the s&p 500 vix short term futures note    is looking for another jump in volatility   more than 250,000 vxx options have already traded twice its daily    average over the last month systems show that a trader    bought august 26 calls for the ask price of $ in volume    that was 6 times the strike 's previous open interest clearly    indicating new activity now the total returns of the etf are a combination of changes in share price plus what happens with the distributions which could be held as cash or reinvested to purchase more shares

it may or may not be a good idea to borrow money from your family there are many factors to consider here not the least of which is what you would do if you got in serious financial trouble and could n't make your scheduled payments on the loan would you arrange with them to sell the property asap or could they easily manage for a few months without your scheduled payments if it were necessary a good rule of thumb that some people follow when lending to family is this do n't do it unless you 're 100 ok with the possibility that they might not pay you back at all that said your question was about credit scores specifically having a mortgage and making on time payments would factor into your score but not significantly more heavily than having revolving credit eg a credit card and making on time payments or having a car loan or installment loan and making on time payments i bought my house in 2011 and after years of paying the mortgage on time my credit score has n't changed at all myfico has a breakdown of factors affecting your credit score here the most significant are a history of on time payments low revolving credit utilization carrying a $ 4900 balance on a card with a $ 5000 limit is bad carrying a $ 10 balance on the same card is good and overall length of your credit history as to credit mix they have this to say types of credit in use credit mix determines 10 of my fico score the fico ® score will consider your mix of credit cards retail accounts installment loans finance company accounts and mortgage loans it 's not necessary to have one of each and it 's not a good idea to open credit accounts you do n’t intend to use the credit mix usually wo n’t be a key factor in determining your fico score but it will be more important if your credit report does not have a lot of other information on which to base a score have credit cards but manage them responsibly having credit cards and installment loans with a good payment history will raise your fico score people with no credit cards tend to be viewed as a higher risk than people who have managed credit cards responsibly

if you buy a long term bond with long term fixed interest rate and then the interest rates increase your bond is worth less that 's not a problem because over the years the value of the bond will go back to its nominal value if you have a bond that does n't pay out annually but increases its value every year you will get exactly the amount of cash when it pays out that you expected   the problem is that if for 20 years interest rates were 8 while your bond only paid 4 then you will have such an amount of inflation that the cash you get is worth much less than you hoped you may have hoped that your bond would be worth one year average salary but it may be only worth six months of average salary even if the dollar amount is exactly what you expected

my understanding is that when you die the stocks are sold and then    the money is given to the beneficiary or the stock is repurchased in    the beneficiaries name this is wrong and the conclusion you draw from michael 's otherwise correct answer follows your false assumption   you seem to understand the estate tax federal threshold jersey would have its own and i have no idea how it works there if the decedent happened to trade in the tax year prior to passing normal tax rules apply   now if the executor chooses to sell off and liquidate the estate to cash there 's no further taxable gain a $ 5 m portfolio can have millions in long term gain but the step up basis pretty much negates all of it   if that 's the case the beneficiaries are n't likely to repurchase those shares in fact they might not even know what the list of stocks was unless they through the asset list but that sale was unnecessary assets can be up and distributed in kind each beneficiary getting their fraction of the number of shares of each stock and then your share of the $ 5 m has a stepped up basis meaning if you sell that day your gains are near zero you might owe a few dollars for whatever the share move in the time passing between the step up date and date you sell   i hope that clarifies your misunderstanding   by the way the irs is just an intermediary it 's congress that writes the laws including the tangled web of tax code the irs is the moral equivalent of a great customer service team working for a company we do n't care for

the tried and true policy would be government spending and not just any government spending but one with positive feedback on the whole economy such as specific subsidized industry or high tech projects most likely wind solar high efficiency and hybrid cars etc   and this includes something like addition education in fields that are needed     instead we give money to banks tax breaks for the already wealthy and then deregulate finance when the problem seemed to stem from deregulation and non enforcement   if we do n't hit a bigger bottom in 1 5 years i 'd eat my shorts

if this was going on in the uk i would try to get a mental capacity assessment done on the father there are laws that stop you taking advantage of people that do n’t understand what is going on these laws could be used against the manager but only if you can clearly prove that the father does not understand that the business is losing money if the father does understand what is going on then there is nothing you can do as he has every right to waste his money and anyone that may inherit what is left has no rights until he is dead

thank you very much for your reply    i 'll look more into the cfa but i have a question does it require an undergrad degree in finance accounting to become licensed if you pass obviously that 's an area that i need to do more research but a great place to start based on your suggestions    if i take it in december i 'll be 5 months from my masters in that case it makes more sense to complete the masters because quitting that close to the end really throws a lot away i know counseling is n't specific to the field but people skills seem to be the cornerstone of every career    thank you again for taking the time to respond i feel like a small fish in a big pond the earning potential is shiny but i 'm more interested in a career that is not as emotionally taxing and that to my skill set critical thinking and love for evaluating speculating problem solving

one thing to consider the apple service plan covers replacement of the battery in addition to the normal things you expect   since the is not consumer replaceable and according to what i hear is almost certain to wear out within the two year life of the phone and is more expensive to have apple replace than the extended coverage it 's probably worth it   disclaimer this was told to me by my son who used an iphone for two years before i got mine   i have n't independently verifies his facts this also applied to the 3 g and i 'm just assuming it 's also true for the 4

it 's called a pyramid scheme its illegal in almost every country of the western world you 're not going to earn lifetime income of course and these things collapse pretty quickly most of the common folks do n't return the investment its the organizers who take the money sometimes they run most times they end up in jail the way these schemes work is that they pay the early investors from the fees paid by new investors as long as a steady stream of new people keep signing up and paying into it those who got in very early make money the idea is based on the geometric of each new person signing up two or more people and those people doing the same pretty quickly at that rate you need to sign up every human being on the planet to keep the new money flowing in to make it work which obviously is not realistic ultimately a small of the people if they can stay out of jail will make a big amount of money the vast majority of investors get stiffed

costco requires an annual paid membership before you can enter and the the minimum price of any purchase is greater than at other stores because you are getting large bulk of that item   starbucks charges several dollars for a cup of coffee not an essential item   in both cases their clientele are the middle classes not the less well off members of society   consequently it makes business sense for them to pay staff such that are they are substantially similar to the customers   but walmart does serve the less well off   and their management is n't stupid if they believed a doubling of wages would result in greater sales and profitability they would do it in an heartbeat   but it wo n't   and i 'll bet walmart 's customers and employees are as similar to each other as costco 's customers and employees are to each other     walmart 's effects on prices is well   every cent they save customers is a cent those customers can put towards other things or prolong how long a particular amount of money will last   there are numerous claims about them lowering the effects wal mart   so changing nothing else increasing employee wages would decrease customer savings   we could make the cost of living for employees be less by reducing the costs of housing rather than every time house prices go up   and if you believe everyone should have healthcare then ensure everyone has it   if you believe it should be provided via employers along with a bizarre insurance industry a rather peculiar then just make that mandatory in the law   and finally for all the who believe it can be done better go ahead and do so   it is always easier to advocate how and what others should do if walmart are getting it so wrong then show everyone the right way

gold has value because for the most of the history of mankind 's use of money gold and silver have repeatedly been chosen by free markets as the best form of money gold is durable portable homogeneous fungible divisible rare and recognizable    until 1971 most of the world 's currencies were backed by gold   in 1971 the us government defaulted on its obligation to redeem us dollars by which most other currencies were backed in gold as agreed to by the bretton woods agreement of 1944   we did n't choose to go off the gold standard we had no choice foreign central banks were demanding in gold and the us did n't have enough we inflated too much    i think that the current swell of interest in gold is due to the recent massive increase in the federal reserve 's balance sheet plus the fast growing national debt plus a looming social security medicare crisis   people are looking for protection of their savings and they wish to opt out of the government bail outs government deficits government run health care and government money printing   they are looking for a currency that does n't have a counter party gold is money and nothing else jp morgan in the absence of the gold standard there is no way to protect savings from confiscation through inflation there is no safe store of value if there were the government would have to make its holding illegal as was done in the case of gold if everyone decided for example to convert all his bank deposits to silver or copper or any other good and thereafter declined to accept checks as payment for goods bank deposits would lose their purchasing power and government created bank credit would be worthless as a claim on goods the financial policy of the welfare state requires that there be no way for the owners of wealth to protect themselves this is the shabby secret of the welfare statists against gold deficit spending is simply a scheme for the confiscation of wealth gold stands in the way of this insidious process it stands as a protector of property rights if one this one has no difficulty in understanding the statists toward the gold standard alan greenspan

math the half match is 3 or $ 3900 after 5 years $   if you stay you are vested and have $ 20 k i hope it 's actually far more extra for you it 's like 2 month 's salary bonus after 5 years   if you leave early the good news is that even if the expenses within the plan were n't great you have the money you put in along with what vested so far you move that to an ira and choose your own thrifty funds or etfs   for me as duff said there 's no one answer so to be clear this is my feeling or preference not gospel 6 is far too little to save as a percent of my income so if the 401(k fees ran say .8 or higher i 'd put in the 6 to get the potential match and then save on the side   our answers might change slightly depending on the exact fees you 're exposed to

this is the best tl;dr i could make myth of the skills reduced by 95 i 'm a bot gt the basic strategy is to ask what skills do employers demand and do the employers that demand high skill levels have trouble hiring workers   gt the data imply that we should be careful about calling for more technical skills without specifying which skills we are talking about   gt proponents of the skill gap theory sometimes assert that the problem if not a lack of stem skills is actually the result of a poor attitude or inadequate soft skills among younger workers    extended summary**](http://np.reddit.com r autotldr | faq](http://np.reddit.com r autotldr comments/31b9fm faq_autotldr_bot/ version 1.65 tl;drs so far | feedback](http://np.reddit.com message compose?to=%23autotldr pm 's and comments are monitored constructive feedback is welcome | top keywords work**^#2 more**^#3

hsbc also known as the hong kong and shanghai banking corporation has banks in india i would imagine that might be a place to start    paypal which is commonly used to pay for items on ebay is also available in both india and china    you should of course respect any laws regulating this kind of money transfer

technically you should take the quarterly dividend yield as a fraction add one take the cube root and subtract one and then multiple by the stock price if you want a dollar amount per share rather than a rate   this is to account for the fact that you could have re invested the monthly dividends and earned dividends on that reinvestment however the difference between this and just dividing by three is going to be negligible over the range of dividend rates that are realistically paid out by ordinary stocks

other than the guaranteed 5 bonus assuming you sell it right away no benefits keep in mind that the price from which the discount is calculated is not necessarily the market price at the date of the espp purchase so the actual discount may be more than 5 depending on the volatility of the stock much more

i 'm of your position    i reckon that people who put crazy long hours into a business that fails are lacking some intangible qualities of entrepreneurship   there are people you can just tell they do n't have what it takes they 're putting in loads of commitment or loads of money into an idea that just is n't right or they spend money in the wrong ways you know how all these internet companies spent money on champagne and $ 1000 chairs during the dot com bubble i 've seen the small scale version of that as people rent expensive offices when i 'm thinking why are n't you just working from home    as a small time entrepreneur i 'm obviously biased but if you 've got what it takes so i think there is an element of here and you work hard then you will succeed to some greater or lesser extent   i mean i know electricians and builders that have started their own contracting or supplies businesses they 're not rich by the standard of but they have a bloody nice house and a bloody nice car in the driveway and they probably take an afternoon a week off to play golf they 're doing better than most of the other guys they worked with as electricians or builders 20 years ago and i do n't see that they 're really doing anything too clever or sophisticated    also the classic figure of 9/10 businesses failed failed here is a very dramatic word implying that the entrepreneur lost his or her shirt often it 's not a case that the business lost them money they pissed away thousands on rent or wages or misplaced marketing but more that it made a bit of money but not enough so they moved on to something else that something else might be regular employment for some people but there are plenty of entrepreneurs perhaps some of the greatest and most famous ones who have gone on from one failure to a much bigger success
