thanks for your reply i think a lot of people are confused when talking about ownership and i think it is a issue    when a company issues stock the first time or anytime what they are doing is selling the right to a percentage of the dividend they are not actually selling parts of the company to you everyone thinks this way though and that has to do with the chicago school economists who perpetuated their ideas of ownership which is what everyone know thinks is the case this way of thinking about corporations and ownership is just wrong not ethically just erroneous    as i stated before of cornell university explains this really well i would encourage anyone to read more about it

the policy you quoted suggests you deposit 6 minimum that $ 6,000 will cost you $ 4,500 due to the tax effect yet after the match you 'll have $ 9,000 in the account taxable on withdrawal but a great boost to the account   the question of where is less clear there must be more than the 2 choices you mention most plans have too many choices this into my focus on expenses a few years back pbs frontline aired a program titled the retirement gamble in which fund expenses were discussed with a focus on how an extra 1 in expenses will wipe out an extra 1/3 of your wealth in a 40 year period very simple to illustrate this go to a calculator and enter .99 raised to the power of 40 is the result my 401(k has an expense of .02 that 's of 1 raised to the same 40 gives in other words a cost of .8 over the full 40 years my wife and i are just retired and will have less in expenses for the rest of our lives than the average account cost for just 1 year   in your situation the knee jerk reaction is to tell you to maximize the 401(k deposit at the current 2016 $ 18,000 that might be appropriate but i 'd suggest you look at the expense of the s&p index sometime called large cap fund but see the prospectus and if it 's costing much more than i 'd go with an ira roth if you ca n't deduct the traditional ira much of the value of the 401(k beyond the match is the tax differential i.e. depositing while in the 25 bracket but withdrawing the funds at retirement hopefully at 15 it does n't take long for the extra expense and the holy cow my 401(k just turned decades of dividends and long term cap gains into ordinary income effect to take over understand this now not 30 years hence   last to answer your question how much i often recommend what may seem a cliche continue to live like a student half the country lives on $ 54 k or less there 's certainly a wide gray area but in general a person starting out will choose one of 2 paths living just at or even above his means or living way below and saving say 30 40 off the top even 30 does n't hit the extreme saver level if you do this you 'll find that if when you get married buy a house have kids etc you 'll still be able to save a reasonable percent of your income toward retirement   in response to your comment what counts as retirement savings there 's a concept used as part of the budgeting process known as the envelope system for those who have an income where there 's little discretionary money left over each month the method of putting money aside into small buckets is a great idea in your case say you take me up on the 30 40 challenge 15 of it goes to a hard and fast retirement account the rest to savings according to the general order of emergency fund 6 12 months expenses to cover a job loss another fund for random expenses such as new transmission i 've never needed one but i hear they are expensive and then the bucket towards house down payment keep in mind i have no idea where you live or what a reasonable house would cost regardless a 20 25 downpayment on even a $ 250 k house is $ that will take some time to save up if the housing in your area is more bump it accordingly   if the savings starts to grow beyond any short term needs it gets invested towards the long term and is treated as retirement money there is no such thing as saving too much when i turned 50 and was let go from a 30 year job i was n't unhappy that i saved too much and could call it quits that day had i been saving just right i 'd have been 10 years shy of my target

largely it comes down to the complexity of your return likely relatively simple if it 's your first time filing and your comfort level with using software more complex returns would include filing business claims handling stocks and investments special return forms etc   one benefit to most of the software options out there such as turbotax hr block and tax are that they are free to use and you only pay when you 're ready to file you could give them a shot to see how easy difficult they are and if you feel overwhelmed then contact a cpa whose time wo n't be free also remember that those hr block seasonal places that open up are not cpa 's but are temps hired and trained to use the software that you would find online you did n't indicate they were an option but i like to point that out to those who might not know otherwise   my opinion would be to use one of the online options because of cost and their ease of use they also allow you to take your time and save your progress so you can start using it and go ask questions do research on your own time

i have a capitalone credit card and every two or three weeks capitalone bank sends me checks that can be used almost anywhere including a deposit into my own checking account if i wish or to pay taxes or utility bills etc the amount thus borrowed is counted as a balance transfer as if i   were paying off another credit card balance and it will be charged 0 interest for a year   the catch is that unless i pay off the next monthly statement in full by the due date i will be charged interest on all new purchases from the day that they post to the account till the day they are paid off no more grace period etc   all this will continue until that loan amount is paid off in full   so i either would have to i pay off all the purchases made this month plus the minimum monthly payment shown on the next monthly statement and give up use of the card till that 0 balance is all repaid or ii pay interest on new purchases    it might be worth checking on the capitalone credit card site if such an offer is available to you   if so get a check from them pay off the invoice using that check actually i would strongly recommend depositing the money in your local bank and writing them your personal check for the amount to be paid and then pay off next month 's bill in full etc

the only really good reason to open a line of credit is that you want to buy something that you do n't have money for that 's got its own risks see plenty of other places to see warnings about not borrowing too much the only other reason is that you might want to use a line of credit as your emergency fund the usual way of doing this is to keep the money in an easily savings account but such accounts usually pay rather now interest and there is an argument for instead investing your emergency money in a higher interest but less accessible fund and using a line of credit to tide you over until you can extract the money i 'm worried about the comment that you can deduct my interest on my tax returns that is usually only possible if you are borrowing money to invest it sounds as if your banker is going to persuade you to not only open a line of credit but then invest that money in something be aware that this kind of leveraging is much higher risk than investing money you already own

the answer is simple you can generally claim a deduction for an expense if that expense was used to derive an income of course social policy sometimes gets in the way and allows for deductions where they usually would n't be allowed your rent is not tax deductible because this expense is not used to derive your income if however you were working from your home example you had a home based business and you dedicated a part of your home for your work say an office then part of your rent may then become tax deductible

typically businesses always charge their home currency so if the shop is in canada you will pay canadian dollars normally you do n't have any choices either your credit card company will convert it to your currency using the current international currency exchange rate pretty good plus a potential fee between 0 and 5 depending on your credit card not so good if it is a significant amount or you plan to do that more than once and if you have multiple credit cards check first to see which one has the lowest international fee 0 is not uncommon but neither is 3 or 4 if it 's a 10 $ it 's probably not worth the time but 4 of 1000 is already 40 $ as of right now the currency exchange rate is 1.33 so you would pay usd plus the potential fee 0 $ understand that this exchange rate is floating continuously it probably wo n't change much but it will change

i 've read multiple times that the way to rebuild the credit score is to get a credit card and then have some minor charges on it every month and have them paid in full every month old negative events age and this disciplined activity rebuild the score to some not to horrible levels now it 's true that it 's hard to get reasonably good credit cards when your credit score is poor yet it 's not necessary to have a good credit card for this case such things as large credit limit are not needed all that 's needed is a long grace period so that there 's no interest between the moment a charge is done and a moment the bill is paid in full at the end of the month yes the card may have rather high interest and rather low credit limit but it does n't really matter i 've read once on msn money that people are offered credit even while they 're in the middle of bankruptcy so it 's not impossible to get a credit card in the described situation goes without saying that a lot of discipline will be needed to have all this implemented

honestly the best way to manage this risk is to manage your savings appropriately many experts recommend that maintain a reasonably liquid account with 6 your minimum monthly expenses for just this occurrence i know easier said than done right as for insurance i can only speak for what is the case in the us here most mortgages will require you to get pmi insurance until you have at least 20 equity in your house however that insurance only protects the bank from losing money if you ca n't pay it does n't save you from foreclosure or ruining your credit   really the type of insurance you are talking about is unemployment insurance which all states in the us make available to workers via deductions from their paycheck   the best advice i suppose is to keep your expenses low enough to cover them with an unemployment check until you have accumulated enough savings to get through a rough patch that may mean buying a less expensive home or just waiting until you have saved a bigger down payment if you did n't plan ahead and you are already in the house another option might be to extend your mortgage for example from a 20 to a 30 year to reduce your payments to a manageable level a more risky option might be to convert to a variable rate loan temporarily which typically carries a lower interest rate however it might be hard to secure a new loan if you do n't currently have an income

keep in mind that unless you have a contract that says you get a certain amount of raise every year the employer is not required to give you any raise the quality of a raise is too subjective for anyone to tell you how to judge it   you either get a raise you can live with it makes you content happy and you continue working there or you get a raise that does not satisfy you and you jump ship to get more money some most employers know that raises can be the tipping point for employees deciding to leave   if you consistently receive raises greater than inflation rate the message is that the employer values you   if the opposite they value you enough to continue your employment but are willing to replace you if you decide to leave key thing here is there are three ways of getting increased pay with your current employer   cost of living or annual raise is the one that we are discussing   merit based raises are a second way   if you think you deserve a raise due to loyal consistent contribution or contributing above your duty or for whatever reason then ask for a raise   the third way is to be promoted or transferred to a higher paying position   often times you should also make your case to your supervisor why you should have the new position similar to asking for a merit raise

what are my options for raising the funds assuming you have decent credit you can either mortgage your home or apply for a land loan in order to purchase the land since both your home and the land have value either one can act as collateral in case you default on your loan land loans tend to have a higher interest rate and down payment however this is because banks see land loans as a riskier investment since it 's easier for you to walk away from an empty plot of land than your own home

here 's my crude reasoning let 's say you have just one recently acquired credit card with a $ 5000 limit the company that issued the credit card set the $ 5000 limit based on however they assessed your risk now if you 're using a significant portion of of the $ 5000 limit it means at least for them that you are stretching your wallet even if you 've been paying monthly consistently and since you are heavily using your limit it also means that if you lose your primary source of money for even one month income etc then your risk to the lender increases sharply had you been making more money compared to this $ 5000 limit then either you 'd have used less of your available credit or you would've gotten your limits raised by asking your bank to re evaluate your risk and increase the limit also your statement why is a us credit score based on credit utilization is slightly incorrect as per fico credit utilization has 35 weight while your payment history has a weight of 35 to sum it up we can debate if the weight for credit utilization should be higher or lower but unfortunately as others have pointed out these scores are meant to help lenders not consumers so whether we like it or not the secret algorithms to calculate the scores and the actual weights variables and rules they use are completely out of our hands

in theory yes it makes sense to sell your current bonds in pursuit of higher yields in practice there are a lot of smart people out there who own bonds and the market is very efficient so you wo n't see opportunities to trade new bonds for old bonds with better yields from the same issuer if you do find someone willing to buy your old bond for a higher amount it probably points to a change in the contract that the new bonds were issued under see argentina for an example

according to your post you bought seven shares of at $ each on august 23rd   you paid €   now on august 25th is worth $   so you have   but you want to know what you have in eur not usd   so if i ask google how much $ is in eur it says €   that 's even lower than what you 're seeing    it looks like usd has fallen in value relative to eur   so while the stock price has increased in dollar terms it has fallen in euro terms   as a result the value that you would get in euros if you sold the stock has fallen from the price that you paid    another way of thinking about this is that your price per share was € and is now €   that 's actually a small drop    when you buy and sell in a different currency that you do n't actually want you add the currency risk to your normal risk   maybe that 's what you want to do   or maybe you would be better off sticking to euro denominated investments    usually you 'd do dollar denominated investments if some of your spending was in dollars   then if the dollar goes up relative to the euro your investment goes up with it   so you can cash out and make your purchases in dollars without adding extra money    if you make all your purchases in euros i would normally recommend that you stick to euro denominated investments   the underlying asset might be in the us but your fund could still be in europe and list in euros    that 's not to say that you ca n't buy dollar denominated investments with euros   clearly you can   it 's just that it adds currency risk to the other risks of the investment   unless you deliberately want to bet that usd will rise relative to eur you might not want to do that    note that usd may rise over the weekend and put you back in the black   for that matter even if usd continues to fall relative to the eur the security might rise more than that   i have no opinion on the value of   i do n't actually know what that is as it does n't matter for the points i was making   i 'm not saying to sell it immediately   i 'm saying that you might prefer euro denominated investments when you buy in the future   again unless you are taking this particular risk deliberately

i would just do a loan for a different number of years on your new mortgage for example if you just spent 10 years paying off your first house then for your second close the first mortgage upon selling and then open a 20 or 25 year mortgage and the loan end date as well as the payment should remain similar this would be more do able if you paid ahead a little to compensate all the early on interest you have to eat so if you want to finish around the same time you could look into doing that since you 'll have more equity to make a stronger down payment

i really like keshlam 's answer your age is also a consideration if you make your own target fund by matching the allocations of whatever vanguard offers i 'd suggest re balancing every year or every other year but if you 're just going to match the allocations of their target fund you might as well just invest in the target fund itself most not all just most target funds do not charge an additional management fee so you just pay the fees of the underlying funds same as if you mirrored the target fund yourself check the prospectus to see if an additional fee is charged or not you may want to consider a more aggressive approach than the target funds you can accomplish this by selecting a target fund later than your actual retirement age or by picking your own allocations the target funds become more conservative as you approach retirement age so selecting a later target is a way of moving the risk reward ratio i 'm not saying target funds are necessarily the best choice you should get professional advice etc etc

the hst is a sales tax levied on most goods and services it is important to realize that in both bc and ontario the new hst does not in most cases result in an increase in sales tax paid for example in ontario the pst is 8 and when combined with the gst the sales tax is 13 with the hst the gst and pst are replaced by a single hst of 13 so the tax bill does not change some services that were previously not subject to pst such as mutual fund service fees and labour will now be subject to the hst so some things will increase over time this should not have a material impact on the consumer due to the way businesses remit gst hst

a key principle of economics is sunk costs are irrelevant you bought the stock at 147 and it has now fallen to 144 that 's too bad this has nothing to do with whether it is wise or foolish to buy shares at 144 the only relevant thing to consider is do i expect the stock to go up or down from 144 you have lost $ 3 per share on the original buy buying more shares will not reduce your loss in any way suppose you bought 100 shares at 147 the price then drops to 144 you have lost $ 3 per share or $ 300 total you buy another 50 more shares at 144 the price stays at 144 so your average purchase price is now 147 x 100 + 144 x 50 150 = 146 so i guess you could say that your average loss per share is now only $ 2 but it 's $ 2 x 150 shares instead of $ 3 x 100 shares you still lost $ 300 you did n't reduce your loss by a penny maybe it made you feel better that you reduced your average loss per share but this is just an arithmetic game if you believe that the stock will continue to drop than buying more shares just means you will lose even more money your average loss per share may go down but you 're just multiplying that average by more and more shares of course if you believe that the stock is now at an low price and it will likely go back up then sure buy if you buy at 144 and it goes back up to 147 then you 'll be making $ 3 per share on the new shares you purchased but i repeat whether or not you buy more shares should have nothing to do with your previous buy buy more shares if you think the price will go up from the present price do n't buy more shares if you do n't think it will go up the decision should be exactly the same as if you had never previously bought shares i 'm assuming here that you are a typical small investor that you not buying enough shares to have any significant effect on the market nor that you are in a position to buy enough shares to take control of the company

to what end would you want to break the law why would you think it is beneficial to you in any way the reason for these limitations is to protect people who have no financial reserves and are not sophisticated investors from making dangerous and risky investments with the little money they have to invest you need to remember that there 's no guarantee of principal with these loans and the rate of default is pretty high from my own personal experience with lending club and i 've only invested in a and some b rated loans rate of default is about 10 this may be a nice exercise in but if you want to put all your savings into this you 're taking a huge risk risk which is completely unjustified since not only the returns are pretty low again from my aforementioned experience < 6 apr you take higher rate loans you get higher rate of defaults but they 're also taxed as ordinary gains why would you not instead invest in a more conservative bond or bond stock mix fund which will pay you dividends that will get preferential tax treatment and appreciation would be subject to capital gains tax no reason and the limitation on who can invest in lending club is there for exactly this purpose to weed out people like you who have no idea of what they 're doing

another thing that insurance companies try to do with these types of vehicles is to promote the cash value of the policy the longer you participate in the policy the more your cash value goes up assuming the investments perform reasonably well the selling point is that at any time you can take out part of that cash value without impacting your insurance policy a lot of people see that benefit as being the same as either putting the money in the bank or investing it when actually they could do better if they did either of those things themselves one true advantage of the whole term policy is that if you should fall on hard times and are not able to work the premium payments can be taken out of the cash value that way even if you ca n't make the monthly payments the insurance policy basically pays for itself i actually experienced this myself many years ago after i lost my job and had some health issues i was out of work a long time but my life insurance never lapsed that in itself made it worthwhile for me

before going into specific investments i think it would be a good idea to assess how free is that $ 5000 how much do you have to rely on it in emergency you always want to buy low and sell high however if you need to make unplanned withdraw from an investment you risk unfavorable market conditions at the time when you need the money and lose money that way one common suggestion is to keep 3 6 months living expense in checking saving very very liquid short term investments after that you can invest the rest in more profitable ventures   assuming that you are all set in that regard next consideration is whether you have any goal for the money besides generating the maximum return is this for retirement buying a house apartment a few year down the road graduate school emergency cash store for the time between graduation and getting a job or traveling a year in europe after graduation there are myriad of other possible goals knowing that you get a better idea of the time frame involved in the investment and what you need to do with your money if this is for retirement you just need to generate the highest possible return for 40 50 years while minimize taxes when you have to withdraw that money there are more nuanced concerns but large idea wise that 's what you need to do if you want it for a trip to an exotic location in 2 year then your primary goal will be to preserve the value of your capital while assessing whether you need to manage foreign exchange risk   the time frame also rule in or rule out certain types of investments if you are planning to use the money to purchase a house in 5 years iras probably would not be what you are looking for if you are planning to retirement short term cd would not be the most effective way after figuring out a bit of what you are trying to do with the money i think how you want to invest it will be much more clear to you in case of retirement people seem to generally recommend no load index funds and mid cap growth funds nothing is really off the table since your investment time frame is so long and you can tolerate risk you might also be interested to check out i have no relation with them a friend recommended it to me and i think their pitch make sense   in other cases it really is case dependent and there might have more than one solution to any case there is just one more potential investment venture that people you might not immediately thinking of and that might be of interest to you that is to use the $ 5000 as your own budget to build maintain connections with people and network use it to take professors out to a meal to pick their brain travel to keep in touch with old friends network with potential future employers and peers to improve job prospect or get opportunities to meet interesting people   i hope this helps

i do n't think anything will change as long as you can buy a politician in this country the get elected fulfill the promises only to those that contributed to their campaign and then go out to raise more money there is no way you can win their loyalty unless you give them their required blood money unless you 're a huge giver you wo n't get what you want one politician 's vote wo n't do anyone any good so you have to sway several of them which requires even more money    the one good thing about obama 's presidency was that america got to see how big of a these politician 's can be they claim to be the exact opposite of the incumbent before them then regardless of whether they are a dem or rep they continue with the exact or worse policies hopefully the voters of this country wise up and realize it 's not dems vs reps it 's haves vs have nots

no   in good years the income seems free in a down year particularly a bad one the investor will be subject to large losses that will prove the strategy a bad one   on the other hand one often hears of the strategy of selling puts on stock you would like to own if the stock rises you keep the premium if it drops you own it at a bit of a discount from that starting point

credit unions are structured such that the account holders are in fact the owners of the institution thus the money invested in your savings account is in fact a share of ownership and the interest paid to you is dividend tax wise these dividends are usually treated as interest income

i take it you have nearly zero expenses since you do n't mention any savings and with your income you would n't have much left over for investing at your level of income any actual investing is either going to unwisely reduce your cash available should you need it such as investment in mutual funds which often have minimum investment periods of 2 6 months or more to avoid fees or cost you a high percentage of your income in commissions stock trading so i would n't recommend investing at all yet i find dave ramsey 's baby steps to be very good general money management advice   here is how i would adapt the first three steps to your income and stage in life beyond this dave recommends saving for retirement college for kids and paying off your house early   these things are a little beyond your stage in life but it would be good to start thinking about them for you i recommend following 's advice to invest in yourself   specifically plan to get through college debt free   put away money so that you have a head start once you do have living expenses save for a car save money for rent etc so that you do n't have to live month to month as most people do starting out so what this boils down to put away every cent you have in a savings account

plenty of links around under the monetization heading however my understand came from a local app developer who 's done a number of presentations he 's been tweaking and trying to find new ways to develop his now quite successful app with the aim of earning enough that he does n't have to work doing databases   what he found was that ranking in app searches was dependent on downloads and revenues paid or ads were dependent on total installs therefore if you go the paid app way you do n't get the downloads to get placement on search returns so you do n't get downloads a negative spiral in addition it 's another barrier to get your potential user over thus you want free as the initial price   you can try the freemium route but it really depends on continued usage rate if people are to buy it in app then then need to regularly use it and it has to be designed this way but if you do this you can get regular ad revenue as well it might not be much but it adds up   hence his statement was to design to have high value ads built in to the way the app works and allow people to also pay to get rid or add new functionality

welcome to the 21st century the new order forget all that legal jumbo you may have read back in law school in the 1960s about commercial code its all gone now now we have check 21 and the patriot act basically what this means is that because some arab fanatics burned down the world trade center the us government and its allied civilian banking company now have total control and dictatorship over your money which is no longer really money but more like a credit to your account with them which they can do with what they want here are some of the many consequences of the two aforementioned acts 1 you can no longer sue a bank for mishandling your money 2 all your banking transaction information is the joint property of the bank its affiliates and the us treasury 3 you can no longer conduct private monetary transactions with other people using a bank as your agent you can only request that a bank execute an unsecured transaction on your behalf and the bank has total control over that transaction and the terms on which occurs you have no say over these terms and you can not sue a bank over any financial tort on you for any reason 4 all banks are required to spy on you report any suspicious actions on your part develop and run special software to detect these suspicious actions and send their employees to government run educational courses where they are taught to spy on customers how to report suspicious customers and how to seize money and safe deposit boxes from customers when the government orders them to do so 5 all banks are required to positively identify everyone who has a bank account or safe deposit box and report all their accounts to the government 6 no transactions can be done anonymously all parties to every banking transaction must be identified and recorded so from the above it should be clear to if you are a lawyer why no endorsement is present that is because your check is not a negotiable instrument anymore it is merely a request to the bank to transfer funds to the treasury the treasury does not need to endorse anything in fact legally speaking the treasury could simply order your bank to empty your account into theirs and they actually do this all the time to people they are investigating for supposed crimes you do n't need to endorse checks you receive either because as i said above the check is no longer a negotiable instrument banks still have people do it but it is just a pro forma habit from the old days since you ca n't sue the bank the endorsement is pretty meaningless because it can not be challenged in court anyway you could probably just write x there and they would deposit it

the values of 12 26 and 9 are the typical industry standard setting used with the macd however other values can be substituted depending on your trading style and goals the ema is considered the long moving average when in this case it is compared to the shorter ema if you used a ema and a ema then the ema would be considered the long ma it is based on what you are comparing it with apart from providing signals for a reversal in trend macd can also be used as an early indication to a possible end to a trend what you look out for is divergence between the price and the macd see chart below of an example   here i have used 3d and 1 for the signal as i did not want the signal to show up i am simply using the macd as a momentum indicator which work by providing higher highs in the macd with higher highs in price this shows that the momentum in the trend is good so the trend should continue however the last high in price is not met with a higher high in the macd the green lines demonstrate bearish divergence between price and the macd which is an indication that the momentum of the trend is slowing down this could provide that the trend may be about to end and to take caution i.e. not a good time to be buying this stock or if you already own it you may want to tighten up your stop loss

the original note should have had a a clear start and expiration date included with in it the term   if it did then the term has likely expired by now since you said it had been years and you should issue an amendment to the note that clarifies the new term and also clarifies the interest rate terms   if the original note did not have an expiration date then that would be unusual and your mom should work with her friend to execute a new note with clear start and expiration dates and that also clarifies the payment and interest terms   from my experience it is best to include a specific payment schedule within the note as well as very specific and clear terms around how interest will be handled in the event of a missed payment late payment or inability to pay the note off in full at expiration   there are many good examples available online to help you craft the appropriate verbiage for your specific needs

even though they 're only asking for 1/2 the money and have excellent credit that the mortgage company may not lend it to them if i 'm over priced yes if the house 's value as determined by the appraisal is less than the sale price the bank will not finance the loan appraisals and the appraisal process have become much tighter since the and freddie debacle this fact is true regardless of amounts or credit history though this is happens somewhat rarely typically if a seller and buyer agree to a price this price is a reasonable value after all that is nearly the definition of market value so yes it is true and always true for any financed purchase but that should n't really affect your decision if you try to sell for more than the appraisal you will just lower the price to the appraised amount

the cost of paying tax should be considered an additional financial expense and the administrative burden of filing those taxes should be considered an additional labour expense simplified your question is asking how to determine whether these additional expenses are worth it there are many ways to calculate what your time is worth consider two situations where you may consider picking up additional part time work at minimum wage 1   if you are working 80 hours a week at a stressful but high paying job working another 5 hours a week at minimum wage would likely not be worth your time both because you already make a lot of money and also because your time is limited and therefore precious   2 if you are working 20 hours a week at minimum wage then another 5 hours a week at the same job would likely be worth your time both because it would increase your income by 25 and also because it would not put a heavy strain on your light schedule   these two extreme examples highlight the inferred principle that i think generally applies to weigh such decisions competes with in your specific example the actual work component will happen regardless of the money aspect that is your wife will be providing these services regardless so your question is essentially would it be worth it for my wife to make $ 5k given that she would pay tax on that money and would bear the burden of the tax filings etc   we ca n't answer this directly because it relates to what your wife values if doing this would make the activity which is otherwise just a hobby an unwanted chore then it may not be worth the post tax income if doing this would not impact her enjoyment of the teaching but would add on an unwanted ~1 hour week of paperwork is it worth spending 50 hours over the course of the year to earn $ 5k i assume the answer then would be yes

let me start by giving you a of a report that will floor you beat the market investors lag the market by so much that many call the industry a scam    this is the 2015 year end data from a report titled analysis of investor behavior by a firm dalbar it boggles the mind that the disparity could be this bad a mix of stocks and bonds over 30 years should average 8.5 or so take out fees and even 7.5 would be the result i expect the average investor return was less than half of this jack bogle founder of vanguard and considered the father of the index fund was a i got from vanguard decades ago quoted fund managers as saying that indexing is a path to mediocrity fortunately i was a numbers guy read all i could that jack wrote and got most of that less .05 down to .02 over the years to answer the question psychology people are easily scammed as they want to believe they can beat the market or that they 'll somehow find a fund that does it for them i 'm tempted to say ignorance or some other hint at lack of intelligence but that would be unfair to the professionals all of which were scammed by madoff individual funds may not be scams but investors are partly to blame buy high sell low and you get the results above i dare say an investor claiming to use index funds might not fare much better than the 30 year return above if they follow that path buying high selling low edit i am adding this line to be clear my conclusion if any is that the huge disparity can not be attributed to management a 6.7 lag from the s&p return to what the average investor sees likely comes from bad trading to the comments by dave we have a manager that consistently beats the market over any 2 3 year period you have been with him 30 years and are clearly smiling about your relationship and investing decision yet he still has flows in and out people buy at the top when reading how good he is and selling right after a 30 drop even when he actually beat by dropping just 22 by getting in and out he has a set of clients with a 30 year record of 6 returns while you have just over 11 this paragraph speaks to the behavior of the investor not managed vs indexed

as a self employed handyman i can tell you this   any work that is done be it professional part time hobby or whatever else has to answer to two primary criteria   as you asked it has to be worthwhile in financial terms and more importantly in personal terms   in the long term charging low rates will her   not worth it someone once said i have no with he who charges cheaply because who better then he knows the value of his services   obviously one has to remain reasonable   then there is an factor in working for yourself   i call it losses since they are extremely difficult to calculate as noted above here already   in the first place they are extremely difficult to detect anyway   micro management will not tell you the losses you can only do it at the end of a period on a balance sheet   then you have to calculate a fair price in terms of lessons given and monies received the trick is to gain a fair assessment of worth to her without her needing to go into the books just as a simple gut feel   she needs to really feel good about it to maintain motivation for the future   otherwise i did it it does not work the other consideration is that when money changes hands it places a benchmark on the tuition and the relationship   one   it locks her into delivering professional work as she already is one   two   the students will be locked into giving fair and excellent commitment in being taught a simple calculation goes like this use the time span of a month as it is easier to break down available time per week   also remember that there will be extra hours spent in consultation with parents   this is a cost it has be calculated difficult at the start but keep track of it   one other thing   i do not give discounts of extend favours but i keep my prices reasonable i was told i am some 25 more expensive than the latest quotes but i kept on getting work with a high execution to quotation rate   floating prices are   impossible to track manage and justify   people talk to each other whether you like it or not   do proper reasonable calculations and be up front to all about how you work   in contract on paper   it just may be necessary to scale prices from beginner to advanced classes ok $ 50 seems a fair price i do n't live in the states but about three four big mac 's would compare about right   you are not selling time you are selling expertise decide how much she wants out of it per month forget retirement you live now   this income will also cover other invisible extraneous work determine how much time will be spent in giving lessons   you can only charge for visible work done basic hourly rate = monthly income lesson hours then there 's a catch   research has shown that owners of one man and small businesses spend about 55 of their time in getting new business   so now charged hourly rate = basic hourly rate divided by 45 this could you but these are hard commercial facts   things could appear to be extremely expensive   you will however have a solid base from which to decide as you go further   the accounting is a good place to start but she you both rather have to feel good about the rewards and the counter performances great success to you both

i answered a similar question before essentially you should n't trust a site you find on the internet merely because it looks professional and real   before signing up with any new service provider you found online you should verify the authenticity of both the organization itself and their web site address even if the name displayed by a web site represents a legitimate brokerage firm any site you happen to come across on the internet could be an elaborate of a real company intended to capture your personal details or worse first to check if a brokerage firm is in fact registered to trade securities in the united states you can consult finra 's online service   this might be the first of many checks you should undertake after you convince yourself that finra is legitimate   a meta problem then if you want to know if the web site address is authentic one way is to contact that broker offline using the contact information found from a trusted source such as the finra details   unfortunately those details do not currently appear to contain the broker 's web site url   else that could be useful another thing to look at is the site 's login or sign up page for a valid ssl certificate that is both issued to the correct legal name of the brokerage firm as well as has been signed by a well known certificate authority e.g. for a financial services firm of any kind you should look for and expect to see an extended validation certificate   any other kind of certificate might only assert that the certificate was issued to the domain name owner and not necessarily to an organization with the registered legal name   yes anybody can register a domain with a similar name and then acquire a basic ssl certificate for that domain fwiw scottrade and sharebuilder are both legitimate brokers i was aware already of each but i also just checked in the finra tool and the urls currently linked to by the question are legitimate web site addresses for each   also you can see their ev certificates in action on secured pages here and here as to whether your investments with those brokers would be safe in the event of the broker failing e.g. goes bankrupt you 'll want to know that they are members of the securities investor protection corporation wikipedia   of course this kind of protection does n't protect you if your investments simply go down in value but do your own due diligence always

you 're right to be a bit afraid for lack of a better term   it 's a guarantee that some crooked people will try to screw you and running a business in virtually any industry is getting more and more competitive everyday   but if you 're savvy enough to call people out on their and willing to compete you can succeed with a solid business model       the two main reasons people do n't try and start a small business of their own all the time are 1 because they 're too lazy or do n't have the drive and 2 do n't have the start up capital   believe me i 've met some fellow successful business owners that could n't pass a freshman undergrad level business law course     do n't get me wrong there is always risk involved with a new venture   but if you 're committed to learning how to streamline your service and operations then market it effectively you 'd probably be okay   the legal side of things will really play an extremely likely negligible small part in your day to day life once you 've gotten them out initially

this has been made clearly many times in this thread and others and by myself i refuse to go around in circles so i will not repeat myself after this long term investors need to be able to liquidate their assets since long term investors by definition trade infrequently short term speculators are necessary to perform this function your argument at times has been that you do n't need ultra short term speculators and mine is that the ultra sort term speculators have not been shown to do anything negative to long term investors so banning them is reactionary short term speculators do make money out of long term investors and that is by design they are the very reason markets exist otherwise people would stick to direct investment

from the uk usa tax treaty article 1 general scope 1 except as specifically provided herein this convention is applicable only to persons who are residents of one or both of the contracting states 2 this convention shall not restrict in any manner any benefit now or accorded a by the laws of either contracting state or b by any other agreement between the contracting states i 'm not an expert but to me that sounds like the tax free advantage of an uk isa would be respected by the irs from the uk usa tax treaty article 7 7 where under any provision of this convention income or gains arising in one of the contracting states are relieved from tax in that contracting state and under the law in force in the other contracting state a person in respect of the said income or gains is subject to tax by reference to the amount thereof which is remitted to or received in that other contracting state and not by reference to the full amount thereof then the relief to be allowed under this convention in the first mentioned contracting state shall apply only to so much of the income or gains as is taxed in the other contracting state this is very difficult to comprehend but also that tax free status is upheld in the usa

gt as i currently understand we owe much of our national debt to ourselves    debtors owe creditors creditors are by and large the banks forget about we ourselves   one thing we are taught in school is that banks earn money on the spread between what a creditor pays minus what a saver earns in interest on his deposit in reality such private savings pretty much do not exist when someone borrows from the bank they mostly are n't borrowing another person 's savings the bank is creating new currency through the issuance of debt   gt the reason for this is that people are being charged interest that does not exist in the system    i 'm not sure what you mean by does not exist in the system the way it works is you borrow a dollar and now you owe a dollar plus the interest on the dollar since each new loan creates more debt than currency the monetary system can never shrink or it if you mean that the currency is by any objective measure of value that is correct    gt therefore if we tried to pay the debt like some conservative politicians are fighting for it would be a massive transfer of wealth from the 99 to the 1 since most of the debt is owed to the 1 banks   there is no possibility of repaying it both the red team and the blue team are in on this if you 're worried about the 99 you should be advocating commodity money because that is the only way to stop theft by inflation if you 're worried about yourself get informed as to how these plans have played out in history and how you might protect yourself

the is per year not per month so you will be getting about 1 k per year just for sitting around on your some important things it is almost certain that you can earn a better interest rate elsewhere if you are prepared to leave your 100 k untouched for example even in natwest you can earn 3.2 over the next year if you buy a fixed rate bond for 100 k that is certainly worth looking at or maybe put 90 k in a fixed rate bond and leave 10 k in an instant access account taxes should not be a problem since you can earn around 7 k before you start paying taxes however be aware that in the uk most bank accounts deduct tax at source that means they send the tax they think you should have paid to the government and you then have to claim it back from them accounts for young people may work differently ask your bank

books would be considered personal use property according to canada 's income tax laws   the most detailed it i was able to find is which says gains and losses 3 a gain on the disposition of personal use property is normally a capital gain within the meaning of paragraph where the property is a principal residence the gain > is computed under paragraph or c 4 under a loss on a disposition of personal use property other than listed personal property is deemed to be nil this part of the bulletin indicates that a gain might be considered a capital gain not income   however you do n't get to book a loss as a capital loss   this is the first hint that your book sale which is actually an exempt capital loss should n't go on your tax return unless it 's one of the listed items listed personal property 7 listed personal property is defined in paragraph to mean personal use property that is all or any portion of or any interest in or right to any a print drawing painting or other similar work of art b jewellery c rare folio rare or rare book d stamp or e coin so unless you 're selling rare books the disposition sale of them is essentially exempt as income regardless of whether you sold it at a profit or at a loss   if it is rare then you might be able to consider it a capital loss which does n't help you much unless you had other capital gains but you can carry over capital losses to future years there 's also a newer it related to hobbies and collecting items   this one says 11 in order for any activity or pursuit to be regarded as a source of income there must be a reasonable expectation of profit where such an expectation does not exist as is the case with most hobbies neither amounts received nor expenses incurred are included in the income computation for tax purposes and any excess of expenses over receipts is a personal or living expense the deduction of which is denied by paragraph on the other hand if the hobby or pastime results in receipts of revenue in excess of expenses that fact is a strong indication that the hobby is a venture with an expectation of profit if so the net income may be taxable as income from a business the current version of visual artists and writers discusses the concept of a reasonable expectation of profit in greater detail where a hobby consists of collecting personal use property or listed personal property should be accounted for as described in the current version of personal use property emphasis mine in other words if it 's not the type of thing where you 'd make a tax deduction when you bought it in the first place then you clearly do n't need to report it as income when you sell it just to be absolutely clear here the fact that you are selling them at a loss is not actually what 's important here what 's important is that if the books are n't collectibles then you would have had no expectation of profit   if you did have that expectation then you could have made a tax deduction when you first purchased them so in this case it is probably not necessary for you to report the income however for the benefit of other readers in some cases you might need to report it under other income or book it as a capital gain loss depending on what those personal items are and whether or not you made a net profit

well for a start funds do n't pay interest   if you pick an income paying fund as opposed to one that automatically reinvests any income for you you will receive periodic income based on the dividends paid by the underlying stocks but it wo n't be the steady predictable interest payment you might get from a savings account or fixed rate security this income is not guaranteed and will vary based on the performance of the companies making up the fund it 's also quite likely that the income by itself wo n't cover the interest on your mortgage   the gains from stock market investment come from a mixture of dividends and capital growth i.e. the increase in the price of the shares   so you may have to sell units now and again or cover part of the interest payments from other income you 're basically betting that the after tax returns from the fund will be greater than the mortgage interest rate you 're paying    3 facts if you 're comfortable with these 3 facts go for it if they 're going to keep you awake at night you might not want to take the risk

economically it does n't make much difference but i like to control the account because i can adjust the amount i put aide each month based on the new tax rates that come out each spring this allow me finer control i also know that the bills have been paid i had one lender years ago that failed to pay the property tax bill i had to end the money in to the county and then months fighting the lender to get the money back now i avoid escrow accounts   the money being collected by the mortgage servicing company for property taxes and property insurance goes into a separate account the company insists on handling the funds to make sure that these bills are paid on time thus protecting their investment the failure to pay the taxes leaves the property subject to forfeiture via tax lien   the failure to pay property insurance leaves the house unprotected if there is a fire or other incident you can avoid the use of an escrow   account if you have enough equity in the account some lenders ask for you to provide proof of payment each year if you are going to pay it yourself   at the end of each year the servicing company will provide you with an accounting for interest on the loan and the amount of money spent on taxes and insurance also expect that they will make adjustments to the monthly withholding based on estimated increases for taxes and insurance   depending on your financial situation the interest taxes may be included on schedule a. if you have a rental property the interest taxes and insurance are considered expenses that you can write off the biggest issue with escrow accounts is that the company can have a buffer built in to protect them from unexpected increases many people view the calculation of the buffer a confusing and feel that they are overpaying   if you want to avoid the escrow account you should make sure that each month you put the money into a separate account so that when the property tax bill is due you can pay it on time when savings accounts earned significant interest it was possible to make a little money in the deal but that has n't been true for the last few years

in an efficient investment market the amount of risk premium would exactly offset the likelihood of loss such that over long time frames the expected return on investment would be equal for all investment options   in practice we usually see that riskier investments yield a higher long term return because the risk premium is larger than that efficient amount this is because many investors do n't have a long term time horizon and the pain of loss is greater than the reward of gain asymmetric preferences it 's also important to think about the risk reward interaction as being perceived risk to expected reward   if i 'm lending money to somebody who is likely not to pay me back i 'd want a better deal than if i were lending to somebody who is certain to pay i think that addresses your confusion but if i misinterpreted what 's you please let me know and i

there is plenty of over in the majority of these answers when the simple answer is that it is simply down to statistics say an insurer had two pieces of information about two separate drivers annual mileage and whether they had had an accident in the last 3 years driver a drives 10,000 miles a year and has n't had an accident in the past 3 years driver b drives 500 miles a year and has n't had an accident in the past 3 years which would the insurer think was the safer bet the answer is a and this makes his premiums lower the reason for this is that the insurer has a lot more data about driver a than driver b they know that driver a has driven 30,000 miles without having an accident this could of course be luck or a fluke but it is likely that driver a is actually a safe driver the chance that driver a has n't had an accident just through sheer luck and that they are actually a terrible driver is quite slim on the other hand driver b has only driven 1,500 miles in the past three years whilst this seems like prima evidence of them being as safe a driver as driver a it is much more likely that driver b could have driven 1,500 miles and avoided an accident through sheer luck even though they are a terrible driver   this means drivers who drive low amounts of mileage will be penalised relative to other drivers who have high mileage it has nothing to do with insurers taking a judgement that doing more mileage makes you more experienced or makes you a better driver as others have suggested here although it is probably true it 's not quantifiable from an insurer 's perspective

no a jump in market capitalization does not equal the amount that has been invested   market cap is simply the stock price times the total number of shares this represents a theoretical value of the company i say theoretical because the company might not be able to be sold for that at all   the quoted stock price is simply what the last buyer and seller of stock agreed upon for the price of their trade they really only represent themselves other investors may decide that the stock is worth more or less than that   the stock price can move on very little volume in this case amazon had released a very good earnings report after the bell yesterday and the price jumped in after hours trading the stock price is up but that simply means that the few shares traded overnight sold for much higher than the closing price yesterday   after the market opens today and many more shares are traded we 'll get a better idea what large numbers of investors feel about the price but no matter what the price does the change in market cap does not equal the amount of new money being invested in the company market cap is the price of the most recent trades extrapolated out across all the shares

unfortunately economics and accounting for that matter wo n't help much with being an entrepreneur   the main thing you need to focus on is cash generation you need to maximise this there are 2 aspects revenue and costs   you need to plot these over the last 5 10 years to see trends   what is happening to revenues are they growing with inflation   if not why not   is it because people are buying online   is it because the products are not fashionable is it because people simply buy less jewelry these days   have the cost of the products gone up but the shop has n't increased prices i.e. gross margin contraction   decreasing gross margin could also be an indicator that someone is stealing from the business    what about the overhead costs of running the business   what has happened to rent salaries insurance   look for any unusual trends     in summary first you need to identify where the problem is and to do this you need to look at the trends of revenues and costs break costs down into categories

that makes complete logical sense this is n't a shutdown of cryptocurrency however    if you look at russia they banned bitcoin at one point now they have said it is not illegal and are looking to regulate it it 's entirely possible that the law makers do n't understand it yet but eventually will when that time comes rules will come into play possibly hopefully will benefit the majority   the biggest factor playing against crypto right now is lack of understanding to the majority many people do n't understand there is no security with an ico you have no guarantee of profit they hear about the gains bitcoin is making and they get excited there was an ad going around that literally said missed the bitcoin ico do n't miss this one or something along those lines it is feeding off the uninformed   china is n't trying to ban talking about a large group of people they 're preventing icos from continuing what they are doing a lot of icos are complete scams ponzi schemes that benefit a very small percentage they did n't just ban bitcoin they banned scamming people it 's better to create a fast ban and change a law later then to continue to allow people to get screwed while we debate logistics   banning icos in my opinion is a step in the right direction and in no way should be seen as the start of the end

in maryland a landlord must hold your security deposit in an escrow account and pay you interest when returning the deposit   the interest is simple interest it does not compound the interest rate that they must pay has changed over the last 43 years   before october 1 2004 the rate was 4   until january 1 2015 the rate was 3   currently the rate is 1.5 or the simple interest rate accrued at the daily u.s. treasury yield curve rate for one year as of the first business day of each year whichever is greater   this year the rate is 1.5   maryland 's department of housing and community development has a security deposit calculator for easy calculation of this interest however it only works for deposits since january 1 2015 it is unclear to me whether the interest rate in effect is the one that was in place when the security deposit was made or if the rate changes over the years    at most if you get 4 interest every year i would expect you to receive $ which is $ 158 + $ 158 4 43   the interest is accrued every 6 months so you would not get any interest for the 3 months that you rented in your year with the new law that took effect this year interest is accrued monthly at least if the interest rate changes with the new laws i would expect you to receive $ which is $ 158 + $ 158 4 + $ 158 3 + $ 158 1.5 0.5 some text on the security deposit calculator suggests that the laws for prince george 's county are different than the rest of the state   if you are in that county you 'll need to check the local ordinances to see what security deposit policies apply

do n't worry the cyprus situation could only occur because those banks were paying interest rates well above eu market rates and the government did not tax them at all even the one time tax discussed is comparable to e.g. germany and the netherlands if you average over the last 5 years the simple solution is to just spread your money over multiple banks with assets at each bank staying below eur there are more than 100 banks large enough that they 'll come under ecb supervision this year you 'd be able to squirrel away over 10 million there each branch of the dutch is insured individually so you could even save 14 million there alone and they 're collectively aaa rated additionally those savings will then be backed by more than 10 governments many of which are still aaa rated   once you have to worry about those limits you should really talk to an independent advisor investing in aaa government bonds is also pretty safe the examples given by littleadv all involve known risky bonds e.g. argentina was on a credit watch and paying 16 interest rates

one approach would be to create journal entries that debit asset accounts that are associated with these items and credit an open balance equity account the value of these contributions would have to be worked out with an accountant as it depends on the lesser of the adjusted basis vs. the fair market value as you then depreciate the amounts over time to take the depreciation as a business expense and it adjusts your basis in the company to calculate capital gains losses when you sell if there were multiple partners or your accountant wants it this way you could then debit open balance equity and credit the owner 's contribution to a capital account in your name that represents your basis when you sell from a pure accounting perspective if the open balance equity account would zero out you could just skip it and directly credit the capital accounts but i prefer the open balance equity as it helps know the percentages of initial equity which may influence partner ownership percentages and identify anyone who needs to contribute more to the partnership

in 2014 the irs announced that it published guidance in notice 2014 21 in that notice the answer to the first question describes the general tax treatment of virtual currency for federal tax purposes virtual currency is treated as property general tax principles applicable to property transactions apply to transactions using virtual currency as it 's property like any other capital gains if and when you sell are taxed as with any capital gains you 're taxed on the profit you made that is the proceeds how much you got when you sold minus your basis how much you paid to get the property that you sold until you sell it 's just an asset like a house or a share of stock or a rare collectible card that does n't require any reporting if your initial cryptocurrency acquisition was through mining then this section of that notice applies does a taxpayer who mines virtual currency for example uses computer resources to validate bitcoin transactions and maintain the public bitcoin transaction ledger realize gross income upon receipt of the virtual currency resulting from those activities yes when a taxpayer successfully mines virtual currency the fair market value of the virtual currency as of the date of receipt is includible in gross income see publication 525 taxable and nontaxable income for more information on taxable income that is to say when it was mined the market value of the amount generated should have been included in income probably on either line 21 other income or on schedule c if it 's from your own business at that point the market value would also qualify as your basis though i doubt there 'd be a whole lot of enforcement action for not amending your 2011 return to include $ 0.75 technically if you find a dollar bill on the street it should be included in income but usually the government cares about bigger fish than that it sounds like your basis is close enough to zero that it 's not worth trying to calculate a more accurate value since your basis could n't be less than zero there 's no way that using zero as your basis would cause you to pay less tax than you ought so the government wo n't have any objections to it   one thing to be careful of is to document that your holdings qualify for long term capital gains treatment held longer than a year if applicable also as you 're trading in multiple cryptocurrencies each transaction may count as a sale of one kind followed by a purchase of the other kind much like if you traded your apple stock for google stock it 's possible that 1031 like kind exchange rules apply and in june 2016 the american institute of cpas sent a letter asking about it among other things but as far as i know there 's been no official irs guidance on the matter there are also some related questions here see do altcoin trades count as like kind exchanges and assuming 1031 does n't apply to cryptocurrency trading but if in fact those exchange rules do not apply and it is just considered a sale followed by a purchase then you would need to report each exchange as a sale with that asset 's basis probably $ 0 for the initial one and proceeds of the fair market value at the time and then that same value would be the basis of the new asset you 're purchasing using a $ 0 basis is how i treat my bitcoin sales though i have n't dealt with other cryptocurrencies as long as all the usd income is being reported when you get usd i find it unlikely you 'll run into a lot of trouble even if you technically were supposed to report the individual transactions when they happened though i 'm not in charge of irs enforcement and i 'm not aware of any high profile cases so it 's hard to know anything for sure obviously if there 's a lot of money involved you may want to involve a professional rather than random strangers on the internet you could also try contacting the irs directly as believe it or not their job is in fact helping you to comply with the tax laws correctly also there are phone numbers at the end of notice 2014 21 of people which might be able to provide further guidance including this statement the principal author of this notice is keith a. of the office of associate chief counsel income tax accounting for further information about income tax issues addressed in this notice please contact mr. at 202

this is a misconception one of the explanations is that if you buy at the ask price and want    to sell it right away you can only sell at the bid price this is incorrect there are no two separate bid and ask prices the price you buy your bid is the same price someone else sells their sell the same goes when you sell the price you sell at is the price someone else buys there 's no spread with stocks emphasized it on purpose because many people especially those who gamble on stock exchange without knowing what they 're doing do n't understand how the stock market works on the stock exchange the transaction price is the match between the bid price and the ask price thus on any given transaction bid always equals ask there 's no spread there is spread with commodities if you buy it directly especially contracts mutual funds and other kinds of transactions that go through a third party the difference spread is that third party 's fee for assuming part of the risk in the transaction and is indeed added to your cost indirectly in the way you described these transactions do n't go directly between a seller and a buyer for example there 's no buyer when you redeem some of your mutual fund the fund pays you money so the fund assumes certain risk which is why there 's a spread in the prices to invest and to redeem similarly with commodities when you buy a gold bar you buy it from a dealer who needs to keep a stock thus the dealer will not buy from you at the same price there 's a premium on sale and a discount on buy which is a spread to compensate the dealer for the risk of keeping a stock

there are three ways to do this so far the answers posted have only mentioned two   the three ways are selling short means that you borrow stock from your broker and sell it with the intent of buying it back later to repay the loan   as others have noted this has unlimited potential losses and limited potential gains   your profit or loss will go $ with the movement of the price of the stock buying a put option gives you the right to sell the stock at a later date on a price that you choose now   you pay a premium to have this right and if the stock moves against you you wo n't exercise your option and will lose the premium   options move non linearly with the price of the stock especially when the expiration is far in the future   they probably are not for a beginner although they can be powerful if used properly the third option is a synthetic short position   you form this by simultaneously buying a put option and selling short a call option both at the same strike price   this has a risk profile that is very much like the selling the stock short but you can accomplish it entirely with stock options   because you 're both buying an selling in theory you might even collect a small net premium when you open you might ask why you 'd do this given that you could just sell the stock short which certainly seems simpler   one reason is that it is not always possible to sell the stock short   recall that you have to borrow shares from your broker to sell short   when many people want to short the stock brokers will run out of shares to loan   the stock is then said to be hard to borrow which effectively prevents further short selling of the stock   in this case the synthetic short is still potentially possible

a non trading stock or non marketable security or security is one that does not trade continually on an exchange for tax purposes this can mean a whole new ball of wax which i would prefer the experts address with an edit to this answer or a new answer for financial accounting purposes this is when say one owns shares in an corporation and should be treated very carefully less one oneself for trading stock the value can be known immediately by checking any valid data provider 's price and marking to market   for non trading stock the value has to be marked to model   this can get one into enron sized trouble in this case it 's best to either leave the value of the stock at the purchase price and recognize gains upon sale use a price from another honest transaction by third parties which are most likely difficult to attain or to use some shorthand measure like applying the market p e. be wary of strangely high figures for value from the purchase price by using a market average and do n't throw away the shares just yet if a strangely low one arises   this method can lead to strange results

an order is not a transaction   it is a request to make a transaction   if the transaction never occurs e.g. because you cancel the order then no fees should be charged will i get the stamp duty back the 0.5 tax i paid on the shares purchase when i sell the shares i 'm not a uk tax expert but to this page is seems like you only pay stamp tax when you buy shares and do n't get it back when you sell but may be responsible for capital gains taxes   that makes sense because there 's always a buyer and a seller so if you got the tax back when you sold the tax would effectively be transferred from the buyer to the seller and the government would never collect anything

as an nri you ca n't hold a regular savings account it should have been converted to nro option 1 open nre account since i am relocating permanently this might not be good option for me as converting   this is the best option as funds into nre are not taxable in india the provides a clean paper trail so that if there are any tax queries you can answer them easily you can open a rupee nre account move the funds on return move the funds into normal savings account and close the nre account this is not much of hassle option 2 create nro account there would be taxes on the interest earned of the funds but i am not sure of this since i will have been moved to india permanently would i need to still pay taxes on the interest earned while i am in india any interest in nro or normal savings account is taxable in india there is no exemption   option 3 i can transfer my funds directly to my account in india but i believe i would have to pay tax on the the funds that i transfer and that would be double taxation which i think would be the worst option for me please correct me if i am wrong this is incorrect any earnings outside of india when your status is nri is not taxable in india opening an nre account provides proper paper trail of funds as an nri one can not hold normal savings account this should have been converted into an nro account although there is no penalty prescribed its violation of fema regulation i also hope you were declaring any income in india i.e. interest etc on savings and filing returns accordingly option 4 i can transfer the funds to my direct relatives account i still believe there would be tax to be paid on the interest earned of the amount you can transfer it to your parents siblings etc this would come under gift tax and would not be taxable they can then gift this back to you however such transactions would appear to be evading regulations and may come under scrutiny interest on savings account is taxable so best is go with option 1 no hassle else go with option 3 but ensure that you have all the paperwork kept handy for next 7 years

truthfully i do n't know but in actuality a 4 5 billion dollar loss even is n't the big deal it 's more important that they lost almost of market cap   now realistically it 's relatively oversold in my opinion and they will make it back eventually but that has more of an impact on them in the here and now   as far as the offset you are asking about i 'm not sure personally i do n't trust any accounting practices of banks in reality it 's entirely possible that not even the c suite understands their exact financial position at any given time   the reports of this loss actually came out about a month before they were even able to make an educated guess as to how much their losses would be     in any case there are much more qualified knowledgeable people on here that could likely answer your question a bit better

gt;if you have more people in an insurance pool premium costs go down which is the whole point of the individual mandate   the costs depend very very very much on who the people in the pool are actuarial data shows that older people almost invariably and by definition have significantly higher costs ergo this is why their premiums have been higher or if a particular pool has an inordinate number of older people in it why everyone in that pool 's premiums are higher because they are essentially an average and the younger members are in essence subsidizing the older ones conversely if a firm has almost entirely young single people premium costs are significantly significantly lower   one of the things the legislation does though is place an artificial limitation of the premium price differential ergo younger people will across the board be seeing a huge increase in premium costs because the law is essentially mandating a major increased operating loss on the older pool members the cost will be shifted to the younger people   end result is that premiums for younger people will increase several times over which will make buying a policy which in the past was relatively cheap for young amp healthy people a significantly more difficult burden and that will naturally make paying the fine far more financially pragmatic   this is especially true since the other provision of the law is that known pre existing conditions can not be used to exclude or change the premium cost so should the individual be diagnosed with something they can after the fact still purchase coverage   basically it is like being able to buy a lottery ticket after the number have been drawn   it is an inherently unstable and unsustainable system

you asked specifically about the roth ira option and stated you want to get the most bang for your buck in retirement   while others have pointed out the benefits of a tax deduction due to using a traditional ira instead i have n't seen anyone point out some of the other differences between roth and traditional such as i agree with your thoughts on using an ira once you maximize the company match into a 401k plan    my reasoning is i personally prefer etfs over mutual funds for the ability to get in and out with limit stop or oco orders at open or anytime mid day if needed   however the price for that flexibility is that you risk discounts to nav for etfs that you would n't have with the equivalent mutual fund   said another way you may find yourself selling your etf for less than the holdings are actually worth   personally i value the ability to exit positions at the time of my choosing more highly than the impact of tracking error on nav also as a final comment to your plan if it were me i 'd personally pay off the student loans with any money i had after contributing enough to my employer 401k to maximize matching   the net effect of paying down the loans is a guaranteed avg 5.3 annually given what you 've said whereas any investments in 401k or ira are at risk and have no such guarantee   in fact with there being reasonable arguments that this has been an excessively long bull market you might figure your chances of a 5.3 or better return are pretty low for new money put into an ira or 401k today   that said i 'm long on stocks still but then i do n't have debt besides my mortgage at the moment   if i were n't so conservative i 'd be looking to maximize my leverage in the continued low rate environment

collections companies buy debt for a fraction of the face value of the debt as little as 5 7 cents on the dollar and you can often settle debt for a fraction of the face amount perhaps 10 25 cents on the dollar but there are several considerations   do you owe the debt is it a legitimate debt can you afford to pay the debt what is the age of the debt remember there is a statute of limitations on debt varies by state and what are the consequences of non payment or settlement of the debt rather than confirm that you owe the debt tell the debt collector that you need proof that the debt is yours you should do this by certified letter   be careful not to confirm the debt or agree to pay it or make any payments yet you said that your doctor ordered the product for you you said the company sent you a product you have the product once you have confirmed that the debt is yours you should determine the age of the debt when was the last time you paid on the debt   each state has statute of limitations on debt depending upon the age of the debt this is why it is important not to send the collector money until you have verified the debt you did not state when the debt was incurred assume under sol ask yourself whether you can afford to pay the debt   the amount of the debt and your ability to pay and whether you want to avoid the time and expense of dealing with the collector they are trained to be annoying are all factors to consider   you should also consider the negative consequences credit score effects and whether the cost of a derogatory entry is worth fighting the debt you did not explain your financial situation paying the $ 55 may be trivial or it may be a hardship before you settle any debt you should send a letter keep a copy and proof you sent it certified and demand that the debt collector provide proof that you owe the debt   often this proof does not exist or is insufficient to gain a judgement you would need legal help here   and should a debt collector agree to settle the debt for a lower amount you need to get that agreement in writing   be aware that when you settle a debt the collector can and will send you a 1099 for the portion of the debt which has been forgiven and can report to the credit bureaus that you settled a debt for less than the full amount negative mark against credit   derogatory credit items will you for years decide whether saving $ 20 $ 30 or even $ 55 is worth the trouble   probably not learn from this when a company sends you something you did not order contact them and send it back or demand they pay shipping and send them a letter demanding $ storage and $ 20 handling fee to ship it back to them disclaimer heed the insane of a at your peril hire a lawyer

the portfolio described in that post has a blend of small slices of vanguard sector funds such as vanguard pacific stock index   and the theory is that rebalancing across them will give you a good risk return tradeoff   caveat i have n't read the book only the post you link to similar etfs are available from vanguard ishares and state street   if you want to replicate the exactly pick from them   if you have questions about how to match specific funds in australia just ask another question   so i think you could match it fairly exactly if you wanted to however i think trying to exactly replicate the gone portfolio in australia would not be a good move for most people for a few reasons brokerage and management fees are generally higher in australia smaller market so dividing your investment across ten different securities and rebalancing is going to be somewhat more expensive if you have a middle class sized portfolio of somewhere in the tens of thousands to low millions of dollars you 're cutting it into fairly small slices to manually allocate 5 to various sectors   to keep brokerage costs low you probably want to buy each etf only once every one two years or so   you also need to keep track of the tax consequences of each of them if you are earning and spending australian dollars and looking at the portfolio in australian dollars a lot of those assets are going to move together as the australian dollar moves regardless of changes in the underlying assets   so there is effectively less diversification than you would have in the us the post does n't mention the 's approach to tax   i expect they do consider it but it 's not going to be directly applicable to australia if you are more interested in implementing the general approach of rather than the specific details what i would recommend is the vanguard and superannuation diversified funds have a very similar internal split to the with a mix of local first world and emerging market shares bonds and property trusts   this is pretty much fire and forget contribute every month and they will take care of rebalancing spreading across asset classes and tax calculations   by my calculations the cost is very similar the diversification is very similar and it 's much easier the only thing they do n't generally cover is a precious metals allocation and if you want that just put 5 of your money into the asx gold etf or something similar

i 'm not an expert by any means but pretty much every source i 've seen says that one year is far too short for any sort of real investment   most guides suggest that anything less than 3 5 years should stay in no risk accounts like savings or cds   if you need to be sure you get all of the money back after just one year any sort of market based investment e.g. stocks or bonds is too risky one option is to buy i bonds   you can buy up to $ 10,000 worth in a calendar year and 12 months is the minimum holding period   the advantage of i bonds is that the interest rate is indexed to inflation so that roughly speaking they can not lose value in real dollars   right now they pay per year which is substantially better than you 're likely to get with a savings account or 12-month cd   this would come to $ if you buy $ 10k of i bonds if you sell before holding them for five years which you will under your plan you forfeit the last 3 months worth of interest   even so your effective rate will likely be better than a savings account or cd   also you could get 12 months worth of interest if you 're able to buy them slightly early and/or postpone your sabbatical slightly so that you hold them for 15 months your other option is to find the best rate you can in a cd or savings account   nerdwallet for instance suggests you could get between 1 and 1.1 for a $ 10k deposit in a 1-year cd which would be about $ 100 as you can see either way your money is not going to grow that much   you 'll be gaining somewhere in the ballpark of a couple hundred dollars at most   there just is n't a way to earn more than that in one year without some risk of losing principal i 'm assuming based on your texas flag pic that you live in the usa   to buy i bonds you must be a us citizen resident or government employee

i 'm not an importer but i sold a lot of things online and has tried a lot of methods and calculate it   in my experience warranty almost always a good financial decision unless your marketing really sucks you could always mark up your product against competitors with no warranty by quite a large amount 10 20 would be quite a low estimate if you combined it with marketing and sales person considering i sold goods with full guarantee and no question asked and only got return of less than 2 online it is actually good decision on most product it 's electronics and we sell 300 500 pieces a day just make sure that the buyers have to absorb some of the cost shipping + waiting 2 days so you wo n't have a group of people bought things without actually want to follow through

gt also in the past a person with lower socioeconomic background if they finish high school or got a ba it would for sure really change their lives and they become middle or high class   because the cost was still going to keep most people out of university    finishing high school was never as hard as you suggest and did n't guarantee you any sort of job     overall high school graduation rates in 1968 were 5 lower than they were in 2004   seems like what you 're arguing for does n't support that education is bad there is just more competition among workers with higher levels of education than ever so degrees are less valued than the used to be when far fewer people had access

i 'm assuming you are in the us here from a tax perspective you do n't need to take any action to start a business and deduct expenses   if you have earned income coming from a source other than a w2 paying job then you have a business   on your taxes this means you file a schedule c which is where you will deduct business expenses and schedule se which computes how much fica tax you will owe on your business income   when we talk about starting a business we usually are talking about creating a corporation or llc   no particular tax advantage to that in your case but there could be liability advantages if you are concerned about that if you file losses consistently year after year the irs might try and classify your business as a hobby   that 's what you should worry about   i suppose incorporating might reduce the probability of that but it might not   keep good records in case you need to argue with the irs   if you do have to argue with them they will want to ensure that you only used the laptop and internet for your business   that 's a big if but it 's a potentially scary one irs guidelines on hobby vs. business income note besides deducting expenses another advantage of self employment is opening a or sep or simple ira   these potentially allow you to set aside a lot more money than the typical ira and 401(k arrangement   thing is you have to have a lot more earned income to really take advantage of them but let 's hope your app gets you there

i 'm all in on hard silver a small portion is stored at my house for emergency expenditures and the vast majority is in a high security vault in canada that was actually the cheapest place i could find for long term storage and insurance which happened to be off shore it could turn out to be beneficial to be off shore though in the 1930s gold became illegal to privately own its very possible they could do the same this time although they did n't in 1979 oil is too high in volume to reasonably store gold is n't as undervalued as silver which i could spend a full day talking about but to sum it up in a few points there is less silver than there is gold gold has a premium for jewelry which will likely go down in a crash even though you will still see gains silver is the second most used commodity besides oil less people are in the know about it silver prices were actually higher than gold a few times in the past century simply measuring the dow in silver will show it 's further below the historical average compared to gold i 'll stop there but i could go on though on silver if people want real estate is still very expensive from the 2008 recession traditionally mortgages are $ 1.05 per dollar you would spend on renting the same property currently real estate is at like $ 1.25 + i believe it peaked at about $ i rent to save money which you can spend on other assets   if one 's willing to move to another state for lower taxes they definitely should employment is going to be harder to come by and they should get as much out of it as possible as they can if they do n't save enough they could end up just using their entire savings during the whole thing if they ca n't find a job in which case at the end you 'd never know they knew it was going to happen   overall i do n't think this crash is going to be like the great depression i do n't feel compelled to store food and buy a generator or anything i believe the living will be easier than it were to live in the 90s for those who are invested in assets everything is going to be on sale meanwhile their wealth will be increasing depending on how much they own it could be increasing faster than they need to spend it sounds like the life to me but with that said those without real assets especially the lower class will be unemployed and living on food stamps perhaps even the food stamps making more people leave the dollar and the economy this actually might not be a prediction and is what happening already but i do n't believe anybody in america at least will be starving in the 30s we had not mastered industry farming yet and we had the to make things worse    crime though i 'd own a gun the protesters are here already and i think we are just passing the half way point right now they will get   i do n't know enough about taxes to know the best country or place to store to combat taxes maybe someone else can chime in i 'm in canada to avoid high insurance and storage fees   and for careful selection of primary residence in the long haul i 'd rent a small apartment as small and cheap as possible in a safe neighborhood but not so much that a single grocery store or gas station going out of business could ruin it

not to mention that what they were doing was the right way to do it for many decades it was simply seen as the norm that you would have a job take part of your savings and put that into a 401k because it was the only way to really provide for a safe future   so that 's what we did oops   the other big difference between gen x and the surrounding generations in regards to retirement is social security the baby boomers will have social security for most of the rest of their lives it 's funded and it wo n't be a problem millenials have mostly come of age knowing that 's a joke gen x on the other hand grew up and worked at least part of their lives under the assumption that social security while having problems would at least provide some help however with the way the economy and government is going it 's very possible that wo n't be a guarantee without major adjustments decreased payout increased retirement age etc so they 're going to be taking it there as well   that 's not even to get started on the mortgage situation for a lot of us x'ers we bought homes near or at the top of the bubble again because everyone was telling our generation that we were foolish for renting why with the tax incentives in place and the way housing prices have been rising the last 20 years you 're just throwing your money away by renting so again the baby boomers enjoyed 20 30 years of rising home prices giving them a chance to build up a lot of equity and refinance at lower and lower rates the millenials again were shielded simply by not being at the point in their lives where it would be a problem once again it 's gen x that was just trying to do what they had observed as working their entire life   i think generation x will rise out of everything that has happened much wiser most of us have been through enough at this point that i think we 're beginning to become very of the way things are and that will have heavy ramifications as the reigns of power fall from the boomers to the x'ers   may you live in interesting times

you said should i make a side contract with the realtor to pay me the commission at closing i would imagine that in most if not all states that is illegal this is because selling real estate is an activity that requires passing an exam on real estate laws and obtaining a state issued license you are not bringing a buyer because you are not an agent   if you decide to go directly to the realtor that has the listing there is a possibility that the agent might agree to lowering their commission in order to make the sale however the agent is entitled to both sides of the commission because they bear all the administrative and marketing costs of the transaction   the listing agent might choose to enter into a dual agency agreement where they would have to fairly represent both sides but they can not reveal information that would be helpful to you as a buyer e.g. why the seller is choosing to sell other material facts about the property that are not public knowledge etc if there is no written dual agency agreement then the listing agent only represents the seller   in either scenario you lose the benefit of a full fiduciary relationship with an agent so if you choose to deal directly with the listing agent you are making one of the biggest purchases of your lifetime without the benefit of professional representation do you really want that put another way would you use your spouse 's attorney in a divorce so that you could save money

first when a debt collector says it 's to your advantage to give me money now i 'd take that with a grain of salt my ex wife declared bankruptcy and when debt collectors could n't find her they somehow tracked me down and told me that i should tell her that it would be to her advantage to pay off this debt before the bankruptcy went through that was total nonsense of course the whole point of bankruptcy is to not have to pay the debt why would you pay it just before it was wiped off the books now that i think of it i 'm surprised that they did n't tell me that i should pay her debts as others have noted this would be controlled by state law but in general when someone dies any debts are payed from the assets of the estate and then whatever is left goes to the heirs if nothing is left or the debts exceed the assets then the heirs get nothing but they do n't have to pay somebody else 's debts i do n't see how you could put the house under your name if he left the house to you in his will then after any debts are settled in accordance with state law the house would transfer to you but you ca n't just decide to put the house in your name outside of the legal inheritance process if you could then people could undermine a will at any time by just deciding to take an asset left to someone else and put it in their name or as in this case people could undermine the rights of creditors by transferring all assets to themselves before debts were paid even if there 's some provision in your state for changing the name on a deed prior to probate to facilitate getting mortgages and taxes paid or whatever i would be quite surprised if this allowed you to shelter assets from legitimate creditors it would be a gaping loophole in inheritance law frankly if your father 's debts are more than the value of his assets including the value of the house i suspect you will not be able to keep the house it will be sold to pay off the creditors i would certainly talk to a lawyer about this as there might be some provision in the law that you can take advantage of i 'll gladly yield on this point to anyone with specific knowledge of new jersey inheritance law

the essential and obvious thing to avoid getting back into debt or to reduce debt if you have it is to make your total income exceed your total expenses that means either increasing your income or reducing your total expenses    either take effort    basically you need a plan if your plan is to increase income work out how   if the plan is to increase hours in your current you need to allow for your needs sleep rest etc and also convince your employer they will benefit by paying you to work more hours    if your intent is to increase your hourly rate you need to convince a current or prospective employer that you have the capacity skills etc to deliver more on the job so you are worth paying more     if your intent is to get qualifications so you can get a better paying job work out how much effort studying etc you will apply over how long what expenses you will carry fees textbooks etc and how long you will carry them for will you accept working some years in a higher paying job to clear the debt most of those options involve a lot of work take time and often mean carrying debt until you are in a position to pay it off      there is nothing wrong with getting a job while studying but you have to be realistic about the demands    there is nothing about studying that means you should n't have a job    however you need to be clear how many hours you can work in a job before your studies will suffer unnecessarily and possibly accept the need to study part time so you can work which means the study will take longer but you wo n't struggle as much financially if your plan is to reduce expenses you need a budget     itemize all of your spend   do n't hide anything from that list no matter how small    work out which of the things you need paying off debt is one which you can get rid of which you need to reduce and by how much    be brutal with reducing or eliminating the non essentials no matter how much you would prefer otherwise   keep going until you have a budget in which your expenses are less than your income    then stick to it there is no other answer     revisit your budget regularly so you can handle things you have n't previously planned for say rent increase increase fees for something you need etc     if your income increases or you have a windfall do n't simply drop the budget the best way to get in trouble is to neglect the budget and get into a pattern of spending more than you have    instead incorporate the changes into your budget and plan how you will use the extra income    there is nothing wrong with increasing your spend on non essentials but the purpose of the budget is to keep control of how you do that by keeping track of what you can afford

why is the us still working with paper checks when europe went digital about a decade ago tax filing is just another area in which the us is lagging it costs money and the us is quite close to bankruptcy as seen by the repeated government   also the us tax code is quite complicated for instance i doubt there 's anyone who has a full and complete list of all allowed deductions   some comments wonder about multiple incomes this does n't require tax filing either my local tax authority just sends me a combined statement with data from 2 employers and 2 banks and asks me to confirm the resulting payment this is possible because tax number usage is strictly regulated ssn abuse in the us presumably makes this problematic

the roth is the mirror image of the pre tax traditional ira the latter gives you a tax break now the deposits go in pre tax and are withdrawn at your rate in retirement the former lets you squirrel that money away now post tax but never pay tax again   for young folk the roth is a great way to go my 12 year old has a roth account and paid no tax since she has her own exemption at your level you are probably in the 10 bracket now imagine investing that money and at retirement finding it 's grown 100x very possible if it were in a roth you 'd have no tax due   as noted you are always free to withdraw the deposit so if you decide this was n't money you could actually put away long term you still have an out

to do all of those things we need people in office substantially different than them there now at first i read that as and was about to ask about your far out philosophy and/or new for drafting the new world 's blueprints hah yes i think i mostly agree with your list of good changes labor absolutely needs to be upheld less emphasis on money systems in general and ensuring we use it i think the r&amp;d we need to be doing is more in line with nature and focused on preserving and using what the world can comfortably produce and maintain forests have some pretty wild materials science going on already do we really need to keep thinking in terms of plastics and electronics maybe maybe not i do n't think the real answers are in technology the way we 've used it so far maybe i am reading it incorrectly if you 're going to talk about saving the world i guess i 'd like to have that but and mit kinda freak me out with how amoral they seem sometimes    those changes and you suggest require us thinking more from the heart being compassionate and willing to risk much personally if they are to last or be meaningful who can do such a thing these days where do you suppose these things begin    i have encountered the phrase you before it really struck me i thought back to moments earlier in my life when i made a decision based on the thought of that million dollar inevitability but to still cling to that in this day and age requires a ignorance anymore i almost admire the people who are still able to believe in it i admire the power of their faith dick cheney is a hero for america whether america likes it or not because he does so much to keep the momentum of the machine going if the reality of the world without those systems is too scary then dick cheney is a hero for that person for that person 's participation in it or fear of figuring out what that means for them it removes the experiencing of huge parts of life compounded with the quality of food water air required to keep everyone in an air conditioned office of amoral consumption industries i think the back being sore from digging and is worth more than tunnel syndrome and fucked feet legs from the desk and remember to roll a tennis ball under your feet for a few mins every day to stretch your it thank you very much

the answer for me has to do with compounding that drop in price post ex div is not compounded but if you reinvest your dividends back into the stock then you buy on those post ex div dips in price and your money is compounded because those shares you just bought will themselves yeald dividends next quarter   also with my broker i reinvest the dividend incurring no commission my broker has a feature to reinvest dividends automatically and he charges no commission on those buys edit i forgot to mention that you do not the loss from a drop in price until you sell the security if you do not sell post ex div then you have no loss as long as the dividend remains the same or increases then the theoretical roi on that security goes up the drop in price is actually to your benefit because you are able to acquire more shares with the money you just received in the dividend   so the price coming down post ex div is a good thing if you buy and hold

the primary difference between japan and most other developed nations is who owns their debt   japan 's debt is almost entirely internal   that is it 's actually borrowed from within japan   it 's not owned by china or anyone else   additionally japan owns a fairly substantial proportion of the usa 's debt which provides additional security   it 's a favorite complaint of romney and his friends that american is borrowing from china to finance public spending   a lot of people do n't realize that in fact japan was until very recently america 's biggest source of borrowing   and is still number 2 by a substantial margin   combine this with pretty careful regulation by the bank of japan low bond yields and a much larger economy still with a decent manufacturing base and japan 's situation is n't remotely like greece despite it appearing worse   in a nutshell the japan is the educated university graduate with a reasonable income who like many of us who buy a house that costs many multiples of our annual salary and can afford to service the debt even if it needs to be carefully managed   greece is the homeless one armed drug addict with no prospects that struggles to find a few bucks to spend a night in a   the size of the debt is more or less irrelevant   it 's the ability to pay it that really matters   of course this does n't mean that if circumstances change things could n't go south badly but right now japan is n't in trouble and the 230 vs 130 the reality of the situation

you also need to remember that stock options usually become valueless if not exercised while an employee of the company   so if there is any chance that you will leave the company before an ipo the effective value of the stock options is zero   that is the safest and least risky valuation of the stock options    with a google or facebook stock options can be exercised and immediately sold as they are publicly traded   in fact they may give stock grants where you sell part of the grant to pay tax withholding   you can then sell the remainder of the grant for money at any time even after you leave the company   you only need the option grant to vest to take advantage of it   valuing these at face value current stock price makes sense   that 's at least a reasonable guess of future value    if you are absolutely sure that you will stay with the company until the ipo then valuing the stock based on earnings can make sense   a ten million dollar profit can justify a hundred million dollar ipo market capitalization easily   divide that by the number of shares outstanding and multiply by how many you get   if anything that gives you a conservative estimate    i would still favor the big company offers though   as i said they are immediately tradeable while this offer is effectively contingent on the ipo   if you leave before then you get nothing   if they delay the ipo you 're stuck   you ca n't leave the company until then without sacrificing that portion of your compensation   that seems a big commitment to make

options are an indication what a particular segment of the market those who deal a lot in options think will happen and just because people think that does n't mean it will   bearing in mind however that people writing covered calls may due so simply as part of a strategy to mitigate downside risk at the expense of limiting upside potential   the presence of more people offering up options is to a degree an indication they are thinking the price will fall or hold steady since that is in effect the bet they are making   otoh the people buying those options are making the opposite bet so who is to say which will be right   the balance between the two and how it affects the price of the options could be taken as an indication of market sentiment within the options market as to the future direction the stock is likely to take i just noticed that blackjack posted the that can be used to model all of this   to address the last part of your question does that mean it will go lower i would say this   the degree to which any of this puts actual pressure on the stock of the underlying instrument is highly debatable since many likely most people trading in a stock never look at what the options for that stock are doing but base their decision on other factors such as price history momentum fundamentals and recent news about the company   to presume that actions in the options market would put pressure on a stock price you would need to believe that a fraction of the buyers and sellers were paying attention to the options market   which might be the case for some quants but likely not for a lot of other buyers    and it could be argued even then that both groups those trading options and those trading stocks are both looking at the same information to make their predictions of the likely future for the stock and thus even if there is a correlation between what the stock price does in relation to options there is no real causality that can be established   we would in fact predict that given access to the same information both groups would by and large be taking similar parallel actions due to coming to similar conclusions regarding the future price of the stock   what is far more likely to pressure the price would be just the shear number of buyers or sellers and also especially since repeal of the uptick rule someone who is trying to actively drive down the price via a lot of shorting at progressively lower prices   something that is alleged to have been carried out by some hedge fund managers in the course of bear raids on particular companies

if you 're sure you want to go the high risk route you could consider hot stocks or even bonds for companies countries with lower credit ratings and higher risk i think an underrated cost of investing is the tax penalties that you pay when you win if you are n't using a tax advantaged account for your speculating account you might want to open a self directed ira so that you can get access to more of the high risk options that you crave without the tax liability if any of those have a big payout you want your high growth money to be in a roth because it would be a shame to strike it rich while you 're young and then have to pay taxes on it when you 're older if you choose not to make these investments in a tax advantaged account try to hold your stocks for a year so you only get taxed at capital gains rates instead of as ordinary income if you choose to work for a startup buy your stock options as they vest so that if the company goes public or sells privately you will have owned those stocks long enough to qualify for capital gains if you want my actual advice about what i think you should do i would increase your 401k percentage to at least 10 with or without a match and keep that in low cost index funds while you 're young but moving some of those investments over to bonds as you get closer to retirement and your risk tolerance declines assuming you 're not in the 25 tax bracket all of your money should be in a roth 401k or ira because you can withdraw it without being taxed when you retire   the more money you put into those accounts now while you are young the more time it all has to grow the real risk of chasing the high risk returns is that when you bet wrong it will set you back far enough that you will lose the advantage that comes from investing the money while you 're young you 're going to have up and down years with your self selected investments why not just keep plugging money into the s&p which has its ups and downs but has always up over time

i did n't mean to imply that bankruptcy is a magical process i was using that to clarify my use of conservative vs. aggressive to be fair i guess it can vary depending on your perspective if you 're taking the perspective of the debt laden company then yes on the side of a higher value could be defined as aggressive if you 're taking the perspective of someone looking to acquire business i would say on the side of a higher value is conservative    if the debt is trading at say $ 0.20 on the dollar then yes i can agree that the market value of the debt is likely more representative of the book value i guess i was n't thinking of that type of extreme example a more common scenario i 'd encounter would be a the debt trading at maybe $ 0.95 on the dollar and b taking the perspective of someone looking to invest in the equity which is why i 'd say that it 's more conservative to use the higher value which is the book value   so i 'm persuaded that using market value of the debt can make sense in some cases but i would still argue that the book value might make more sense in other cases

why do they have to endorse every check every time they want to    deposit it they told you why they said it was because it was made out to one person and there were    others on the account that could withdraw money from the acct so    endorsing it acknowledged that the payee still wanted to deposit the    money knowing others could take the $ out the reason they insist on it may have something to do with their responsibility in case of abuse they are worried that you may be using your parents money without their knowledge and if it ends up being true and they did n't enforce the requirement they may also be liable i have a joint account with my spouse and they do not let us deposit checks written to both of us unless we both endorse this is similar and stems from the same concern so here 's the unusual situation in case of a death of a joint account holder the whole account is frozen until the estate is executed you can not deposit a check of a deceased person to such an account

the net return reported to you as a percentage by a mutual fund is the gross return minus the expense ratio   so if the gross return is x% and the expense ratio is y% your account will show a return of x   be aware that x could be negative too so with y = 1 if x = 10 as you might get from a stock fund if you believe historical averages will continue then the net return is 9 and you have lost y x times 100 = 10 of the gross return if x = 8 as you might get from a bond fund if you believe historical averages will continue then the net return is 7 and you have lost y x times 100 = 12.5 of the gross return and so on and so forth   the numbers used are merely examples of the returns that have been obtained historically though it is worth emphasizing that 10 is an average return averaged over many decades from investments in stocks and to believe that one will get a 10 return year after year is to mislead oneself very badly i think the point of the is that expense ratios are important and should matter a lot to you but that their impact is proportionately somewhat less if the gross return   is high but very significant if the gross return is low as   in money market funds   in fact some money market funds which   found that x < y have even foregone charging the expense ratio   fee so as to maintain a fixed $ 1 per share price   personally   i would need a lot of to invest in even a stock fund with 1 expense ratio

i admit in the long term there are a good number of to work out but in the end i want to see some system where people in general can seize the means to their own well being without stepping on one another   the management you talked about is another reason why i prefer worker co ops to be the optimum form of issuing business because its not just a few people in charge it 's a whole social group acting in     when you discuss the mom and pop store having no suppliers it would be good to promote some way of each money supply to have a share of each industry within it   there are always some people in every trade looking for their next job   they just have to find a supply where there trade is in demand   the process is self feeding   next off or course the mechanism of the system would work in a way that firm 's ca n't just pay themselves with their own debt they have to issue it to their creditors first and even then it 's practically impossible to accept your own debt as payment   you would have to take some from a competitor at best     what i 've been trying to do is find some system where no one institution or no one alliance holds the keys to the definition of value   if you have five to eight dictators fighting at once as opposed to one financial dictator who can oversee all like the fed scenario you just described it 's more possible for people who are freer relatively to survive freely between the borders of these of influence as they can play each dictator off the other   at least from your dialogue i can see you 're one of those who gets what i 'm trying to aim for     here 's another idea i 've explored with it that 's similar but may make the environment slightly different so let me know what you think   what i call the revolving tax window where the government accepts different both in quantity and specific of notes in intervals of every business quarter so that the demand for specific notes changes four times a year   from january until the end of march they could accept taxes in notes from firms a f h and t and for april into june it could be just b and s and so on   the options for note issuing could be set on a list of firms registered with the sec or whoever    the combination for the quarter could be picked at random by a algorithm so no firm could make a plan to be a market dictator and a sense of is maintained in the economy     obviously the more firms are properly registered on this list the more combinations of monetary combinations you have and the more power is distributed from too much control by anybody     what you can do is choose whether or not you want there to be less or more notes in the next quarter because just like fiscal policy and conventional monetary policy the extremes have trade offs but different ones to few currencies the economy may be stimulated but you get market dictators via monetary oligopoly even if temporary   too many you avoid market dictators who will be more focused on getting a real return by investing in competing ventures based on what will actually return investment but the economy may not be as stimulated   what do you think of this structural alternative   one of the sources i 've been building my economic policy on has been debt the first 5,000 years by david if anyone 's familiar

the first statement is talking about a sudden sharp increase in volume double or more of average volume with a sudden increase in price in other words there has been a last rush to buy the stock exhausting all the current bulls buyers so the bears sellers take over at least temporarily whilst the second statement is talking about a gradual increase in volume as the price up trends thus the use of a volume oscillator in other words in an uptrend the bulls buyers are gradually increasing in numbers sending the price higher and new buyers keep entering the market the opposite is the case for a down trend

yes many people operate accounts in usa from outside usa you need a brokerage account opened in the name of your sister and then her username and password remember that brokerages may check the location of login and may ask security questions before login so when your sister opens her account please get the security questions also note that usa markets open 7.00 pm or 8.00 pm ist depending on daylight savings in usa so this means when they close at 4:00 pm et it will be or am in india this means it will affect your sleeping hours if you intend to day trade also understand that there are some day trading restrictions and balances associate normally brokerages need 25,000 $ for you to be a day trader finally cfa is not a qualification to be a trader and desire to become a trader does n't make one a trader to give an analogy just because you want to be a does n't make you one it needs a lot of practice and discipline also since in bangladesh you will always convert the usa amount to currency and think of profits and losses in those terms this might actually be bad

we measure the value of gold by comparing it to other things sorry but there is no better answer than that there is no gold standard pun intended by which objects can be measured in value because value is a subjective term it would be comparable to asking how funny is an object different objects are funny to different people even if we gathered all the really funny object together there is no guaranty those objects would be funny next year unless we all agreed they were as part of a social contract which is basically what we do with currency while gold does not need a social contract in order for it to retain its value this is only because it is has been 1 very useful and 2 rare if either of these two factors change the value of gold will change which it has on several occasions rant about intrinsic value of gold below gold has no intrinsic value none whatsoever   intrinsic value makes just as much sense as a cat dog animal dog and cat are referring to two mutually exclusive animals therefore a cat dog is a nonsensical term intrinsic value the actual value of a company or an asset based on an underlying perception of its true value intrinsic value is perceived which means it is worth whatever you or a group of people think it is intrinsic value has nothing i repeat absolutely nothing to do with reality   the most obvious example of this is the purchase of a copy right you are assigning an intrinsic value to a copy right by purchasing it however when you purchase a copy right you are not buying ink on a page you are purchasing an idea someone 's that for all intensive purposes does n't even exist in reality by definition things that do not exist do not have intrinsic properties because things that do n't exist do n't have any natural properties at all intrinsic according to dictionary   belonging to the essential nature or constitution of a thing the intrinsic of a star an intrinsic property of an object is something we know that exists because it is a natural property of that object emit light we know this because we can measure the light coming from it it is not subjective intrinsic value by definition is the opposite of intrinsic

he is assuming flat structural growth    amazon is turning no profit because they are a services company not a hardware company they use all their money to invest in infrastructure to expand their services amd needs to spend a lot of money to operate a fab to produce chips while amazon keeps spending money to expand new business units offering greater services    imagine you are a toll bridge operator you build a bridge and collect a toll but instead of declaring the fees collected as profit you start construction of another bridge paid for by the profits of the first you are pretty careful not to go crazy with debt so you break even all the time    20 year later you have 10 bridges paying for the next ten to be built those 20 will pay for the next 20 their bridge membership club keeps customers using existing bridges and automatically brings in customers for newly built ones    of course it took amazon so long to catch the largest retailer and so little to double them    the next large play is really large the whole foods purchase they bought the foundational land for hundreds of small bridges to more easily connect them to even more bridge users    once amazon is done growing and they have thousands of bridges collecting tolls all over the world the money flow will be absolutely insane    but they will still be breaking even as they will be buying fleets of aircraft and other international chains for further delivery but the small profit they declare will still be pretty big it wo n’t be apple sized profit but it will be an amazing amount of revenue    amazon is to big box retail what big box retail was to mom pop retail the oxygen remover    they want to be the toll booth operator for all retail in the entire world

a technically strong stock or market is simply a stock or market which is up trending and has been up trending for a while just as a fundamentally strong stock is one with good fundamentals a stock that is healthy and making higher profits year after year and continually improving a technically strong stock has a healthy uptrend that continues to go up and up apple was technically strong until it hit $ 700 its price stayed above the 200 day ma for a long period until after it hit $ 700 then broke down through the 200 day ma shortly after the uptrend was over i will usually buy stocks which are both fundamentally and technically strong as a technically strong stock will generally stay technically strong longer if it also has strong and good fundamentals

while the us tax code does not directly impose an obligation to pay estimated taxes it does impose a penalty on individuals for failure to pay enough taxes either through withholding or estimated tax anyone can choose how s he wants to pay their taxes but they better deal with any consequences of not paying them instead of just complaining about it like most people do most people get the hatred towards the irs but most complaints are and should be directed towards congress who creates and messes around with the us tax code some people actually do not make estimated payments and pay any possible taxes with their returns knowing that there may be underpayment penalty for those people the penalty is relatively small compared to what they can do with the cash over a year 's time i.e. investing or paying down debt it 's their choice

the answer provide by @mbhunter is correct however there are contexts shorting in spot market and carrying the position over settlement usually does not entail payment of dividend to the broker one of the reason being post ex date the price of the share downward adjusts to the extent of the dividend so practically if you have shorted at 100 and post ex date assuming a dividend of 2 and no movement of the stock price the price would slide to 98 the party who the stock 100 now is sitting on a price of 98 and received a dividend of 2 which equates to 100 the above is also to the law of the country governing the exchange and the security exchange board regulations

if you can afford the cost and risk of 100 shares of stock then just sell a put option   if you can only afford a few shares you can still use the information the options market is trying to give you see below a standing limit order to buy a stock is essentially a synthetic short put option position 1   so deciding on a stock limit order price is the same as valuing an option on that stock options and standing limit orders are hard to value and the generally accepted math for doing so the black scholes merton framework is also generally accepted to be wrong because of black so rather than calculate a stock buy limit price yourself it 's simpler to just sell a put at the put 's own midpoint price accepting the market 's best estimate options market makers whole job and the purpose of the open market is price discovery so it 's easier to let them fight it out over what price options should really be trading at the result of that fight is valuable information use it sell a atm put option every month until you get exercised after which time you 'll own 100 shares of stock purchased at this will typically give you a much better cost basis several dollars better versus buying the stock at spot and it the valuation math onto the options market   meanwhile you get to keep the cash from the options premiums as well disclaimer markets do make mistakes   you will lose money when the stock drops more than the option market 's own estimate if you ca n't afford 100 shares or for some reason still want to be in the business of creating synthetic options from pure stock limit orders then you could maybe play around with setting your stock purchase bid price to approximately see your statistics book for how to set 1 standard deviation gives you a 30 chance of a fill 2 gives you a 5 chance etc disclaimer the above math probably has mistakes do your own work   it 's somewhat invalid anyway because stock prices do n't follow a normal curve so standard deviations do n't really mean a whole lot   this is where market makers earn their keep or not if you still want to create synthetic options using stock limit orders you might be able to get the options market to do more of the math for you try setting your stock limit order bid equal to something like this where is the strike price of a put option for the equity you 're trading   which option expiration and strike you use for depends on your desired time horizon and desired fill probability   to get probability you can look at the delta for a given option   the relationship between option delta and equity limit order probability of fill is approximately disclaimer there may be math errors here   again do your own work also while this method assumes option markets provide good estimates see above disclaimer about the markets making mistakes

to summarize your starting situation you want to possible paths no small business get a job invest the 300 k in safe liquid investments then move the maximum amount each year into your retirement accounts depending on which company you work for that could include 401 k regular or roth deductible ira roth ira the amount of money you can transfer is a function of the options they give you how much they match and the amount of income you earn for the 401 k you will invest from your paycheck but pull an equal amount from the remainder of the if you are married you can use the same procedure for your spouse 's account you current income funds any vacations or because you will not need to put additional funds into your retirement plan by your late 30 's the 300 k will now be fully invested in retirement account unfortunately you ca n't touch much of it without paying penalties until you are closer to age 60 each year before semi retirement you will have to invest some of your salary into non retirement accounts to cushion you between age 40 and age 60 invest start a business take a chunk of the   300 k and decide that in x years you will use it to start a small business this chunk of money must be liquid and invested safely so that you can use it when you want to you also do n't want to invest it in investments that have a risk of loss take the remaining funds and invest it as described in the no small business section you will completely convert funds to retirement funds earlier because of a smaller starting amount hopefully the small business creates enough income to allow you to continue to fund retirement or semi retirement but it might not comment regarding 5 year rules roth ira you have to remain invested in the roth ira for 5 years otherwise your withdrawal is penalized investing in stocks if your time horizon is short then stocks are too volatile if it drops just before you need the money it might not recover in time final advice get a financial adviser that will lay out a complete plan for a fixed fee they will discuss investment options types not particular funds they will also explain the tax implications of investing in various retirement accounts and how that will impact your semi retirement plans review the plan every few years as tax laws change

i would say it 's a bit more complicated than that do you understand what a market maker does   an ecn electronic communication network is a virtual exchange that works with market makers using a rebate structure that works by paying for orders adding liquidity and charges a fee for removing liquidity so liquidity is created by encouraging what are essentially limit orders orders that are outside of the current market price and therefore not immediately these orders stay in the book and are filled when the price of the security moves and triggers them   so direct answer is nyse arca is where market makers do their jobs these market makers can be floor traders or algorithmic when you send an order through your brokerage your broker has a number of options your order can be sent directly to an ecn exchange like nyse arca sent to a market making firm like americas formerly knight capital or is when the broker uses an in house service to execute your trade brokerages must disclose what they do with orders for example etrade 's this is a good graphic showing what happens in general along with the names of some common liquidity providers

so if my father signed up for the military at age 18 became an officer worked 30 years and spent very little buying used cars eating in amp having roommates to afford to buy me a car and pay for my education   an education where i worked worked extremely hard at to become a civil engineer with a high gpa and spent at least 100 hours my resume and interview skills to get a high paying entry level job where i replicate my fathers habits while being single choosing to not have children until i build capital learn to invest in my free time and live off of 35 of my income by leveraging wealth and having roommates    your telling me that since i am able to retire at age 35 on my current plan it is all due to luck luck    sure i 'm thankful that my dad sacrificed and gave me a privileged life with free education but that was n't luck that 's hard god damn work and i thank him everyday what he did for me to tell me it 's luck is borderline crazy    if you did n't have what i stated above be the person who works his ass off so your kids can have the privilege to retire at 40 if they make smart choices   or better yet borrow capital to get an education that pays you 60,000 pay it back and retire at 40 stop trying to act like it 's impossible investing is n't gambling it 's foolish to think so if you invest in index funds it will grow over a long period of time    the medical scenario is completely different and is mostly caused due to a lack of a free market and insurance system this is and should be fixed as a wealthy society    are ways to ensure you have medical coverage but again it 's difficult and should be made easier

gt the facebook ipo was n't a debacle    it really depends on how you see the markets   if they 're just a way for companies to rip off gullible investors then sure it was n't a debacle   but everyone except fb lost out of this one and it was n't just that the price went down it was also that nasdaq 's systems failed badly causing significant additional losses and impending lawsuits   i do n't think nasdaq could be happy about these results   i 'm really doubtful that early investors are happy about losing a chunk of value overnight   i doubt other companies who were trying to go public in this calendar year are by this   and frankly i doubt that fb overall is happy about this result   lots of people there have stock options options that they ca n't yet execute   lots more people there have options but decided to wait   some people who sold a lot of their stock are personally happy but is this good for facebook as a company   i do n't think so   after having an almost exclusively winning profile they become a public company and really badly right out of the gate it 'll take years to erase the bad perception created by this   so unless you 're one of a tiny number of fb insiders this was a debacle

sorry but i am absolutely correct   fractional reserve lending banking is simply that when someone deposits money into a bank the bank is allowed to loan that money out so long as they keep a reserve   if the reserve rate is 10 it 's much lower in reality and someone deposits $ 100 into the bank the bank can then loan out $ 90   that is fractional reserve lending at its most basics   now fractional reserve lending does have a multiplier effect   and this effect is exactly how i described it   let 's go back to the example   person a deposits the $ 100 the bank then loans $ 90 to person b person b spends it with person c person c takes the money and deposits back to the bank   now the bank has the $ 100 cash back $ 90 in loans and the $ 190 in deposits so they need to hold onto $ 19 as a reserve and can loan out $ 81   assuming the money cycles with 100 efficiency the bank can continue loaning out the same money until they are left with $ 1000 in deposits $ 900 in loans and the original $ 100 is the reserve   this is the multiplier effect

hmm almost   as someone who has worked for startups and firms as an consultant and is an investor i have a unique insight on both aspects so i really enjoyed this rant i do n't know if i necessarily agree with what she says but i think what it comes down to is the for every given situation   i 've seen firms do a ~3 month project for dollars i 've seen startups fail i 've seen startups not require investment money if anything no two situations have been alike actually   from the investment aspect roughly 1 in 10 companies that receive investments do not fail so it is an extremely risky business the author has no insight to this aspect which explains her rant   from a coder standpoint it is extremely frustrating being told a project has to be a certain way that will most likely guarantee its failure or generally fuck it over and it is being from a high up investor that never speaks to the software engineer directly

yeah me too as i said actually what i 'd really prefer is single payer but failing that getting health insurance separated from employment would be a big step forward if people really knew how much they are paying for health insurance things would change   i 've never worked for an employer that did n't renegotiate health insurance every year often changing insurance providers every year to the extent that hr departments are competent in finding the best value the current environment is pretty dynamic and competitive are individuals going to be as competent and well informed as hr departments i do n't know but i do know that simply making a market free does n't guarantee lower prices if consumers are ill informed and bad at making decisions   as for wages currently companies are not required to carry health insurance and many have dropped it already without increasing wages so i do n't see an upward pressure on wages from greater employee mobility   but it 's true that if there were a single large pool for insurance to be based off of large businesses would no longer get the pool advantage of health insurance over small businesses hence my preference for single payer or single group multi payer

a couple of thoughts from someone who 's kind of been there is the business viable at all a lot of people do miss the jumping off point where the should stop throwing good money after bad and just pull the plug on the business if the business is not that viable then selling it might not be an option if the business is still viable and i 'd get advice from a good accountant on this then i 'd be tempted to try and pull through to until i 'd get a good offer for the business do n't just try to sell it for any price because times are bad if it 's self sustaining and hopefully makes a little profit i does sound like their business is on the up again and if that 's a trend and not a fluke imho pouring more energy into not money would be the way to go do n't make the mistake of buying high and selling low so to speak i 'm also a little confused re their house do they own it or do they still owe money on it if they owe money on it how are they making their payments if they close the business do they have enough income to make the payments still before they find another job even if it 's just a part time job as to paying off their debts or at least helping with paying them off i 'd only do that if i was in a financial position to gift them the money anything else is going to wreak havoc with the family dynamics including co signing debt for them and everybody will wish they did n't go there ask me how i know re debt consolidation i do n't think it 's going to do much for them apart from costing them more money for something they could do themselves bankruptcy well are they bankrupt or are they looking for the get out of debt free card sorry to be so blunt but if they 're so deep in the hole that they truly have no chance whatsoever to pay off their debt ever then they 're bankrupt from what you 're saying they 're able to make the minimum payments they 're not really what i 'd consider bankrupt are your parents on a budget as duffbeer703 said depending on how much money the business is making they should be able to pay off the debt within a reasonable amount of time which again does n't make them bankrupt

if you find a particular stock to be overvalued at $ 200 for example and a reasonable value at $ 175 you can place a limit order at the price you want to pay if when the stock price falls to your desired purchase price the transaction takes place your broker can explain how long a limit order can stay open this method allows you to take advantage of flash crashes when some savvy stock trader decides to game the market this tactic works better with more volatile or low volume stocks if it works for an s&p500 tracking etf you have bigger problems another tactic is to put money into your brokerage cash account on a regular basis and buy those expensive stocks funds when you have accumulated enough money to do so this money wo n't earn you any interest while it sits in the cash account but it 's there ready to be deployed at a moment 's notice when you have enough to purchase those expensive assets

you should also update your net worth statement as well as an inventory of all your assets   unfortunately these are extremely time consuming but in the event that you pass away your loved ones will know all of your finances and it will be easier for them in a very difficult time    the net worth statement compiles just that your net worth   the net worth is compiled by subtracting your liabilities from you assets   assets include things such as cash money in accounts all estimated value of your household items any life insurance bonds mutual bonds and retirement money   the liabilities include amounts such as your mortgage second mortgage car loans unsecured loans credit cards student loans and life insurance loans   this statement is a great way to track year to year how you are doing on your finances and if you are where you need to be in order to retire when you would like the inventory is also very important this is used in the event that you have a fire or some sort of disaster that requires you to give a statement of any items you had in your home   this is a very difficult thing to go through and having this statement ready to hand over only makes thing easier   there are a couple ways to do this   some people take pictures of everything they have in their house and make notes of prices and values some people take a video of the whole house and some people write down item by item on the computer or on a piece of paper   whatever way you would like to do it is fine what works for one person does not necessarily work for the other

one aspect of this no matter which valuation method you choose is that there are limited shares available to buy other people already know those valuation methods and have decided to buy those shares paying higher than the previous person to notice this and take a risk so this means that even after you have calculated the company 's assets and future growth you will be possibly buying shares that are way more expensive and overvalued than they will be in the future you have to consider that or you may be stuck with a loss for decades and during that time the company will get new management or their industry will change completely undermining whatever fundamentals you originally considered

lets talk about price gouging laws intended to protect victims in a disaster that actually serve to make it more difficult to service the needy   allowing producers to charge a higher price for items that are in high demand water gas etc sends signals to other producers that profits are available this in turn gives them incentive   to make extraordinary efforts to service victims   no one is going to drive 200 miles to sell water if the price is limited by law there will be less water available for all   if huge profits are available to those entrepreneurs who take the risk to help people then more people will engage in the helping and more resources will be available for all the prices will eventually come down as supply is restored and as more competitors enter the area   tl;dr i would rather have expensive water in an emergency than no water

there seems to be a common sentiment that no investor can consistently beat the market on returns what evidence exists for or against this first off even if the markets were entirely random there would be individual investors that would consistently beat the market throughout their lifetime entirely by luck   there are just so many people this is a statistical certainty   so let 's talk about evidence of beating the market due to persistent skill i should hedge by saying there is n't a lot of good data here as most understandably most individual investors do n't give out their investment information but there are some ok datasets   there is weak evidence for instance that the best individual investors keep outperforming and interestingly that the trading of individual investors can predict future market movements   though the evidence is more clear that individual investors make a lot of mistakes and that these winning portfolios are not from commonly available strategies and involve portfolios that are much riskier than most   would recommend is there really no investment strategy that would make it likely for this investor to consistently outperform her benchmark there are so many papers many reasonable even out there about how to outperform benchmarks especially risk adjusted basis   not too mention some advisers with great track records and a sea of questionable websites   you can even copy most of what buffet does if you want remember though that the average investor by definition makes the average market return and then pays fees on top of that   if there is a strategy out there that is obviously better than the market and a bunch of people start doing it it quickly becomes expensive to do and becomes part the market   if there was a proven easy to implement way to beat the market everyone would do it and it would be the market so why is it that on this site or elsewhere whenever an active trading strategy is discussed that potentially beats the market there is always a claim that it probably wo n't work to start with there are a large number of clearly bad ideas posed here and elsewhere   sometimes though the ideas might be good and may even have a good chance to beat the market   like so many of the portfolios that beat the market though and they add a lot of uncertainty and in particular for this personal finance site risk that the person will not be able to live comfortably in retirement there is so much uncertainty in the market and that is why there will always be people that consistently outperform the market but at the same time why there will be few if any strategies that will outperform consistently with any certainty

first you will need a plan stating three main points you will have to decide what criteria you will use to answer these points you might use fundamental analysis to find what to buy and technical analysis to decide when to buy and when to sell your buy and sell triggers once you have a trading plan in place you would need to find a broker with conditional orders you can place conditional buy orders to get in a trade for example if the price moves above or below a target price you can place conditional stop loss orders if your trade goes against you and you can also place conditional profit target stops to automatically get out if rises to your desired profit target you can place one two or many conditional orders after hours which will enable you to trade without being in front of your screen all day long

there 's a serious mistake in your analysis granted in the traditional ira you avoid paying taxes on the $ 5000 now but you 're now stuck paying taxes on $ 2.2 million dollars when you withdraw it later obviously you 'll end up paying massively more than $ 1250 in taxes on this in the end as other people have pointed out if you can afford to cut the $ 1250 elsewhere in your budget you could still end up with the $ however let 's say just for argument that you do n't the question then becomes if you 're better off taking the tax hit on the $ 5,000 now or the $ 2.2 million later it also really matters how much money you 'll be withdrawing when you retire as well as how you 'll be doing the withdraws personally my goal is to be able to withdraw as much per year as my highest salary while working so clearly the roth ira is a good deal for me an important consideration here is that most people believe that their expenses will go down when they retire but the majority of retirees in some surveys have indicated that their expenses either stayed approximately the same or actually increased also quick reality check would the fact that you know you 'd be saving $ 1250 on your taxes by contributing to the ira actually cause you to contribute an extra $ 1250 to your retirement even if you personally would i highly doubt that most people with the exception of people who post on this site actually think that way especially given how little most people actually save for retirement
