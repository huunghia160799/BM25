credit card fraud protection by law credit card cash back programs provided by most cc issuers and debit card fees commonly imposed by the merchant the crux is that with cc transactions a small percentage is remitted to the issuing bank   since the banks are already making money hand over fist on cc 's they incentivize people to use them cc security is also lax because the merchant is responsible for fraudulent charges instead of the bank   if the merchant fails to check a signature they are held liable for all charges if the card holder reports a fraudulent transaction

there are several reasons why credit cards are popular in the us on the other hand debit cards do not have any of these going for them   a debit card does n't make much money for the bank unless you overdraw or something so banks do n't have incentive to push you to use them as much   as a result they do n't offer rewards other benefits some people say the ability to spend more than you have is a downside of a credit card   but it 's really an upside   the behavior of doing that when it is n't needed is bad but that 's not the card 's fault it 's the users   you can get a credit card with a very small limit if this is an issue for you the question i find interesting is why debit cards are more popular in your home country   i ca n't think of any advantage they offer besides free cash back   but most people in the us do n't use cash much either   i have to think in your home country the banks have a different revenue model or perhaps your country is n't as eager to offer tons of easy credit to everyone as the us is

the real reason credit cards are so popular in the us is that americans are lazy and broke and the credit card companies know how to market to that   have you ever heard of the $ 30k millionaires these were individuals that purchased as if they were some of the wealthy elite but had no real money to back it up american society has pushed the idea of living on credit for quite some time now an idea that is even by watching the us government operate solely on credit raise the debt ceiling much live in america for more than six months and you will be bombarded with pre approved deals with low introductory rates that are designed to sucker the average consumer into opening multiple accounts that they do n't need then they try and get you to carry a balance by allowing low minimum payments that could take in the neighborhood of 20 years to pay off depending on carried balance this in turn pads the credit companies pockets with all of the interest you now pay on the account the few truly wealthy americans do not purchase on credit

for me it is mostly for the fraud protection if i have a debit card and someone makes a fraudulent charge the money is removed from my bank account   from my understanding i can then file a fraud complaint with the bank to recover my money   however for some period of time the money is missing from my bank account   i 've heard conflicting stories of money being returned quickly while the complaint is undergoing investigation as well as money being tied up for several days weeks   it may depend on the bank with a credit card it is the banks money that is tied up

personally i use my credit cards for everything because i get reward points or cash back depending on the card and i build credit history i 've had credit cards since i was 18 now 22 and my credit score is in the higher end which i 'm told is pretty good for my age additionally since i put my rent and large purchases on my credit card i have a lot of reward points i use these to buy things i would n't normally buy to try them out and see if they bring any value into my life if not i did n't really lose anything but i have found value in some of those things i realize most of this is and consumerism at play but getting that extra little thing once in a while for free which is pretty nice

there are two things i can think of that might be different in other countries until 2013 american express visa and mastercard prevented businesses from charging extra for credit card usage and credit card surcharges still illegal in several states since credit card companies add a surcharge to credit card purchases and merchants ca n't pass that onto credit card users they just make everyone pay extra instead since everyone gets charged the credit card surcharge you might as well use a credit card and recoup some of that via rewards points almost all credit cards here have grace periods where you wo n't be charged interest if you pay back your loans in full within some period of time at least 21 days this makes credit cards attractive to people who do n't need a loan but like the convenience that credit cards provide not carrying cash extra insurance better fraud protection apparently grace periods are n't required by law here so this might be common in other countries as well

support and resistance only works as a self fulfilling prophecy if everyone trading that stock agrees there 's a resistance at so and so level and it is on such and such scale then they will trade accordingly and there will really be a support or resistance so while you can identify them at any time scale although as a rule the time scale on which you observed them should be similar to the time scale on which you intend to use them it 's no matter unless that 's what all the other traders are thinking as well especially if there are multiple possible s p levels for different time scales there will be no consensus and the whole system will break down as one cohort ruins the other group 's s p by not playing along and vice versa but often fundamentals are expected to dominate in the long run so if you are thinking of trades longer than a year support and resistance will likely become meaningless regardless it 's not like that many people can hold the same idea for that long anyhow

imo it 's usually not worth it and here 's why there 's a statistical distribution of how likely a unit may fail depending on its age probability is high for a short period after the unit comes into use because there are parts that were not thoroughly tested and manufacturing defects then all those defective parts fail and get replaces and the unit likely functions without faults for years then it reaches it lifetime end and again probability becomes much higher parts wear out and start failing one by one every unit comes with a manufacturer warranty of one to two years already and that warranty will likely cover any defect causes by materials and manufacturing defects the period when fault probability is initially high extended warranty only covers the unit for two to five years and most units have lifetime of about ten years this means that the extended warranty is in effect when it is least useful

certainly no one knows in advance how much a stock is going to swing around however there are measures of how much it has around in the past and there are people who will estimate the probability first of all there 's a measure of an individual stock 's volatility commonly referred to as beta a stock with a beta of 1 tends to rise and fall about as much as the market at large a stock with a beta of 2 in the meantime would rise 10 when the market is up 5 these are of course historical averages see wikipedia secondly you can get an implied measure of volatility expectations by looking at options pricing if a stock is particularly volatile the chance of a big price move will be baked into the price of the stock options note also that other things affect options pricing such as the time value of money for an options based measure of the volatility of the whole market see the volatility index aka the fear gauge vix   wikipedia chart looking at individual stocks as a group and there 's an oxymoron for you individual stocks are definitely much more likely to have big moves than the market besides netflix consider the bp oil spill or the tokyo electric power company 's incident i do n't have any detailed statistics on quantitatively how much mind you but in application a standard piece of advice says not to put more than 5 of your portfolio in a single company 's stock diversification protects you alternatively if you 're trying to play mr. sophisticated stock picker instead of just buying an index fund you can also buy insurance through stock options hedging your bets naturally this will eat up part of your returns if your pick was a good one

that 's a simplified layman 's argument that you have inflation has nothing to do with prices of goods but rather the purchasing power of the money itself it sounds like the same thing but the subtle difference is crucial to understanding monetary policy    look at the counterexample in places with super high inflation like venezuela people spend their entire paycheck the minute they get it because it 's value is declining     if you do n't know that gasoline is an inelastic product i really ca n't help you without significant amounts of time to helping you understand a subject that is frequently counterintuitive and hard to understand you should probably take an economics class it 's fascinating stuff    suffice to say literally everyone who studies this stuff agrees that a small amount of controlled inflation is beneficial to keeping money moving rapidly around the economy growth and activity in production of goods and services high inflation is very bad hyperinflation is worse deflation is the worst though it sounds great to people who do n't know what they are talking about    econ 101 take it love it

to add to @keshlam 's answer slightly a stock 's price is made up of several components the only one of these that is known even remotely accurately at any time is the book value on the day that the accounts are prepared even   completed cashflows after the books have been prepared contain some slight unknowns as they may be reversed if stock is returned for example or reduced by unforeseen costs   future cashflows are based on amongst other things how many sales you expect to make in the future for all time exercise for the reader how many iphone will apple sell in even known future cashflows have some risk attached to them customers may not pay for goods a supplier may go into liquidation and so need to change its invoicing strategy etc estimating the risk on future cashflows is highly subjective and depends greatly on what the analyst expects the exact economic state of the world will be in the future investors have the choice of investing in a risk free instrument this is usually taken as being modelled by the 10 year us treasury bond that is guaranteed to give them a return to invest in anything riskier than the risk free instrument they must be paid a premium over the risk free return that they would get from that the risk premium is related to how likely they think it is that they will not receive a return higher than that rate calculation of that premium is highly subjective if i know the management of the company well i will be inclined to think that the investment is far less risky or perhaps riskier than someone who does not for example since none of the factors that go into a share price are accurately measurable and many are subjective there is no right share price at any time let alone at time of ipo each investor will estimate these values differently and so value the shares differently and their trading based on their ever changing estimates will move the share price to an level in comments to @keshlam 's answer you ask if there is enough information to work out the share price if a company buys out the company before ipo dividing the price that this other company paid by the relative ownership structure of the firm would give you an idea of what that company thought that the company was worth at that moment in time and can be used as a for market price but it will not and can not accurately represent the market price as other investors will value the firm differently by estimating the criteria above differently and so will move the share price based on their valuation

as the comments above have been trying to get across the prospective employer is offering to pay you for the bonus unvested compensation that you would be losing by jumping ship right now to go work for them   they are not offering to buy any securities that you already hold regardless of whether they 're profitable or unprofitable example 1 you participate in your current company 's 401(k and your company matches your contributions at 50   however the matching funds are not yours immediately they vest in increments until you have been at the company for 5 years   let 's say you 've been there for 3 years and have contributed $ 50 k to the plan   your company has matched you at $ 25 k but only 60 of that $ 15 k has vested   if you leave right now for the new employer you 're leaving $ 10 k behind   so the new employer might offer to buy out i.e. pay you that $ 10 k to help encourage you to switch now   you might then counter their offer by pointing out that if you stay where you are that $ 10 k is coming to you tax deferred whereas their $ 10 k signing bonus would be taxed   so you ask for $ 15 k instead example 2 you work for a wall street investment bank   each december you receive a performance bonus   since you began working there your three yearly bonuses have been in order $ 500 k $ 750 k and $ 1m.   it 's june so you 've worked halfway towards your next bonus   you have a lot of incentive to not leave your current employer   a competing employer may offer to buy you out of your anticipated bonus by giving you a $ 1.25 m signing bonus since you 'd almost certainly not be eligible for a performance bonus during your first year there   you might negotiate with them and say i 'm on track for $ 2 m this year and then they would figure out if you 're really worth that much to them so you can see this all has to do with the prospective employer trying to compensate you for any income you 're already counting on receiving from your current employer   by jumping ship now you would be foregoing that guaranteed expected income so the competitor wants to remove that anchor that might be holding you back from making the move stocks options that you already own are irrelevant to the prospective employer   since you would n't be giving those up by changing jobs there 's no reason for them to factor into the equation

a stop loss order becomes a market order when a trade has occurred at or below the trigger price you set when creating the order this means that you could possibly end up selling some or all of your position at a price lower than your trigger price for relatively illiquid securities your order may be split into transactions with several buyers at different prices and you could see a significant drop in price between the first part of the order and the last few shares to mitigate this brokers also offer a stop limit order where you set not only a trigger price but also a minimum price that you are will to accept for your shares this reduces the risk of selling at rock bottom prices especially if you are selling a very large position however in the case of a flash crash where other sellers are driving the price below your limit that part of your order may never execute and you could end up being stuck with a whole lot of shares that are worth less than both your stop loss trigger and limit price for securities that are liquid and not very volatile either option is a pretty safe way to cut your losses for securities that are illiquid and/or very volatile a stop limit order will prevent you from cashing out at bottom dollar and giving away a bargain to lurkers hanging out at the bottom of the market but you may end up stuck with shares you do n't want for longer than originally planned it 's up to you to decide which kind of risk you prefer

unfortunately there is very little data supporting fundamental analysis or technical analysis as appropriate tools to time the market i will be so bold to say that technical analysis is meaningless on the other hand fundamental analysis has some merits for example the realization that cdos were filled with toxic mortgages can be considered a product of fundamental analysis and hence provided traders with a directional assumption to buy cdss however there is no way to tell when there is a good or bad time to buy or sell the market behaves like a random 50/50 motion there are many reasons for this and interestingly there are many fundamentally sound companies that take large dips for no reason at all depending on your goal you can either believe that this volatility will smooth over long periods and that the market has generally positive drift on the other hand i feel that the appropriate approach is to remain active you will be able to mitigate the large downswings by simply staying small and diversifying   not in the sense of traditional finance but rather looking for uncorrelated products remember volatility brings higher levels of correlation my second suggestion is to look towards products like options to provide a method of shaping your p l giving up upside by selling calls against a long equity position is a great example ground your trades with fundamental beliefs if need be but use your tools and knowledge to combat risks that may create long periods of drawdown

are you sure the question even makes sense in the present day world economy it 's unlikely that someone young who just started working has the means to put away any significant amount of money as savings and attempting to do so might actually preclude making the financial choices that actually lead to stability things like purchasing the right types and amounts of insurance buying outright rather than using credit to compensate for the fact that you committed to keep some portion of your income as savings spending money in ways that enrich your experience and expand your professional opportunities etc there 's also the ethical question of how viable sustainable saving is the mechanism by which saving ensures financial stability is by everyone hoarding enough resources to deal with some level of worst case scenario that might happen in their future this worked for past generations in the us because we had massive amounts relative to the population of stolen natural resources infrastructure built on enslaved labor etc it does n't scale with modern changes the world is undergoing and it inherently only works for some people when it 's not working for others from my perspective much more valuable financial skills for the next generation are

for example it is not allowed to buy flood insurance at peak flood season and then cancel it when it is over they are not offering this right now so it would be interesting to see if they offer this and how they offer this for example you can insure your camera for a week when you are going on vacation they call it on demand insurance they segment is targeting consumer electronics more often people do n't take insurance in this segment as the insurance cost is high and benefits low however if going on vacation most are afraid of loosing damaging equipments generally although we are afraid most often nothing happens it is this segment you make the insurance cheap and easy to buy and create a new segment   insurance fraud detection is an important part of insurance process such that insurance companies allocate a lot of resources to detect improper insurance claims the website does not mention how they process claims although it looks easy they may have a more stringent process for example what is stopping me from buying an insurance after event i.e. break my phone monday buy insurance on monday and make a claim on tuesday saying the phone broke on tuesday

first do n't save anything in a tax sheltered vehicle you will be paying so little tax that there will be essentially no benefit to making the contributions and you 'll pay tax when they come out tax free compounding for 40 years is terrific but start that after you 're earning more than a stipend second most people recommend having a month 's expenses readily available for emergencies for you that would be $ 1500 if you put $ 100 a month aside it will take over a year to have your emergency fund it 's easy to argue that you should pick a higher pace so as to have your emergency money in place sooner however the emergencies usually cited are things like home repair car repair needing to replace your car and so on since you are renting your home and do n't have a car these emergencies are n't going to happen to you ask yourself if your home was destroyed and you had to replace all your clothes and possessions including furniture how much would you need keep in mind any insurance you have the only emergency expense i ca n't guess about is health costs because i live in canada i would be tempted to tell you to get a credit card with a $ 2000 limit and consider that your emergency fund just because grad student living is so tight to the bone been there and 25 years ago i had $ 1200 a month so it must be harder for you now if you do manage to save up $ 1500 and you 've really been pinching to do that walking instead of taking the bus staying on campus hungry instead of popping out to buy food let up on yourself when you hit the target delaying your graduation by a few months because you 're not mentally sharp due to hunger or will be a far bigger economic hit than not having saved $ 200 a month for 2 or 3 years the former is 3 6 months of your new salary the latter 5 you know what you 're likely to earn when you graduate right

while i totally agree with you talking to free market people you have to address it this way    their point is that they should pay what the market bears not what you want to make   that is fair     but that market has shown they need to pay more but they ca n't do it      roofing is a perfect example    charge $ 6000 for a roof materials cost $ 2000    labor costs $ 800    the rest is additional expenses and profit   even if you have to give your roofers a 25 raise that is $ 200   you are n't going out of business even if you have to absorb the increase and you ca n't tell me you ca n't raise your prices by $ 200 when your competitors are all over the board   i guarantee that if the cost of shingles go up the cost of a roof is raised no second thought    the problem is that they think their competitors are still paying the old rate   they are no longer competitive if they give a raise they are no longer competitive

there are moral distinctions that can be drawn between gambling and investing in stocks first and i think most important in gambling you are trying to get money for nothing you put $ 100 down on the roulette wheel and you hope to get $ 200 back in investing you are not trying to get something for nothing you are buying a piece of a hopefully profit making company you are giving this company the use of your money and in exchange you get a share of the profits that is you are quite definitely giving something the use of your money for a period of time you invest $ 100 of your money and you hope to see that grow by maybe $ 5 or $ 10 a year typically you may get a sudden windfall of course you may buy a stock for $ 100 today and tomorrow it jumps to $ 200 but that 's not the normal expectation second gambling is a zero sum game if i gamble and win $ 100 then someone else had to lose $ 100 investing is not a zero sum game if i buy $ 100 worth of stock in a company and that grows to $ 200 i have in a sense won $ 100 but no one has lost $ 100 to give me that money the money is the result of the profit that the company made by selling a valuable product or service to customers when i go to the grocery store and buy a dozen eggs for $ 2 some percentage of that goes to the stockholders in the grocery store say 5 cents so did i lose 5 cents by buying those eggs no to me a dozen eggs are worth at least $ 2 or i would n't have bought them i got exactly what i paid for i did n't lose anything carrying that thought further investing in the stock market puts money into businesses it enables businesses to get started and to grow and expand assuming these are legitimate businesses they then provide useful products and services to customers gambling does not provide useful products and services to anyone except to the extent that people enjoy the process of gambling in which case you could say that it is equivalent to playing a video game or watching a movie third and these are all really related the whole goal of gambling is to take something from another person while giving him nothing in return again if i buy a dozen eggs i give the store my $ 2 or whatever amount and i get a dozen eggs in exchange i got something of value and the store got something of value we both walk away happy but in gambling my goal is that i will take your money and give you nothing in return it is certainly true that buying stocks involves risk and we sometimes use the word gamble to describe any risk but if it is a sin to take a risk then almost everything you do in life is a sin when you cross the street there is a risk that you will be hit by a car you did n't see when you drink a glass of water there is the risk that it is contaminated and will poison you when you get married there is a risk that your spouse will divorce you and break your heart etc we are all we all sin every day but we do n't sin quite that much btw i do n't think that gambling is a sin nothing in the bible says that gambling is a sin but i can comprehend the argument for it i think gambling is foolish and i do n't do it my daughter works for a casino and she has often said how seeing people lose money in the casino regularly reminds her why it is stupid to gamble like she once commented on people who stand between two slot machines feed them both coins and then pull the levers down at the same time so that she said they can lose their money twice as fast

my own personal point of view i earn about twice what my wife to be earns we are planning on getting married next year   i ultimately do all the finances basically because she hates that kind of thing not because i 'm in charge or whatever to work out how we do this i wrote a spreadsheet   at the top it has my monthly pay in one column and her 's in another i add all our bills against me at the bottom i have a total of both of our spending money spending money is wage bills savings i then move money out of my column into her column my goal is that we pay all the bills and save a decent amount and have roughly the same amount to spend each month so each persons spending money should be roughly equal i then fine tune this as things change if we get a pay rise we alter it if a bill goes up or down we alter it to manage this we have 4 accounts a joint account to pay bills both give a set amount to each a savings acount both give a set amount to each month and our own accounts where we get paid and where our spending money lives like everyone else says this seems fair to me i do n't earn more we both earn an amount and this should be split equally

my wife and i use a digital form of the envelope system we call it a budget we record how much we want to allocate each month to spend for each category of expense in a spread sheet why use prepaid cards why not open a bunch of bank accounts and use debit cards from each if you want to separate the money you could also keep a ledger for each account that you spend from on a smart phone or even in a physical ledger   the reason for the envelope method is that it psychologically hurts some people to physically part with cash once you it in some factor you lose what is the primary touted benefit and it 's no longer the envelope system the secondary benefit that once the budget for one category is gone it 's gone is only as good as the discipline you have to not rob cash from another envelope why is this any easier than the discipline of not debiting beyond the bottom of the ledger so a budget is a digital version of the envelope system once the physical cash is removed from the equation it 's definitely not the envelope system sorry for the contrarian take on this question but i 've never been a fan of the envelope system for many of the reasons you have described i guess i 'm too young for the cash psychology to work for me

this very much depends how you use that second line of credit and what your current credit is there are of course many more combinations buy you can probably infer the impact based on these cases    your credit score is based on your likely hood of being profitable to a creditor should they issue you credit this is based on your history of your ability to manage your credit   having more credit and managing it well shows that you have a history of being responsible with greater sums of money available   if you use the card responsibly now then you are more likely to continue that trend than someone with a history of irresponsibility   having a line but not using it is not a good thing   it costs the creditor money for you to have an account   if you never use that account then you are not showing that you can use the account responsibly so if you are just going to throw the card in a safe and never access it then you are better off not getting the card in the first place

ditto mhoran_psprep   i 'm not quite sure what you 're asking where does the money come from when someone starts a bank they normally get together a bunch of investors perhaps people they know personally perhaps they sell stock to raise initial capital but most of the money in the bank comes from depositors fundamentally what a bank does is take money from depositors and loan it to borrowers banks also borrow money from other banks and from the government they charge the borrowers interest on the loan and they pay depositors interest on their deposits the difference between those two interest rates is where the bank gets their profit where does the money go when you pay it back as mhoran_psprep said some of it goes to pay interest to the depositors some of it goes to pay the bank 's expenses like employee salaries cost of the building etc and some of it goes as profit to the owners or stockholders of the bank if you 're thinking wow i 'm paying back a whole lot more than i borrowed well yes but remember you 're borrowing that money for 20 or 30 years the bank is n't making very much money on the loan each year that you have it these days something like 4 or 5 in the u.s. i do n't know what the going rates are in other countries

buying the right shares gives higher return buying the wrong ones gives worse return possibly negative the usual recommendation even if you have a pro advising you is to diversify most of your investments to reduce the risk even though that may reduce the possible gain a mutual fund is diversification in a can it requires little to no active maintenance yes you pay a management fee but you are n't paying per transaction fees every time you adjust your holdings and the management costs can be quite reasonable if you pick the right funds minimal in the case of computer managed index funds if you actively enjoy playing with stocks and bonds and are willing able to accept your failures and less than great choices as part of the game and if you can convince yourself that you will do better this way go for it for those of us who just want to deposit out money watch it grow and maybe rebalance once a year if that index funds are a perfectly good choice i spend at least 8 hours a day working for my money the rest of the time i want my money to work for me   risk and reward tend to be proportional to each other when they are n't market prices tend to move to correct that you need to decide how much risk you 're comfortable with and how much time and effort and money you 're willing to spend managing that risk personally i am perfectly happy with the better than market rate of return i 'm getting and i do n't have any conviction that i could do better if i was more involved your milage will vary if folks did n't disagree there would n't be a market

i agree with the first the first step is to measure your spending and put it down into raw numbers once you have the raw numbers you will feel a natural inclination to improve on those numbers set yourself a daily target for cash incidental expenses it does nt have to be a crazy target just something you can achieve easily mark a tick mark next to every day on the calendar that you meet that target or spend less than the target gradually the momentum from the past few ticks will automatically compel you to want to tick off the next day   at the end of each week lower the target a little you 'll find that when you start measuring your expenditure you become more aware of how you might be wasting money all too often we just go out and buy stuff we do n't need without really thinking about it

ianal i have not been vat registered myself but this is what i have picked up from various sources you might want to confirm things with your solicitor or accountant as i understand it there is a critical difference between supplying zero rated goods services and supplying exempt goods services   if the goods services are zero rated then the normal vat rules apply you charge vat on your outputs at a rate of 0 and can claim back vat on your inputs at whatever rate it was charged at depending on the type of goods if the goods services are exempt you do n't charge and vat on your outputs and ca n't claim back any vat on your inputs things get complicated if you have a mixture of exempt and non exempt outputs according to adsense income is a buisness to buisness transaction with a company in another eu country and so from a supplier point of view you are the supplier google is the customer it counts as a zero rated transaction

or we could allow market forces to work    my suggestion be to outlaw price charging different people different rates force providers to disclose prices publicly and discourage patients from paying everything through a middle man type and purchase more services upfront we then institute a national catastrophic insurance to trigger in life death situations and we could then reimburse lower income people later with a government program but the amount of reimbursement needs to be hidden from the service provider because if they know how much the patient gets reimbursed they will just charge more

in general prices are inversely proportional to rates however accurate interest rate prediction would make one worthy of managing a large credit derivative hedge fund this is not to say that interest rates can not go up in canada since the world is currently undergoing a resource bust and the united states has begun exporting more oil even trying to recently open the market to europe both of which canada is relatively dependent upon also to say that canada currently has the most overpriced real estate is an oversight to say the least considering china currently has entire cities that are empty because prices are too high a ten to twenty percent drop in real estate prices would probably be a full blown financial crisis and since mortgage rates are currently around 2.5 a one to two hundred basis point rise could mean a nearly 50 decrease in real estate prices if interest payments are held constant   canada would either have to start growing its economy at a much higher rate to encourage the central bank to raise rates to such a height or oil would have to completely collapse suddenly to cause a possible collapse of cad to encourage the same the easiest relationship to manipulate between prices and rates is the perpetuity where p is the price i is the interest payment and r is the interest rate   in this case an increase of r from 2.5 to 4.5 would cause a decrease in p if i is held constant   however typical canadian mortgages seem to mature in ten years at a fixed rate so i can not be held constant and the relationship between r and p is less strong at earlier maturities thus the most likely way for prices to collapse is for a financial collapse as described above

after hours trading and alternate venues allow one to trade outside of regular market hours however there are a few reasons why you would not want to the purpose of an exchange is to improve liquidity by gathering all buyers and sellers in the same place at the same time if trading was 24/7 not all market participants would be trading at the same time some markets including nasdaq depend on market makers or specialists to help liquidity these exchanges are able to mandate that the market maker actively make a market in a security during a meaningful percentage of the trading day requiring 24/7 active market making may not be reasonable trading systems meaning both exchange infrastructure and market participant infrastructure need maintenance time it 's nice to have the evenings and weekends for scheduled work post trade clearing and settlement procedures are still somewhat manual at times you need staff around to handle these processes

if the mortgage is against your primary residence then the only part that 's probably deductible is the mortgage interest   if you pay down your loan principal faster then all other things being equal you 'll get less of a tax deduction because you 'll accrue less interest in the months after you throw a big chunk at the principal the principal is less so the interest is less but do n't worry that 's all right   it 's a tax deduction so your actual tax savings will be only a fraction of the interest you paid so at the end of the day you 'll be saving yourself money

i do n't know whether you 'd consider buying a single bond instead of a fund strips are treasuries where the coupons have been stripped to produce debt instruments with a fixed maturity date they pay zero interest their value comes from the fact that you buy them at a price less than 100 and they are worth exactly 100 at some point in the future you can buy them with any year month that you wish they are backed by the federal government and are considered to have no default risk like most bonds the price is actually a percentage and they mature at a 100 the one that expires costs and returns 100 on the expiration date the price list is here there 's more information about them here first of all they are still t bonds in all but the most    sense which means they are the safest most risk free investment    possible the u.s. federal government has stellar credit and a record    of never defaulting these bonds have no call features so the timing and distribution of    bond payments can not be altered by any foreseeable occurrence they are sold at a known and generally deep discount off a known    face value that can be redeemed at a known date so buyers know    exactly how much they will earn from an investment in strips

in my experience financial advisors do not normally assist with budgeting and personal everyday finance there certainly are people who do that but you would normally only consult them when you have financial difficulties especially debt the more common find of financial advisor is mostly focussed on advising you about savings and investments a lot work for banks and investment companies they will usually advise you for free the downside being that they will only recommend their company 's products this may or may not be a bad thing depending on the company others will charge you a commission on purchases and their advice will be more neutral this question will also be interesting are all financial advisors compensated in the same way

unfortunately i 've seen every single example you 've provided from the health care providers perspective   trust me they are n't happy about the situation either hence the reason they will demand up front payment from you based on who your insurance carrier is   i could name a few of the top brand name insurance companies in this country that do all of this to their clients    medical billing is an incredibly over complicated beast   one that insurance companies have been doing everything they can to make worse over the years   the codes can change annually and there are many different codes which can cover the exact same situation   sure the insurance company might cover but if you happen to be pregnant well that may not covered even though the treatment is the exact same what can you do consider locating a new insurance company   you do have options and do n't have to go with the one your company uses   the downside is that this is going to take quite a bit of research on your part and it will end up costing you more money on your monthly premiums simply because your company wo n't be footing part of the bill    talk to other co workers and see if their experiences match yours   if so try to get a large enough group together to approach management and demand resolution    a third potential avenue is to get politically involved but i 'm enough of a pessimist that i doubt that would do any good   from what i 've seen neither major political party 's current position actually does anything to solve the problem a fourth option is suing the insurance company but that is going to be incredibly expensive and take forever   you might have better luck getting together with a bunch of local people and demand your attorney general review the billing payment practices again this is going to require a lot of effort a fifth option is to attempt to cash pay your bills and submit them yourself to the insurance company for reimbursement   if you do this you can likely negotiate lower bills with the medical provider   for anything less than about $ 2,000 i negotiate the amount prior to service   believe me when i say that providers are more than happy to give decent discounts if they know they wo n't have to deal with the insurance companies themselves   slightly more work for you but could be far cheaper in the long run

i will disagree with some of the other answers here   in my view the most important dimension of the situation is not your friend 's potential loss but the potential losses of the people he may convince by using his position as youth group leader etc to draw more them into the scam exactly how to handle this depends on many factors that are n't mentioned in your question and probably rightly so as this aspect of the situation moves beyond personal finance   for instance if your friend is a of the community who is widely trusted and you are not there may be little you can do since people will believe him and not you   if you have some influence over the groups he is trying to recruit you can attempt to provide a to his recruitment activities again how to do this depends on other factors such as how he is recruiting them   if he is just privately contacting individuals and inviting them to these meetings you may have to just keep your eyes for anyone who seems tempted and try to dissuade them before they suffer the brainwashing   if he actually tries to do some sort of public recruitment e.g. holding a meeting himself you could try to inject doubt by e.g. attending and asking probing questions to expose the dangers   if you think the danger is widespread you could consider taking some more public action like writing a column in a local paper about this organization of course another major factor is how much you think people stand to lose by this   however in your question you indicated that your friend has invested multiple month or years of income   if he intends to pressure others to invest similar amounts this sounds to me like enough danger to warrant some preventive action   few people can afford to lose months or years of income and sadly those most vulnerable to a scammer 's song are often those who can least afford it   it does n't sound like a situation where you 'd have to devote your life to the cause of stopping it but if i knew that dozens of people in my community stood to lose years of income i 'd want to make at least a small effort to stop them rather than just keep my mouth shut in doing this you may lose your friendship   however you stated that your goal is to resolve the situation in a way that is best with lowest loss of money for everybody   if you really take this utilitarian view it is likely that you may have to give up on the friendship to prevent other people from losing more money

to answer your question as clarified in a comment all i wanted to know what will happen if i enter my debit card number in the sixteen digit account number they offer on the application for balance transfer that 's all almost certainly subject to the particular terms and conditions of the offer no money will move the only question is exactly when and how they will say no if you do it online and their system is clever enough to look up the the first six digits of the card number you enter their system might learn straight away that you   have entered a debit card number eg a card starting is a bank of ireland debit card otherwise you 'll have to wait until the request goes to their back office system which will eventually lead to the card issuer 's system being contacted at which point it will become clear that it 's a debit card and your transfer request will be refused at that point that said some credit card companies do offer a money transfer aka super balance transfer which is an offer to transfer money directly into a bank account putting the resulting debt on the credit card i 've never seen these offered without having to call a service centre and talk to a person though presumably so that they can check that the details they have for you about income etc are still correct

the most important thing is not to tell yourself i 'll save more later in my career when i have more disposable income because of two factors 1 you will get raises over your career but unless you make it big it will never really feel like you have extra money you may double or triple your salary over a career but it usually happens in small increments which your lifestyle tends to adjust upwards to meet even though it does n't feel like it 2 later in your career you may have more money to save but now the commodity you have is time your total savings at retirement are going to be influenced in a massive way by both of these factors a good strategy is save something early in your career even if it feels like an insignificant amount then save larger amounts later in your career when you are earning more but have less time for your investments to grow and less tolerance for high risk high growth investments

indefinitely is easy to answer assume that the average house currently costs four times the average salary and that house prices rise 1 faster than salaries indefinitely then in only 1,000 years time the average house will cost around times the average salary in 10,000 years it will be 6.5 times the average salary that does n't seem plausible to me if you want arguments about for the foreseeable future instead of indefinitely then that 's harder

the stock market at large has about a 4.5 long term real real inflation fees etc adjusted rate of return yes even in light of the recent crashes that means your money invested in stocks doubles every 16 years so savings when you 're 25 and right out of college are worth double what savings are worth when you 're 41 and four times what they 're worth when you 're 57 you 're probably going to be making more money when you 're 41 but are you really going to be making two times as much in real terms and at 57 will you be making four times as much and if you have n't been saving at all in your life do you think you 're going to be able to start and make the sacrifices in your lifestyle that you may need and will you save enough in 10 years to live for another 20 30 years after retirement and what if the economy tanks again and your company goes under and you 're out of a job when you turn 58 having tons of money at retirement is n't the only worthy goal you can pursue with your money ask anyone who saves money to send kids to college but having some money at retirement is a rather important goal and you 're much more at risk of saving too little than you are of saving too much in the us most retirement planners suggest 10 15 as a good savings rate coincidentally the standard us 401(k plan provides a tax deferred vehicle for you to put away up to 15 of your income for retirement   if you can save 15 from the age of onward you probably will be at least as well off when you retire as you are during the rest of your life that means you can spend the rest on things which are meaningful to you well you should also keep around some cash in case of emergencies or sudden unemployment and it 's never a good idea to waste money but your responsibilities to your future have at least been satisfied and in the uk you get tax relief on your pension contribution at your income tax rate and most employers will match your contributions

i had an hsa for two or three years i found very routinely that my insurance company had negotiated rates with in network providers so as i never hit the deductible i always had to pay 100 of the negotiated rate but it was still much less than the providers general rate sometimes dramatically so like i had some blood and urine tests done and the general rate was $ 450 but the negotiated rate was only $ 40 i had laser eye surgery and the general rate was something like $ 1500 but the negotiated rate was more like $ 500 et cetera other times it was the same or trivially different like routine office visits it made no difference i found that i could call the insurance company and ask for the negotiated rate and they would tell me when i asked the doctor or the hospital they either could n't tell me or they would n't it 's possible that the doctor 's office does n't really know what rates they 've agreed to they might have just signed some contract with the insurance company that says yes we 'll accept whatever you give us but either way i had to go to the insurance company to find out you 'd think they 'd just publish the list on a web site or something after all it 's to the insurance company 's advantage if you go to the cheapest provider with a regular non hsa plan they 're share of the total is less even with an hsa plan if you go to a cheaper provider you are less likely to hit the deductible yes medical care in the u.s. is rather bizarre in that providers routinely expect you to commit to paying for their services before they will tell you the price can you imagine any other industry working this way can you imagine buying a car and the dealer saying i have no idea what this car costs if you like it great take it and drive it home and in a few weeks we 'll send you a bill and of course whatever amount we put on that bill you are legally obligated to pay but we refuse to tell you what that amount will be the american medical association used to have a policy that they considered it unethical for doctors to tell patients the price of treatment in advance i do n't know if they still do

is investing a good idea with a low amount of money yes i 'll take the angle that you can invest in penny stocks there 's nothing wrong with that the oversimplified suggestion i would make is to answer the question about your risk aversion this is the four e.g.   you are introduced to when you first sit down to open your brokerage stocks or employer retirement account 401 k along with a release of liability in the language of past performance is not an indicator which you will not truly understand until you experience a market crash the reason i say this is because if you are 100 risk averse then it is clear which vehicles you want to have in your tool belt t bills cds money market and plain vanilla savings absolutely nothing wrong with this do n't let anyone make you feel otherwise with remarks like your money is not working for you sitting there it 's extremely important to be absolutely honest with yourself in doing this assessment too for example i thought i was a risk taker except when the market tumbled i reacted exactly how a knee jerk investor would also i feel it 's not easy to know just how honest you are with yourself as we are humans and not impartial machines so the recommendation i would give is to make a strong correlation to casino gambling in other words conventional advice is to only take play money to the casino this because you assume you will lose it then you can enjoy yourself at the casino knowing this is capital that you are okay throwing in the trash   i would strongly caution you to only ever invest capital in the stock market that you characterize as play money i 'm convinced financial advisors fund managers friends will disagree still i feel this is the only way you will be completely okay when the market fluctuates you wo n't lose sleep if you choose this approach then you can start investing any time that five drachma you were going to throw away on lottery tickets transfer it into your roth ira that twenty yen that you were going to ante in your weekly poker night transfer it into your index fund you already got past the investors remorse of losing that money if you truly accept that amount as play money then you can put it into penny stocks i 'll get lots of criticism here however i maintain that once you are truly okay with throwing that cash away like you would drop it into a slot machine then it 's the same whether you lose it one way or in another investment vehicle

to try and address your how   it goes a bit like this you need to first assess how your stuff is invested if for example half is in stocks and the other half is in bonds then you will need to calculate a blended rate for what are reasonable average return for both that might mean looking at the s&p500 or russell 3000 for the stock portion and some bond index for that portion then blend the rates in this case using a formula like this then compare the blended rate with the return in your ira it is generally a lot more useful to compare the various components of your total return separately especially if you investing with a particular style such as agressive growth or you are buying actual bonds and not a bond fund since most of the bond oriented indexes are for bond funds which you ca n't really compare well with buying and holding bonds to maturity lets say your stock side was two mutual funds with different styles one large cap the other aggressive growth   in that case you might want to compare each one of those funds with an appropriate index such as those provided by morningstar   if you find one of them is consistently below the average you might want to consider finding an alternative fund who 's manager has a better track record bearing in mind that past performance for me maybe someone has a good suggestion here bonds are the hard thing to judge   the normal goal of actually owning bonds as opposed to a fund is to retain the entire principal value because there 's no principal fluctuation if you hold the bond to maturity as long as you choose well and the issuer does n't default    the actual value right now of a bond as in selling before maturity and bond funds goes up and down in an inverse relationship with interest rates   that means the indexes for such things also go up and down a lot so it 's very hard to compare them to a bond you intend to hold to maturity also for such a bond there 's not a lot of point to switch out unless you are worried about the issuer defaulting   if rates are up from what you are getting on your bonds then you 'll have to sell your bond at a discount and all that happens is you 'll end up holding a different bond that is worth less but has higher interest basically the net return is likely to be pretty much the same   the better approach there is generally to ladder your maturity dates so you get opportunities to reinvest at whatever the prevailing rates are without having to sell at a discount   anyway the point is that i 'm not sure there 's a lot of value to comparing return on the bond portion of an ira unless it 's invested in bond funds which a lot of people wanting to preserve principal tend to avoid

edit i think it 's a fairly straightforward cause amp effect   you tax the transactions it lowers the incentive to do frequent trading   so yes i do think it would limit it effectively   i 'm under no illusion that speculating will end   but i think we need to dial it back a bit so that investment is the primary driver in the market not gambling   i 'm not anti speed but the markets serve a real purpose   they allow for liquidity amp for useful capital allocation   and liquidity is nothing if all the machines are set to sell sell sell   this is what caused some of the crashes   also we had liquidity prior to all this high frequency trading   i 'm unsure that the added liquidity makes up for the cons of turning an investment engine into a gambling engine   you do nt even have to believe me   there are a few big time investors that say they are out of the market because it is no longer governed by reason

correct by putting expenses on to a credit card which does not charge interest during the grace period and paying that balance every month in effect you earn interest on money you 've already spent however first savings account interest is something like .05 right now depending on your bank yeah it 's money but seriously that 's 4 cents per month on $ 1000   second two things can make this very wrong if you carry a balance you 'll pay much more in interest than you 'd get from practically any investment you could make with the cash in the meantime second a debit card can be used to get cash you already have from an atm not everyone takes credit you know and it 'll cost you little or nothing use a credit card for the same purpose and you 're paying 40 from the second the money comes out of the machine also correct rewards cards earn you more the more they 're used that 's because the card issuer makes money based on usage they get 3 of each transaction they 're happy to turn 1 of that up to a limit or subject to a spending floor back around to you again check the terms and conditions most cards have a limit on total rewards many of them also have fees either while you hold the card or when you try to redeem the rewards look for a card with high limits or no limits on rewards from spending and with no annual fee or reward redemption fee in addition to the above you build good credit history with good spending patterns however your credit score can fluctuate wildly because on one day you have very low leverage percent of credit limit used and on the next you 've bought $ 200 in groceries and so your leverage went up 20 on a card with a $ 1000 limit leverage under 10 is good leverage under 40 is ok and leverage over that starts looking bad with a $ 1000 limit with you maxing it out and then paying it off your credit score can fluctuate by 30 points on any given day

a large number of bond holders decide to sell their bonds   if they all decide to do this at the same time then there will be a large supply of bonds being sold in the market   this will drive down the price of the bonds which will increase yields why do bond yields move inversely to bond prices you purchase a $ 100 bond today that yields 5   you spent $ 100   the very next day the same bonds are being sold with a yield of 10   if you wanted to sell your bond to someone you would have to sell it so it competed with the new bonds being sold   you could not sell it for $ 100 which is what you paid for it   you would have to sell it for less than the $ 100 you paid for it in order for it to have the equivalent yield of the new bonds being sold with a 10 yield   this is why bond yields move inversely to bond prices why does rising yields increase the cost of borrowing if someone is trying to sell new bonds they will have to sell bonds that compete with the yields of the current bonds already in the market if yields are rising on the existing bonds then the issuer of the new bonds will have to pay higher interest rates to offer equivalent yields on the new bonds the issuer is now paying more in interest making it more expensive to borrow money what are the incentives for the bond to sell his her bonds one reason a bond holder will sell his her bonds is they believe inflation will outpace the yield on the bond they are holding   if a bond yields 3 and inflation is at 5 then the bond holder is essentially losing purchasing power if they continue to hold onto the bond   another reason to sell would be if the bond holder has doubts in the ability of the issuer to repay the interest and/or principal of the bond

all you have to do is ask warren buffet that question and you 'll have your answer grin   he is the very definition of someone who relies on the fundamentals as a major part of his investment decisions investors who rely on analysis of fundamentals tend to be more long term strategic planners than most other investors who seem more focused on momentum based thinking there are some industries which have historically low p e ratios such as utilities but i do n't think that implies poor growth prospects   how often does a utility go out of business    i think oftentimes if you really look into the numbers there are companies reporting higher earnings and earnings growth but is that top line growth or is it the result of cost cutting and other measures which artificially imply a healthy and growing company   a healthy company is one which shows year over year organic growth in revenues and earnings from sales not one which has to continually make new acquisitions or use accounting tricks to dress up the bottom line is it possible to do well by investing in companies with solid fundamentals   absolutely   you may not realize the same rate of short term returns as others who use momentum based trading strategies but over the long haul i 'm willing to bet you 'll see a better overall average return than they do

given that utilizing all the funds available to you drains your retirement and leaves you with very little cushion for unforeseen events as already noted it may be best to use a smaller amount for closing and just deal with the pmi for a couple years pmi is likely less than the taxes penalties incurred from withdrawing a full 20 + closing costs let alone the lost earning on the accounts above your mortgage interest rate but personally i think the stability of significant home equity is worth more than anticipated stock gains i would recommend pulling enough to buy the house comfortably without dipping too deeply in any one area while still paying down your balance to where you can eliminate pmi quickly say 2 3 years your limits for each account are approximately roth iras   traditional iras brokerage non retirement checking things to consider    if you are current on your payments you can request pmi removal once your loan to value drops below 80 it also automatically when it is scheduled to drop below 78 not if it actually has many loans have a 2 year minimum pmi period though regardless of your loan to value ltv changes ltv changes could be from

why do companies exist well the corporate charter describes why the company exists usually the purpose is to enrich the shareholders the owners of a company want to make money in other words there are a number of ways that a shareholder can make money off a stock as such maintaining the stock price and dividend payouts are generally the number one concern for any company in the long term most of the company 's business is going to be directed towards making the company more valuable for a future buyout or more valuable in terms of what it can pay its shareholders directly note that the company does n't always need to be worried about the specifics of the day to day moves of the stock if it keeps the finances in line solid profits margins earnings growth and the like and can tell people that it 's generally a valuable business it can usually shrug off any medium term as market some companies are more explicitly long term about things than others e.g. berkshire hathaway basically tells people that it does n't care all that much about what happens in the short term   of course companies are and they 're run by people to make the people running the company worry about the stock price you give them stock or stock options or something like that a major executive at a big company is likely to have a significant amount of stock if the company does well he does well if it does poorly he does poorly despite a few limitations this is really a powerful incentive if a company is losing a lot of money or if its profits are falling so it 's just losing a lot of its value as a business the owners stockholders tend to get upset and may vote in new management or launch some sort of shareholder lawsuit and as previously noted to raise funds a company can also issue new shares to the market as a secondary offering as well and they can issue fewer shares if the price is high meaning that whatever the company is worth afterward the existing owners own proportionally more of it

there are many flaws with your idea say i want to borrow $ to accrue interest on a 1.20 apy    account i promise that i can not withdraw nor touch the    account by legal contract if you break the contract and lose the money the lender is out the money they can take you to court and will win but if you do n't have the money then they do n't get paid you ca n't squeeze water out of a rock even if a judge orders you to by sharing the interest with me on a loan they keep a percentage that they 'd normally get if you 're investing the money at 1.2 and the lender gets some amount less than that then they are getting much less than they normally get lenders typically get somewhere from 5 15 on loans the money can also be used to fund a stock trading account regardless of whether i profit i pay interest on the loan and split the profit shares 24/7 how can the lender lose with legal enforcing again if you lose the money no amount of legal enforcing can force you to pay money that you do n't have even if you go to jail for fraud the lender still does n't get paid simply no bank would ever agree to this

although not technically an answer to your question i want to address why this is generally a bad idea    people normally put money into a savings account so that they can have quick access to it if needed and because it is safe   you lose both of these advantages with a foreign account   you are looking at extra time and fees to receive access to the money in those australian accounts   and more importantly you are taking on substantial fx risk   since 2000 the aud exchange rate has gone from a low of to a high of   those swings are almost as large as the swings of the s&p.   but you 're only getting an average return of 3.5 instead of the average return people expect with stocks of 10 a better idea would be to talk to a financial adviser who can help you find an investment that meets your risk tolerance but gives you a better return than your savings account on a final thought the exception to this would be if you plan on spending significant time in australia   having money in a savings account there would actually allow you to mitigate some of your fx risk by allowing you to decide whether to convert usd when you are travelling or using the money that you already have in your foreign account

your questions in the world of technical analysis is candlestick charting an effective trading tool in timing the markets it depends on how you define effective but as a standalone and systematic strategy it tends not to be profitable see for example market timing with candlestick technical analysis using robust statistical techniques we find that candlestick trading rules are not profitable when applied to djia component stocks over period neither bullish or bearish candlestick single lines or patterns provide market timing signals that are any better than what would be expected by chance basing ones trading decisions solely on these techniques does not seem sensible but we can not rule out the possibility that they compliment some other market timing techniques there are many other papers that come to the same conclusion if used correctly how accurate can they be in picking turning points in the market technical analysts generally fall into two camps i those that argue that ta ca n't be fully automated and that interpretation is part of the game ii those that use ta as part of a systematic investment model automatically executed by a machine but generally use a combination of indicators to build a working model both groups would argue for different reasons that the conclusions of the paper i quoted above should be disregarded and that ta can be applied profitably with the proper framework psychological biases it is very easy to get impressed by technical analysis because we all suffer from confirmation bias whereby we tend to acknowledge things that confirm our beliefs more than those that contradict them when looking at a chart it is very easy to see all the when a certain pattern worked and miss the when it did not work and not missing those is much harder than it sounds conclusions

your description works except for hbo   hbo is n't included in any bundling because they do n't have any advertising   their only source of revenue is consumers paying them for their content either through subscriptions   that s why you 've seen hbo be very aggressive in dvd publishing and online offerings compared to other channels   i think that in their heart of hearts hbo 's management would very much like to sell directly to the consumer through some sort of digital market place and cut out the cable middle man   most of their revenue still comes from cable subscriptions and they ca n't risk pissing off their business partners by going directly to consumers

technically it 's only when you need to pass money through however consider that the length the account has been open builds history with the financial institution so i 'd open asap longer history with the bank can help with getting approved for things like business credit lines business cards and other perks though if you 're not making money with that business seek out a bank that does not charge money to have a business account open with them

i 'm going to guess you 're on verizon and your wife has an iphone i just went through this exact same situation with my mom 's phone last week when you 're off contract with verizon you 're saving $ on your plan at least i am so staying off contract is big if you do the monthly payment you 're paying full retail over 2 years without interest so you do stay off contract at least here 's the thing as long as it 's a 16 gb iphone 5 or better you 're going to be able to craigslist it for the cost of the deductible no problems to me that makes the decision pretty easy to make as long as you can craigslist it for more than the deductible get the insurance replacement then when you want a new phone you can sell your old one since you can sell the phone i think that makes the comparison between the deductible and deciding to pay off the $ 100 now and start payments on the new phone less relevant the real comparison i 'd suggest looking at is the value of the phone and the deductible

this is a really interesting question and something a lot of work is being done to understand   i 'm going to look at the closely related question do non market cap etf weighting methods consistently outperform once you take into account their investment biases let 's use revenue weighting as a reason why investment biases are so important   in revenue weighting you would own almost no fast growing tech companies as they generally have little revenue    this sounds great if we are talking about say pets.com in the late 90s but you also would miss most of the rise of google to believe in these etfs consistently outperform adjusted for risk you would have to have a strong reason to believe that earnings sales or dividends are a better predictor of company value than market value   market analysts include the above three metrics and many more when pricing stocks so out performance using only one of the above metrics seems unlikely there is one caveat to this and that is value and small cap stocks have been shown to give slightly better risk adjusted returns in the very long run see fama french and many of these alternative weighting methods will have a value or small cap bias   first it is unclear if this out performance will continue now that it is more widely known   second even if you believe this will continue you can more easily and cheaply get this bias though value small cap etfs than these weighting schemes in the end the only thing that is perfectly clear is that higher fee investments will generally under perform

consider the mechanic which actually drives the price of a stock in simplest terms the price of a stock is the price at which the most recent trade occurred ie if the price of ibm is $ 100/share that means the last time someone bought ibm stock they paid $ 100 above and below the spot price are dozens hundreds thousands of buyers and sellers who have placed orders that no one is yet willing to match ie if ibm 's spot price is at $ 100 there could still be 10,000 people willing to sell for $ 101 called the ask price for the lowest price someone is currently willing to sell at and 15,000 willing to buy for $ 99 called the bid price for the highest price someone is currently willing to buy for   until someone is willing to buy for $ 101 then no one will be able to sell at $ 101 until someone is willing to sell for $ 99 no one will be able to buy for $ 99 typically orders are placed in the market at a particular limit meaning that those orders to buy at $ at $ 101 are already in the system and will be matched immediately as soon as someone is willing to meet the price on the other side now consider general market economics high demand drives up price and high supply drives down price if the details above for ibm were yesterday and today some news came out that ibm was laying off employees imagine that another 10,000 people who held shares wanted to sell now there would be 20,000 sellers and only 15,000 buyers if those new sellers were aggressive about wanting to sell they would have to drop their price to $ 99 to match the highest buyers in the market put together this means that as more sellers enter the market supply of shares increases driving down price conversely as more buyers enter the market demand for shares increases driving up share price as a result of the above you can say that all else being equal if price for a stock goes up there were more buyers that day and if price goes down there were more sellers that day on the face of it that is not necessarily true because you could have the same number of buyers and sellers one side could have simply decreased increased their acceptable price to match the other side

have you tried complaining to the real estate institute in your state and if that does n't work try taking them to fair trading i know from doing some work for real estates that getting money from them is like getting blood from a stone but you just need to keep bugging them talk to the manager or director and tell them you have been waiting too long for your money give them a deadline not more than 3 business days and tell them if you have not received the money by then you will make a complaint to the real estate institute and take them to fair trading sometimes you have to go to the person who runs the business as the workers usually do n't care especially when it is extra work for them and they get no reward for doing it plus the longer the real estate do n't pay you the longer they earn interest on your money

first to mention one thing better analysis calls for analyzing a range of outcomes not just one assigning a probability on each and comparing the expected values then the choice based on risk tolerance but now just look at the outcome or scenario of 3 and time frame of 2 days let 's assume your investable capital is exactly $ 1000 multiply everything by 5 for $ 5,000 etc a. buy stock the value goes to 103 your investment goes to $ net return is $ 30 minus let 's say $ 20 commission you should compare these between brokers i use one that charges 9.99 plus a trivial government fee b. buy an call option at 100 for $ 0.40 per share with an expiration 30 days away december 23 this is a more complicated to evaluate this you need to estimate the movement of the value of a 100 call $ 0 in and out of the money 30 days remaining to the value of a 100 call $ 3 in the money 28 days remaining that movement will vary based on the volatility of the underlying stock an advanced topic but there are techniques to estimate that which become simple to use after you get the hang of it at any rate let 's say that the expected movement of the option price in this scenario is from $ 0.40 to $ 3.20 since you bought 2500 share options for $ 1000 the gain would be 2500 times 2.8 = 7000 c. buy an call option at 102 for $ per share with an expiration 30 days away december 23 to evaluate this you need to estimate the movement of the value of a 102 call $ 2 out of the money 30 days remaining to the value of a 102 call $ 1 in the money 28 days remaining that movement will vary based on the volatility of the underlying stock an advanced topic but there are techniques to estimate that which become simple to use after you get the hang of it at any rate let 's say that the expected movement of the option price in this scenario is from $ to $ 1.50 since you bought 8000 share options for $ 1000 the gain would be 8000 times = d. same thing but starting with a 98 call e. same thing but starting with a 101 call expiring 60 days out f. etc other option choices again getting the numbers right for the above is an advanced topic one reason why brokerages warn you that options are risky if you do your math wrong you can lose even doing that math right with a bad outcome loses anyway you need to score as many options as needed to find the optimal point but back to the first paragraph you should then run the whole analysis on a 2 gain or 5 or 5 in 4 days instead of 2 days do as many as are fruitful assess then pull the trigger and buy it try these techniques in simulation before diving in please one last point you do n't have to understand how to evaluate projected option price movements if you have software that   does that for you i 'll on that process except to mention it get the general idea edit p.s. i forgot to mention that brokers need love for handling options too check those commission rates in your analysis as well

the words good and bad are evaluations and are the conclusions which you reach after a chain of thought   you look at the situation you identify the problem you think of a solution and you offer an evaluation   so when you call a policy good you jump over any analysis tied to context and facts straight to a conclusion   absent the thinking which helped you reach the conclusion the conclusion itself is worthless   so statements like taxing the rich more is a good policy are equivalent to saying fire saturday night live video weekend update segment   ultimately they just tell us how you feel about the policy   we do n't care how you feel about it we care how you think

some lenders will work with you if you contact them early and openly discuss your situation   they are not required to do so   the larger and more corporate the lender the less likely you 'll find one that will work with you my experience is that your success in working out repayment plan for missed payments depends on the duration of your reduced income   if this is a period of unemployment and you will be able to pay again in a number of months you may be able to work out a plan on some debts if you 're permanently unable to pay in full or the duration is too long you may have to file bankruptcy to save your domicile and transportation   the ethics of this go beyond this forum as do the specifics of when it is advisable to file bankruptcy research your area find debt counselling   they can really help with specifics   speak with your lenders they may be able to refer you to local non profit services   be sure that you find one of those not one of the predatory lenders posing as credit counselling services   there 's even some that take the money you can afford to pay divide it up over your creditors allowing you to keep accruing late partial payment fees and charge you a fee on top of it   to me this is fraudulent and should be cause for criminal charges the key is open communication with your lenders with disclosure to the level that they need to know   if you 're disabled long term they need to know that   they do not need to know the specific symptoms or causes or   they need to know whether the social security administration has declared you disabled and are paying you a disability check   if this is the case you probably have a case worker who can find you resources to help negotiate with your creditors

you said all terrorists are muslims which is not true at all because most acts of terror comes from right population most common are the burning down a house and personal attacks on looking guys at least in germany do nt know about other countries but i can not imagine it much different   cause and effect and quantity is a terror attack more harmful if more people heard of it effect on who i can imagine you talking in public is pretty scary for foreigners which is the point of the hate speech topic lets not drag the topic in here too because its very complicated just for your information i m very much in favour of fighting the cause of immigration and helping where it is needed and not letting millions walk thousands of miles to get to safety of to make a living funny how your mind works criminal immigrants are not accepted in germany by the way and if they get criminal here they get deported the crime rate of the refugees is actually a bit lower then the rate of the rest of the population so not big a problem which makes sense if you think about it it was hard to get here and they do nt want to go back    do you think a rightwing would attack muslims if they did not attack westerners do you think rightwing attacks are more than muslim attacks are they even 1 of all attacks and harm      this is the core problem i am talking about this is why millions of germans slaughtered the jewish population this is the result of hate speech and hard right propaganda the difference between now and then swap jew with muslim the muslims are to blame for the crime attacking our women the bad economy it is exactly the same mindset people then were no different then people now they did think they help germany by getting rid of those pests most of them did nothing at all and after the war they said they did n't know about any attacks or of jews needles to say that the actual crime rate if jews in germany was no different then the non jew crime rate just as it is now with muslims the overall crime rate rise significantly though since the start of the refugees crisis as a result of massive right wing activity you said you hate nazis a while back i do n't think you know what a nazi is and sure enough i called you one and you did not deny my friend i was wrong about you you are a helpless cause with terrible arguments based on prejudice and hate i still did enjoy this conversation because it was a mostly civil and b gave me a very good look into the mindset of a nazi you may be happy to here that i realized while researching the topic that the problem of nazis is much bigger then i have thought and i can not ignore it anymore and have to join the fight good day to you and may reason catch up to you in your future life

firstly if you 've formed a limited company you do n't need to register as self employed   you 're an employee and shareholder of the company and your taxes will be handled that way registering as self employed is only necessary if you 're operating as a sole trader i.e. without a company secondly you absolutely do want to get set up correctly with hmrc as soon as possible whether you 're a company or a sole trader   ignoring the legal question your worry about paying taxes when you have no income is if you 're not making any money there wo n't be any tax to pay   furthermore it seems likely that the business is currently losing money   those losses if correctly recorded can be carried forward and offset against future profits so not only do you not have to pay tax now but you can reduce the tax you pay later when the money does start rolling in

given your needs gnucash will do i 've used it for the past 3 years and while it 's a gradual learning process it 's been able to resolve most stuff i 've thrown at it schedule bills and deposits in the calendar view so i can keep an eye on cash flow   gnucash has scheduled payments and receipts and should you need them i prefer to keep enough float to cover monthly expenses in accounts rather than monitor potential shortfalls    track all my stock and mutual fund investments across numerous accounts it pulls stock mutual and bond quotes from lots of places domestic and foreign it can also pull transaction data from your brokers if they support that   i manually enter all my transactions so i can keep control of them i just reconcile what i entered into quicken based on the statements sent to me i do not use quicken 's bill pay there 's a reconciliation mode but i do n't use it personally the purpose of is less about catching bank errors and more about agreeing on the truth so that you do n't incur bank fees when i was doing this by hand i found i had a terrible data entry error rate but on the other hand the bayesian importer likes to mark gasoline purchases from the local grocery store as groceries rather than gas i categorize all my expenditures for help come tax time gnucash has accounts and you can mark expense accounts as tax related it also generates certain tax forms for you if you need that not sure what all you 're categorizing that 's helpful at tax time though i use numerous reports including net worth tracking cash not is retirement funds and total retirement savings tons of reports and the newest version supports sql if you prefer that vs their reports

i am admittedly not giving a scientific or mathematical analysis here just giving my anecdotal take on what i 've lived through i do n't know if my assessment of tripled is even accurate just that there 's a palpable sense of things being a lot more expensive amp it just seems to me that the cost of living has gone up quite a bit for average people from what it once was especially considering most of us now have cable bills internet costs and in my case several different cell phone bills for different members of the family i realize these are not necessities but they are important things that most people are now expected to have i did n't mean to imply that we 've had insane inflation amp i understand that these things are mathematically measured as both core inflation and cpi and by these measures things have held pretty steady it just seems to me that these sorts of indexes have not yet taken a lot of things into account regarding the realities of modern day living and their resultant expenses

why do you keep going on about test results you do realise that the drug does n't last very long in the system and as explained by the testimonies there were techniques to delay blood testing until it was clear from the system such as ringing each other up telling them that testers are here and to say out on the track for longer or to dope more often at night when testers were n't around or to simply not answer your door when testers came around   and yes there were was a test result i do n't remember which year exactly that when tested at the time was found to have no drugs but that s because the drug he used was n't by any method the blood was later on when they did have a method to test for it and they did find it in his system   let 's say i have a gun which disappears into thin air after firing i use it to kill a person in a room full of people nobody sees me directly firing the gun but i do manage to use it to kill someone and the gun disappears police search everyone including me for a gun but find no gun they find that i had motive but again no gun now a week later 26 of my one of them who was the person who manufactured this magical gun own up to the police and confess how i was able to do what i did would n't it be stupid of me to argue you never found a gun on me after the murder therefore i 'm innocent   the gun is like the drug it disappears after use with the drug it 's not so instant but still disappears fairly quickly with regards to the blood testing frequency therefore do you not see how it is stupid to say no positive test results therefore it 's evidence he never used drugs again i 'll reiterate it incase you still do n't understand it of the drug disappears quickly from the blood

gt one of the best news i 've heard today that 's the right way awesome gesture   i do n't know on this one while it gives the warm all it means in reality is the seats will be all be sold out really fast    the economist in me that i pretend to be while listening to freakonomics in my car wants to point to this quote that i feel turned me around on this   and consumer surplus is one of the most important things in economics one of the incredible of the market system is that for so much of what we buy we would have been willing to pay way more for it than we actually have to a great example is water how much do we pay for water each month i do n’t know what your water bill is mine is maybe $ 40 but think about how much we ’d be willing to pay for water water is i mean we ’d be willing to pay almost anything for water but it ’s really really cheap so in that way the modern economy has arranged things so that we get things we need like water and food much more cheaply than we ’d be willing to pay and that is really important that is really the magic of the market    gt to me what sounds like the problem is how do you measure that because i need to know what you in your head were willing to pay before you came to the store and then were confronted with the actual price so how typically have economists measured those two numbers what you pay and what you ’re willing to pay   gt so you have never been more right about anything in your life than what you just said because we simply have no good ways to measure consumer surplus because we know what people pay we can sometimes see that observe how much they buy but we never see what ’s inside their head what their choice what they would be willing to pay if we ’re really going to estimate a consumer surplus what you would want to do is you would want to take a consumer and somehow magically you ’d want to reproduce that consumer in 10 parallel universes   source

putting a dollar amount on the valuation of a start up business is an art form that often has very little at all to do with any real numbers and more to do with your salesman abilities when talking with the vc that said there are a few starting points first is past sales the cost of those sales and a hopefully realistic growth curve   however you do n't have that so this gets harder do you have any actual assets   machinery computers desks patents etc   things that you actually own   if so then add those in   if this is a software start up code is an asset but without sales it 's incredibly hard to put a value on it   the best i 've come up with is how much would it cost for someone else to build it after they 've seen yours   yes you may have spent 5,000 hours building something but could someone else duplicate it or at least the major parts in 200 hours after seeing a demo   use the lower number if i was you i 'd look hard at my business plan   hopefully you were as honest as you can be when writing it and that it is as researched as possible   what is it going to take to get that first sale   what do you actually need to get there hint your logo on the side of a building is not a necessary expense   nor is really nice office space   once you have that first sale what is the second going to take   can you extrapolate out to 3 years   how many key members are there   how much is their contribution worth   at what point will you be profitable    next is to look at risks   you have n't done this before that 's huge i 'm assuming simply because you asked this question   another is competitors hopefully they already exist because opening a new market is incredibly hard and expensive on the flip side hopefully there are n't that many because entering a crowded market is equally hard and expensive   note each are possible but take radically different approaches and sums of money and $ 200k is n't going to cut it no matter what it is you are selling that said competition should be able to at least point you in the direction of a price point and estimate for how long sales take   if any are publicly traded then you have additional info to help you set a valuation   are there any potential regulatory or legal issues what happens if a key member leaves dies or is otherwise no longer available   insurance only helps so much if the one guy that knows everything literally gets run over   god help you if this person likes to go i bring risks up because you will have to them during this negotiation   for example asking for $ 200k with zero hard assets while trying to sell software to government agencies assuming a 3 week sales cycle will have you laughed at for naivety   whereas asking for $ 10 m in the same situation with a team that has governmental sales experience would likely work another big question is exit strategy do you intend to ipo or sell to a competitor or a business in a related category   if selling do you have evidence that the target company actually buys others and if so how did those deals work out   what did they look for in order to buy   exit strategy is huge to a vc and they will want to make several multiples of their money back in a relatively short amount of time   can you realistically support that for how much you are asking for   if not then going through an angel group would be better   they have similar questions but very different expectations the main thing is that no one knows what your business is worth because it is 100 unproven after 2 years and is therefore a huge financial risk   if the money you are asking for is to complete product development then that risk factor just went up radically as you are n't even talking about sales   if the money is purely for the sales channel then it 's likely not enough however if you know what it 's going to take to get that first sale and have at least an educated idea on how much it 's going to cost to repeat that then you should have an idea for how much money you want   from there you need to decide how much of the business it is worth to you to give up in order to get that money and voila you have a pre money valuation the real trick will be to convince the vc that you are right which takes research and a rock solid presentation and negotiating from there   no matter what offer a small percentage of the business for the money you want and realize you 'll likely give up much more than that a few things you should know usually by year 3 it 's apparent if a start up is going to work out or not   you 're in year 2 with no sales that does n't look good unless you are building a physical product have a competent team with hard experience doing this have patents at least filed a proven test product and hopefully have a few pre orders and just need cash to deliver   although in that situation i 'd probably tell you to ask your friends and family before talking to a vc   even would be better    $ 200k just is n't a lot of money and should be very easy to raise from friends or angels   if you ca n't then that speaks volumes to an institutional vc   a plus is having two or three people financially invested in the company more than that is sometimes a problem while having only 1 is a red flag if it 's a web thing and you 've been doing this for 2 years with zero sales and still need another $ 200k to complete it then i 'd say you need to take a hard look at what you 've built and take it to market right now   if you ca n't do that then i 'd say it might be time to abandon this idea and move on as you 'll likely have to give up 80%+ to get that $ 200k and most vcs i 've run into would n't bother at that level   which begs the question how did the conversation with the vc start   did you approach them or did they approach you   if the latter how did they even find out about you   do they actually know anything about you or is this a fishing expedition   if the latter then this is probably a complete waste of your time the above is only a rough guide because at the end of the day something is only worth what someone else is willing to pay   $ 200k in cash is a tiny sum for most vcs so without more information i have no clue why one would be interested in you i put a number of hard questions and statements in here   i do n't actually want you to answer me those are for you to think about   also none of this should n't be taken as a rather it should shock you into a realistic viewpoint and hopefully help you understand how others are going to see your baby    if the vc has done a bit of research and is actually interested in investing then they will bring up all the same things and likely more in order to convince you to give up a very large part of it   the question you have to ask yourself is is it worth it   sometimes it is often it 's not

the largest problem and source of anxiety ruin for homeowners during the housing market collapse was caused by the inability to refinance many people had bought homes which they were stretched to afford by using variable rate mortgages   these would typically offer a very attractive initial rate with an annual cap on the potential increase of rate   many of these people intended to refinance their variable rate to a fixed rate once terms were more favorable   if their house wo n't appraise for the value needed to obtain a new loan they are stuck in their current contract with potentially unfavorable rates in the later years above prime was not unheard of also many people especially those in areas of high inflation in the housing market used a financial device known as a balloon mortgage which essentially forced you to get a new loan after some number of years 2 5 10 when the entire note became due   some of those loans offered payments less than principal + interest so say you move near los angeles and ca n't afford the $ 1.2 m for the ranch in which you wish to live   you might work out a deal with your mortgage broker banker in which you agree contractually to only pay $ 500/month with a balloon payment of $ 1.4 m due in 5 years which seemed like a good deal since you and everyone else actually expect the house to be worth $ 1.5 m in 5 years this type of thing was done all the time back in the day   now imagine the housing bubble bursts and your $ 1.2 m home is suddenly only valued at perhaps $ 750k   you still owe $ 1.4 m sometime in the next several years maybe very soon depending on timing and can only get approved financing for the current $ 750k value so you 're basically anticipating becoming homeless and bankrupt within the same year that is a source of much anxiety about being upside down on a loan see this question for an unfortunate example

what prevents a company from doing secondary public stock offerings on regular basis the primary goal of a company doing secondary public offering is to raise more funds that can be utilized for funding the business if no funding is needed i.e. company has sufficient funds or no expansion plans this funding creates a drag and existing shareholder including promoters loose value for example with the current 100 invested the company is able to generate say 125 25 as profit if additional 100 is taken as secondary public offering then with 200 the company should mark around 250 else it looses value so if the company took additional 100 and did not is not able to deploy in market on 200 they still make 25 as profit its bad there are other reasons i.e. to fight off hostile acquisition or dilute some of promoters shares etc thus the reasons for company to do a secondary po are few and doing it often reduces the value for primary share holders as well as minority share holders

in both cases you have a bunch of assets that pay into a trust and a set of rules determining how the payments are distributed to bond holders     typically the bonds are split up by seniority where any losses from the underlying assets gets recognized by the least senior bond holder first and the most senior is protected until those below in seniority are wiped out   in the case of mortgage backed securities you have a lot of early payoffs sales and refinances and those payoffs tend to pay off the senior bonds first though in practice quite a bit more complicated than that   cdos tend to have bonds as assets that pay into the trust and have mortgages   cdos used to be more likely to be things like corporate debt or junk rated debt   but during the housing bubble you did have cdos backed by some form of mortgage backed bonds   if you build a cdo out of tranches of you are going through multiple stages of and things get weird when you have highly correlated loss behavior in your underlying assets   the equity position or the residual as it is sometimes called is whatever money coming from the underlying assets is n't owed to any bond after all of the structuring rules are followed   this would be interest received in excess to interest owed + money required to make up for lost principal   typically goes back to the issuing bank   there is something called a bond that gets carved out of the residual and pays to the investment bank i gather   and of mortgage bonds are pretty worthless in a high loss environment like this

if you 're talking about just theta the amount of decay due to the passage of time all else being equal then theoretically the time value is a continuous function so it would decay throughout the day although by the day of expiry the time value is very very small   which makes sense since even with 15 minutes to go there 's still a 50/50 shot of an atm option expiring in the money so there should be some time value associated with that one sided probability the further away from atm the option is the smaller the time value will be and will be virtually zero for options that are deep in- or out of the money if you 're talking about total time value then yes it will definitely change during the day since the underlying components volatility underlying price etc change more or less continuously

everyone is perfectly free to instantaneously decide that a dollar is worth only of an orange and oranges would instantly cost a billion dollars oranges cost less than that not because the government sets the price of oranges but purely because that 's what the market agrees to    this shows a profound misunderstanding of how fiat currencies work   the demand for fiat currencies comes from the fact they are necessary to pay taxes and debts   other currencies commodities will not be recognized as settlement of debts in court disputes so they would first need to be sold onto the market in exchange for the fiat currency   individuals ca n't simply decide what the relative value of certain goods and services are   the market does that collectively via voluntary trade   gt;i'm explaining internal combustion for a 5-year old and you 're calling it inaccurate and misleading because it does n't address the sociological implications of american car culture    hahah you 're confusing the oil for the gasoline

signing bonuses are probably the most variable of all as there is a general understanding that more personal factors are taken into account as a result hr is n't under a huge obligation to explain away the differences in comparison for salary there 's the wide expectation that same job = same pay since there 's so variable but also fairly rare budget is n't a main concern for many hr departments and they certainly wo n't have a finely grained budget breakdown this year we 'll pay $ for $ 50000 for relocation payments $ 100,000 for pension transfers $ for stock option losses it 's generally tossed on one big heap cost of hiring so what can you ask for that 's really a market question what 's your value to the company how much of that is already reflected in salary and other benefits the main downside to signing bonuses is that a company wo n't know how long you 'd stay your value to the company is probably your monthly work therefore they can not amortize that bonus over a fixed amount of months what if you leave after 3 months for that reason a conditional signing bonus is a reasonable offer from your side e.g. ask for one month salary conditional on you staying for 24 months and otherwise you 'll repay them from your last salary

for the first and last questions i can do this multiple ways   for the middle question i 'll just make up values   if you want different ones you will have to redo the math    i am going to assume that you participate in the merger exchange swapping your share for their offer    if you own one share it depends how they handle fractional shares   your original one share of abc can be worth either one share of xyz or 1.05 shares of xyz   if you get one share you typically get an additional $ cash to make up for the fractional share    you might ask why you do n't just get $ 20 cash and one share of xyz   consider the case where you own twenty shares of abc   then you 'd own twenty one shares of xyz and $   no need for fractional shares    beyond all this though the share value of xyz is not set   the shares might be worth $ 16 $ 40 or $ 2 after the merger   if both stocks are perfectly valued and the market is aware of that value then it will depend partially on the number of shares of each    for example if we assume there are 10,000 shares of abc and 50,000 shares of xyz including the shares paid for abc then their initial market values are $ 320,000 for abc and $ 800,000 for xyz   xyz is paying $ so its value drops to $   but it is gaining abc which is worth $ 320,000   net value now is $ or $ per share    this has assumed that the shares transferred from xyz to the shareholders of abc were already included in the market value   this may mean that the stock price was previously $ 20 or so with almost 40,000 shares in circulation   then they issued new shares diluting the value down to $ 16   we could start at 50,000 shares at $ 16 and end up with 60,000 to shares at $ to $ per share   then xyz is really only paying $ for abc   that 's a premium of only $ for abc and gives a final stock value of $ per share    the problem though is that in reality there is no equivalent of perfect value   so i say again that the market value might be $ the answer that best fits the question given the example quantities of shares $ 13 $ 20 or something else   it will depend on how the market perceives the deal   is the combined company worth more or less than the sum of its parts    and beyond this you will have $ 19.20 to $ 20 in cash in addition to your xyz share or 1.05 shares   assuming 1.05 shares that would be $ plus the $ 19.20 's $ total in theory or anything from $ 19.20 up in practice   with the the only thing of which you can be sure is the $ 19.20 cash   the value of the stock is up in the air    if xyz is only privately traded this is still true   the stock is worth the price that someone will pay for it   the someone is just more limited with privately traded stocks

it 's not a question with a single right answer   other answers have addressed some aspects my case may provide some guidance as to one way of looking at some of the issues when i had student loans the interest rate was and i could get more than that as the return on a savings account   at the time i could get a whole year 's worth of loan at the start of the year save it and draw from the savings partly because i had a little working capital saved already   importantly in my case the loans were use it or lose it if i did n't take the loan out by about halfway through each academic year it was no longer available to me the difference in interest rates was probably similar to what you can get with a careful choice of savings account and 0 on the loan i did this in the 90s when interest rates were higher over a four year degree the interest i earned this way added up to no more than about £ 100 which went towards offsetting the fact i would be paying interest after graduation if you can clear the loan before you pay any interest it would give you a return but a small one that could easily be eroded by rate changes or errors on your part like not keeping on top of the paperwork   it still may be beneficial to take out the loans depending on your capital needs in my case it made buying a house after graduating much easier as we still had money for the deposit downpayment and student loan rates were much lower than mortgage rates 100 mortgages were also available then but expensive stands for retail price index a measure of inflation

when you exercise a put you get paid the strike price immediately so you can invest that money and earn some interest compared to only exercising at expiry so the benefit to exercising early is that extra interest the cost is the remaining time value of the option along with any dividend payments you miss as @joetaxpayer points out there might be tax considerations that make it better to exercise at one time rather than another but those would likely be personal to you so if the option would intrinsically have more value unexercised in many cases you could sell it on rather than exercise it the exception might be if it was n't very liquid and the transaction costs of doing that outweighed the theoretical value

there is not one right way it depends on the level of detail that you need one way would be create the following accounts when you pay the phone bill when you are paid with the reimbursement that is when you pay the phone bill you must debit both phone expense to record the expense and also reimbursements due to record the fact that someone now owes you money if it 's useful you could add another layer of complexity when you receive the bill you have a liability and when you pay it you discharge that liability whether that 's worth keeping track of depends i never do for month to month bills afterthought i see another poster says that your method is incorrect because a reimbursement is not salary technically true though that problem could be fixed by the account to something like income from employer the more serious problem i see is that you are reversing the phone expense when you are reimbursed so at the end of the year you will show total phone expense as $ 0 this is clearly not correct you did have phone expenses they were just reimbursed you really are treating the expense account as an asset account phone expenses due to be reimbursed by employer

according to the new york attorney general 's tenants rights guide landlords regardless of the number of units in the building    must treat the deposits as trust funds belonging to their tenants and they may not co mingle deposits with their own money landlords of buildings with six or more apartments must    put all security deposits in new york bank accounts earning    interest at the prevailing rate each tenant must be informed    in writing of the bank ’s name and address and the amount of    the deposit so you have to keep it separate you ca n't spend it and if you own more than six units you have to put it in a bank account   the guide goes on to explain that the interest should be paid to the tenant

it 's interesting that after reading this article you would make an assumption about where the stock market is headed this article specifically says that the only way to know that is to know where interest rates are going and for that we can guarantee no one knows    the takeaway is this the key to investing is not assessing how much an industry is going to affect society or how much it will grow but rather determining the competitive advantage of any given company and above all the durability of that advantage the products or services that have wide sustainable around them are the ones that deliver rewards to investors   intelligent investors should have no concern about what the market is doing analyze businesses not the stock market

this is a great question precisely because the answer is so complicated it means you 're starting to think in detail about how orders actually get filled executed rather than looking at stock prices as a mythical the market the market price is a somewhat deceptive term the price at which bids and asks last crossed filled is the price that prints i.e. that is what you see on a market price data feed in reality there is a resting queue of orders at various bids asks on various exchanges   source larry harris a size of 1 is = 100 shares so at first your order will sweep through the standing queue of fills let 's say you are trading a low volume stock and let 's say someone from another brokerage has set a limit order at a ridiculous price part of your order may sweep through and part of it get filled at a ridiculously high price or maybe either the exchange or your broker execution mechanism somehow will protect you against the really high fill let 's say your broker hired who guarantees a certain vwap also people change their bids asks in response to what they see others do your size will likely be marked as a human counterparty by certain players other players might see that order differently let 's say it was a 100 size maybe people will decide you must know something and decide they want to go the same direction as you rather than take the opportunity to exit and maybe some super fast players will in and out of the filling process itself there is more to it because what if some of the resting asks are on other venues what if both you and some of the asks match with someone who uses the same broker as you not only do exchange rules come into play but so do national regulations tl;dr you will get filled with price slippage if you send in a big buy order it will sweep through the resting asks but also there are complications

there is no catch you 've been a good customer and your bank wants to reward you for it one of the ways you build credit is by having more credit available so by increasing your credit limit its lowering your credit utilization rate one of the factors that go into your credit score which is a good thing so your bank trusts you with more credit which again is a good thing you can also request a line of credit increase yourself without waiting for the bank to do so but there 's a 6 month wait between each increase assuming you get one i always ask every 6 months and have gotten approved each time and it 's helped my credit score tremendously

in addition to the other answers which cover the risks of what is essentially leveraged investing i 'd like to point out that the 2.6 penalty is a flat rate if you are responsible for withholding your own taxes then you are paying tax four times a year so any underpayment on your first quarterly tax payment will have much more time to accrue in the stock market than your last payment although each underpayment will be penalized by the 2.6 it may make sense for someone to make full payments on later payments but underpay on earlier ones
# 473936
ditto bill and i upvoted his answer but let me add a bit if everyone knew exactly what the risk was for every investment then prices would be bid up or down until every stock or bond or derivative or whatever was valued at exactly risk times potential profit or more precisely integral of risk times potential profit if company a was 100 guaranteed to make $ 1 million profit this year while company b had 50 change to make a $ 2 million profit and 50 to make $ 0 and every investor in the world knew that then i 'd expect the total price of all shares of the two stocks to stabilize at the same value the catch to that though is that no one really knows the risk the risk is n't like we 're going to roll a die and if it comes up even the company makes $ 1 million and if it comes up odd the company makes $ 0 so we could calculate the exact probability the risk comes from lack of information will consumers want to buy this new product how many what are they willing to pay how capable is the new ceo etc it 's very hard to calculate probabilities on these things how can you precisely calculate the probability that unforeseen events will occur so in real life prices are the risk reward ratio should be roughly sort of approximately linear but that 's about the most one can say

if you sell through an intermediate who sets up the shop for you odds are they collect and pay the sales tax for you my experience is with publishing books through amazon where they definitely handle this for you if you can find a retailer that will handle the tax implications that might be a good reason to use them   it looks like etsy uses a different model where you yourself are responsible for the sales tax which requires you to register with your state looks like this is the information for new york and pay the taxes yourself on a regular basis see this link for a simple guide if you 're doing this you 'll need to keep track of how much tax you owe from your sales each month quarter or year depending on the state laws   you can usually be a sole proprietor which is the easiest business structure to set up if you want to limit your legal liability or work with a partner you may want to look into other forms of business structure but for most a sole proprietorship is fine to start out with   if you do a sole proprietorship you can probably file the income on a 1040 schedule c when you do your personal taxes each year

you could debate the of tax policy endlessly there are lots of things in tax law that i think are bad ideas and probably a few here and there that i think are good ideas i am well aware that there are things that i think are good ideas that others think are bad ideas and vice versa   to your specific point i suppose you could say that having a place to live is a necessity but most people do not live in the absolute minimum necessary to give them a place to sleep and protection from the weather you could survive with a one room apartment with a bed on one side and a toilet and some minimal cooking facilities on the other most people have considerably more than that at some point that 's luxury and not necessity and if you want to push it you could live in a cardboard box under a bridge you do n't need a house or apartment to survive personally i think it 's absurd that as a home owner i get a deduction for my mortgage interest while if someone were to rent an identical house with a monthly rental equal to exactly the same amount that i am paying on my mortgage he would receive no deduction the stated goal of that one was to encourage home ownership but people who own homes are generally richer than those who rent so the net result is that the poor are paying higher taxes to help subsidize the homes of the rich and then the rich congratulate themselves on how they are giving these tax breaks to help make housing more affordable for poor people to reiterate @keshlam tax laws only makes sense when understood politically yes some people have fine ideas about what is fair and just others simply want tax breaks that benefit their business or people with tough financial situations that just happen by chance to resemble their own many of the people with noble ideas have little concept of what the implications of the policies they push are many of the ideas that some people view as worthy and noble others view as frivolous counter productive or even evil then you mash all these competing groups and interest together and see what comes out

i see a couple of reasons why you could consider choosing a mutual fund over an etf in some cases index mutual funds can be a cheaper alternative to etfs in the uk where i am based fidelity is offering a management fee of 0.07 on its ftse all shares tracker last time i checked no etf was beating that there are quite a few cost you have to foot when dealing etfs in some cases when dealing for relatively small amounts e.g. a monthly investment plan you can get a better deal if your broker has negotiated discounts for you with a fund provider my broker asks £ 12.5 when dealing in shares £ 1.5 for the regular investment plan whereas he asks £ 0 when dealing in funds and i get a 100 discount on the initial charge of the fund as a conclusion i would suggest you look at the all in costs over total investment period you are considering for the exact amount you are planning to invest despite all the hype etfs are not always the cheapest alternative

value slip below vs equal a bank savings account ’s safety there is no conflict   the first author states that money market funds may lose value precisely due to duration risk   the second author states that money market funds is as safe as a bank account   safety in the sense of a bond loan credit mostly about default risk for example people can say that a 30-year u.s. treasury bond is safe because the united states can not default as said in the constitution amendments and the s&p moody 's credit rating is the top special safety is about whether it can default ex experience a -100 return   safety does not directly imply riskiness in the example of t bond it is ultra safe but it is also ultra risky the volatility of 30-year t bond could be higher than s&p 500   back to money market funds   a money market fund could hold deposits with a dozen of banks or hold short term investment grade debt those instruments are safe as in there is minimal risk of default but they do carry duration risk because the average duration of the instrument the fund holds is not 0   a money market fund must maintain a weighted average maturity of 60 days or less and not invest more than 5 in any one issuer except for government securities and repurchase agreements   if you have $ 10,000,000 a money market fund is definitely safer than a savings account   1 savings account at one institution with amount exceeding fdic terms is less safe than a money market fund which holds instruments issued by 20 different banks   duration risk your savings account does n't lose money as a result of interest rate change because the rate is set by the bank daily and accumulated daily though paid monthly   the pricing of short term bond is based on market expectation of the interest rates in the future the most likely cause of money market funds losing money is unexpected change in expectation of future interest rates   the drawdown max loss is usually limited in terms of percentage and time through examining historical returns   the rule of thumb is that if your hold a fund for 6 months and that fund has a weighted average time to maturity of 6 months you might lose money during the 6 months but you are unlikely to lose money at the end of 6 months this is not a definitive fact   using mint and as an example or short duration funds the maximum loss in the past 3 years is 0.4 and they always recover to the previous peak within 3 months had 1.3 per year return somewhat similar to savings accounts in the us

if i do n't need this money for decades meaning i can ride out periodical market crashes why would i invest in bonds instead of funds that track broad stock market indexes you would n't   but you can never be 100 sure that you really wo n't need the money for decades   also even if you do n't need it for decades you can never be 100 certain that the market will not be way down at the time decades in the future when you do need the money   the amount of your portfolio you allocate to bonds relative to stocks can be seen as a measure of your desire to guard against that uncertainty i do n't think it 's accurate to say that the general consensus is that your portfolio should at least be 25 in bonds   for a young investor with high risk tolerance many would recommend less than that   for instance this page from t. rowe price suggests no more than 10 bonds for those in their 20s or 30s basically you would put money into bonds rather than stocks to reduce the volatility of your portfolio   if you care only about maximizing return and do n't care about volatility then you do n't have to invest in bonds   but you probably actually do care about volatility even if you do n't think you do   you might not care enough to put 25 in bonds but you might care enough to put 10 in bonds

yes i really do n't disagree with anything that you 're arguing regarding social mobility in general the lack of social safety net in the us and uk do n't enable social mobility   i would also point out that rich kids tend to inherit and so tend to stay in the class with which they were born to for instance i know a lawyer whose son is a fuck up sure he 'll have six figure income all his life due to inheriting dad 's money but he 'll never earn anything on his own is that success i do n't think so   i would also assert that the point is more salient in the middle class just because my parents are middle class does n't mean that i would be middle class there 's quite a few ways that i could have off and ended up quite poor i know a consultant who was solidly middle class who 's son flips burgers for a living said son is a bloody smart person from what i heard but never got his shit together   so yes i agree that decreasing social mobility is a problem i 'd also argue that success is only on luck

it has got to do with the irrationality of humans   the so called long term investor is in it for the long term they are not worried about market fluctuations nor timing the market but yet they will aim to try to get a bargain when they buy in   it is contradictory in a way think about it if i buy a stock and it drops by 30 i am not worried because i am in it for the long term but i am worried about getting 1 off when i buy it   they usually tend to buy when the stock starts falling however what they do n’t realise is when a stock starts falling there is no telling when it will stop so even if they get a bargain for that day it is usually quickly wiped out a few days later instead of waiting for the price to find support and start recovering they are eager to buy what they think is a bargain i think this type of long term investing is very risky and the main reason is because the investor has no plan they just try to buy so called bargain stocks and hold them until they need the money usually in retirement but what happens if the stock price is lower when they want to retire than when they bought it i hope no long term investor was trying to retire in 2008 if they simply had a plan to indicate when they would buy and under what conditions they would sell and have a risk management plan in place then maybe they could reduce their risk somewhat and conserve their capital a good article to read on this is what 's wrong with long term investing

try and bring with you a folder full of evidence about your skills and accomplishments many of the top blue chip companies do what 's called evidence based interviewing and it means you provide evidence to back up your assertions about how great you are so for example the interviewer asks how you get on with your colleagues and you provide an email thanking you for being a great team player or they ask you about research and you show them a piece of research you did of course this is harder when you go for your first job but bring what you can as an alternative and/or alongside this you can use stories as someone else said as a kind of evidence if you do n't have any physical evidence your story should show systematically how you handled a situation to get a good outcome   if they are a very conservative company they will want you to show that although you can kind of think outside the box you are not prone to emotional reactions or knee jerk responses and everything you do is carefully thought out and would n't bring them into if it got covered on the front page of a newspaper   good luck

william r is a momentum indicator used for measuring overbought and oversold levels it is not used to predict the price of a stock in fact william r like all momentum indicators is a lagging indicator meaning the indicator level changes as the price of the stock changes it ranges from 0 to -100 usually when a reading is less than the stock can be considered to be oversold and when the reading is above -20 the stock can be considered overbought when viewed together with the price chart this can help provide a trader with entry and exit points into and out of a trade

for your first question the general guidelines i 've seen recommended are as follows as to your second question portfolio management is something you should familiarize yourself with   if you trust it to other people do n't be surprised when they make mistakes   remember they get paid regardless of whether you make money   consider how much any degree of risk will affect you   when starting out your contributions make up most of the growth of your accounts now is the time when you can most afford to take higher risk for higher payouts still limiting your risk as much as possible of course   a 10 loss on a portfolio of $ 50k can be replaced with a good year 's contributions   once your portfolio has grown to a much larger sum it will be time to dial back the risk and focus on preserving your capital    when choosing investments always treat your as a whole including non retirement assets other investment accounts savings even your house   do n't put too many eggs from every account into the same basket or you 'll find that 30 of your is a single investment   also consider that some investments have different tax consequences and you can leverage the properties of each account to offset that

let 's say a stock trades at $ 100 right now and you can buy a $ 100 call option when you buy the call option and the money you paid is gone one of two things can happen the share price goes up or the share price goes down   if the share price goes up you profit if the share price goes down you do n't lose because once the shares are below $ 100 you do n't exercise the call option and you do n't lose any money   so if you have a share that is rock solid at $ 100 you do n't make money if you have a share where the company owner took some ridiculous risk and the shares could go to $ 200 or the company could go bankrupt then you have a 50 chance to make $ 100 and a 50 chance to not lose anything that 's much more preferable

hopefully is a very good term    it remains a fact because in the current scenario of low growth companies do n't see much of a reason to invest and all evidence points agrees    so what are companies doing with all the extra cash they are getting from the rich they are either buying back their own shares which is a or they are doing mergers and buyouts which are both at record highs at the moment here too evidence points that neither of these are actual productive activities share buy backs only inflate the share price without actually changing the market cap as there are less shares in the market mergers have a strong track record of being expensive and ultimately bad investments that do more to erode value than they do to increase it    then of course there are the fees from the finance industry that are from these investments share buy backs and mergers that are just added into the spinning wheel without actually impacting the real economy

gt vouchers pay the private schools what the public school would have received in the first place the public school does n't pay as much in taxes and has a government supported administration that cuts waste at every chance so the private schools collect all the voucher money figure out they ca n't turn a profit and go bankrupt sending all the kids they had enrolled back to the public schools or forcing another issuance of another voucher costing the school system double to triple for every kid that gets screwed that way which means the public school system does n't have that money in their budget either forcing further cuts    i have never considered this before i can see the issue with it you 've changed my view on vouchers being a good system   it also causes self segregation at the schools because all the affluent parent can afford to drive their kids to another school poor kids need a bus that 's not covered by a voucher so we end up with schools that are 90 black hispanic with only 50 speaking english in a county that is 66 white while around the corner is a 90 white school where only 5 speak spanish when over 25 of the population does and that 's just the racial demographics that are immediately obvious the poverty levels are harder to get data on   i do n't consider this is necessarily a bad thing though if schools are self segregated it allows for teachers to teach in a certain way that is better for their demographic    school security officer bob on a power trip or the delinquent in the hall the problem is the same fearing for safety when there really should n't be a problem   you do n't get either of those at schools where there is almost no poverty you will have the same problem in canada if you move to a school district that has a significant amount of poverty   gt;and i get the feeling you do n't live near a population center   i do n't live in a big city but i live in a suburban area

sipc is a corporation a legal entity separate from its owners in the case of sipc it is funded through the fees paid by its members all the us brokers are required to be members and to contribute to sipc funds can it go bankrupt of course any legal entity can go bankrupt a person can go bankrupt a country can go bankrupt and so can anything in between however looking at the history of things there are certain assumptions that can be made these are mere guesses as there 's no law about any of these things to the best of my knowledge but seeing how things were we can try and guess that they will also be like this in the future i would guess that in case of a problem for the sipc to meet its obligation any of the following would happen or combinations too big to fail large insurance companies had been bailed out before by the governments since it was considered that their failure would be more destructive to the economy than the bailout aig as an example in the us sipc is in essence is an insurance company so is lloyd 's of london breach of trust of the individual investors that can lead to a significant market crash that 's what happened in the us to fannie mae and freddie mac they 're now officially backed by the us government if sipc is incapable of meeting its obligation i would definitely expect the us government to step in even though there 's no such obligation raising funds through charging other members if the actuary calculations were incorrect the insurance companies adjust them and raise premiums that is what should happen in this case as well while may not necessarily solve a cashflow issue in the long term it will allow sipc to balance so that bridge loans from the us government feds public bonds could be used in between not meeting obligations i.e. bankruptcy that is an option and insurance companies have gone bankrupt before not unheard of but from the past experience again i 'd expect the us government to step in in general i do n't see any significant difference between sipc in the us and a generic insurance coverage elsewhere except that in the us sipc is mandatory well regulated and the coverage is uniform across brokerages which is a benefit to the consumer
