your own site business i ’m in freelancing and internet business for 15 years 20 years it experience currently i use freelance websites for cheap asian employees very seldom for eu usa employees and if only if local competition is heavily out pricing qualified staff till i went limited i.e. founded a limited corporation i was as freelancer and sole proprietor both with limited success due to the strong asian competition i myself currently hire the point where freelancing got not sustainable as primary income was 2006 for me do n’t want to get into detail but every freelancer who was active back then knows what i mean it was like whole india got internet if you have absolutely no references do it for the references a limited time and see the fee you pay as service for you to get references then start your own web identity either as freelancer or as corporation make sure you take your very satisfied customers with you every very satisfied customer in your contact list means 10 new customers which mean 2 new customers which mean 0.2 new customers and so on honestly this info is solely based on experience of this niche fro ma european citizen perspective if you ’re based anywhere else the situation might be totally different

most of the stuff that is making them money and putting them in the spotlight were started before satya took the ceo chair azure and all started under and are probably the best things going for them right now but again they are not market leaders in those spaces maybe but that is forced conversion   their os and licensing schemes are just awful they will not be a relevant player if they keep performing so poorly with these

the fact that you want to look for a home within the next 2 years and the lack of 401(k match leads me to suggest saving for the house as top priority a va loan for that purchase the va loan has a very low up front fee but a new home is always going to come with expenses that can add up better to have as much liquidity as you can if you have a lot of cash after the move in and furnishings it wo n't be tough to choose a high savings rate to jump start the retirement plan thank you for your service

while i would be very of making any investments in greece and if i lived there might want to strongly consider a larger than average investment in international funds such as an index fund on the us uk or german exchanges having debt in greece might not be such a bad thing if only it was denominated in local currency the big issue is that right now you 'd be taking out a loan on property in greece that would be denominated in euros   if worse comes to worse and greece is kicked out of the eu and forced to go back to the drachma then you might be in a situation where the bank says this loan is in euros we want payment in the same and if the drachma is plummeting vs the euro you could find your earning power presuming you were then paid in drachma greatly diminished and since you 'd be selling the house for drachma you might be way under water in terms of the value of the house due to currency exchange vs what you owed now if greece were currently on the drachma and you were talking about a mortgage in the same i 'd say go for it   since what tends to happen when a government has way overspent is they just print more money rather than default that tends to lead to inflation and a falling currency value vs other countries   none of which is bad for someone with a debt which would be rapidly shrinking due to the effect of inflation but right now safer to rent

in an ipo the seller is the company selling new shares some of the ipos also include something called secondary sales which are existing holders selling at the same time at the ipo price   but that is a but more unusual   and as someone noted the $ 68 is the price paid for the people who bought at the ipo the aggregate group usually called the syndicate the $ 85 is the price that it is trading at once there is trading in the open market   people that are able to get into the syndicate to buy the stock at $ 68 sometimes quickly sell if the price is much higher when trading starts this is called flipping the stock   hedge funds do this much more often than institutional buyers like fidelity

this is going to vary from insurer to insurer and likely year to year   typically an insurer will set what it calls the guaranteed rate of return for whole life policies and will allow you to take loans against the cash value of your policy at some adjustment to that rate   also typically you pay the interest back to yourself less some small administrative fee some insurers have whole life policies called something along the lines of an accelerated cash value policy or a high early cash value policy stick to these ones   the commission structure is less favorable to the agent broker but much more of your premium is recognized as cash value earlier the benefit for lack of a better word to taking a loan against your own cash value over taking a loan from a bank is the severely reduced process   there 's no underwriting for your loan like there would be from a bank   if you 're laid off maybe you ca n't get a loan from a bank but you can scoop some money out of your policy on a loan basis or alternatively you can just surrender the policy and take the accrued cash value many people will poo poo the value of whole life but fact of the matter is your underwriting status can change in the course of your life and it 's possible that in the future you wo n't be able to buy any life insurance   there 's nothing wrong with having something permanent to supplement your larger term policies personally i view diversification as having money in a lot of different places   this strategy is probably not as efficient as it could but i do n't like the idea of having all my eggs in one basket   i have cash in a lock box at home cash savings cds a personal loan portfolio bitcoins index funds individual stocks commodity etfs and bond funds spread in traditional 401(k roth ira and regular taxable accounts spread out to 6 different institutions   i do n't personally own any whole life but i 'll probably buy a small policy before my next 6-month birthday i might as well put some money there too   all of this is to say do not put all of your money in a whole life policy and do not buy all of your life insurance needs via whole life

credit is not free money the idea is you will repay all of it within a reasonable amount of time it is abundantly clear you either do n't really understand this concept or completely failed at planning for it or even at keeping up with how much you owe you are blaming the bank for letting you go over the limit the reason most banks will authorize that for credit customers is they do n't want to people in some sort of an emergency situation i 'd recommend you cut back on your spending and work on paying the balance down if you have been charged any over the limit fees you can attempt to negotiate getting those credited most banks will compromise on that the first time i do n't really recommend it but if there are some circumstances surrounding this that are temporary and you are very confident about being able to manage money better in the future chances are you might be able to get approved for another card if you otherwise have had some good credit history and this situation is very recent it may not even show up on your credit report yet and another bank might happily approve you they may even offer a low or zero interest for some time balance transfer deal which you should use to get the other card within the limit if that ends up working it 's very important that you keep in mind having dodged the bullet once does n't mean you will ever be able to do it again get your budget in order and pay things off

any inward remittance received by your parents can not be treated as income as per the this can at best be treated as gift however in india there is no gift tax for certain relations and there is no ceiling on the amount in your case gifting of money by son to father or is allowed without any limits and tax implication however if you father were to invest this money in his name and make gains the gains would be taxable   however if the money is being transfered with specific purpose such as to buy a property etc make sure you have the bank give your dad an certificate of inward remittance this is also advisable even otherwise the remittance certificate from bank that the credit entry in the account is because or funds into india and if the tax authorities were to question the large amount of credits it would be proof that it is due to inward remittance and not due to say a sale of property by your dad helpful links edit 1 what you father does with the money is treated as expense ie spends on day to day expense or pays off your loans or pay off his loans have no relevance from a tax in india   the only issue comes in say you have transfered the funds to buy a property and there was no purpose of remittance specified by bank 's letter and one want to this funds back to us then its an issue if you transfer the funds directly to your loan account again there is no tax implication to you in india as you are nri

your parents are nothing in our area was affordable for those services so we tried the clean your own kind they were really nice and probably would help train but seriously a few months of scraping poop into the trash and washing a bucket of smelly diapers got old i will say this the kind you clean yourself is the absolute cheapest option it was like $ 300 for a half week supply of cloth diapers so you 're doing diaper laundry twice a week and the only other added cost is the special detergent which was pretty cheap and lasted a long time then we sold them used on ebay for $ 200 and bought the next size up when it was time which was like 2 months later they snap to multiple sizes rinse and repeat works out pretty well if you 're willing to commit to washing poop cloth twice a week and 3 months of honest diapers is around $ 300 i think

you wo n't be able to sell the car with a lien outstanding on it and whoever the lender is they 're almost certain to have a lien on the car   you would have to pay the car off first and obtain a clear title then you could sell it when you took out the loan did you not receive a copy of the finance contract   i ca n't imagine you would have taken on a loan without signing paperwork and receiving your own copy at the time    if the company you 're dealing with is the lender they are obligated by law to furnish you with a copy of the finance contract all part of truth in lending laws upon request   it sounds to me like they know they 're charging you an illegally high called usury interest rate and if you have a copy of the contract then you would have proof of it   they 'll do everything they can to prevent you from obtaining it unless you have some help i would start by filing a complaint with the better business bureau because if they want to keep their reputation intact then they 'll have to respond to your complaint    i would also contact the state consumer protection bureau and/or the attorney general 's office in your state and ask them to look into the matter and i would see if there are any local consumer local television stations are a good source for this who can contact the lender on your behalf   knowing they have so many people looking into this could bring enough pressure for them to give you what you 're asking for and be more cooperative with you as has been pointed out keep a good detailed written record of all your contacts with the lender and as also pointed out start limiting your contacts to written letters certified return receipt requested so that you have documentation of your efforts companies like this succeed only because they prey on the fact many people either do n't know their rights or are too intimidated to assert them   do n't let these guys bully you and do n't take no for an answer until you get what you 're after another option might be to talk to a credit union or a bank if you have decent credit about taking out a loan with them to pay off the car so you can get this finance company out of your life

suggested way to make the decision to repair or buy figure out what it will cost to repair your car if necessary pay a garage to evaluate it as if your daughter was interested in buying it then think about whether you would pay that much to buy a car just like yours but without those problems if the answer is yes fixing it us probably your most cost effective choice even if it is a big bill if the answer is no consider a used car and again have the mechanic check it for any horrors before committing to buy it that avoids the line tax where a new car loses a significant percentage of its value the moment it leaves the dealership an almost toy car us virtually indistinguishable from a new car costs much less and realistically has about the same expected life span i bought a new car once at about $ 300 over the dealer 's real as opposed to sticker cost since i was willing to take the one he was stuck with from the previous model year thank you consumer reports for providing the dealer 's cost info and making this a five minute transaction if it had n't suffered flood damage i 'd probably still be driving it and even so i sorta regret not pricing what it would have cost go completely replace the engine if you really plan to drive it until it is completely you may be able to justify a new car but realistically buying a or two year old car would have been a better choice

i 'll add this to others having non deductible portion in your ira requires additional tax forms to be attached to your tax return and tracking if you plan to have long term investments in your non deductible ira such as say target funds or long term stock positions that you expect to hold till retirement it may be better to keep them in a non ira account this is because the income tax on the withdrawals from the ira is at ordinary rates and from the regular investment account is at capital gains rate while the rates can definitely change traditionally capital gains rates are significantly lower than the ordinary income bracket rates so generally i think that having non deductible ira deposits is only useful if you 're planning a roth conversion in a near future

off the top of my head i do n't know of any publicly traded companies that routinely earmark distributions as return of capital but theoretically it 's certainly applicable to any publicly traded company the wikipedia article gives one situation in which a publicly traded company may use return of capital public business may return capital as a means to increase the debt equity ratio and increase their leverage risk profile since return of capital is a distribution it shrinks the firm 's equity thus increasing its leverage investopedia also has an article dividend facts you may not know that gives an example of when return of capital might be used sometimes especially in the case of a special large dividend part of the dividend is actually declared by the company to be a return of capital in this case instead of being taxed at the time of distribution the return of capital is used to reduce the basis of the stock making for a larger capital gain down the road assuming the selling price is higher than the basis for instance if you buy shares with a basis of $ 10 each and you get a $ 1 special dividend 55 cents of which is return of capital the taxable dividend is 45 cents the new basis is $ and you will pay capital gains tax on that 55 cents when you sell your shares sometime in the future a company may choose to earmark some or all of its distribution as return of capital in order to provide shareholders with a more beneficial tax treatment the irs describes this different tax treatment distributions that qualify as a return of capital are not dividends a return of capital is a return of some or all of your investment in the stock of the company a return of capital reduces the basis of your stock these distributions do n't necessarily count as taxable income except in some instances once the basis of your stock has been reduced to zero any further non dividend distribution is capital gain the irs also states a distribution generally qualifies as a return of capital if the corporation making the distribution does not have any accumulated or current year earnings and profits in this case the firm is lowering its equity because it 's paying distributions out of that equity instead of accumulated earnings profits a company may use return of capital to maintain a distribution even in times of financial difficulty   in the context of closed end funds however return of capital can be much more complicated and can affect the fund 's performance and reputation in numerous ways also jb king is correct in you that return of capital is not the same thing as return on the latter is a method for valuing a company and determining how efficient a company is where it comes to using its resources to quote jb king 's comment again

from indian context there are a number of factors that are influencing the economic condition and the exchange rate interest rate etc are reflection of the situation i shall try and answer the question through the above indian example india is running a budget deficit of 4 odd for last 6 7 years which means that is spending more than their revenue collection this money is not in the system so the govt has to print the money either the direct 4 or the interest it has to pay on the money it borrows to cover the 4 do n't confuse this with us printing post 2008 after printing the supply of inr is more compared to usd in the market inr is current a c convertible value of inr usd falls in simplistic terms there is another impact of this printing it increases the money supply in domestic market leading to inflation and overall price rise to contain this price rise reserve bank of india rbi increases the interest rates and increases compulsory reserve ratio thus trying to pull lock up money so that overall money supply decreases but there is a limit to which rbi can do this as overall growth rate keeps falling as money is more expensive to borrow to invest the above in simplistic term how this is working however there are many factors in economy and the above should be treated as it is intended to a simplistic view only

if you are struggling with debt and can not realistically pay your debts off with your current level of income these businesses offer for a fee to negotiate with your debt providers a sum that you can realistically afford to pay the debt providers will consider the offer because they would rather get some money back rather than nothing as these are usually unsecured loans for you it can be a better deal than going bankrupt or trying to struggle endlessly to pay off something you ca n't afford to pay off note that even though you wo n't be bankrupt you will be treated by lenders very similar to being bankrupt in other words it will be very hard for you to get new loans in the near future

our view is that just be cause amzn can disrupt somebody else 's profit stream it does n't mean that amzn earns that profit stream for the moment the market does n't agree perhaps simply being disruptive is enough   while he is right in theory the problem with this viewpoint is it is incredibly short sighted amazon is disrupting spaces to the point of near outright eliminating entire markets when amazon eliminates a market that revenue has to go somewhere and while amazon may not turn a profit on it now since they now own that entire market it would be extremely simple to in the future   i can make comments for most of these companies the reason disruption is being valued so high is because the disruption happening today is so massive compared to history the disruption these four companies are causing is on the order of magnitude of what ford caused with the assembly line except greater

as in most anti living wage   editorials there is a lot of here   first the workers are not minimum wage in the sense that increasing the minimum wage will not increase their wages   second the article cites that one worker claimed to be making $ 2 and hour less in tips before the law was enacted with wages unchanged that seems like pretty strong evidence that tipping behavior is ultimately independent of the minimum wage   finally the article cites studies that show that workers that rely on tips have higher poverty levels than those that do n't   so while the article appears to be an editorial opposed to increasing minimum wage a more objective look at the evidence presented suggests that the minimum wage should be increased and that is either a bit of an idiot or he recognizes that as a non minimum wage earner he benefits from the inequality of a lower minimum wage

no if you are taking a loss solely and purely to reduce the tax you have to pay then it is not a good strategy in fact it is a very bad strategy no matter what country you are in no investment choice should be made solely due to your tax if you are paying tax that means you made a profit if you made a loss just to save some tax then you are loosing money the whole point of investing is to make money not lose it

to the average consumer the financial health of a bank is completely irrelevant   the fdic 's job is to make it that way   even if a bank does go under the fdic is very good at making sure there is little no interruption in service   usually another bank just takes over the asset of the failing bank and you do n't even notice the difference   you might have a hour window where your local atm does n't work i also really question the fdic is broke statement   the fdic has access to additional funding beyond the deposit insurance fund mentioned in your link   it also has the ability to borrow from the treasury if you look into the fdic 's report a bit closer the amount in the provision for insurance losses is not just money spent on failing banks   it also includes money that has been set aside to cover anticipated failures and litigation   saying the fdic is broke is like saying i am broke because my checking account balance went down after i moved some money into a rainy day fund failure of the fdic would signal a failure of our financial system and the government that backs it   if the fdic fails your petty checking account would be meaningless anyway   the important things would be non perishable food clean water and guns ammo that said it will be interesting to see the latest quarterly report for the fdic when it is released next week   the article implies things will look a little better for the fdic but we 'll see

you mention early exercise in your title but you seem to misunderstand what early exercise really means some companies offer stock options that vest over a number of years but which can be exercised before they are vested that is early exercise you have vested stock options so early exercise is not relevant it may or may not be the case that your stock options could have been early exercised before they vested but regardless you did n't exercise them so the point is moot as littleadv said 83(b election is for restricted stocks often from exercising unvested stock options your options are already vested so they wo n't be restricted stock so 83(b election is not relevant for you a taxable event happen when you exercise the point of the 83(b election is that exercising unvested stock options is not a taxable event so 83(b election allows you to force it to be a taxable event but for you with vested stock options there is no need to do this you mention that you want it not to be taxable upon exercise but that 's what incentive stock options isos are for isos were designed for the purpose of not being taxable for regular income tax purposes when you exercise although it is still taxable upon exercise for amt purposes and it is only taxed when you sell however you have non qualified stock options were you given the option to get isos at the beginning why did your company give you i do n't know the specifics of your situation but since you mentioned early exercise and 83(b elections i have a hypothesis as to what might have happened for people who early exercise for plans that allow early exercise there is a slight advantage to having compared to isos this is because if you early exercise immediately upon grant and do 83(b election you pay no taxes upon exercise because the difference between strike price and fmv is 0 and there are no taxes upon vesting for regular or amt and if you hold it for at least 1 year upon sale it will be long term capital gains on the other hand for isos it 's the same except that for long term capital gains you have to hold it 2 years after grant and 1 year after exercise so the period for long term capital gains is longer so companies that allow early exercise will often offer employees either or isos where you would choose if you intend to early exercise or iso otherwise if hypothetically that 's what happened then you chose wrong because you got and did n't early exercise

let 's look at the two options   it sounds like at this time the company has enough cash to pay you a salary or pay your loan off but not both at the same time ideally in the future there will be enough cash flow to be able to do both at the same time   if you start your salary now when the cash flow increases to the point where the company can pay off your loan you will continue to receive your salary while the loan is being repaid so it is probably most advantageous to you to start the salary now and wait with the loan payments if you think that the company is not going to make it and there is a danger of not ever getting the loan repaid this could change however you are probably optimistic about the company or you would n't have made the loan and agreed to work for free in the first place with the other option the company gets out of debt quicker and cheaper i can totally understand your brother wanting to eliminate this debt asap   it looks like you and your brother had different expectations about what was going to happen that 's why it is so critical to put these kinds of agreements in writing if you had had a payment schedule in your written loan agreement this would n't be an issue of course the issue of how long you would continue to work for free would still be there but this could also have been decided ahead of time as is you have two different things going on that were left up in the air with no formal agreement   as to what is fair that is something only you and he can work out perhaps you can propose a payment schedule for your loan that the company can afford now while paying your salary that way you will start getting paid for working and the company will start moving toward eliminating the debt   i hope that you will be able to agree to a solution without ruining the relationship you have with your brother besides the fact that family relationships are important a rift between the two of you would certainly be disastrous for the company and as a result your and his finances

yes merchants may charge a fee for using a credit card for a credit card transaction interchange fees flow from the merchant to the card issuer this is why australians are seeing a boom in debit mastercard visa cards the issuing banks make income when you select credit   these costs can be passed from the merchant to the customer as a credit card fee for an transaction the interchange flows the other way from the card issuer to the acquiring bank the merchant 's bank   as an aside the setup of these fees is why some large supermarket chains in australia restrict you from selecting credit with a scheme debit card mastercard and visa are schemes   they are in the payments networks and they make interchange fees when you hit savings and pay if you hit credit therefore where you can hit either credit or savings they prefer and may force you to press savings

it 's important to distinguish between speculation and investing buying something because you hope to make money on market fluctuations is speculation buying something and expecting to make money because your money is providing actual economic value is investing   if person a buys 100 shares of a stock with the intent of selling them in a few hours and person b buys 100 shares of the same stock with the intent of holding on to it for a year then obviously at that point they both have the same risk the difference comes over the course of the year first person b is going to be making money from the economic value the company provides over the whole year while the only way person a can make money is from market fluctuation the economic value the company provides over the course of an hour is unlikely to be significant person b is exposed to the risk of buying the stock but that 's by the profit from holding the stock for a year while person a just has the risk second if person a is buying a new stock every hour then they 're going to have thousands of transactions so even though person b assumed just as much risk as person a for that one transaction person a has more total risk

so a major problem with looking at historical stock data on these graphs is that they set the stock price based off of current market if i was to say look at entertainment cool in june of 2016 it would say that the stock as trading between $ 5 6 in reality it was between   but in august there was a reverse split so june 's value based on todays current share count would be about $ 5 6 per one share 1988 for home depot must have been a really bad year for them and because of all the splits they 've had over the years already screws that estimate of what one share is worth there 's a lot of variance in 1988 but you have to be looking at only 1988 87 and 89 really screws the the chart 's scale

when you hear advice to buy index funds that usually comes with two additional pieces of investment discipline advice that are important these two elements are important to give you relative predictability in your outcome 20 years from now   in this old blog post of mine i linked to warren buffett talking about this also   mentioned it in a comment on another answer it 's perfectly plausible to do poorly over 20 years if you buy 100 stocks at once without dollar cost averaging or rebalancing it 's very very very plausible to do poorly over 10 years such as the last 10 in fact can you really say you know your financial situation in 20 30 years and for sure wo n't need that money because predictability is important i like buying a balanced fund and not pure stocks http://blog.ometer.com/2010/11/10/take-risks-in-life-for-savings-choose-a-balanced-fund/ feel a little bad linking to my blog but all that into this answer seems dumb here 's another tip you can go one step past dollar cost averaging and try value averaging however chances are you are n't even going to be good about rebalancing if it 's done by hand so personally i would not do value averaging unless you can find either a fund or a financial advisor to do it for you automatically finance buff blog makes a case for a financial advisor in case you like that more than my balanced fund suggestion like rebalancing value averaging makes you buy more when you 're depressed about the market and less when it 's exciting it 's hard   dollar cost averaging is easily done by setting up automatic investment of course so you do n't have to do it manually in the way you would with value averaging if you read the usual books on index funds and efficient markets it 's easy to remember the takeaway that nobody knows whether the market will go up or down and yes you wo n't successfully time the market but what you can do successfully is use an investment discipline with risk control assume that the market will fluctuate that both up and down are likely and possible and optimize for predictability in light of that most importantly optimize to take your emotions and behavior out of the picture some disciplines for example are there are dozens out there many of them snake oil i think these i mentioned are valid anyway you need some form of risk control and putting all your money in stocks at once does n't give you a lot of risk control there 's no real need to get creative a balanced fund that uses index funds for equity and bond portions is a great choice

in the us if your monthly statement was issued by the credit card company on january 1 and it showed a balance of $ 1000 then a payment must be made towards that balance by january 25 or so not february 1 as you say to keep the card in good standing the minimum payment required to keep the card in good standing is specified in your monthly statement and failure to meet this requirement can trigger various consequences such as an increase in the interest rate charged by the credit card company with regard to interest charges whether your purchase of $ 2000 on   january 3 is charged interest or not depends entirely on what happened the previous two months   if you had paid both your monthly statements dated november 1 and december 1 of the previous year in full by the their respective due dates of november 25 and december 25 and the $ 1000 balance on the january 1 statement is entirely due to purchases no cash advances made in december then you will not be charged interest on your january purchase of $ 2000 as long as you pay it off in full by february 25 the charge will appear on your february 1 statement but if you had not paid your december 1 statement in full by december 25 then that $ 1000 billed to you on january 1 will include   purchases made during december finance charges on the unpaid balance from the previous month   plus finance charges on the purchases made during december the finance charges will continue to accumulate during january until such time as you pay off the bill in full these charges will appear on your february 1 statement hopefully by the due date of january 25 but even if you pay off that $ 1000 in full on january 25 your charge of $ 2000 on january 3 will start to accumulate finance charges as of the day it hits the account and these finance charges will appear on your february 1 statement   if you paid off that $ 1000 on january 10 say then maybe there will be no further finance charges on the $ 2000 purchase on january 3 after january 10 but now we are getting into the real fine print of what your credit card agreement says ditto for the case when you pay off that $ 1000 on january 2 and made the $ 2000 charge on january 3 you most likely will not be charged interest on that $ 2000 charge but again it depends on the fine print for example it might say that you will be charged interest on the average of the daily balances for january but will not be charged interest on purchases during the february cycle unless you miss the february 25 payment and the whole cycle starts all over again as a general rule it takes two monthly cycles of payment in full by the due date before one gets into the state of no finance charges for new purchases and effectively an interest free loan of $ 2000 from january 3 date of purchase till february 25 due date of payment   matters become more complicated when cash advances are taken from a credit card which are charged interest from the day they are taken but do n't trigger finance charges on new purchases or the so called zero percent balance transfer offers are accepted

they 're probably talking about flipping houses the conventional wisdom when flipping is to purchase the property with a mortgage or other loan on do the work to it get it listed for re sale promptly this step has varying strategies with a profitable price but one that will make it move have the house sold on or before the first payment would be due this is anywhere from 30 to 60 days the flipper then never has to make a payment on the mortgage or loan the costs of the home are recovered promptly potentially before any loan credit card payments or invoices are due and there is a profit this also assumes that either a 100 loan or some other mechanism is used to address closing costs and fees this model fits the premise of the in that you make money investing in real estate but never have to tie up any of your own money in the process

they help fund road projects that would otherwise require an increase in the fuel tax a large enough project like a new limited access will cost hundreds of millions to construct so they float some bonds that will be paid off with toll revenue lots of times after the bonds have been paid off the state has the options to remove the toll and put the road back   in the pool with all the other roads of course governments very rarely voluntarily a revenue stream   for example here in georgia we only have one toll road wiki in atlanta despite having 10 million residents how do you justify increasing fuel taxes on residents hundreds of miles away on the coast for a transportation project that only benefits atlanta commuters you can not thus tolls

while from a money saving standpoint the obviously right course of action is to make only the minimum payment on the 0 loan there are potentially legal reasons to try to pay off a car loan early with a mortgage you are the legal owner of the property and any action by the lender beyond imposing fees e.g. foreclosure requires going through the proper legal channels on the other hand in most jurisdictions you are not the legal owner of a car purchased on a loan and a missed or even lost payment can result in repossession without the lender even having to go to court so from a risk aversion standpoint there 's something to be said for getting rid of car loans as soon as you can

taking out your equity when refinancing means that you take out a new loan for the full value of your house perhaps less 20 as a down payment on the new mortgage otherwise you 'll be paying insurance pay off your old lender and keep the rest for yourself the result is much the same as using as a heloc or home equity loan or a second mortgage except it 's all rolled into a single new mortgage the advantage is that the interest rate on a first mortgage is going to be lower than on heloc or equivalent and the equity requirements may be lower e.g. a heloc may only let you borrow against the amount of equity that exceeds 25 or 30 while a new mortgage will require you only to have 20 equity   this is especially attractive to those whose homes have appreciated significantly since they bought them especially if they have a lot of high interest debt e.g. credit cards they want to pay off of course rolling credit card debt into a 30-year mortgage is n't actually paying it off but the monthly payments will be a lot lower and if you 're lucky and your home appreciates further you can pay it off fully when you sell the property and still have paid a lot less interest the downside is that you have turned unsecured debt into secured debt which puts your home at risk if you find yourself unable to pay in your case you do n't yet have even 20 equity in your home so i would n't recommend this   equity is simply the difference between the amount you still owe on your home and the amount you 'd get if you were to sell it until you do sell it this amount is tentative based on the original purchase price and perhaps an intervening appraisal that shows that the property has appreciated that is really all that it is and there 's nothing magic about it except that since you own your home you have equity in it while as a renter you would not it used to be decades ago when you needed 20 down to get a mortgage that selling was the only time you 'd be able to do anything with the equity in your home now you can take it out as described above or borrow against it thanks to various financial products it is sometimes tempting to consider equity roughly equivalent to profit but some of it is your own money contributed through the down payment your monthly principal payment and improvements you have made so cashing out is n't all profit it 's partly just you getting your own money back and there are many additional expenses involved in owning a home such as interest property taxes maintenance utilities and various fees not to mention the commissions when you buy or sell which the equity calculation does n't consider increasing equity reflects that you own a desirable property in a desirable location that you have maintained and maybe even improved it that you are financially responsible i.e. paying your mortgage taxes etc and that your financial interests are aligned with your neighbors all those things feel pretty good and they should otherwise it is just a number that the banks will sometimes let you borrow against

i do n't have a formula for anything like this but it is important to note that the current value of any asset is really theoretical until you actually sell it for example let 's consider a house   you can get an appraisal done on your house where your home is inspected and the sales of similar houses in your area are compared   however this value is only theoretical   if you found yourself in a situation where you absolutely had to sell your house in one week you would most likely have to settle for much less than the appraised value the same hold true for collectibles   if i have something rare that i need cash for immediately i can take it to a pawn shop and get cash   however if i take my time and locate a genuinely interested collector i can get more for it this is comparable to someone who holds a significant percentage of shares in a publicly held corporation   if the current market value of your shares is $ 10 million but you absolutely need to sell your entire stake today you are n't going to get $ 10 million   but if you take your time selling a little at a time you are more likely to get much closer to this $ 10 million number a motivated seller means that the price will drop

this answer is provided mostly to answer your question what is it a variable annuity is a contract between you and an insurance company the insurance company takes a bunch of money up front as a lump sum and will pay you some money yearly like earning interest in this case they will probably be paying you the money into the account itself how much they return is as the name suggests variable it can be anything depending on what the contract says mostly there will be some formula based on the stock market frequently the performance of the standard poors 500 index there will typically be some minimum returns and maximum returns if the stock market tanks your annuity will not lose a ton of value but if the stock market goes up a lot in one year as it frequently does you will not gain a lot of value either if you are going to be in the market for a long amount of time decades e.g. a few years out of college and then a little it makes a lot more sense to invest in the stock market directly this is essentially what the insurance company is going to do except you can cut out the middleman you can get a lot more money that way you are essentially paying the insurance company to take on some stock market risk for you you are buying some safety buying safety like this is expensive   variable annuities are the right investment for a few people in a few circumstances mostly if you 're near retirement it 's one way to have an option for a safe investment for a portion but not all of your portfolio maybe depending on the specifics a lot if you are under like 50 or so almost certainly a terrible investment which will gradually waste your money by not growing it as fast as it deserves to be grown since you want to transfer it to vanguard you can probably call vanguard ask to open a roth ira and request assistance rolling it over from the place it is held now there should be no legal restrictions or tax consequences from transferring the money from one roth ira account to another

most of this advice applies to the uk where i work in motor insurance pricing for a large personal lines insurer but a lot of it is more general a loyal customer is usually an overpaying customer the guiding most financial services companies go by is that there 's no point rewarding loyalty except to create it where none exists i.e. by giving massive discounts to desirable new customers   shop around every time your policy comes up for renewal and whenever your circumstances change never allow your policy to automatically renew you may be charged a higher premium by default if you do phone up your current insurer and haggle to see if they can beat the best quote you find their agents will usually be able offer a discount if applicable in your country use price comparison websites use at least two different insurers sometimes offer different rates on different sites competing harder on some than on others especially if the price comparison website happens to be owned by one of the insurance companies that quotes on it one example of this is which is owned by rsa group a major insurer if there are no price comparison websites for your country try purchasing your policy through a broker they 'll get quotes from a panel of insurers and offer you the cheapest they can be especially helpful if you have a problematic driving history e.g. drink driving convictions as many mainstream insurers will decline to quote for such people other suggestions chris rea 's answer is a good starting point but i would disagree about cutting back on cover in the uk at least many insurers often charge an equal or greater amount for lower levels of cover because the people who choose these policies tend to be worse risks re switching vehicles a cheap old car will not necessarily be much cheaper to insure than a new expensive one as you can still people with it or crash into other people 's cars and the newer car will probably have better safety features however a less powerful and smaller vehicle typically poses less of a threat to others and will therefore be cheaper to insure another tactic not mentioned so far is reverse fronting fronting where the main driver poses as an additional driver and a less risky driver as the main driver is illegal but the reverse adding a less risky driver as an additional driver is legal and can sometimes reduce premiums this is because only one of you can drive the car at any one time and sometimes it 'll be the less risky one so especially if you 're male and aged < 25 see if adding your safest parent as a named driver makes a difference if you have the choice of storing your car on a driveway or on the street get quotes for both and see which is cheaper if you live in an area where is commonplace thieves are more likely to steal cars left on driveways as they can break into the owner 's home and steal the keys if not the driveway is better as it reduces the risk of a collision if you have previously driven another vehicle e.g. motorbike or or if you 've been insured as an additional driver on someone else 's car call up insurers directly and ask if they can offer you a no claims bonus for this quotes from price comparison websites tend to limit you to the numbers of years of no claims you 've accrued as a main driver and may not reflect your full available no claims bonus extreme measures some insurers give you the option to install a tracking device in your car that can tell them various things e.g.   some people may be uncomfortable sharing this much information with their insurer but for particularly risky drivers i 'm looking at you males < 25 it can sometimes result in a substantial saving one insurer that offers this is finally if every insurer you can find is quoting in excess of £ 10,000 for a year 's cover you may find it cheaper instead to purchase a vintage agricultural vehicle and get it covered on a specialist farmer 's policy

first things first its always good to set the records straight when you are trying to clear your debt do them one by one and ask the collection agent that you would pay in full only if the records would be deleted from your credit history and most of the collection agencies are happy to take it off your credit report as they are getting the money this would work generally only when you pay the full amount i can guarantee you this because i have tried it myself after hearing about it from my friends   if you have already paid whole amount already then records of your payments generally will not be available after 2 years with any banks even the big ones like bank of america or wells fargo that means if they do n't have the records no body else would because its a burden as your payment is written off you can file a dispute to credit bureaus for your payment history and if they could n't provide you the history they have to take your record off your history even they know that you have delinquent history because they do n't have enough proof to confirm that and when you file a dispute its always good to file it by paper as they have to write back and you can ask hard copies of the proofs which are very difficult to get one more thing if you want to dispute it might take couple of months atleast and you need to have patience because you already might have known how important credit history is

generally investing in index tracking funds in the long term poses relatively low risk compared to short term investment aka speculation no one says differently however it is a higher risk than money market savings bonds the reason for that is that the return is not guaranteed and loss is not limited here volatility plays part as well as general market conditions although the volatility risk also affects bonds at some level as well while long term trend may be upwards short term trend may be significantly different take as an example year 2008 for s&p500 if by any chance you needed to liquidate your investment in november 2008 after investing in november 1998 you might have ended up with 0 gain or even loss had you waited just another year or liquidated a year earlier the result would be significantly different that 's the volatility risk you do n't invest indefinitely even when you invest long term at some point you 'll have to liquidate your investment higher volatility means that there 's a higher chance of downward spike just at that point of time killing your gains even if the general trend over the period around that point of time was upward as it was for s&p500 for example for the period 1998 2014 with the significant downward spikes in 2003 and 2008 if you invest in major indexes these kinds of risks are hard to avoid as they 're all tied together so you need to diversify between different kinds of investments bonds vs stocks as the books parrot and/or different markets not only us but also foreign

my opinion is that 50 savings is the number to shoot for and i strive toward that number as often as possible   10 savings for retirement 10 savings for short term emergency fund 25 payment on mortgage principal 5 savings for planned big purchases i overpay the principal so that 25 of my income goes to principal payments and i separately account for the mortgage interest home owners insurance as another expense in my budget   because of this aggressive payment schedule the house i bought 2 years ago will be payed in full in another 9 years   i own another property outright that i paid down in the same fashion and i collect rent on it as a supplement to my income   i started with a small townhouse that i could easily afford but now i have a much larger home that i can still easily afford the emergency fund does n't need to be more than 6 months of expenses which is 3 months of income if your expenses are only 50 of your income   i keep 6 months of expenses liquid and another 12 in a low risk investment   once you have your emergency fund funded you can add that percentage to a different category say 15 to retirement and 10 to planned big purchases or you can over fund it   i have had a few catastrophes that have depleted that fund so i like having the extra 12 months of income available i set the last 5 aside for wants that are not regular expenses   if i want a car i save 5 of my income until i can pay cash for it   i have an infinite number of these wants so i prioritize them and buy them in order when the cash becomes available the reason i use percentages is to keep me focused when my income increases instead of spending all the additional money that i could afford to spend each time i get a raise i instead only increase my expenses to the 50 mark   it was much harder to save 50 when i got my first job out of college but now i live quite comfortably on that percentage and i could take a large hit to my income before i would need to make significant changes to my lifestyle

first off the answer to your question is something everyone would like to know there are fund managers at fidelity who will a pay $ 100 million fee to someone who can tell them a safe way to earn interest the first thing to decide is do you want to save money or invest money if you just want to save your money you can keep it in cash certificates of deposit or gold each has its advantages and disadvantages for example gold tends to hold its value over time and will always have value even if russia switzerland and the swiss franc becomes worthless your gold will still be useful and spendable as alan greenspan famously wrote long ago gold is always accepted if you want to invest money and make it grow yet still have the money fluent which i assume means liquid your main option is a major equity since those can be readily bought and sold i know in your question you are reluctant to put your money at the mercy of one stock but the criteria you have listed match up with an equity investment so if you want to meet your goals you are going to have to come to terms with your fears and buy a stock find a good blue chip stock that is in an industry with positive prospects stay away from stuff that is sexy or hyped focus on just one stock that way you can research it to death the better you understand what you are buying the greater the chance of success zurich financial services is a very solid company right now in a nice boring highly profitable business might fit your needs perfectly they were founded in one of the safest equities you will find nestle is another option is another if you want something a little more risky consider fischer anyway what i can tell you is that your goals match up with a blue chip equity as the logical type of investment note on diversification many financial advisors will advise you to diversify for example by investing in many stocks instead of just one or even by buying funds that are invested in hundreds of stocks or indexes that are invested in the whole market i disagree with this philosophy would you go into a casino and divide your money putting a small portion on each game no it is a bad idea because most of the games have poor returns yet that is exactly what you do when you diversify it is a false sense of safety the proper thing to do is exactly what you would do if forced to bet in casino find the game with the best return get as good as you can at that game and play just that one game that is the proper and smart thing to do

whichever is most convenient for the two of you so it will depend on the situation if you two are close by cash is probably the best option your friend can hand it over to you in a number of ways if you two are far apart a cheque would probably be the better option you do n't want cash to get stolen from the mail if it is international and/or you need it asap something like western union would work better it would cost me usd not sure what fees are for cad but comes with additional protections to prevent fraud your friend could deposit the money on one side of the world and you could pick it up at another side of the world within the hour assuming cash other payment methods may take longer other considerations

take the case where a stock has just two owners a and b both at $ 10 one of them sells his shares to c at $ 11   now b has made $ 1 in profit but is no longer an owner of the stock a has n't sold anything but his shares are worth 10 more due to the last traded price printed c has bought shares at $ 11 and the price is $ 11 so technically he has n't lost any money in a larger market there are winners and losers every day on a single stock but they may not remain owners of a stock there could be days in which those that remain owners are all winners say when a stock goes up to an all time high and all those that are currently owners have an average buy price lower than the last traded price and the reverse applies too   it is of course more complicated say you own a stock and let someone else borrow it for a short selling opportunity he sells it in the market for each uptick in price you win the short seller loses and the guy he sold it to also wins a person that has a covered call on a stock is not a winner beyond a point and so on

rob i 'm sorry your first visit here has been unpleasant   what you are asking for is beyond the capability of most software if you look at you find the standard deduction for married filing joint is $ in 2012 and $ in 2013 i offer this anecdote to share a deduction story the first year i did my mil 's taxes i had to explain that she did n't    have enough deductions to itemize every year since she hands me a    file full of paper medical deductions that do n't exceed    7.5 of her income in turn i give her two folders back one with the 5 or so documents i needed and the rest labeled trash fewer than 30 of filers itemize and a good portion of those that do have no question that 's the right thing to do e.g. my property tax is more than the $ 12 k so anything else i have that 's a deduction adds right to the number   it 's really just those people who are at the edge that are likely frustrated i wrote an article regarding standard deduction vs itemizing in which i describe a method of pulling in one 's deductible expenses into odd years reducing the number in even years to allow a bi annual if this is your situation you 'll find the concept interesting   you also ask about filing status think on this for a minute after pulling in our turbotax imports the data right from adp i do the same for our stock info the stock info and all schedule a deductions are n't assigned a name so any effort to split them in search of savings by using married filing separate would first require splitting these up turbotax has a what if worksheet for this function but when the marriage penalty was lifted years ago the change in status had no value items that phaseout over certain income levels are often lost to the separate filer anyway when i got married i found my real estate losses each year could not be taken they accumulated until i either sold or until our income dropped when the mrs retired   so while is respect your desire for these magic within the software i think it 's fair to say they would provide little value to most people   if this thread stays open i 'd be curious if anyone can cite an example where filing separately actually benefits the couple

in short your scenario could work in theory but is not realistic generally speaking you can borrow up to some percentage of the value of the property usually 80 90 though it can vary based on many factors   so if your property currently has a value of $ 100k you could theoretically borrow a total of $ 80 90k against it   so how much you can get at any given time depends on the current value as compared to how much you owe   a simple way to ballpark it would be to use this formula =      if your available equity allowed you to borrow what you wanted and you then applied it to additions renovations your base property value would hopefully increase   however as other people mentioned you very rarely get a value increase that is near what you put into the improvements and it is not uncommon for improvements to have no significant impact on the overall value   just because you like something about your improvements does n't mean the market will agree just for the sake of argument though lets say you find the magic combination of improvements that increases the property value in line with their cost   if such a feat were accomplished your $ 40k improvement on a $ 100k property would mean it is now worth $ 140k   let us further stipulate that your $ 40k loan to fund the improvements put you at a 90 loan to value ratio   so prior to starting the improvements you owed $ 90k on a $ 100k property   after completing the work you would owe $ 90k on what is now a $ 140k property putting you at a loan to value ratio of   meaning you theoretically have 26 equity available to borrow against to get back to the 90 level or roughly $ 36k   note that this is 10 less than the increase in the property value   meaning that you are in the realm of diminishing returns and each iteration through this process would net you less working capital the real picture is actually a fair amount worse than outlined in the above ideal scenario as we have yet to account for any of the costs involved in obtaining the financing or the decreases in your credit score which would likely accompany such a pattern   each time you go back to the bank asking for more money they are going to charge you for new appraisals and all of the other fees that come out at closing   also each time you ask them for more money they are going to your credit and see the additional inquires and associated debt stacking up which in turn drops your score which prompts the banks to offer higher interest rates and/or charge higher fees also when a bank loans against a property that is already securing another debt they are generally putting themselves at the back of the line in terms of their claim on the property in case of default   in my experience it is very rare to find a lender that is willing to put themselves third in line much less any farther back   generally if you were to ask for such a loan the bank would insist that the prior commitments be paid off before they would lend to you   meaning the bank that you ask for the $ 36k noted above would likely respond by saying they will loan you $ 70k provided that $ 40k of it goes directly to paying off the previous equity line

exact rules may be different depending on the size of the investor the specific broker and the country   for both the us and canada short sales occur only through one 's margin account   and shares that are borrowed for shorting only come from a margin account shares held in a cash account are not available for shorting   from wikipedia short finance the speculator instructs the broker to sell the shares and the    proceeds are credited to his broker 's account at the firm upon which    the firm can earn interest generally the short seller does not earn    interest on the short proceeds and can not use or the proceeds    for another transaction as with many questions i 'd suggest you contact your broker for the exact details governing your account

in this scenario the date of income is the date on which the contract has been signed even if you received the actual money settlement later regardless of the ny special law for residency termination that is the standard rule for recognition of income during a cash not installments sale the fact that you got the actual money later does n't matter which is similar to selling stocks on a public exchange when you sell stocks through your broker on a public exchange you still recognize the income on the day of the sale not on the day of the settlement this is called the constructive receipt doctrine the irs publication 538 has this to say about the constructive receipt constructive receipt    income is constructively received when an    amount is credited to your account or made available to you without    restriction you need not have possession of it if you authorize    someone to be your agent and receive income for you you are    considered to have received it when your agent receives it income is    not constructively received if your control of its receipt is subject    to substantial restrictions or limitations once you signed the contract the money has essentially been credited to your account with the counter party and unless they 're bankrupt or otherwise insolvent you have no restrictions over it and also more specifically for your case you can not hold checks or postpone taking possession of similar    property from one tax year to another to postpone paying tax on the    income you must report the income in the year the property is    received or made available to you without restriction timing wire transfer is akin to holding and not depositing a check from this perspective so unless there was a restriction that was lifted after you moved out of new york i doubt you can claim that you could n't have received it before moving out i.e. you have in fact constructively received it

i recently moved out from my parents place after having built up sufficient funds and gone through these questions myself i live near louisville ky which has a significant effect on my income cost of living and cost of housing factor that into your decisions to answer your questions in order when do i know that i 'm financially stable to move out when you have enough money set aside for all projected expenses for 3 6 months and an emergency fund of 4 10 k depending on how large a safety net you want or need note that part of the reason for the emergency fund is as a buffer for the things you wo n't realize you need until you move out such as pots or chairs it also covers things being more expensive than anticipated should i wait until both my emergency fund is at least 6 months of pay    and my loans in my parents names is paid off to free up money 6 months of pay is not a good measuring stick use months of expenses instead in general student loans are a small enough cost per month that you just need to factor them into your costs when should i factor in the newer car investment how much should i    have set aside for the car do the car while you are living at home this allows you to put more than the minimum payment down each month and you can get ahead that looks good on your credit and allows refinancing later for a lower minimum payment when you move out finally it gives you a sense of the monthly cost while you still have leeway to adjust things   depending on new used status of the car set aside around 3 5 k for a down payment that gives you a decent rate without too much haggling trouble should i get an apartment for a couple years before looking for my own    house not unless you want the flexibility of an apartment in general living at home is cheaper if you intend to eventually buy property in the same area an apartment is throwing money away if you want to move every few years an apartment can depending on the lease give you that how much should i set aside for either investment apartment vs    house 10 20 k for a down payment if you live around louisville ky be very about the price of your house and this gives you the best of everything the biggest mistake you can make is trying to get into a place too early banks pay attention to the down payment for a good reason it indicates commitment care and an ability to go the distance in general a mortgage is 30 years you wo n't pay it off for a long time so plan for that is there anything else i should be doing taking advantage of with my    money during this living at home period before i finally leave the    nest if there is something you want now 's the time to get it you can make snap purchases on furniture motorcycles games and not hurt yourself take vacations since there is room in the budget if you 've thought about moving to a different state for work travel there for a weekend week and see if you even like the place look for deals on things you 'll need when you move out towels furniture and so forth can be bought cheaply and you can get quality but it takes time to find these deals pick up activities with monthly expenses boxing dancing gym memberships and so forth become much more difficult to fit into the budget later they also give you a better credit rating for a recurring expense and allow you to get a feel for how things like a monthly utility bill will work finally get involved in various investments a 401k is only the start so look at penny stocks indexed funds etfs or other things to diversify with check out local businesses or start something on the side experiment and have fun

lets be clear on this because i think you maybe misrepresenting some of the costs   now i 'll agree that $ 20 k is an extreme cost but that is for 10 weeks   each of these camps runs a fairly normal rate for summer camp per week $   considering you have young children living away from their parents and doing occasionally risky activities   food housing supervision amp insurance   most of these camps include riding skills water which are extreme insurance hazards i 'm sure   you are looking at $ 202   try going on a vacation for this     now the comments regarding rustic experience down experience small pleasures are all fucking douchey to be sure but your disbelief at the costs seems to me that you were n't considering the details and time frames given     i do nt have the money to send my kids away for one of these 7 10 week camps but lets be clear i 'd spend $ 202 to send my kids away to camp for a day so i could bang the wife in the kitchen like we used to and if i was rich i might send them away for 2 3 weeks

i was thinking more of a limit on the total of patents something fairly small like maybe 10,000 total patents are allowed to be valid at any given moment in time so that patent applications from multiple sources have to be somehow compared with each other to decide which would provide more societal benefit by being allowed patent status   if you want to take the government mostly out of the picture then maybe use an auction format when a valid patent slot becomes available due to a previously granted patent expiring or being invalidated due to court challenge then anyone who wants their idea to get patent rights submits their application to an auction for that slot   then the people who want to own the patent rights to any of those submitted ideas will bid for them whoever pays the top bid will get the patent rights for the concepts in the specific application they were targeting   this will force the people who are doing the bidding to basically do the due diligence on each patent application instead of depending on the patent since they will not want to pay a lot of money to get the patent rights for an idea only to have that patent 's value be destroyed by being declared invalid in court   if you want to encourage small inventors to throw their hat into the ring then set things up so that the money from the winning bid goes to the inventor who submitted the original application this way you get the best of both worlds the inventor gets compensated handsomely in most cases for their good idea and the idea being patented gets into the hands of someone with enough resources to exploit the idea in a broad scale

you did n't identify the fund but here is the most obvious way some of the stocks they owned could had dividends therefore they would have had to pass them on to the investors if the fund sold shares of stocks they could have capital gains they would have sold stocks to pay investors who sold shares they also could have sold shares of stock to lock in gains or to get out of positions they no longer wanted   therefore a fund could have dividends and capital gains but not have an increase in value for the year some investors look at how tax efficient a fund is before investing

that ai n't nothing   it 's really easy to get up into a sense of entitlement and forget to be grateful for what you do have   if this house does n't exist what would his costs of housing be elsewhere   realistically   would landlords rent to him would other bankers lend him money to buy a house would those costs really be any better   what about the intangible benefits like not having any landlord hassles or having a good relationship with the neighbors   it 's entirely possible he has a sweet deal here and just does n't make enough money   if your credit rating is poor your housing options really suck   banks wo n't lend you money for a house unless you have a huge ton of upfront cash   most landlords wo n't rent to you at all because they are going to automated scoring systems to avoid accusations of racism   in this day and age there are lots of ways to make money with a property you own   in fact i believe very firmly in robert allen 's doctrine never sell   that way you avoid the tens of thousands of dollars of overhead costs you bear with every sale that 's pure profit gone up in smoke   keep the property forever keep it working for you   if he does n't know how learn   to get bootstrapped he can put it up on airbnb or other services or do housemate shares   when your house is not show condition just be very honest and about the condition   do n't it tell them exactly what they 're going to get   people like honesty in the social sharing economy   and here 's the important part do n't booze away the new income invest it back into the property to make it a better money maker better at airbnb better at housemate shares better as a month to month renter so it 's too big is there a way to the unit to make it a better renter or airbnb   can he carve out an in law unit that would be a good size for him alone if he can keep turning the money back into the property like that he could do alright   this is what the new sharing economy is all about   of course sister might show up with her hand out wanting half the revenue since it 's half her house   tell her hell no this pays the mortgage and you do n't   she deserves nothing yet is getting half the equity from those mortgage payments and that 's enough it   and if she wants to go to court get a judge to tell her that   not that he 's going to sell it but it 's a huge deal he needs to know how much of his payments on the house are turning into real equity that belongs to him    owning it on paper does n't mean you own it   there 's a mortgage on it which means you do n't own all of it   the amount you own is the value of the house minus the mortgage owed    this is called your equity    of course a sale also minus the costs of bringing the house up to mandatory code requirements   minus the cost of making the house    but when you actually sell there 's also the 6 realtors commission and other closing costs   this is where the mortgage is more than the house is worth   this is a dangerous situation   if you keep the house and keep paying the mortgage all right that is stable and can be cheaper than the intense disruption and credit rating shock of a foreclosure or short sale   if sister is half owner she 'll get a credit burn also that may be why she does n't want to sell   and that is leverage he has over her   i imagine a winter 's bone great movie situation where the family is hanging on by a thread and has n't told the bank the parents died   that could get very complex especially if the brother sister are not creditworthy because that means the bank would simply call the loan and force a sale    the upside is this wo n't result in a credit rating burn or bankruptcy for the children because they are not owners of the house and children do not inherit parents debt

i do n't know about jeff bezos in particular but in general and with a a few other notorious exceptions like warren buffet billionaires also have incomes salary dividends fees to seat on various boards of directors etc in the millions not the tens of thousand that 's typically still much lower than their wealth but certainly enough to sustain a comfortable lifestyle however it 's still true that some billionaires have so much of their wealth tied up in a single corporation that they could not practically get it all out at once if they ever wanted to but they can still typically sell at least some shares which is exactly what jeff bezos has done to buy the washington post for example

the par value is a technicality that you can ignore in this case and it has nothing directly to do with the merger   when a company issues stock it puts a par value on the shares   if it later issues more shares they can not be issued at less than par value the rest of the notice seems to be as you said if you hold until the merger takes effect they are going to give you $ and your shares will be gone   as always you can try to sell on the open market before that time instead although you can bet that not too many people are going to want to give you more than $ at this point

hi accounting major here   a lot of people mentioned both tax advantages and cheap money money you can borrow at a low interest rate   another reason businesses do this is to reward investors generally people with stock in a company want to see some of its operations financed with debt instead of all of it financed from investors money or profit this way the company can grow more and still pay better dividends to its investors however you do n't want too much debt either it 's a balance and a way to see how much debt vs equity a company has is called a leverage ratio leverage = debt hope this helps

i definitely agree with this before i could get federal or state loans i had to do this online orientation and while you probably could skip most of it and click accept i actually read through and am competent in how the interest works and how even though not paying until after graduation is an option that 'll increase my total loans by like 50 almost every other student i 've talked to with student loans has little to no knowledge as to how interest works and how it applies to their loans     and the choosing what to study because while it is nice to study something fun if you ca n't practically get a decent paying job in your field then you have a lot of knowledge and nothing to do with it

at this time there is one advantage of having a 30 year loan right now over a 15 year loan   the down side is you will be paying 1 higher interest rate so the question is can you beat 1 on the money you save every month so lets say instead of going with 15 year mortgage i get a 30 and put the $ 200 monthly difference in lets say the dia fund   will i make more on that money than the interest i am losing   my answer is probably yes   plus lets factor in inflation   if we have any high inflation for a few years in the middle of that 30 not only with the true value of what you owe go down but the interest you can make in the bank could be higher than the 4 you are paying for your 30 year loan    just a risk reward thing i think more people should consider

no you have to reimburse the current mortgage you have and a new one for your new house a mortgage is a loan from a financial institution that accepts to give you money if you pay it back the total amount adding interests interests are the price you pay to the financial institution for it to give you money for a while in the mortgage you have an legal agreement with the financial institution on how to reimburse the total amount that is given to you for a while breaking that agreement is breaking the law the fact of the matter is that when 30 of your mortgage is reimbursed the financial institution own your house legally for real at 70 your live in the house own by the financial institution at 70 it is the same exact logic for a car loan the mortgage goes with a specific house at a legal address that you live in as a primary residence

have you shopped around   i would agree that the fees seem high    the first question i would ask if if the .75 management fee is per year or per month   if it is per month you will almost certainly lose money each year    a quick search shows that fidelity will allow one to transfer their pensions into a self directed account   here in the us where we have 401ks it is almost always better to transfer them into something self directed once you leave an employer   fidelity makes it really easy and i always recommend them   no affiliation here in the us they actually pay you for you transferring money into your account   this can come in the form of free stock trades or money added to your account i would encourage you to give them or their competitors a look in order to make an informed decision   often times a person with balances ca n't really afford to pay those high management fees   you might need in the 10s of millions before something like that makes sense

buy term and invest the rest is something you will hear all the time but actually cash value life insurance is a very misunderstood useful financial product cash value life insurance makes sense if if you you are n't maxing out your retirement accounts just stick with term insurance and save as much as you can for retirement otherwise if you have at least 5 or 10k extra after you 've funded retirement for at least 7 years   one financial strategy is to buy a whole life policy from one of the big three mutual insurance firms   you buy a low face value policy for example say 50k face value the goal is to build cash value in the policy overload the policy by buying additional paid up insurance in the first 7 years of the policy using a paid up addition rider of the policy this policy will then grow its cash value at around 2 to 4 over the life of the policy similar perhaps to the part of your portfolio that would would be in muni bonds basically you are beating inflation by a small margin further as you dump money into the policy the death benefit grows after 7 or 8 years the cash value of the policy should equal the money you 've put into it and your death benefit will have grown substantially maybe somewhere around $ 250k in this example you can access the cash value by taking a policy loan you should only do this when it makes sense financially or in an emergency but the important thing to realize is that your cash is there if you need it   so now you have insurance you have your cash reserves why should you do this   you save up your cash and have access to it and you get the insurance for free while still getting a small return on your investment you are diversifying your financial portfolio pushing some of your money into conservative investments

this is called the ask bid spread the difference varies based on the of the asset the more liquid or the higher the volume of trades for the asset then the smaller the spread is the spread goes to the broker to pay for some of the cost of the trade my guess is that when there is a higher volume of shares being traded brokers need to take less of a fee per share out of the transaction to cover their costs this makes the spread is smaller   this is essentially the difference in    price between the highest price that a    buyer is willing to pay for an asset    and the lowest price for which a    seller is willing to sell it the seller will get the bid price and the buyer will pay the ask and the broker keeps the spread from

with new cars it 's usually the other way around finance at a low apr or get cash back when you buy it outright with used cars you usually do n't know how much they have invested in the car so it 's more difficult to know how low they 're willing to go regardless i do think it 's odd that they would knock 2 k off the price if you finance with them but not if you pay cash the only reason they would do that is if they intend to make at least 2 k in interest over the life of the loan but they have no way of guaranteeing you wo n't refi therefore i suspect they are and would probably close the deal if you wrote them a check or put the cash on the table for 2 k less however if they wo n't budge and will only knock off 2 k if you finance you could finance and pay it off in full a week later just make sure they do n't have any hidden origination fees or pay off early fees

to me the key is a budget   each month before it begins decide on what to spend on each dollar that you earn   money should be allotted for normal expenses such as housing food transportation and utilities if you have any consumer debt that should be a priority   extra money should go to eliminate that debt there should be money allotted to savings goals such as retirement home down payment or vacation home   also there should be money set aside for clothing and giving   giving is an important part and often overlooked part of wealth creation    somewhere in there you should also give yourself a bit of free money   for example one of the things i spend my free money on is coffee   i buy freshly ground coffee from a really good supplier   it is a bit expensive but that is okay as it does not preclude me from meeting other goals if you still have money left after all of that increase your giving some your savings some and your free money some   you can then spend that money without guilt if your budget includes $ 100 of free money per month and you want something that costs $ 1000 save up the $ 1,000 and then buy it   do not borrow to buy free money stuff    doing those sorts of things will make you weigh purchasing decisions very carefully if you find that you can not stick to a budget you should enlist a friend to be your accountability partner   they have to be very good with money

actually asking to be refinanced at a lower rate is asking them to forgive give up part of the mortgage    either my knowledge of finance is wrong or how interest rates work is wrong if that statement is true    here is why your statement is not true   the interest rate is money the bank makes on the loan    for example say you buy a home valued at $ 250,000 put 10 down and your interest rate is 5 for 30 years    well now you 've got a mortgage $ 225,000 that you pay $ monthly now expand this out to 30 years which means you 'll make 360 payments for a total balance of $ so even though you have a mortgage of $ 225,000 and your home is only valued at $ 250,000 due to the interest rate on that loan you will   be giving the bank $ in profit for that $ 225,000 loan    refinancing the loan at a lower rate is not debt forgiveness or a write off    greed in getting themselves into upside down mortgages are why we have problems not the banks not helping them out enough   actually it 's the bank 's greed which is wanting to keep the homeowner at the higher interest rate because it will make them more money over the long run if the bank was to reduce the interest rate on the loan they would be reducing their potential profits    and now you know why i support non profit banks

you got ta stop using that argument it 's ridiculous first of all it does n't work like that because most trades get filled internally or through dark pools and secondly the hft is taking risk for that 2 cents also they do n't hold it they got ta offload it so the price will go back down finally this only affects people making huge orders and this is pennies to them this is not a free lunch for hft since those 2 cents have risks associated   think of it another way some hft dudes have some programs that run really fast and they make some minuscule amounts of money think maybe a few k a day but they do do something useful they let you enter exit positions at a better price by reducing spreads

the question that i walk away with is what is the cost of the downside protection disclaimer i do n't sell anything i am not a fan of insurance as an investment with rare exceptions i 'll stop there all else is a tangent there 's an appeal to looking at the distribution of stock returns it looks a bit like a bell curve with a median at 10 or so and a standard deviation of 15 or so this implies that there are some number of years on average that the market will be down and others about 2/3 up now you wish to purchase a way of avoiding that negative return and need to ask yourself what it 's worth to do so   the insurance company tells you a 2 off the top i.e. no dividends and b we will clip the high end over 9.5   i then am compelled to look at the numbers knowing that your product ca n't be bought and sold every year it 's appropriate to look at rolling returns the annual returns i see and the return you 'd have in any period i start with 1900 2012 i see an average 9.8 with std of 5.3 remember the 10 year rolling will do a good job pushing the std down the return the insurance would give you is an average 5.4 with std of .01 you 've bought your way out of all risk but at what cost   from 1900 2012 my dollar grows to $ yours to $ for much of the time treasuries were higher than your return much higher   it 's interesting to see how often the market is over 10 for the year clip too many of those and you really lose out   from 1900 2012 i count 31 negative years ouch but 64 years over 9.5 the 31 averaged the 64   the illusion of market gains is how this product is sold long term they lag safe treasuries

well keep in mind until the housing crash fannie and freddie made money they received no help from the federal gov't the whole idea of the secondary mortgage market was to keep money flowing to home buyers and everyone who bought a home benefited via rates a few points lower than if banks had to keep all the capital on hand to back all the loans   both these institutions worked well for about 40 years the here was that ratings agency rated these bonds as aaa when in fact they were junk that 's who failed in their due diligence and really should be held accountable as if they were rated junk the banks would have no one to buy them except at junk bond interest rates meaning they would n't have made these loans to people who could n't really afford houses the rating agencies were supposed to be neutral of the debt and instead they essentially took what amounts to bribes from the banks to rate them highly

there are a few factors at play here depending on the bank that has offered you the card there are different types of overdraft protection that may have been set up typically if they attempt to run the card with no money if one of these is in play you will be spared any overdraft fees by the transaction charging to a designated overdraft account usually savings or by the transaction failing due to insufficient funds   if you know the transaction went through and you know there were not enough funds in the account to cover the transactions then you have a few options if you have overdraft protection that auto charges insufficient funds charges to a separate account then you have nothing to worry about if you do not most banks offer a grace period where you have until the end of the day to zero out your account that is to say pay the overdraft amount and bring your balance to at least $ 0   if this is a charge that occurred in the past and you have already been charged an overdraft fee there may still be hope i can not speak for all banks but i know that chase bank offers a once per year overdraft forgiveness where they will get rid of the charges if you agree to bring the account out of the negative there is a chance other banks will do the same if you call their customer service

a person can finance housing expenses in one of two ways you can pay rent to a landlord or you can buy a house with a mortgage in essence you become your own landlord that is insta the renter pays an amount equal to the mortgage to insta the landlord who pays it to the bank to reduce the mortgage ideally your monthly debt servicing payments minus tax saving on interest should approximate the rent on the house if they are a lot more you may have overpaid for the house and mortgage the advantage is that your rent is applied to building up equity by reducing the mortgage in your house and mortgage payments are tax deductible to the extent of interest expense at the end of 30 years or whatever the mortgage term you have portable equity in the form a fully paid house that you can sell to move another house in florida or wherever you want to retire sometimes you will get lucky if the value of the house skyrockets in a short time then you can borrow against your appreciation but be careful because sky in housing and elsewhere often fall to earth but this does represent another way to build up equity by owning a house

each bank builds or buys their own bill pay system so answers are not universal try your banks bill pay system out before fully transferring over if i did n't like mine i 'd get a new bank but for your questions in order other things to consider include check your bank account at least twice a month to verify what payments have been made this is just good general advice i use bill pay to automatically pay the minimum payment so i avoid forgetting to pay my credit card bill   i strongly recommend a push vs. pull method for bill pay that is pushing money from your bank account to pay bills rather than allowing to pull money from your account this limits the number of companies that you directly give your bank account information to and makes it easier to hold onto your money when you dispute a mistake they made it also puts all payment information in once central place so you can keep track of all payment schedules together

i would also consider the following factors how stable is your income   are you in an industry that could vanish in the near future   how long would it take you to replace this income   if you are at risk then you need to consider that your lenders do not care how fast you 've paid down your debt   all the care about is that you make next month 's payment   you need to have liquid reserves available to weather any storm current wisdom is 3 6 months expenses   it may be prudent to put this money in gics or t bills   there may be an early withdrawal penalty but at least you wo n't lose your house obviously this is n't as important when you can actually retire all debt what 's your debt level   if it 's more than 3x income then reducing that number might be the most prudent on another note what is your expected retirement income   iras defer the tax to a later year but if you expect a great pension it is feasible that you might be in a higher tax bracket on retirement when you withdraw the funds than you are now a situation that makes indexed retirement planning counterproductive rich people do n't buy iras

is a latin phrase that simply means irregular deposit it 's a concept from ancient roman contract law that has a very narrow scope and does n't actually apply to your example there are two distinct parts to this concept one dealing with the notion of a deposit and the other with the notion of i 'll address them both in turn since they 're both relevant to the tax issue i also think that this is an example of the problem since your proposed solution give my money to a friend for safekeeping is n't the right solution to your actual problem how can i keep my money safe the currency issue is a complication but it does n't change the fact that what you 're proposing probably is n't a good solution the key word in my definition of is contract you do n't mention a legally binding contract between you and your friend an oral contract does n't qualify because in the event of a breach it 's difficult to enforce the agreement legally there is n't any proof of an oral agreement and emotionally taking your friend to court might cost you your friendship i 'm not a lawyer but i would guess that the absence of a contract implies that even though in the eyes of you and your friend you 're giving him the money for safekeeping in the eyes of the law you 're simply giving it to him in the us you would owe gift taxes on these funds if they 're higher than a certain amount in other words this is n't really a deposit it 's not like a security deposit in which the money may be held as collateral in exchange for a service e.g. not trashing your apartment or a financial deposit where the money is held in a regulated financial institution like a bank this is n't a solution to the problem of keeping your money safe because the lack of a contract means you incur additional risk in the form of legal risk that is n't present in the context of actual deposits also if you do n't have an account in the right currency but your friend does how are you planning for him to store the money anyway if you convert your money into his currency you take on exchange rate risk unless you hedge which is another complication if you do n't convert it and simply leave it in his safe house car boot etc you 're still taking on risk because the funds are n't insured in the event of loss   furthermore the money is n't necessarily safe with your friend even if you ignore all the risks above without a written contract you have little recourse if a your friend decides to spend the money and not return it b your friend runs into financial trouble and creditors make claim to his assets or c you get into financial trouble and creditors make claims to your assets the idea of giving money to another individual for safekeeping during bankruptcy has been tested in us courts and ruled invalid if you do decide to go ahead with a contract and you do want your money back from your friend eventually you 're in essence loaning him money and this is a different situation with its own complications look at this question and this question before loaning money to a friend although this does apply to your situation it 's mostly irrelevant because the irregular part of the concept of irregular deposit is a standard feature of currencies and other legal tender it 's part of the of modern currencies and does n't have anything to do with taxes if you 're only giving your friend physical currency if you 're giving him property other assets etc for safekeeping it 's a different issue entirely but it 's still probably going to be considered a gift or a loan you 're basically correct about what means but i think you 're overestimating its reach in modern law in roman times it simply refers to a contract in which two parties made an agreement for the depositor to deposit money or goods with the and withdraw equivalent money or goods sometime in the future although this is a feature of the modern deposit banking system it 's one small part alongside contract law deposit insurance etc these other parts add complexity but they also add security and risk mitigation your arrangement with your friend is much simpler but also much riskier   and yes there probably are taxes on what you 're proposing because you 're basically giving or loaning the money to your friend even if you say it 's not a loan or a gift the law may still see it that way the absence of a contract makes this especially important because you do n't have anything speaking in your favor in the event of a legal dispute besides what you meant the money to be furthermore the money is n't necessarily safe with your friend and the absence of a contract exacerbates this issue if you want to keep your money safe keep it in an account that 's covered by deposit insurance if you do n't have an account in that currency either a talk to a lawyer who specializes in situation like this and work out a contract or b open an account with that currency as i 've stated i 'm not a lawyer so none of the above should be interpreted as legal advice that being said i 'll reiterate again that the concept of is a concept from ancient roman law trying to apply it within a modern legal system without a contract is a potential recipe for disaster if you need a legal solution to this problem not that you do i think what you 're looking for is a bank talk to a lawyer who understands modern law since ancient roman law is n't applicable to and wo n't pass muster in a modern day court

housing eh housing costs are driven by salaries and land availability over in the bay area $ for a nice apartment is a good deal but a decent software engineer with ~4 years experience can get $ 120k easily the standard benchmark of affordability of housing is spending a third of your income on it a year that guy can afford about $ on housing if you do n't away the money and can keep your cost of living down and save money you can really clean up especially if you move elsewhere later so to stop thinking about it in terms of dollar value first try to think of it in terms of time 33 of someone 's salary or a third of their time at work going for housing is pretty nominal beyond that think about it in terms of opportunity cost if you saved that extra $ 20 what exactly would you use it for and how much of that goal does it represent

there are actual cases where this has occurred in cases where the beneficiary was suspected of knowing that the insured person was alive they have faced fraud charges in cases where they appeared to act in good faith the legal consequences are less severe but the likelihood of the insurance company to sue for their money back will depend on the circumstances and the amount of the payout one interesting case was a woman who abandoned her family and did n't reappear until 11 years later the family did n't know where she was so they probably wo n't end up paying back the relatively small $ 100,000 that they received

comission is a must when doing sales that is the best and only good incentive to sell more how much you want to give all depends on margins the salary level that is accepted in your state country and what sellers you have young or old   salary costs at 30 35 of total order value is normal including salary tax and all tax oriented costs around that employee    there are 2 ways of doing it only high commission and fixed salary + lower commission even if you use fixed salary + commission you can have restrictions so they have to sell above a certain level to get that commission that means that you do n't take any risks    an example of a salary model that i found was popular the numbers are just made up according to what is normal to have in sweden it 's a step model if you sell for   step 1 0 $ 3000 you get high commission 20 of everything you sell   step 2 $ 3000 $ 4000 you get fixed salary of $ 1000 + 10 commission   step 3 $ 4000 $ 6000 you get fixed salary of $ 1700 + 15 commission   and so on   your weakest points are when going to a higher step you have to change the steps so it works with your salary statistics so you have most people under a step to motivate them to go to the next instead of having them exactly above one step as you can see with a step model you just put a on the commission model but make it more attractive what the seller think is that they have a fixed salary if a seller is happy he she is selling a lot     i have also had a criteria saying that if you can keep at 1 step for more than 3 months you will start there each month then it 's up to the team leader to warn if that seller is good or just lucky

one thing to note before buying bond funds the value of bonds you hold will drop when interest rates go up interest rates are at historical lows and pretty much have nowhere to go but up if you are buying bonds to hold to maturity this is probably not a major concern but for a bond fund it might impair performance if things suddenly shift in the interest rate market

technical analysis is based more on psychology than anything else as an example if an analyst estimates or believes that a stock is undervalued or simply wants to re balance their portfolio then they will buy some amount moving the price up others in the market see the upwards move as the start of an upwards trend an indication that the stock is undervalued or perhaps even that an insider is trading ahead of better than expected data from the firm they then buy the stock creating a self fulfilling prophecy and pulling more traders in as they see an upward trend being confirmed this is even more pronounced in a bear market as fear is an even stronger driver when a trader sees a stock is falling they are more likely to jump to the conclusion that it is due to expected poor performance of the firm and that the firm and the economy are both in trouble and going down than to think that it is simply a or a large investor re balancing etc to quote credit suisse 1   a chart is a mirror    of the mood of the crowd and not of the fundamental factors thus technical analysis is the    analysis of human mass psychology therefore it is also called behavioral finance the underlying truth that makes technical analysis work is that people are predictably irrational at least in the short run and tend to follow the same patterns of thought references 1 2 3 cfa level 1 syllabus

you are correct that the price fixed when the contract is made is set and maybe there are a few institutions that do n't actually bother to track the future after they initiate the contract   but most parties likely track the contracts fairly carefully for a number of reasons   the big deal is that while the price the contract is set and if you did a perfect hedge maybe the value of the contract and the thing you are hedging is then fixed the value of that futures contract by itself changes and this is important the biggest reason is as jb mentions above most futures contracts settle up on a daily basis as the price of the underlying changes   this happens to limit the losses when for large price changes and one party owes a bunch of money on a futures contract and for that reason or a different one goes bankrupt   if the other party is using the contract to hedge a sale or asset maybe this risk is minimal but maybe that expected sale does n't happen or maybe the party is using futures for speculation   there is no way to know built into the contract if a party is really hedging or not so people naturally want to limit this default risk there are many other reasons to track profit and loss as well there are likely even more reasons as well that i 'm missing but hopefully that gives you an idea

if a company is valued correctly then paying dividends should lower the share price and buying back shares should leave the share price unchanged   if the share price is $ 100 and the company pays a $ 10 dividend then either its cash goes down by $ 10 per share it is has to borrow money for the same amount or some mixture either way the value of the company has gone down by $ 10 per share   if the share price is $ 100 and the company buys back 10 percent of its shares then it also has to find the money just as for the dividend and the value of the company goes down by 10 percent however the number of shares also goes down by 10 percent so the amount of value per share is the same and the share price should stay unchanged   now there are psychological effects many people like getting paid dividends so they will want to own shares of a company paying dividends so the share price goes up similar with a share buyback the fact that someone buys huge amounts of shares drives the price up both effects are purely psychological   a buyback has another effect if the shares are not valued correctly if the company is worth $ 100 per share but for some reason the is down to $ 50 then after the buyback the value per share has even gone up basically the company buys from stupid investors which increases the value for clever investors holding on to their shares if the were $ 200 then buying back shares would be a stupid move for the company

for some people it should be a top priority   for others there are higher priorities   what it should be for you depends on a number of things including your overall financial situation both your current finances and how stable you expect them to be over time your level of financial education the costs of your mortgage the alternative investments available to you your investing goals and your tolerance for risk your 1 priority should be to ensure that your basic needs including making the required monthly payment on your mortgage are met both now and in the near future which includes paying off high interest i.e. credit card debt and building up an emergency fund in a savings or money market account or some other low risk and liquid account   if you have n't done those things do not pass go do not collect $ 200 and do not consider making advance payments on your mortgage   mason wheeler 's statements that the bank ca n't take your house if you 've paid it off are correct but it 's going to be a long time till you get there and they can take it if you 're to paying it off early and then something bad happens to you and you start missing payments   if you 're not underwater you should be able to get some of your money back by selling possibly at a loss before it gets to the point of foreclosure but you 'll still have to move which can be costly and   so make sure you 've got what you need to handle your basic needs even if you hit a rough patch and make sure you 're not financing the paying off of your house by taking a loan from visa at 27 annually once you 've gotten through all of those more important things you finally get to decide what else to invest your extra money in   different investments will provide different rewards both financial and emotional and mason wheeler has clearly demonstrated that he gets a strong emotional payoff from not having a mortgage which may or may not be how you feel about it   on the financial side of any potential investment you 'll want to consider things like the expected rate of return the risk it carries both on its own and whether it balances out or the overall risk profile of all your investments in total its expected costs including its and your tax rate and any preferred tax treatment and any other potential factors such as an employer match on 401(k contributions which are basically free money to you   then you weigh the pros and cons financial and emotional of each option against your imperfect forecast of what the future holds take your best guess and then keep adjusting as you go through life and things change but i want to come back to one of the factors i mentioned in the first paragraph   which options you should even be considering is in part influenced by the degree to which you understand your finances and the wide variety of options available to you as well as all the of how different things can make them more or less advantageous than one another   the fact that you 're posting this question here indicates that you 're still early in the process of learning those things and although it 's great that you 're educating yourself on them and keep doing it it means that you 're probably not ready to worry about some of the things other posters have talked about such as cost of capital and roi   so keep reading blog posts and articles online there 's no shortage of them and keep developing your understanding of the options available to you and their pros and cons and wait to tackle the full suite of investment options till you fully understand them however there 's still the question of what to do between now and then   paying the mortgage down is n't an unreasonable thing for you to do for now since it 's a guaranteed rate of return that also provides some degree of emotional payoff   but i 'd say the higher priority should be getting money into a tax advantaged retirement account a because the tax advantaged growth of those accounts makes their long term return far greater than whatever you 're paying on your mortgage and they provide more benefit tax advantaged growth the earlier you invest in them so doing that now instead of paying off the house quicker is probably going to be better for you financially even if it does n't provide the emotional payoff   if your employer will match your contributions into that account then it 's a no brainer but it 's probably still a better idea than the mortgage unless the emotional payoff is very very important to you or unless you 're nearing retirement age so the tax free growth period is small   if you 're not sure what to invest in just choose something that 's broad market and low cost total market index funds are a great choice and you can diversify into other things as you gain more savvy as an investor what matters more is that you start investing in something now not exactly what it is disclaimer i 'm not a personal advisor and this does not constitute investing advice   understand your choices and make your own decisions

insider trading is when you buy or sell an investment based on material non public information that gives you an unfair advantage over the rest of traders in that market   working for a company is one way that you might have such information but whether it is insider trading is not contingent on you working there you could use that information a long time after leaving the company you do n't even need to have worked there if a friend relative gave you non public information because they work there it is still insider trading

i thought the same money as a transferable item is against future items and debt is a transferable item against future money which is also seen as a much farther into the future item   money = item debt = money = + 1 or longer if we agree to pay it off over 20 years   interestingly i have seen a writeup on why gold is the material of choice    if someone can find this it would be great but i will try write from memory google is not helping the story is something like this   essentially when trading a material for jewellery we had difficulty finding what material to use obviously it must be something and tough but not common metals are the obvious choice although crystalline structures like gems and are useful the reason for metals are that they can easily and be shaped into a form that will be aesthetically pleasing and hold its shape    but which specific metal is to be chosen obviously it must be chemically stable so and those metal like elements are removed from contention it must be rare so items like lead iron and copper are too common although not worthless   the most stable malleable and rare materials are platinum silver and gold    platinum requires too high a melting point to be suitable the requirements to and handle it as a material are too high not to deny the value but the common use it prohibitive    silver is easier to handle but tends to continuous upkeep is required and this becomes a of its full value   finally gold rare low melting point resistant to and rare malleable and pretty a sweet spot of all materials

there obviously is not such a list of companies because if there were the whole world would immediately invest in them their price would rise like a rocket and they would not be undervalued anymore some people think company a should be worth x per share some people think it should be worth y. if the share price is currently higher than what someone thinks it should be they sell it and if it is lower than they think it should be they buy it the grand effect of this all is that the current market price of the share is more or less the average of what all investors together think it should currently be worth if you buy a single stock hoping that it 's undervalued and will rise you may be right but you may equally well be wrong it 's smarter to diversify over lots of stocks to reduce the impact of this risk it out   there are analysts who try to make a guess of which stocks will do better and they give paid advice or you can invest in their funds but they invariably do worse than the average of the market as a whole over the long term so the best advice for amateurs is to invest in index funds that cover a huge range of companies and try to keep their costs very low

1 internet is not a regular product or service it 's a utility   2 an unregulated utility market simply leads to regional monopolies because the companies privately own the infrastructure   that 's exactly what we have   the cable companies cut up the country and generally stay out of 's turf because it 's more profitable than competition   this is the opposite of a capitalist market by the way   they are now all billionaires from providing bear minimum service and avoiding any real competition   instead of competing they slowly build enough money until they can simply buy out their competitors   comcast has gotten so rich it bought nbc and is now looking to buy twc   3 fair competition for utilities requires rules that prevent the company from blocking out competitors this is called open wiki this is what they have throughout most of europe this does n't happen here because the monopolies use their billions to buy political influence in washington dc via lobbyists campaign fund raising donations etc   it is so effective that the former chair of the fcc michael powell made a bashing open access competition rules and praising our monopoly system saying it has resulted in the best internet in the world which is of course a bold faced demonstrable lie   video used to be on youtube ca n't find it anymore   4 the root cause is an apathetic voter base who view washington as too corrupt to even reform which keeps the people who care about this issue the most away from the poles   this simply strengthens the power of the corporate lobbyists to control politics even more   5 to take on these giants you need to be a giant yourself with tons of money to burn and a big reason to do it even though you 'll probably lose money since it 's more like charity than a great business opportunity   the only ones who fit the bill are google and only because they have a vested interest in keeping the internet free open fast robust and affordable   it also helps that they spent the past decade buying up fiber optic infrastructure

depending on your local laws such a layoff may be an unlawful act if the whole purpose of the lay off is to strip the employees of their rsu 's the employer may be liable and get sued however you have to check that with a lawyer licensed in your jurisdiction in many places there are no laws against this in any case you may claim that there was no good faith just cause in the action and still sue the employer mere threat of a lawsuit may the whole deal so i suggest the employees to lawyer up and talk to the employer that by the way will require to create a union a representative body for the employees in some places that by itself may be a just cause for termination in some extremely anti union jurisdictions i would guess if there were some they would be in the us bottom line talk to a lawyer

the literal answer to your question is that a number of different types of mutual funds did not have significant downturns in 2008 money market funds are intended to always preserve capital made in 2008 it was a major scandal broke the buck that its holders took a 3 loss inverse funds which go up when the market goes down obviously did well that year but if you have a low risk tolerance that 's obviously not what you 're looking for and they have other problems as well when held long term but you 're a old talking about your retirement funds you should have a much longer time horizon at least 30 years over a period that long stocks have never had negative real inflation adjusted returns dating back at least to the civil war if you look at the charts here or here you can see that despite the risk in any individual year as the period grows longer the average return for the period gets tighter and tighter if you look at the second graph here you see that 2011 was the first time since the civil war that the trailing 30-year return on t bills exceeded that for stocks and 1981 2011 was period that saw bond yields drop almost continuously leading to steady rise in bond prices although past performance is no guarantee of future results everything we 've seen historically suggests that the risk of a broad stock market portfolio held for 30 years is not that large and it should make up the bulk of your holdings for example vanguard 's target retirement fund is 90 in stocks us + international and only 10 in bonds

paying in physical cash is almost never a good idea for large purchases unless you like being audited and/or having lots of attention from law enforcement   all purchases over $ 10k in cash need to have special forms filled out for the irs and financial crimes enforcement network so this is not a tinfoil hat conspiracy theory if you do that on the regular you are being investigated   when people say cash for normal purchases they generally mean a wire transfer e.g. buying a house cash = wire transfer between banks   in this case purchasing a company cash is contrasted with purchasing with stock   so instead of getting $ of amzn amazon takes out a loan or pulls their money from cash on on hand and transfers it to the financial institution handling the sale   everyone who owns wfm stock gets paid out in cash as opposed to receiving some number of shares of amzn

if you have an actual legal entity legal partnership that is jointly owned by you and your partner then the partnership receives the money and the partnership then sends money to you and your partner each of you will pay tax on your share it 's possible that the partnership itself may have to pay taxes if you are not following that procedure in terms of actual money flow for example if the royalties are paid into your personal account instead of a partnership account then you may have trouble convincing the tax authorities that this is the legal situation if this is a small amount of money then you may be better off just paying the taxes

just an fyi this can be a risky move unless you have been in the industry for a while or are extremely well averse in investment management research keep it pretty short in a lot of ways you might want to think about tailoring it more like a sell side report also make sure you understand the style of investing the pm company you are applying to likes    the reason i say this is because every buy side shop is different some do 1 2 page write ups with models and walk through 's others will expect 60 page decks i.e. the longer the deck the more you have that can go wrong if one tiny thing is wrong or you have a typo anywhere it hurts you more than it helps that you wrote something long i once had the wrong rating on one issuance of a bond ladder i was pitching it 's all the pm 's focused on   the more important aspect is that you understand the shop you are applying to and then tailoring the pitch to them for example do n't do a growth tech company with an forward p e if you 're applying to a fundamental value shop it shows you did n't do research on the firm you 're applying to and that you wo n't fit the culture this is part of why i was saying that this can be a risky move if the firm is large enough to have an hr department they likely have a lot of different investment styles in house   finally try to keep it to a small mid cap company analysts pms follow stocks all day long and will most likely have an opinion on 99 of large caps no matter the sector   in summary i 'd recommend a 1 2 page sell side style write up with a backup model printed excel file kiss keep it simple stupid have a summary couple years worth of historical 's 2 years forward and a few main bullet points of why you like them in your case this pitch should be something to the interest so that you can nail a real pitch in the interview if you get an interview know everything about everything in the industry as well as that specific company for example lets say you do a smartphone secular theme investment do you know what outstanding aapl android cases there are and more importantly how would each ruling likely affect the marketplace this is because i can guarantee if you 're pitching to another tech guy he knows and has an educated opinion on it also in many cases having a great model can mean more than a long write up it shows that you 're good with numbers and can think about future earnings which are all that matter   last point imo you 'd be better off trying to get your foot in the door through networking than hr hr does n't really do much on the buy side with recruiting and wo n't really understand what to look for in a good pitch they 're hr after all not an analyst try to meet someone over coffee and then have a pitch ready to bring out discuss the buy side is selective enough that usually when positions open up it 's either because they are creating one for you or they already have an idea of who is going to fill it this mean hr has little to no say in helping you get in you 'll have a lot more success this way than to a bunch of hr emails

the short answer to your question is yes   company performance affects stock price only through investors views but note that selling for higher and lower prices when the company is doing well or poorly is not an arbitrary choice   a stock is a claim on the future cash flows of the firm which ultimately come from its future profits   if the company is doing well investors will likely expect that there will large cash flows dividends in the future and be willing to pay more to hold it or require more to sell it    the price of a stock is equal what people think the future dividends are worth   if market participants started behaving irrationally like not reacting to changes in the expected future cash flows then arbitrageurs would make a ton of money trading against them until the situation was

this is largely a cultural issue i would be appalled at the very idea that my parents would charge me interest for lending me money just as they would be appalled if i were to do so if lending them money i find the idea of attempting to make money off of your children fundamentally wrong   i realize that you only want to do this to teach them that you have their best interests in mind and not your own profit nevertheless what will actually happen were you to charge them interest is that you would accrue a monetary gain at the expense of your children is that really something you would be comfortable with now as i stated at the beginning this is clearly a cultural issue based on the other answers here many cultures probably including your own find nothing wrong with this i 've even heard of people charging their adult children rent when they come home for the holidays something that is completely baffling to me   the point i am trying to make is that asking other people 's opinions on whether you should do this is not very useful unless those people share your own cultural background my family and culture are such that the idea of charging interest to one 's family members seems downright immoral to me given that you are asking here it seems like you might be on the fence about it yourself however i freely admit that my answer is colored by my own cultural and may very well not be applicable to you   still ask yourself is a relatively small amount of money in the grand scheme of things or for that matter an entire fortune worth your relationship with your children do you really believe that having their parents retroactively charge them interest for a loan will somehow teach them something about the real world that your already adult children do n't know one of the main reasons they came to you and did n't go to a bank is precisely that they expected the loan to be interest free   so sure tell them that you wo n't lend any more until they repay what they owe even better sit them down and have an honest adult conversation explaining that the absence of the money they owe is making itself felt in your household and work out a way they can repay you   what in my opinion you most certainly should n't do is treat your relationship with your children as a regular business transaction it is n't and i am sure you do n't want it to be

here 's an unconventional approach if you really need the money you can always call the bank or go to one of their branches and get new login credentials after some kind of formal process like proving that you are in fact the account holder since it will be a hassle to get the credentials you will not do it if it 's not necessary in germany the banks all use transaction authentication numbers tan that you need to authorize a transfer if there is such a thing in uk you can just throw the tan list away this way you can still check your savings balance but you can not transfer the money without requesting a new tan list which takes time and effort

this is known as zone pricing or geographical pricing such price variations may seem odd but they are not unique to on any given day in any major u.s. city a single brand of gasoline will sell for a wide range of prices even when the cost to make and deliver the fuel is the same the primary culprit is zone pricing a secret and pervasive oil company strategy to boost profits by charging dealers different amounts for fuel based on traffic volume station amenities nearby household incomes the strength of competitors and other factors it 's a controversial strategy but the courts have thus far deemed it legal and the federal trade commission recently said the effect on consumers was ambiguous because some customers got hurt by higher prices while others benefited from lower ones zone pricing as practiced in the gasoline industry in the united states is the pricing of gasoline based on a complex and secret weighting of factors such as the number of competing stations number of vehicles average traffic flow population density and geographic characteristics this can result in two branded gas stations only a few miles apart selling gasoline at a price differential of as much as $ 0.50 per gallon but the short answer is because they can it 's legal provided that some people are paying less while others are paying more essentially the larger richer audience is subsidizing the product for other areas it 's not terribly different than the way most drugs are priced in the world

rent to own is not a precise single agreement it can be whatever the seller and you agree to it 's a unique seller that would agree to this keep in mind most sellers are needing to get their money in full to buy their next house you might find an investor willing to work with you but only for an inflated price interest rate or both   the ideal seller would be underwater owing more than the value of the home but needing to move in which case they are hoping to find someone to buy them some time to get situated in their new house before moving forward with you and the bank to arrange a sale   at its simplest you might pay a premium on your rent to fix the price giving you the option to buy during a particular period at that price   it can be a much higher premium where you are renting and paying extra until you hit 20 at which point you agree to finance the balance either with a bank loan or through the seller   buying a home you will live in is a personal decision with no numbers offered it 's not like we can tell you if it 's a wise purchase

the policy you quoted suggests you deposit 6 minimum that $ 6,000 will cost you $ 4,500 due to the tax effect yet after the match you 'll have $ 9,000 in the account taxable on withdrawal but a great boost to the account   the question of where is less clear there must be more than the 2 choices you mention most plans have too many choices this into my focus on expenses a few years back pbs frontline aired a program titled the retirement gamble in which fund expenses were discussed with a focus on how an extra 1 in expenses will wipe out an extra 1/3 of your wealth in a 40 year period very simple to illustrate this go to a calculator and enter .99 raised to the power of 40 is the result my 401(k has an expense of .02 that 's of 1 raised to the same 40 gives in other words a cost of .8 over the full 40 years my wife and i are just retired and will have less in expenses for the rest of our lives than the average account cost for just 1 year   in your situation the knee jerk reaction is to tell you to maximize the 401(k deposit at the current 2016 $ 18,000 that might be appropriate but i 'd suggest you look at the expense of the s&p index sometime called large cap fund but see the prospectus and if it 's costing much more than i 'd go with an ira roth if you ca n't deduct the traditional ira much of the value of the 401(k beyond the match is the tax differential i.e. depositing while in the 25 bracket but withdrawing the funds at retirement hopefully at 15 it does n't take long for the extra expense and the holy cow my 401(k just turned decades of dividends and long term cap gains into ordinary income effect to take over understand this now not 30 years hence   last to answer your question how much i often recommend what may seem a cliche continue to live like a student half the country lives on $ 54 k or less there 's certainly a wide gray area but in general a person starting out will choose one of 2 paths living just at or even above his means or living way below and saving say 30 40 off the top even 30 does n't hit the extreme saver level if you do this you 'll find that if when you get married buy a house have kids etc you 'll still be able to save a reasonable percent of your income toward retirement   in response to your comment what counts as retirement savings there 's a concept used as part of the budgeting process known as the envelope system for those who have an income where there 's little discretionary money left over each month the method of putting money aside into small buckets is a great idea in your case say you take me up on the 30 40 challenge 15 of it goes to a hard and fast retirement account the rest to savings according to the general order of emergency fund 6 12 months expenses to cover a job loss another fund for random expenses such as new transmission i 've never needed one but i hear they are expensive and then the bucket towards house down payment keep in mind i have no idea where you live or what a reasonable house would cost regardless a 20 25 downpayment on even a $ 250 k house is $ that will take some time to save up if the housing in your area is more bump it accordingly   if the savings starts to grow beyond any short term needs it gets invested towards the long term and is treated as retirement money there is no such thing as saving too much when i turned 50 and was let go from a 30 year job i was n't unhappy that i saved too much and could call it quits that day had i been saving just right i 'd have been 10 years shy of my target

you have made a good start because you are looking at your options because you know that if you do nothing you will have a big tax bill in april 2017 you want to make sure that you avoid the underpayment penalty one way to avoid it is to make estimated payments but even if you do that you could still make a mistake and overpay or underpay i think the easiest way to handle it is to reach the safe harbor if your withholding from your regular jobs and any estimated taxes you pay in 2016 equal or exceed your total taxes for 2015 then even if you owe a lot in april 2017 you can avoid the underpayment penalty if you agi is over 150 k you have to make sure your withholding is 110 of your 2015 taxes then set aside what you think you will owe in your bank account until you have to pay your taxes in april 2017 you only have to adjust your withholding to make the safe harbor you can make sure easily enough once your file this years taxes you only have to make sure that you reach the 100 or 110 threshold from irs pub 17 who must pay estimated tax if you owe additional tax for 2015 you may have to pay estimated tax    for 2016 you can use the following general rule as a guide during the year to    see if you will have enough withholding or if you should increase    your withholding or make estimated tax payments   general rule     in    most cases you must pay estimated tax for 2016 if both of the    following apply you expect to owe at least $ 1,000 in tax for 2016 after subtracting your withholding and refundable credits you expect your withholding plus your refundable credits to be less than the smaller of a. 90 of the tax to be shown on your 2016 tax return or b. 100 of the tax shown on your 2015 tax return but see special rules for farmers fishermen and higher income taxpayers later    your 2015 tax return must cover all 12 months reminders estimated tax safe harbor for higher income taxpayers if your 2015    adjusted gross income was more than $ 150,000 $ 75,000 if you are    married filing a separate return you must pay the smaller of 90 of    your expected tax for 2016 or 110 of the tax shown on your 2015    return to avoid an estimated tax penalty

so either scenario has about $ 10 k upfront costs either realtor selling expenses or fixing up for rental furthermore i 'm sure that the buyers would want you to fix all these things anyway or reduce the price accordingly but let 's ignore this let 's also ignore the remaining mortgage since it looks like you can comfortably pay it off assuming 10 property management and 10 average vacancy check your market and rental price at $ 1000 you end up with these numbers i took very conservative estimates both on the rent lower than you expect and the maintenance expense although on average over the years since you need to have some reserves this is probably quite reasonable you end up with 2.7 roi which is not a lot for a rental the rule of thumb your wife mentioned 1 of cash equity is indeed usually for roi of leveraged rental purchase however if rental prices in your area are rising as it sounds like they are you may end up there quite soon anyway the downside is that the money is locked in if you 're confident in your ability to rent and are not loosing the tax benefit of selling since it sounds like you 've not appreciated you may take out some cash through a cash out refi to keep cash flow you need to cash out so that the payments would be at or less than the $ i.e. $ that would make about $ 50 k at fixed 5 loan what 's best is up to you to decide of course check whether you can always sell holds for you i.e. how stable is the market what happens if one or two large employers disappear etc

when margin is calculated as the equity percentage of an account the point at which a broker will forcibly liquidate is typically called maintenance margin in the us this is 25 for equities to calculate the price at which this will occur the initial and maintenance margin must be known   the formula for a long with margin is and for a short where is the maintenance margin price is the initial margin price is the initial margin rate and is the maintenance margin rate   at an initial margin of 50 and a maintenance margin of 25 a long equity may fall by 1/3 before forced liquidation a short one may rise by 50 this calculation can become very complex with different asset classes with differing maintenance margins because the margin debt is applied to all securities collectively

you should call your plan administrator and ask few plans allow people to take a hardship withdraw after leaving because their is no way to pay the funds back since you are no longer working there the repayment process is done via payroll deduction usually also you will most likely be required to withhold 20 for taxes from the 401k there is no way to defer the taxation unless you take it   next calendar year you may want to consider doing a rollover into an ira and taking the w d and you can do a 60 day rollover you only get 1 per rolling 12 months now rather than account do to a change in the rule ira 's not 401k do give you flexible withholding so you do n't have to pay taxes today though they would still be in the tax year based on the calendar date taken out so if you take it out in 2015 your going to be paying them at the end of this year when you file in april of 2016 your question seems to be mixing characteristics of both 401k and ira and while they are similar they do operate very differently

there needs to be more numbers with your choices without those any answer is purely speculation assuming that india is much like the us you are almost always better to go with a company leased car   that is if you are not responsible for the lease if your employment ends with the company here in the us companies typically reimburse so tax free their employees for about 50 cents per mile or about 31 cents per   this barely covers the gas and insurance and falls way short when one includes and maintenance   so it is better to have the company to pick up all those costs       borrowing money on a car is just plain dumb no matter what the interest rate   so i would stick with choice number 1 or 3 depending on the arrangement for the company leased car the next question becomes how much you should spend for a car   i would say enough to keep you happy and safe but not much more than that until you are wealthy

there are a lot of open questions about if this is your only accessible money or if you have other emergency funds and if you have any retirements savings and when do you plan to retire but leaving this all aside you currently pay 2.65 on the mortgage and you make less on savings maybe 1 or 1.5 so putting the savings into the mortgage makes you the difference which is a good deal however you need to reflect this with your risk and your long term goals and look at potential even better deals for example you could put the savings into higher risk higher gain investments let ’s assume index funds and make 6 10 per year in average that obviously is a lot more why would you not want to do that investing like this is a long term plan if this is your only savings emergency fund or if you need the money within the next five years you should not do it it could catch you in a bad market situation and then it might be a severe loss if you are sure you do n’t need it for at least five if not ten years invest it and keep the mortgage you will easily beat its interest rate if you are risk averse and ca n’t sleep with your savings doing while you watch that is also not a plan for you there are many things to consider and your personal situation is relevant for the decision consider all options and be sure to always have a emergency fund remaining it is also not black and white there are options in between of your two propositions pay some in and keep some for emergencies

first of all insurance never covers the cost of the item it is almost always a partial payout at best for example a typical house in the northeast us where i live that costs $ 300,000 will have the actual house valued at maybe $ and rest of the value will be in the land therefore the insured value will typically be $ 100,000 the only problem is that to actually rebuild the house might easily cost $ 250,000 so your idea that some kinds of insurance allows the beneficiary to recoup their loss is usually never true as you say from an actuarial point of view insurance is a sheer waste of money for example a typical house has maybe a 0.5 chance of burning down every year in other words out of 2000 houses maybe 1 will burn down every year so lets say you got $ 100,000 of insurance on your house then the value of that policy would be $ 100,000 2000 = $ 50 per year an insurance company will charge around $ 700 per year for the policy that means you are basically $ 650 down the toilet every year to maintain that policy the reason why they do this is what says above they are buying peace of mind a psychological product in other they imagine they are somehow safe so even though they are losing money paying it makes them feel as though they are not losing money it 's delusional but then again most people have a lot of delusions of which insurance is just one of many

a synthetic position the payout of a financial instrument   are attractive when the liquidity availability of an instrument is low or there is a mismatch in fees or values of the synthetic 's components which could lead to arbitrage     in speculative trades the seller of a cds takes a positive view of the credit worthiness of the underlying security   the buyer of a cds has a negative view of the credit of the underlying     so in this example there is a limit on buying or shorting corporate bonds by how many bonds the company has issued and the value you have to invest in the bond itself so if you wanted heavy exposure to this company 's credit you would be limited by how many you could buy   whereas with a cds you can mimic the performance with a synthetic position and as long as there is someone to take the other side of it you can buy or sell however many you want and have more exposure than the debt the company issued would allow on its own   hope that makes some sense

generally it is not recommended that you do anything potentially short term to your credit during the process of seeking a mortgage loan such as opening a new account closing old accounts running up balances or otherwise applying for any kind of loan people often get carried away and apply for loans to cover furniture and appliances for the new home they have n't bought yet you are usually ok to do things that have at least a short term positive effect like paying down debt but refinancing which would require applying for a non home loan is exactly the sort of hard pull that can drop your credit rating it is not generally advised the exception to this is would be if you have an especially unusual situation with an existing loan like your car that is causing a deal breaking situation with your home loan this would for example be having a car payment so high that it violates maximum debt to income ratios dti if your monthly debt payments are more than 43 of your monthly income for instance you will generally be unable to obtain a qualified mortgage and over 28 36 will disqualify you from some lenders and low cost mortgage options the reason this is unusual is that you would have to have a terrible existing loan which could somehow be refinanced without increasing your debt while simultaneously providing a monthly savings so dramatic that it would shift your dti from unacceptable to acceptable it 's possible but most simple consumer loan just do n't give that kind of savings in most cases you should just sit tight and avoid any new loans or refinances while you seek a home purchase if you want to be sure you 'll need to figure out your dti ratio which i recommend anyway and see where you would be before and after a car refinance if this would produce a big swing maybe talk with some mortgage loan professionals who are familiar with lending criteria and ask for their opinion as to whether the change would be worth it 9 times out of 10 you should wait until after your loan is closed and the home is yours before you try to refinance your car however i would only warn you that if you think your house + car payment is too much for you to comfortably afford i 'd strongly recommend you seriously reconsider your budget current car ownership and house purchasing plans you might find that after the house purchase the car refi is n't available either or fine print means it would n't provide the savings you thought it would do n't buy now hoping an uncertain cost saving measure will work out later

something that 's come up in comments and been alluded to in answers but not explicit as far as i can tell even if your marginal tax rate now were equal to your marginal tax rate in retirement or even lower a traditional ira may have advantages   that 's because it 's your effective tax rate that matters on withdrawls based on ty 2014 single person but applies at higher numbers for other arrangements you pay 0 taxes on the first $ of income and then pay 10 on the next $ then 15 on $ then 25 on the total amount over that up to $ etc   as such even if your marginal rate is 25 say you earn $ 80k your effective rate is much less for example $ 80k income you pay taxes on $   that ends up being $ for an effective rate in total of let 's say you had the same salary $ 80k from 20 to 65 and for 45 years saved up 10k a year plus earned enough returns to pay you out $ 80k a year in retirement   in a roth you pay 25 on all $ 10k   in a traditional you save that $ 2500 a year because it comes off the top the amount over $ and then pay during retirement your effective tax rate because it 's the amount in total that matters    so for roth you had while for traditional the correct amount is n't but   you make the difference between .75 and back even with the identical income   of course if your $ 10k would take you down a marginal bracket then it also has an effective tax rate of something between the two rates thus roth makes sense if you expect your effective tax rate to be higher in retirement than it is now   this is very possible still because for people like me with a mortgage high property taxes two kids and student loans my marginal tax rate is pretty low even with a reasonably nice salary i still pay 15 on the stuff that 's heading into my ira   sadly my employer has only a traditional 401k but they also contribute to it without requiring a match so i wo n't complain too much   since i expect my eventual tax rate to be in that 18 20 at a minimum i 'd benefit from a roth ira right now this matters more for people in the middle brackets earning high 5 figure salaries as individuals or low 6 figure as a couple because the big difference is relevant when a large percentage of your income is in the 15 and below brackets   if you 're earning $ 200k then so much of your income is taxed at 28 33 it does n't make nearly as much of a difference and odds are you can play various tricks when you 're retiring to avoid having as high of a tax rate

no danger you can get in a car accident break your leg or otherwise wind up in the hospital like anyone else   you can also get the money back with a tax penalty but you probably will never need to if you are responsible and live within your means do you need a wake up call about what things can cost   i knew a college student who broke his leg and did n't buy the health insurance    he had to have a rod put in his leg and it was   obviously he did n't have the money and the hospital agreed to put him on some kind of payment plan   i suppose bankruptcy was an alternative but either way not a great way to start out in life    any time you can defer payment of tax for decades or buy something with pre income tax money it is like instantly earning 20 or more on your money   i believe you can pay for and dental out of an hsa as well   so i would n't go overboard on an hsa or ira if you have big credit card debts if you do have room for savings it is dumb not to be putting money in the hsa and ira/401k take a look at hsa bank for a low fee home for your money they pay interest on over $ 3,000 but like most banks not much   the fees for being under $ 3k are currently around $ 2 a month   do n't worry about investing the hsa money until you have like $ 10,000 in there which will be a while

for some reason this can result in either    the flow through income being untaxed or the flow through income being    taxed as a capital gains either way this allows a lower tax rate for    llc profits i 'm not sure that correct i know it has something to do    with capital accounts this is incorrect as to capital accounts these are accounts representing the members partners capital in the enterprise and have nothing to do with the tax treatment of the earnings earnings add to the capital accounts but they 're still taxed also is it true that if the llc loses money that loss can be offset    against other taxable income resulting in a lower total taxation it can offset taxable income of the same kind just like any other losses on your tax return generally flow through taxation of partnerships means that the income is taxed to the partner with the original attributes if it is capital gains it is taxed as capital gains if it is earned income it is taxed as earned income going through llc partnership does n't re characterize the income going through corporation does in many cases

listing on nyse has more associated overhead costs than listing on nasdaq   in the case of young technology companies this makes nasdaq a more attractive option perhaps the most important factor is that nyse requires that a company has an independent compensation committee and an independent committee while nasdaq requires only that executive compensation and decisions are made by a majority of independent directors   no self respecting would be instant tech is going to want some independent committee it over their pay packet   additionally listing on nyse requires a company have stated guidance for corporate governance while nasdaq imposes no such requirement   similarly nyse requires a company have an internal audit team while nasdaq imposes no such requirement    fees on nyse are also a bit higher than nasdaq but the difference is not significant a good rundown of the pros cons

i thought to on user 's comment above pc financial seems to fail to calculate explicitly and then display the cashback reward return of 1 for the benefit of consumers does it want to conceal or mislead or conceal customers   anyhow i show this using this info below i 'll just calculate using the rate for everywhere you shop since many deem travel a luxury 1 20,000 pc points = $ 20 in free groceries minimum redemption is 20,000 pc points   2 earn 10 pc points for every $ 1 spent everywhere you shop earn 20 pc points for every $ 1 spent on travel services at cashback reward rate = reward expenditure i find confusing the 20,000 pc points = $ 20 because this is not the cost or expenditure i regard this as the reward   the key step is to calculate the expenditure needed to achieve this reward which again is 20,000 pc points thus we must attain 1 from 2 and must solve for in this ratio problem = $   = = = > = $ 2000 so $ 2000 must be spent to reap $ 20 as the reward altogether cashback reward = $ = 0.01 = 1 i googled this card before and i infer from this article that pc changed its cashback ratios you get five pc points for every dollar you spend on your bank card at participating stores where president ’s choice products are sold this is a bit disappointing as i can do the math in my head and determine that the pc points rewards are only worth 0.5 of your purchase amount i had expected at least 1 to compete with the top reward credit cards also the webpage in the following the cent is supposed to be a dollar pc points are worth one tenth of a cent each so if you use the minimum allowable amount of pc points of 20,000 you will get $ 20.00 worth of groceries

if you keep going over budget with your credit card then stop using the credit card if you plan to pay off the card every month then your balance should always be under whatever your budget is   for example if you budget to spend $ 500 then even though your card has a limit of $ 5,000 you will never carry a balance of over $ 500   most banks have an option to email and or text message you when you pass a certain balance threshold in this instance you would set two notices one when your balance exceeds $ 400 warning you that you 're close need to start paying closer attention and one when you exceed $ 500 additionally maybe you are n't ready to pay for everything with your credit card   i prefer to use mine just for groceries and then pay it off at the end of the month   whatever rewards you get for putting all of your purchases on the card are more than paid for when you cross your budget limit costing you more in interest and fees   perhaps starting with just one type of purchase groceries or gas are good choices as most consumers are fairly consistent in their purchases of both would allow you to ease into using the card until you get used to managing your budget with it personal finances are all about behavior not knowledge   do n't worry too much about slipping up right now and making a mistake just keep practicing good behavior with your credit card and soon managing your budget with it will be as natural for you as when you only used cash

finally some good examples    so clearly this is an issue and many large companies do similar shenanigans but the divisions being cut are massively unprofitable anyhow even with these crappy tricks    i agree that a company like ge should be looking long term but i 'm not sure what they do in technology r&amp;d so i 'm not prepared to be too harsh on that front   i absolutely agree that having non software engineers write software is a long term failure even smart engineers who can pump out software often do so without having learned the lessons that software companies learn resulting in short term results followed by long term pain    anyhow thanks for a real response i wonder if the divisions being cut need to be cut or sold off regardless but i think every large org should look at examples like this and not try to play the this quarter is good game

purchase loans tend to be more challenging to get the best possible rate because you have to balance closing the loan and getting the contract so there is n't as much time to shop around as when you do a refinance   i disagree with the sentiment to go with your local bank nothing wrong with asking at your local bank and using their numbers as a baseline but chances are they wo n't be competitive there are many reputable online mortgage originators that will show accurate fees and rates upfront assuming you provide accurate information   in the past there were a lot of issue with good faith estimates being pretty much worthless there were a fair number of horror stories about people showing up to closing and finding out fee or rates had increased dramatically there was a law passed after the housing debacle that severely limits the shenanigans that lenders can do at closing and so there is less risk when going with a lesser known lender in fact i would say the only real risk with a lender now days is choosing one that happens to be overloaded and or just has poor customer service in general personally i have found the most competitive rates from zillow 's mortgage service and the now defunct google mortgage the lenders tend to be smaller but highly efficient they are very much dependent on their online reputations i have heard good things about a number of larger online lenders but i do n't have personal experience so i will leave them off i personally would n't worry much about whether the loan is sold or not outside of refinancing i do n't think i have ever talked to the bank servicing my mortgage about my mortgage there just is n't much need to talk to them

as a general rule of thumb on average you 'll gain a similar amount of total money over time whether you start withdrawing early or not yes you get less money on each check but you 're also going to get more checks a whole since it 's based on how long you live   i personally do n't try and adjust how i manage my money based on what decisions the government might make but i also am fairly young so do n't quite have the heightened concerns regarding social security others might have i 've pretty much always lived and invested assuming it was n't going to be there at all by the time i retire

here are some important things to think about   alan and fields discuss them in more detail in your new house permanent work   where do you want to live   are there suitable jobs nearby   how much do they pay emergency fund   banks care that you have reserves and/or an unsecured line of credit in case you have a run of bad luck   this also helps with float the large expenses when closing a loan personal line of credit who are you building for   if you are not married then you should consider whether building a home makes that easier or harder   if you hope to have kids you should consider whether your home will make it easier to have kids or harder   if you are married or seriously considering it make sure that your spouse helps with the shopping and is in agreement on the priorities and choices   if you are not married then what will you do if when you get married   will you sell   expand   build another house on the same lot   rent the home out total budget   how much can the lot utilities permits taxes financing charges building costs and contingency allowance come to   talk with a banker about how much you can afford   talk with a build on your lot builder about how much house you can get for that budget   consider a new mobile or manufactured home   but if you do choose one ask your banker how that affects what you can borrow and how it affects your rates and terms   talk with a good real estate agent about how much the resale value might be finished lot budget how much can you budget for the lot utilities permits required to get zoning approval fees interest and taxes before you start construction down payment   it sounds like you have a plan for this loan underwriting   talk with a good bank loan officer about what their expectations are   ask about the front end and back end debt to income ratios   in oregon i recommend washington federal for lot loans and construction loans   they keep all of their loans and service the loans themselves   they use appraisers who are specially trained in evaluating new home construction   their appraisers tend to appraise a bit low but not ridiculously low like the incompetent appraisers used by some other banks in the area   i know two banks with lots of oregon branches that use an appraiser who ignores 40 of the finished heated area of some to be built homes   avoid any institution including usaa and that their lending to lot loan   in oregon washington federal offers lot loans with 30 down payments 20-year amortization and one point on approved credit   the interest rate can be a fixed rate but is typically a few percentage points per year higher than for a mortgage secured by a permanent house   if you have the financial wherewithal to start building within two years washington federal also offers short term lot loans   ask about the costs of appraisals points and recording fees rent   how much will it cost to rent a place to live between when you move back to oregon and when your new home is ready to move into commute   how much time will it take to get from your new home to work   how much will it cost   e.g. car ownership depreciation maintenance insurance taxes fuel   if public transportation is an option how much will it cost lot availability   how many are there to choose from   can you talk a farmer into selling off a chunk of land   can you homestead government land   how much does a lot cost   is it worth getting a double lot or an extra large lot utilities do you want to live off the grid   are you willing to make the choices needed to do that   e.g. well generator system satellite tv and fuel storage   if not how much will it cost to connect to such systems   for practical purposes subtract twice the value of these installation costs from the cost of a finished lot when comparing lot deals easements these provide access to your property access for others through your property and affect your rights   utility companies often ask for far more rights than they need   until you sign on the dotted line you can negotiate them down to just what they need   talk to a good real estate attorney zoning how much will you be allowed to build   in terms of home square footage garage square footage roof area and surfaces   how can the home be used   as a business as a farm how many unrelated people can live there etc   what setbacks are required   how tall can the be   are there setbacks from streams or steep choosing a builder   for construction loans banks want builders who will build what is agreed upon in a timely fashion   if you want to build your own house talk to your loan officer about what the bank expects in a builder and permits   the construction loan process if you hire a general contractor and if you have difficulties with the contractor you might be forced to refuse to accept some work as being complete   a good bank will back you up   ask about points appraisal charges and inspection fees insurance during construction   some companies have good plans if the construction takes 12 months or less   some but not all auto insurance companies also offer good homeowners insurance for homes under construction   choose your auto insurance company accordingly property taxes do n't forget to include them in your post construction budget homeowners insurance   avoid properties that need flood insurance   apply a sanity check to flood maps some of them are unrealistic   strongly consider earthquake insurance   do n't forget to include these costs in your post construction budget energy costs   some jurisdictions require you to calculate how large a heating system you need   do not trust their design temperatures they may not allow for enough heating during a cold snap especially if you have a heat pump   some heat pumps work at -10 ° f but most lose their effectiveness between 10 ° f and 25 ° f   you can use these calculations in combination with the number of heating degree days and cooling degree days at your site to accurately estimate your energy bills   if you choose a mobile or manufactured home calculate how much extra its energy bills will be home design   here are some good sources of ideas a pattern language by christopher alexander   alexander emphasizes building homes and neighborhoods that can grow and that have niches within niches within niches the not so big house by sarah   this book applies many alexander 's design patterns to medium and large new houses before the architect   the late ralph emphasized the importance of plywood flashing pocket doors wide wide attic and open or i floor systems   lots of outlets and incandescent lighting are good too   it is possible to have too much detail in a house plan and too much room in a house   for examples see any of his plans tim the builder 's engineer   since oregon is in earthquake country and the building codes do not fully reflect that risk emphasize that you want a building that would meet san jose california 's

collections companies buy debt for a fraction of the face value of the debt as little as 5 7 cents on the dollar and you can often settle debt for a fraction of the face amount perhaps 10 25 cents on the dollar but there are several considerations   do you owe the debt is it a legitimate debt can you afford to pay the debt what is the age of the debt remember there is a statute of limitations on debt varies by state and what are the consequences of non payment or settlement of the debt rather than confirm that you owe the debt tell the debt collector that you need proof that the debt is yours you should do this by certified letter   be careful not to confirm the debt or agree to pay it or make any payments yet you said that your doctor ordered the product for you you said the company sent you a product you have the product once you have confirmed that the debt is yours you should determine the age of the debt when was the last time you paid on the debt   each state has statute of limitations on debt depending upon the age of the debt this is why it is important not to send the collector money until you have verified the debt you did not state when the debt was incurred assume under sol ask yourself whether you can afford to pay the debt   the amount of the debt and your ability to pay and whether you want to avoid the time and expense of dealing with the collector they are trained to be annoying are all factors to consider   you should also consider the negative consequences credit score effects and whether the cost of a derogatory entry is worth fighting the debt you did not explain your financial situation paying the $ 55 may be trivial or it may be a hardship before you settle any debt you should send a letter keep a copy and proof you sent it certified and demand that the debt collector provide proof that you owe the debt   often this proof does not exist or is insufficient to gain a judgement you would need legal help here   and should a debt collector agree to settle the debt for a lower amount you need to get that agreement in writing   be aware that when you settle a debt the collector can and will send you a 1099 for the portion of the debt which has been forgiven and can report to the credit bureaus that you settled a debt for less than the full amount negative mark against credit   derogatory credit items will you for years decide whether saving $ 20 $ 30 or even $ 55 is worth the trouble   probably not learn from this when a company sends you something you did not order contact them and send it back or demand they pay shipping and send them a letter demanding $ storage and $ 20 handling fee to ship it back to them disclaimer heed the insane of a at your peril hire a lawyer

as i write this the nasdaq composite is at down points from yesterday to calculate the percentage you take and divide by yesterday 's close of to yield 0.22 in your example if spy drops from to you use the difference of and divide by the original i.e. = spy is an etf which you can invest in that tracks the s&p 500 index ideally the index would have dropped the same percentage as spy but the points would be different higher to answer your question about how one qualifies a point it completely depends on the index being discussed for example the s&p 500 is a market capitalization weighted index of the common stock of 500 large cap us public companies it is as if you owned every share of each of the 500 companies then divide by some large constant to create a number that 's easily understood mentally i.e. the nasdaq composite used the same methodology but includes practically all stocks listed on the nasdaq meanwhile the dow jones industrial average is a price weighted index of 30 large cap companies it 's final value is modified using a divisor known as the dow divisor which accounts for stock splits and similar events that have occurred since a stock has joined the index thus points when referring to an index do not typically represent dollars rather they serve as a quantitative measure of how the market is doing based on the performance of the index constituents etfs like spy add a layer of abstraction by creating an vehicle that ideally tracks the value of the underlying index directly finally neither price nor index value is related to volume volume is a raw measurement of the total number of shares traded for a given stock or the aggregate for a given exchange hope this helps

this is potentially a real risk to google the odds of such a huge success it decreases google 's profits are tiny i think but there is a real risk that the increase in google 's profits going forward are materially affected by a well done competitor to adsense   if amazon took away 10 of what google 's adsense business 4 years from now would have been that is likely material to google 's earning not huge but real   even losing the ads on amazon 's web site is likely noticeable though not a huge deal i would guess to google though to most companies it would be a huge lose   there is even the potential google has to reduce their profitability on adsense to compete giving web sites a better cut of revenue   that said i think amazon has plenty of challenges to making it an effective competitor to google but they have a chance and there is even a small chance very small i think that amazon could create a competitor that actually results in noticeably say over 15 declining revenue to google via adsense likely even in this case google continues to grow profit as a company overall   google revenue from ads from their own websites are the most important earnings and likely to continue to be so also new business non web ad income is growing and i think will continue to do so this is likely an area some might find more questionable

will the investment bank evaluate the worth of my company more than or less than 50 crs assuming the salvage value of the assets of 50 crs meaning that 's what you could sell them for to someone else that would be the minimum value of your company less any outstanding debts there are many ways to calculate the value of a company but the most common one is to look at the future potential for generating cash    the underwriters will look at what your current cash flow projections are and what they will be when you invest the proceeds from the public offering back into the company   that will then be used to determine the total value of the company and in turn the value of the portion that you are taking public and what will be the owner ’s share in the resulting public company that 's completely up to you   you 're essentially selling a part of the company in order to bring cash in presumably to invest in assets that will generate more cash in the future   if you want to keep complete control of the company then you 'll want to sell less than 50 of the company otherwise you can sell as much or as little as you want

there generally is n't much in the way of real identity verification at least in the us and online   the protection you get is that with most credit cards you can report your card stolen within some amount of time and the fraudulent charges dropped the merchant is the one that usually ends up paying for it if it gets charged back so it 's usually in the merchant 's best interest to do verification   however the cost of doing so inconvenience to the customer or if it 's an impulse buy giving them more time to change their mind etc is often greater than the occasional fraudulent charge so they usually do n't do too much about it unless they 're in a business where it 's a frequent problem

the credit and debit terms here is talking from bank 's point of view should n't be a surprise banks are never known to look at things from the customers pov   in accounting a liability loans owners capital etc is a credit balance and asset cash buildings and such is a debit balance   your account is a liability to the bank in accounting parlance that is because they owe you every single penny that is there in your account btw in literal parlance too if you really make their life harder   so when the bank accepts money from you they need to increase their asset cash which they will debit higher debit balance for asset means more assets and at the same time they also have to account for the added liability by crediting the deposited money into your account so when bank says they have credited your account it means you have more money in your account now if you transfer money from your account to another or make a payment through your account your account will be debited and the beneficiary account will be 's liability towards you reduces more or less what everyone else said here but hey i could also take a swipe at banks

banks in new zealand tend to take a lien that is higher than the amount of the loan so that your only option for a second mortgage is with them wanted 50 more than the value of the loan when i had my mortgage with them of course with house price inflation the way it 's been in nz the value of your house may have the lien anyway and you can mortgage the rest of it with anyone you like i suspect your lawyer will need to inform the other lienholder but you do n't need their permission

irs pub 521 has all the information you need expenses reimbursed if you are reimbursed for your expenses and you    use the cash method of accounting you can deduct your expenses either    in the year you paid them or in the year you received the    reimbursement if you use the cash method of accounting you can    choose to deduct the expenses in the year you are reimbursed even    though you paid the expenses in a different year see choosing when to    deduct next if you deduct your expenses and you receive the    reimbursement in a later year you must include the reimbursement in    your income on form 1040 line 21 this is not unusual anybody who moves near the end of the year can have this problem the 39 week time test also can be an issue that span over 2 tax years i would take the deduction for the expenses as soon a i could and then count the income in the later year if they pay me back if they do so before april 15th then i would put them on the same tax form to make things easier

i ’m going to answer this because accounting books only reflect the dollar value of inventories which means if you look at the balance sheet of mcdonalds you will not see how many bags of french fries are remaining at their storage facility you will only see the total value at cost basis   your requirement for noting the number of shares purchased is not part of the double entry accounting system   when you transfer $ 10000 from bank to broker the entries would be   the bank ’s name and the broker ’s name will not appear on the balance sheet   when you purchase 50 shares at $ 40 per share the accounting system does not care about the number of shares or the price all it cares is the $ 2000 total cost and the commission of $ 10   you have two choices either place $ 10 to an expense account or incorporate it into the total cost making it $ 2010   the entries for the second method would be now your balance sheet would reflect what happens if the price increases from $ 40 per share to $ 50 per share tomorrow do nothing your balance sheet will show the cost of $ 2010 until the shares are sold or the accounting period ends it will not show the market value of $ 2500   instead the portfolio tracker would show $ 2500 the most basic tracker is   later if you finally sell the shares at $ 50 per share with $ 10 commission again the number of shares will not be reflected anywhere in the accounting system only the total proceeds from the sale matters

at the very least you should invest as much as you can that your employer will match as they are basically giving you free money for saving after that i would prioritize a roth ira as that offers similar tax benefits with more liquidity provided you have enough money available in your emergency fund and have plenty for everyday expenses i see no reason not to max out your 401k after that if you can afford it however if your emergency fund is lacking be sure to put some there other investments like a 529 may come into play if you have kids you plan on sending to college but it all depends on your situation

this may not apply in your particular situation but i think it 's important to mention when a debt collector does n't act like a debt collector it may be because they are n't actually a debt collector it 's certainly strange that someone called you to collect money from you and when you asked for a simple document they not only got off the phone quickly but they also told you the debt would be cancelled that just does n't make sense why would they cancel the debt why would n't they send you the document my initial impression is that you were possibly being scammed the scam can take on many forms whenever you are called by a debt collector or someone pretending to be one it 's a good idea to verify their identity first more info here

yes using debt appropriately is a huge part of what 's called optimal capital structure theory in the finance world debt is generally cheaper than equity financing due to the tax deductibility of interest and using it appropriately can really juice the profitability of a business as long as the rate of return on equity in the business exceeds the interest rate on the debt

hybrids amp are not quite ready for the prime time the cost of manufacturing the batteries let alone problems of efficiency and eventually replacement means that without a massive and permanent increase in oil prices widespread adoption is unlikely i forget what the gasoline cost per gallon often cited is for electric and hybrid vehicles to become competitive i think it was typically north of $ of course twenty to thirty years out we quite well may have such however the cost of those vehicles wo n't be coming down without some near technological miracle in both battery design and production those who can afford $ 40,000 for a car will retain the autonomy granted by private transportation everyone else will probably for meaningful public transportation options and move to a more dense settlement pattern that does not mandate individual vehicle ownership

it 's pretty simple the less money you owe the less interest you pay   paying down debt   gives a guaranteed return of the interest rate of the debt so paying off your starter loan is equivalent to a 4 return   that 's not a bad return in the current environment so it makes sense to do it unless you can find an investment which you think is likely to pay significantly better note this is a general answer not netherlands specific   there may be other considerations around tax for example which have to be factored into the calculation
